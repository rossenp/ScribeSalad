00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.880
<v 2>Dude, first of all, congratulations on your comeback that,</v>

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.400
you know, you're a great guy.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.640
And when there's someone I like who loses a bunch of fights in a row

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.480
and you get into this skid, it's hard, it's hard to watch.

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.630
I can't imagine what it was like being you, you know,

7
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:26.630
to have a young child and to be dealing with all of this going on.

8
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.870
I mean, it's like losing your top,

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.270
but then to come back the way you did against a really

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.150
tough guy and a sun sound and get arguably the KU of the year, I mean,

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.950
you gotta be feeling pretty good. I feel great. You know.

12
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.660
<v 0>Know back from the brink, back from the Brinks. I mean that time in my life,</v>

13
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:48.260
that timeframe period, and, and going through that, you know,

14
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:52.940
from on top of the world, world champion, uh, to three fight skid, honestly,

15
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:56.420
it feels like a, a lifetime ago. I feel like I'm just a different person. Um,

16
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.180
where I, where I was at from there, you know,

17
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.050
removed and the things I'm just doing differently, thinking differently,

18
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.170
you know, how I was able to approach the game,

19
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:06.610
picking myself back up time and time again. I mean,

20
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.650
it's internet is a horrible place to get, get knocked out on, you know,

21
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.970
you got the trolls, this and that. Yeah. You know, it's but besides that point,

22
00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:20.450
you know, um, just coming back to that and having the love for it,

23
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.080
a lot of the times I got to the, and, um, not to make excuses, I was just,

24
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.760
I didn't feel myself. I didn't feel like, um,

25
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.720
and then training and leading up, I felt physically, I'm always ready to fight,

26
00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:33.880
like flip to switch. I'm always physically ready to fight.

27
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.600
I think mentally going into those fights, I was just, um, outta body. I wasn't,

28
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.920
uh, I felt like I was going through the motions. You know,

29
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.190
my passion wasn't there. I wasn't waking up every day. Like,

30
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:46.310
what's your reason why, like, I was just trying to find that. And, uh,

31
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.790
I think the reason why I always had so many people, um,

32
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.470
infiltrated in how I should train or how I should live or what I should do to

33
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:57.950
get back there. And really, it wasn't nothing that I needed to learn new.

34
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.550
I didn't have to reinvent the wheel. It was just doing the slate edge theory,

35
00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:03.620
like getting outta your comfort zone. Like you're doing your son of sessions.

36
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:08.420
Like you're pushing yourself to go in there and, and just be uncomfortable. Um,

37
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.540
you know, so I had to go out there and with that comeback, you know,

38
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.100
I moved to Jersey, the training camp out there. I split time.

39
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.700
<v 1>Yeah. I wanna talk to you about that. I'm a big fan of Henry too. Mark.</v>

40
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:18.980
Henry's a bad. He.

41
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.380
<v 0>He's great. I, I love, I enjoy him so much his passion for his love for it.</v>

42
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.780
He's.

43
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.810
<v 1>So interesting to too,</v>

44
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.610
his crazy codes and the fact the dude makes pizza on the side.

45
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.010
<v 0>Dude, I was so nervous going out there cuz I heard of the codes and, and like,</v>

46
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.290
you know, I was with Lance and Lance kind of gave me a little insight on it, on,

47
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.890
on everything. I'm like codes. And I just fight dude.

48
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:43.090
Like I don't have really set things. I kind of go off of my instincts and,

49
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.680
and game plans and, and he was trying to, you know, brief me on it.

50
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.880
And when I got to the first two weeks, holy,

51
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.840
we go down to his basement and he has like pizza scrolls from the pizzeria where

52
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:55.840
we have off about 50 things that we're working on, um, before camp. And then,

53
00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:56.480
so what does he write.

54
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.250
<v 1>Him on boxes.</v>

55
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.640
<v 0>Pizza boxes, pizza scrolls, like the just, uh,</v>

56
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.400
basically white paper down and it tapes it there to the wall. You have like,

57
00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:06.880
Corey's fight camp. You have, you know,

58
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:09.120
Frankie's and you all these codes and you have, you know,

59
00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:12.120
he is working with 14 fighters at one time and he knows all the codes and.

60
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.320
<v 1>All different kinds of fights, too different kinds. Like he's got beat there,</v>

61
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.200
he's got Frankie. It's like all these different.

62
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.990
<v 0>Yeah. Different styles. And we'll kind of, you know,</v>

63
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.070
what I like about that is he'll try things that beat does Zibi does these crazy

64
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.390
double jump scissor kicks and spinning? You know,

65
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.030
the Russians are really good at spinning, you know? So we threw that into the,

66
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.190
into the game and it's, it's, you know,

67
00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:37.790
it was nice to get that kind of stuff that Frankie's done and had success over

68
00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:41.740
the years. Um, so we meshed that together. Um, he got to know me really well.

69
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.180
Uh, we worked, you know, extensively with Ricardo Mato up there as well. Um,

70
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.860
but yeah, coach Henry is just, uh, there's not, he's obsessed with winning,

71
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.780
but what I loved about him was the first thing that he said to me, um,

72
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.460
was that his job is he's competitive if he wants to win at all costs.

73
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.130
But his job is to get us back to our fair family. And um,

74
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.730
I watched your podcast with, uh,

75
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.770
Andre ward and he said the same thing about his trainer. Mm. And I,

76
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:08.810
once he said that to me and I have a child now my whole thought process is,

77
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.010
has changed, you know, a transition. And they're like,

78
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.690
I wanna be able to be around for my son's life. I wanna have, you know, um,

79
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.170
speak to my grandchildren. I'm not drilling, you know, that's what coach mark,

80
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.800
I want you drawing when you're, you know, your 50, 60 years old. And,

81
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.560
and I kind, the style of that fight,

82
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.680
I can punch and move and I don't have to bra these guys. Right. You know? And,

83
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.120
um, just reiterating the defensive part of the technical offensive part with

84
00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:36.200
him is I could go in there and hit a six, seven punch combo, dude. He would,

85
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.000
he would care less. He's like, what did you do after you moved?

86
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:42.590
After your head was off your hands up like that? He's all about defense.

87
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.150
And you know, I think he just helped me out a lot with saying that,

88
00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:49.110
like getting me home to my family safe. Like that's.

89
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.630
<v 1>What I wanna do. It's such an important approach to be defensively sound. And,</v>

90
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.830
and yet there's so many fighters who don't think like that at all.

91
00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:01.540
They just think about offense. And if you, you know, it's,

92
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:05.780
it's really like in jujitsu, like HS and Gracie had, uh,

93
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.820
I had a conversation with him once about jujitsu.

94
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.500
And one of the things that he said is that the most important thing is defense.

95
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.740
He said, because I'm always safe. This is what he said. He goes,

96
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.020
I'm always safe. And he goes, inevitably puts you in. I'm always safe. Sure.

97
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.610
Like he lets guys on his back with a full locked in rear naked choke and he'll

98
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:27.010
start rolling like that. Yeah. He he's always safe. So he never,

99
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.930
and that's interesting. Also I read that about the Donna, her Des squad,

100
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.730
John Donna, hers guys, like, you know, Gordon, Ryan and all those guys,

101
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.010
they'll start in really bad positions all the time.

102
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.010
They train constantly in bad positions. So they're always defensively sound.

103
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.520
And that makes with striking as well.

104
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.400
So many guys are so concerned with offense and you know,

105
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.920
you've had so many spectacular knockouts,

106
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:53.080
like the Thomas Hall made a fight that it's just like, you probably just want.

107
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.400
<v 0>Blast guys. True. I get, I gotta like pull the reigns back. Sometimes I'm like,</v>

108
00:05:57.401 --> 00:06:00.840
dude, I'm so amped up. Just get in there and get the fight, you know, like,

109
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.920
forget the walk out, forget the, you know, yeah. I want,

110
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.440
I wanna get the first blow. I wanna get that exchange.

111
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.720
And then that's when the fight Andra sometimes I think I get so amped up that,

112
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.640
you know, taking it back, you know, doing that kind of having defensively sound,

113
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.790
it sets up your offense. Yeah. And my uncle's training me my whole entire life.

114
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.350
And this is what he said, your offense sets up your defense and vice versa,

115
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.830
but okay. Like my offense was so good. And then you get to this point where you,

116
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:27.470
people are breaking down your footages and your films and you know,

117
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:29.790
your speed and power, you know, you have to have that.

118
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.110
You have to be defensively sound. If you're so offensive, I'm, I'm,

119
00:06:32.111 --> 00:06:34.870
I'm a forward fighter. I can fight going back. A lot of fighters can't go.

120
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.780
I can feel like I can fight positional. Um, like you said about Dans guys,

121
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.580
Chris Holdsworth, um, has adapted into a phenomenal coach. You know,

122
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:47.900
he's my right hand guy from martial arts to the T and he makes us start in

123
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.940
horrible positions like that when we're dog dead tired and then get up and we're

124
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:53.740
shadow spar on each other. And then going back to the ground,

125
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.420
like really fight simulated things to where you're feeling uncomfortable in

126
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.650
positions. Like, yeah, I can go in there and,

127
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.330
and knee wrestle all day during jujitsu. I didn't get tapped out.

128
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:03.490
I didn't tap anybody. I was safe,

129
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.850
but I didn't put myself in those positions when the fight really happens,

130
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.210
you have to see how, you know, you're grit.

131
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.210
You gotta be able to fight off the hands, fight off the body,

132
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.610
trying to go fight all those bad positions. So you're comfortable,

133
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.650
whatever the fight goes. And I feel like that's where I'm at now.

134
00:07:16.651 --> 00:07:18.480
I've transitioned into that fighter.

135
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.400
I was so green when I got to alpha male and,

136
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.680
and a lot of my speed and power catapulted me to the top where I have to kind of

137
00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:29.360
draw back a little bit and do the correctional errors, not reinvent things,

138
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.400
not do things, but the defensive part of things like, you know,

139
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.080
I was up in training in Jersey and I knew I had the good head slips and

140
00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:38.320
movements, but some of the slips coach was watching me. I would get caught on,

141
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.070
you know, at the first or second, I usually would get hit with a fourth punch,

142
00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:43.430
you know, a combo puncher. So I would slip slip,

143
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:46.350
and then I would slip down this way and I would get hit with the, the jab.

144
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.510
I'm like every time he's like, dude,

145
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:49.630
just bring your hand up a little bit when you're slipping to the right,

146
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.910
you moving to the right. And I, you know, how you feel after smart. I'm like,

147
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.590
dude, I feel great. I don't have a headache. I'm not getting my kicked.

148
00:07:56.591 --> 00:08:00.100
Like I'm not getting hit really. Like my defense has gotten so, um,

149
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.100
solid working with him and just constantly. And Chris is the same way.

150
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.980
And my coaches out in alpha are the same with hands up, hands up, hands up.

151
00:08:07.981 --> 00:08:09.860
But I was just, at that point in my life,

152
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.980
I was just so aggressive and angry and, and just, we had so.

153
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.813
<v 1>Much success.</v>

154
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.740
<v 0>Attacking that way too at, at doing that. But this last fight, I was honestly,</v>

155
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.450
Joe and I was, you know, doing those faints on a sun sound and coach Henry said,

156
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.570
Hey, don't feel like these faints aren't gonna work.

157
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:29.290
Like he's defensively sound. He's a great fighter at, at that respect,

158
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.930
keep doing these faints. They will work. I'm fainting this guy, dude,

159
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.690
I'm fainting. I'm fainting. He's not really biting. He's not really coming in,

160
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.690
but I kept on the faints and we ended, you know,

161
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.050
I started catching him with some,

162
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.200
some shots that I saw and his eyes were hurting him.

163
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.760
And then Fay did the Tyson too. His over hand, right. Dropped him.

164
00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:49.280
And I knew once I had that range and the power and speed in his timing that he

165
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:52.480
would come in with something. So, uh, you know, the Ko the.

166
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.160
<v 1>Way you did it,</v>

167
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.920
where you dropped your hands and looked to the side and waited for him to move,

168
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.520
oh my God, that was like one of the best walk off Ks ever.

169
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.520
<v 0>Oh, it felt great.</v>

170
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.120
Cuz the first round I kind of had myself to the cage and coach, man, he,

171
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.520
he probably kicked my being on the cage, like get, get off the cage, get to the,

172
00:09:07.521 --> 00:09:10.560
you know, movement more or movement fighters. You know, he made me, um,

173
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:14.280
and I know my back was in the cage, but I saw and in the, the round was ending,

174
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.390
but I saw a sunset like, oh, here's my opening. I saw that in the first round.

175
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.670
And then the second round I was staying off, I was moving, I was speed.

176
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.670
I was switched, you know, stances. Um,

177
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.510
but towards the end of I heard the clappers. I'm like, I'm back in swell,

178
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.230
let him come in. I kind of leaned towards and he kind of like fainted on it.

179
00:09:29.231 --> 00:09:31.390
And then he chased me down. When I level changed,

180
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.270
I kept my eye on him and he threw the hook cuz he was going south Paul.

181
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.740
And I knew like I had to hand my hand on the cage and know where my distance was

182
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.580
to he was coming with a kick after I could lean back. I just had my rain,

183
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.980
had my timing. And once when I threw it, man,

184
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.260
I knew when I feel it from the hip, it was, it was over.

185
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.340
<v 1>Too. And that, that guy is so durable. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, that's the thing.</v>

186
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:53.730
I mean,

187
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.690
