<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.110
<v 2>Mental toughness is one of the most important aspects of wrestling.</v>

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.330
Obviously technique and fitness are huge,

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.470
but mental toughness is what defines wrestlers in my opinion,

5
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:18.360
because when you see wrestler successful wrestlers in Mo in the

6
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:21.980
UFC in particular, it there's no one like them. When,

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.160
when they come over to MMA, you, you recognize like there's,

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.010
there's something special about them as athletes.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.200
And I think that it comes from the fact that wrestling is so difficult that the

10
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.210
practices are so hard,

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.950
but in the world of mental toughness where mental toughness is one of the

12
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:44.880
cornerstones you're known as a guy that stands out,

13
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.200
like you stand out amongst like, like David Goggins likes to say,

14
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.330
you're uncommon amongst uncommon men. Like what, what is that like? What,

15
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.560
what, what made you stand out from these other wrestlers?

16
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.190
<v 1>Well, I'm going to jump forth to my high school coach,</v>

17
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.400
even though I got a lot before that, but always,

18
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.590
I just remember what he said in the room.

19
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.130
And he was like the best high school coach in the state at the time.

20
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.430
He said, guys win with humility,

21
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.830
lose with dignity, but don't lose.

22
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.390
And he put those last two lines together real quick.

23
00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:29.980
So he kind of had listened to him,

24
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.720
but it was pretty neat because you win with humility, you lose with dignity,

25
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:38.440
but don't lose. And so, you know, it's it,

26
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.690
that was my first major coach that really taught me a lot of those type of

27
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:45.520
principles. But before that I was,

28
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.600
I was a kid that was at the YMCA when I was five, six years old. Uh,

29
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.120
and basically the reason why I was there because, you know,

30
00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:53.050
you want to learn how to swim,

31
00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:56.740
because if you're an outdoors guy and you want to be around water and you want

32
00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.420
to want to make sure, you know, how your kids swim.

33
00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.920
So my mom and dad got me into the YMCA,

34
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.150
but once they got me into the YMCAs really for was, they needed help.

35
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.500
I mean, they just, my dad was a full-time worker and my mom,

36
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.250
she stayed at home a lot, but she also helped my dad. He had an office at home,

37
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.660
but I was a little hellion and they needed me to learn how to swim,

38
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:19.810
but they also needed me to learn how to be a little bit sociable.

39
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.520
They needed me to learn how to, to, uh, uh, get along with kids. Uh,

40
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.310
my first job was at the YMCA. I actually competed my first sport. Uh,

41
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.570
competitively was besides practicing,

42
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.460
was swimming and I won a YMCA state championship when I was 12 years old.

43
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:41.040
Believe it or not in the backstroke, which, you know, in wrestling, you know,

44
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:42.460
I know in fighting,

45
00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:45.040
you can go to your back and there's lots of tools that you can do there,

46
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.840
but I hate going to my back, you know, and I think if I was a fighter, I don't,

47
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.310
I would think I hate gravity coming down on me. So I don't mind putting it down,

48
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.840
but, you know, and there skills there, you have to learn. But I, um, I really,

49
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.780
um, I really liked, uh, uh,

50
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.670
the YMCA because it gave me a chance to learn something

51
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:07.810
away from home.

52
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.200
I was home with my mom was home with my dad home with my sister four years older

53
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.050
than me, but, you know, it's,

54
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.460
it's just something I call it going for help.

55
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.440
And I think my mom and dad realized at that time that they

56
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.150
needed some help with this kid.

57
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.110
And I think that's a really good thing to think about as,

58
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.830
as people in the world, when you have kids growing up in a few,

59
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.880
not giving them what you need to give them, why not go for help?

60
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:38.710
And there's organizations out there now,

61
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.960
you gotta be careful who you're putting them into,

62
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:44.170
or even if you're giving them to a babysitter or whatever like that. But,

63
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.700
you know, if you, if you're,

64
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.080
if you're pretty confident that you have a good place to get some help,

65
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.900
you get some help. And I, and I, as same way as me as a coach,

66
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.580
same way as me as a husband. I mean, I got my wife, I got my family,

67
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.500
I got, I had my assistant coaches and I, I got my fans. I mean,

68
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.010
I got, I always had them looking out for me.

69
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.270
I built a kind of trust with them, or more than even trust,

70
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:14.830
just they want to help. And that was the way now you can't go overboard.

71
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.210
You still got to make sure that the help you're getting is the right help.

72
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.900
But the YMC was perfect for me because, uh, I mean,

73
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:26.980
I can remember the first day, uh, they took us to a wrestling room.

74
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:31.750
We had a little wrestling room at the YMCA and I was already wrestling

75
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:34.720
before that because my dad was a wrestler, not a great wrestler,

76
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.990
but his friends were. So when they, when they came to the rustling,

77
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.470
learning to sport, that first wrestling room was at the YMCAs there,

78
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.470
even though I had been in a wrestling room because he's older guys had dragged

79
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:47.200
me around into the wrestling rooms, but in Waterloo,

80
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.500
but I can remember wrestling a kid and I,

81
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.820
I handled him pretty good because I had already been wrestling in my carpet at

82
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:57.880
home rustling outside in the grass. And, and these people had,

83
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:02.290
had had a little experience with me. So, but the kid kind of got mad.

84
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:07.150
So I was waiting for my mom and dad to, uh, uh, pick me up after the,

85
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.960
uh, the wa at the, after the wise couple hours where he'd be,

86
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.520
you spend there and this kid came out and he goes, you know, you can, you know,

87
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:17.920
maybe you beat me in wrestling up there, but he goes, uh,

88
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.190
how about a street fight? And I said, well, you know,

89
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.380
I was probably 8, 9, 8 years old at the time. And,

90
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:33.400
you know, was, was downtown Waterloo island, tough town.

91
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.690
I was on one side of the river and he was on the other side of the river, uh,

92
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.583
growing up. And,

93
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.090
and so he probably had been in more fights in me, but

94
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.300
I didn't, wasn't going to really, I wasn't going to fight him.

95
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.640
I was waiting for my dad, picked me up. And all of a sudden he,

96
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:59.930
he punches me. And so, you know,

97
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.830
what do you do? You gotta fight. I mean, he's gotta a run, you know? And I,

98
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.420
I fought and I did all right. I mean, just like in the wrestling room I did.

99
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:12.830
All right. And so I was, I had, I had some of that in me too, but when I,

100
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.470
I had the guy on the down and I kind of let him up,

101
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.170
we both looked over,

102
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.210
my dad was there standing and watching me and that guy's dad was standing there

103
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.290
and my mom, my dad, and his were talking to each other. And so, you know,

104
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.340
that's part of an experience that you kind of grow up in and it's,

105
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.690
I don't know if they even knew each other,

106
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.950
but they were kind of supervising yet. We didn't know they were there.

107
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.370
And that was kind of one of my first experiences with, uh,

108
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.520
understanding a little bit about, uh,

109
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.470
competition outside the organized sports, you know, you have raw competition,

110
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.760
right? Yeah. Primal. Yeah. So, you know,

111
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.350
actually speaking of the story there, it was a really good one. Uh,

112
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.080
this is about my mom and dad, my mom and dad were great people,

113
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.360
but they like to drink a lot of beer and smoke a lot of cigarettes.

114
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:08.480
And that's why they probably didn't live so long.

115
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:12.020
And they probably had a lot of it had some trouble at home.

116
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:13.850
And by that, I mean,

117
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.710
the cops visited home quite often just to break up fights

118
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:22.820
or my mom would probably call the cops on my dad. And, uh,

119
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.220
so the first time I ever really took notice

120
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:31.760
was when they came the first time and they took my dad away

121
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.820
and, you know, he had been rough with my mom, so I probably understood,

122
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.360
but I saw him kind of, uh, throw a handcuff on him. He just,

123
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.140
I think they just threw one on and kind of took him out the door.

124
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.110
I didn't really see from there. So

125
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.250
he came home that night, later on, he got up, he was, did he just, you know,

126
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.930
I don't know, they, they brought him back later,

127
00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:01.280
but so the next day I went to school and

128
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.070
the cop that had the policemen had come and picked him up was actually

129
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.940
a neighbor down the street, just lived about a block from us.

130
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.760
And I was really bad, you know, at the police taking my dad away,

131
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.890
even though probably it was a good tank,

132
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.580
but I didn't really understand what was going on at that time.

133
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.760
This and this is different today. Probably wouldn't go on. But

134
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.480
the neighbor policemen about a block away had a son in my class at

135
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:36.350
school. So after school, that day,

136
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.620
we were both walking home and I was really mad.

137
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.590
And I pull out of my pocket, a wire

138
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:53.510
and I took this kid down on the ground and I wired his

139
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.630
wrist together and not real hard,

140
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:01.320
but like there were handcuffs and I grabbed the wire and I said,

141
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.250
this is what your dad did to my dad last night. And I'm going to do it to you.

142
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:07.470
And I'm going to take you, and I'm going to take you home this way.

143
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.440
And I took him home because they lived about a block away and I,

144
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.100
and took the things off and let him go in. But

145
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.710
it's my puppy, fourth grade. But

146
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.640
my dad found out about that and wow, what did I get in trouble?

147
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.700
I mean, he, he used to hit me on top of the head with a ring,

148
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.570
probably why you don't have much hair, but, but, um, and, um,

149
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.360
and he looked at me and he said, you know what?

150
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.460
I was toxicant last night was good. They took me out of here,

151
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.640
but you know what they did to me, when I got me down to the police department,

152
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:47.100
he said, I played pool with him.

153
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.670
They had a little billiards room down there and they played pool with me until I

154
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:55.290
sobered up. And then they brought me back. And, uh, and you did that to his son.

155
00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.060
I said, dad, I, I, I was just protecting you.

156
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:02.340
I thought, you know, but, and everybody understood,

157
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.330
but it's kind of funny how things are. And I don't think that's the old days.

158
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.680
Good old days, uh, compared to, I don't know,

159
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:14.340
they'd probably do a lot more, you know, they'd lock you up probably,

160
00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:17.010
but I only give him too many breaks, but, uh,

161
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.280
it's kinda funny how that's kind of house, you know,

162
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:25.230
difference between 40 years ago, 50 years ago, 60 years ago.

163
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.340
I'm better though. The good are the good old days, the good old days.

164
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:34.320
I said it today. I think I liked the good old days. I mean,

165
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:38.340
I got picked up one other time and it was my, uh, former, um,

166
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:43.800
I was back home from college and, and he, um,

167
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.540
he was my gym teacher, Nate grade and, uh,

168
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.930
Mr. Mr. Blue. And he, uh,

169
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.090
ended up being a policeman. So when I came home Kali,

170
00:10:57.091 --> 00:11:01.680
so that was about in seventh grade. So we're talking 6, 7,

171
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.290
8 years later when I was home for the weekend and,

172
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.240
and I was driving and he picked me up and I probably had a beer in a car or

173
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:13.380
something. And, you know, he, he actually, um,

174
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.510
let me go. But he picked me up again the same night.

175
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.600
So he took me down a second time and he put me in his office and the police

176
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:28.260
station when we talked for quite a while, we let me go too,

177
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:29.940
but you know,

178
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.130
just can't get away with it. I mean, there's just more rules regulations.

179
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.860
If people find out it's like, whoa, whoa. You know,

180
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:45.300
I think the good old days probably gave you a chance to actually realize things

181
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:50.190
better than you can today can actually get a second chance maybe.

182
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.980
And you know, that type of thing, catch.
