1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How come no diseases ever make us better?</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.330
There's nothing. It's like a Marvel comic book we catch.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.510
<v 1>Yeah. How come I can't get hit with gamma, radiation</v>

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.180
And Spiderman. Every time I get mad at somebody just Hoke out. But you,

5
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:20.730
you know, they never showed like everyday things with the Hulk, like,

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.730
suppose he's in a car right now, your car,

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.030
the Hulk just grew tore up your car now. Hello, state, farm. Yeah.

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.830
You're not going to believe what just happened to my car.

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.870
<v 0>Yeah. Th the concept of the Hawk that's on all the time, annoys the out of me.</v>

10
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.070
You know that he's the Hulk now constantly 24 hours a day. And then he's smart.

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.780
Right? Come on. He's so he's Bruce banner all the time.

12
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.690
He's Bruce banner, but he's also the Hawk eye.

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.860
<v 1>Um, we were talking about reading, which is what I'm doing now.</v>

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.550
And I got this book. It's like 10 years of the Hulk.

15
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.410
It's like a thousand pages of hope comics, a 10 year run.

16
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:00.240
And the story is, it's great.

17
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.100
It's the gray Hulk who was smart, but not like the movie one,

18
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:07.260
but he was smarter than the regular one. And he would,

19
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.120
he would only change at night, like a vamp, like, uh, where off. Yeah.

20
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.900
So it's like, Hey, this is just how much free time I have Joe.

21
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.280
<v 0>The new hope they probably missed mark ruffles acting.</v>

22
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.940
He's such a good actor. And they didn't have enough room for him to just,

23
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.610
I mean, there's so many people in that movie, right? You've got captain America,

24
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.940
you got all these people. You got iron man, a pro.

25
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.910
They probably like mark Ralph. Wasn't just not talking to enough. Yes.

26
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.670
Most of the time we need him as the Hawk. So I got an idea.

27
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.080
Somebody mark ruffle the hug all the time. The Oak has glasses.

28
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:44.820
Now he has glasses, his glasses. It's so ridiculous. No,

29
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:49.140
the whole idea you is supposed to be that he's a really smart guy.

30
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.090
And then he's basically a model.

31
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.960
<v 1>I'm a monster with unlimited strength, like unlimited power talks, like.</v>

32
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.120
<v 0>Hawk smash that smart.</v>

33
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.001
<v 1>Right? Like in,</v>

34
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:02.790
in the Thor movie where he's working as a fighter and he has like a room

35
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.660
and he's, he's taken Babs and stuff like that. What was that movie? Ragnar rock.

36
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.570
And he didn't see that one. He didn't see that one. Yeah.

37
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.300
Where the Hulk is a fighter. He's like a gladiator,

38
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.710
but he's treated like a hero. And he has all the gladiator stuff, you know?

39
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:19.200
And it's like, yeah, the Hoke wouldn't be doing that.

40
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:21.810
Like the hook would just be smashing and destroy.

41
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.230
<v 0>Yeah. I need to watch that one, but oh, that, see, I didn't see this movie.</v>

42
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.573
That looks dope. Oh.

43
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.520
<v 1>It's fun. Yeah. That's one of them. No, this is one of the funny ones, man.</v>

44
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:30.540
You got to see that one. So.

45
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.210
<v 0>The whole goes to battle. Spoiler alert with Thor.</v>

46
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.450
<v 1>Yeah. He like a gladiator in Thor,</v>

47
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:39.180
ends up on the island and Thor ends up in the ring with him. But.

48
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.820
<v 0>It's dumb Hawk. Right? Dumb. Hope's good. He's not.</v>

49
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.540
<v 1>He's not fully done. He's not as, he's not scientists hope,</v>

50
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.760
but he's smart enough to hold conversations.

51
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.860
<v 0>What a mismatch that would be if it was real, are you kidding me? Thor?</v>

52
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.000
Just relax.

53
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.960
<v 1>I don't know. How much did you, how much Marvel were you into growing up into?</v>

54
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.710
<v 0>'Cause like DC that much, but it was a giant Marvel.</v>

55
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.220
<v 1>Guy.</v>

56
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.370
Cause I was a big Marvel guy and I tell people one of the big things and they

57
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:09.640
brought it up in the first Avenger movie. And this was a storyline.

58
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:10.474
I remember this.

59
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.830
The hope could never fight Thor because they were both so strong.

60
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:17.800
They would destroy the planet. Cause like the hoax,

61
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.900
the hoax strength was unlimited.

62
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.220
Cause the matter he got the stronger he got and Thor's a God,

63
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.990
which is something they never play in the movies.

64
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.780
But in the comic books every now and then throw it would remind them like,

65
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.930
I'm a God I can destroy the whole planet.

66
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.140
Like that's what my dad is. The.

67
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.250
<v 0>And that's the problem. If he's a God, then what the is captain Marvel?</v>

68
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.810
Cause that chick trumps everyday,

69
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.860
she comes down and everybody's going to sit the down here.

70
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.590
She's the superhero mom, captain. Marvel's the number one. Super. She's.

71
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.490
<v 1>The most powerful.</v>

72
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.440
<v 0>Although in the save the world you call her.</v>

73
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.960
<v 1>And that last one, like when, the hope, when, I mean,</v>

74
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:59.320
when Thor went to where he got the new acts made. Yes.

75
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.590
Like he was like controlling a son. Right?

76
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.190
Wouldn't it like power of a son was good. You know, it's really,

77
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.260
and this is what I love. And this is what, what, why women laugh at us?

78
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.570
Because we're having this discussion, right? Yes.

79
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.460
<v 0>Well, it's also what makes, uh, what, what, what is the, the, the,</v>

80
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.350
the really pretty girls name? This score? Scarlett Johannson. Yeah.

81
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.220
What is there a character? A black widow, but she's just kicks. Right?

82
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.290
She just UFC power. Chanco hanging out with iron man. Right?

83
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:35.740
That's what it's like. She's Valentina. Shevchenko is UFC strawweight champion.

84
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.873
That's what it's like.

85
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.090
<v 1>And the other thing is she shoot like she has a gun,</v>

86
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.000
but no one they fight can be killed with bullets.

87
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.510
<v 0>She's a flyaway champion. I strongly, yeah, no one can be killed with bullets.</v>

88
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.320
And how about the dude? Uh, Jeremy Renner's character haka.

89
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.780
He's got a bow and arrow. That is ridiculous.

90
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.730
<v 1>He has a lot of special arrows,</v>

91
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.480
but yet to have a gun It's like,

92
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.020
you're fighting aliens with an, and you got a bow and arrow. It's like, man,

93
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.140
you've skipped generations of weapons technology.

94
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.680
<v 0>And it seems to never run out. It's amazing.</v>

95
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.300
<v 1>That's the, that's the superpower.</v>

96
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.500
<v 0>There's like the balance. The imbalance is super power is so crazy.</v>

97
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.990
You can have a guy with a bow and arrow or the Hulk.

98
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.030
Hawkeye has no super human powers with the exception of the period when using

99
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.800
prim particles to become Goliath. Okay. Whatever dorks.

100
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.180
He he's at the very peak of human conditioning. Sure. He is.

101
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.870
He's an exceptional fencer, Acrobat and a grand master marksman.

102
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:39.280
Having been trained from childhood in the circus by the criminals trick shot and

103
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.260
oh boy. Well, I'm a big Jeremy Renner fan. I liked that guy a lot. However,

104
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.040
we have to be realistic about superpowers. You got the Hulk on one hand,

105
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.910
you got captain Marvel and another hand and a dude who's like, uh,

106
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.130
an Acrobat Hawkeye. Good at shooting.

107
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.820
<v 1>I think Hawkeye's limit is fighting crime, right? Like criminals,</v>

108
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.830
Hawkeye could take down, but when super powers and aliens and stuff,

109
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:06.920
come in, that's when you gotta, you gotta make some phone calls.

110
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.390
<v 0>Just camped by aliens coming at you and you shooting them with a bow and arrow.</v>

111
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.360
I just know they came here from another planet to shout with a bow and arrow.

112
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.700
Come on, come on. Yeah.

113
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.340
<v 1>Well, who else? Well, what captain America, like he, he's just really strong.</v>

114
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.090
<v 0>But superhuman.</v>

115
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.490
<v 1>Superhuman strain.</v>

116
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.420
<v 0>We have a experiment, right? But he's like Bulletproof isn't he? No.</v>

117
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.350
<v 1>No, no.</v>

118
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.050
<v 0>He can be really quick or something. No, he can be hurt.</v>

119
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.240
<v 1>Real, real quick. No. Uh, what, what's his name? Wolverine Hills. Right?</v>

120
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.200
Instantly.

121
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.080
<v 0>I thought captain America had one of them jammies too. Not like.</v>

122
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.340
<v 1>I don't think like Wolverine,</v>

123
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:47.060
he probably heals quicker or could take more pain or something. And most.

124
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.220
<v 0>It's an America. Okay. Has agility, agility, strength,</v>

125
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:53.240
speed, endurance,

126
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.260
and reaction time superior to any Olympic athlete athlete,

127
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.430
whoever competed,

128
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.960
LOL the super soldier formula that he has metabolizes enhance all of his bodily

129
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:06.770
functions to the peak of human efficiency. Oh he ain't, man.

130
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.870
Iron man can him up peak.

131
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.720
<v 1>Right. Bodily functions. But that's it right? You can't.</v>

132
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.040
<v 0>With iron man with that set of skills. You just a really strong dude,</v>

133
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.820
but in the movie, he's not in that movie. He's way stronger than any person.

134
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.420
Who's that right?

135
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.890
<v 1>And he's also the leader. Like he's the military strategy guy. I guess he's.</v>

136
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.140
<v 0>The most sculpted face.</v>

137
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.060
<v 1>Iron man tells you who he is. Yeah. Billionaire Playboy philanthropists. Genius.</v>

138
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.750
<v 0>I want the Hawk. I.</v>

139
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.970
<v 1>Come out. Yeah. I'm going to, I'm going to go fight.</v>

140
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.510
I'm going to go hardcore Thor. Those would be my two and a fight.

141
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.250
<v 0>Captain Marvel comes down, them all up. She's bad.</v>

142
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.010
They gave her too many powers. She almost has.

143
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.350
<v 1>To gave her everything except a good movie.</v>

144
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.320
<v 0>That's true. They keep her in the movie department.</v>

145
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.930
<v 1>Horror movie was her movie was in. So it's like, it filled the story.</v>

146
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:07.130
So you knew who she was, but it wasn't that great. You know?

147
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.490
<v 0>And it didn't match up with someone who has the powers that she has.</v>

148
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:11.420
Like she look,

149
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.200
if you're playing a game and the game's good guys versus the bad guys on your

150
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:18.290
good guy side, you want to have like, you'd be like real pumped.

151
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:21.290
If one person had way more power than anybody who's ever lived.

152
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.720
<v 1>Right. Or you would just, you'd wait to play that card. You know? You'd like,</v>

153
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.050
let people know like, Hey, don't let me have to pull captain Marvel. Like don't,

154
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.860
don't let me have to wake her up right now. Because if she comes down here,

155
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.900
everybody.

156
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.130
<v 0>But here's the thing. Like they,</v>

157
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.850
they can't figure out a way to make a good movie.

158
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:45.650
<v 1>I don't know. I mean, again, the movie was, it was all right, but it wasn't,</v>

159
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.620
it wasn't great. It didn't show.

160
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.410
<v 0>That's why I shouldn't have to have a boy,</v>

161
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.260
like remember when wonder woman wonder woman had a boyfriend. Yeah.

162
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.080
People liked it better. Some regular soldier got the wonder woman. Right.

163
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.950
<v 1>And you know what? No one would believe you.</v>

164
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.500
<v 0>Yeah. You'd have to shut up about that. But.</v>

165
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.410
<v 1>I'm sure. And I'm wonder woman.</v>

166
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.650
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.840
There's a looking up captain Marvel's powers and a little question popped up,

168
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.780
but who is the strongest Marvel hero? Yeah.

169
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.220
<v 0>Do you know? Uh,</v>

170
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:22.200
the strongest I w w would eat be captain

171
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:23.310
Marvel or.

172
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.340
<v 2>Yeah, I thought it would be Thor, a Hawk. It says also in the destroyer,</v>

173
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:28.950
which I've never heard of, but it says Hercules and I didn't know.

174
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.390
<v 0>Hercules was in there.</v>

175
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.500
<v 1>Hercules was in like a few comic books,</v>

176
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:37.500
but he's not Hercules Hercules.

177
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.530
Ain't considered part of the Marvel universe. Right?

178
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.620
Like Stan Lee didn't create Hercules.

179
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.640
<v 0>Exactly. Yeah. You're not allowed to do that. Like, by the way,</v>

180
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.130
why would you have Hercules in a comic book? That's a.

181
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.870
<v 1>I do vaguely remember Hercules being in some Marvel comics, but,</v>

182
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.620
but nah, he did. I don't think he counts, stated and create him.

183
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.580
<v 0>I got lucky with Thor, leave it at that stole one. God,</v>

184
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.770
you can't steal any other mythical characters. Right.

185
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.570
<v 1>And, and it was cool with Thor because in the comic books, he was human too.</v>

186
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:14.100
Right. He had like a human form and then he would turn into Thor. Yeah.

187
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.020
In the comic books, he had a human form.

188
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.540
<v 0>I don't remember that. What, but you know,</v>

189
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.000
you would think that someone else could make a Thor movie,

190
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.050
like why can't they make a Thor movie, like an origin movie about Thor.

191
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:25.960
The God can.

192
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.630
<v 1>Do that. They might, they.</v>

193
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.060
<v 0>One's ever done that. Isn't an amazing, done it yet.</v>

194
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.640
<v 1>But who knows? They had.</v>

195
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.590
<v 0>Some movies where people pretend they're in the clouds and they pretend they're.</v>

196
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.820
Yeah. They pretend they're that, you know, they're gods,

197
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.400
there's been some God movies. Right. What.

198
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:41.550
<v 1>Was the.</v>
