00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.620
<v 0>Like, I wonder for the future,</v>

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.940
we'll know that like certain animals can like take messages around for us.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.700
And like, if you told an animal something, it could go tell, you know, like,

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.780
I wonder if we'll start using animals more. Yeah.

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.580
<v 1>For sure. But whatever, for whatever reason, it makes more sense with birds.</v>

6
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.140
Yeah. You gotta send a bird that nobody wants to shoot though. Yeah.

7
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:24.100
People like to shoot birds.

8
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.410
<v 0>Well, owl too, dude. We had owl two Thanksgivings ago.</v>

9
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:30.050
We had two owls at my sister's house.

10
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.330
<v 1>Yeah. I saw one last night actually. Did you? Yeah, it was pretty cool.</v>

11
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.650
It was big too.

12
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.730
<v 0>It's gross. I think owls the meat, the uh, oh.</v>

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.483
<v 0>Guys ate owls.</v>

15
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850
<v 1>Yeah. I think that's legal. You probably shouldn't say that on the podcast.</v>

16
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.880
<v 0>Well, &lt;laugh&gt; I didn't have a lot. I didn't have a lot, man. I had no,</v>

17
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.960
I think I even spit it out. I'm not even joking.

18
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.040
<v 1>Yet. It's like bill Clinton, when you smoked that weed and they.</v>

19
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.480
<v 0>Had two, they didn't have all the things.</v>

20
00:00:56.481 --> 00:01:00.280
They don't have a lot of meat on 'em they're I don't like owls, owls,

21
00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:01.640
whoever did their PR you notice,

22
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:04.240
everybody thinks they're smart and they can read. And they're like.

23
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.110
<v 1>Yeah, they had a good PR agent. Right?</v>

24
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.550
<v 0>Yeah. Look at that. But see how much little meat is on him.</v>

25
00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:12.230
You think there's more? &lt;laugh&gt;.

26
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.870
<v 1>Look, he's kidding. He's kidding folks. He's not eating owls.</v>

27
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.910
I was driving home when one was flying above me on the road and dropped a rabbit

28
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.590
and I stopped the car and to check it out, I was like, whoa, that's.

29
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.740
<v 0>Flirting. Really? It sounds like flirting. Oh, if a drops a rabbit at your feet.</v>

<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; I'll tell you this.</v>

33
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.260
If you wanna feed a family of four, you can't just have one hour.

34
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.530
I will say that though. I.
