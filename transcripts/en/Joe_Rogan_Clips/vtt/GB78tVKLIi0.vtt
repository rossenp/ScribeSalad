00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 1>Experience, we know from the history of censorship, that it never works.</v>

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.920
It never works. It always drives people towards truth.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.690
<v 0>But that doesn't matter. People are stupid. You just because you say,</v>

5
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:14.250
you know it, and we do know it,

6
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.340
it doesn't mean people are going to think that way and operate that way.

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.060
That requires restraint. It requires foresight.

8
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.650
It requires some sort of, uh, uh, an objective understanding of history.

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.280
<v 1>Well, I'll give you an example. So in the UK, there was a far right particle,</v>

10
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.560
the British national party, which does technically still exist,

11
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:35.970
but now there's like 10 people in it. And I'm the leader of that part.

12
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:38.850
There was a moment where they were winning millions of votes, right?

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.590
Because there were a lot of people who were disenfranchised,

14
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:42.780
particularly working class areas, and they were desperate for some kind of,

15
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.580
and the head of that party.

16
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:48.330
Nick Griffin went onto our main political discussion program called question

17
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:51.960
time, BBC won prime time and he was humiliated.

18
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.790
And as soon as that happened, the BMP were over. Within a matter of months,

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.330
it exposed to those normal people,

20
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.240
the ludicrous and absurd nature of his viewpoint.

21
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.480
And that I think is a really heartening idea that actually, if you ex,

22
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.010
if you hear more from these people, they are self discrediting. Right. But,

23
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:14.340
but if you, if you ban them, you're almost giving them a kind of glamor,

24
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.640
a kind of martyrdom status that they don't deserve. And, and,

25
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.520
and that I think attracts a lot of people to their worldview.

26
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.130
<v 0>That's, there's definitely something to be said for that. Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.690
There's definitely something to be said. I mean, like,

28
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.840
I'm not in favor of banning these people. Yeah. But I'm not also,

29
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:32.370
I'm also not in favor of these people.

30
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:36.240
Being able to espouse hate speech everywhere they go.

31
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:38.700
And to be able to indoctrinate people as well. It's like,

32
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:39.890
I don't know what the actual.

33
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.990
<v 1>Well, I'll put it as my view.</v>

34
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.560
I do not trust the state to decide what constitutes hate speech.

35
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.860
I don't believe that. Um, I mean, in the UK,

36
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:52.710
they've proven that they're not capable of doing that. That was Canada. Right?

37
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.120
Exactly. Absolutely. Clearly. So, so in that case,

38
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.870
I'm for abolishing the idea of hate speech as a practice we have,

39
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.420
I don't know how much you know about the UK with this. Right?

40
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:08.160
We have a thing where the police will investigate you for noncrime

41
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.160
if it's offensive, right. On crime. So there's a website,

42
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:15.420
the government's website and hate crime has a paragraph on noncrime hate

43
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:20.220
incidents. Okay. And what they specifically say is if you've heard some,

44
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.260
if someone said something and it's offensive to you,

45
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.490
and you believe that the person said something, because of you, you will,

46
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.130
one of the protected characteristics because of race, gender, sexuality,

47
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.800
disability, whatever, then you report that to the police.

48
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.050
And it gets logged in the hate crime statistics as a hate crime,

49
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.230
even though there's no crime, okay.

50
00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:37.680
I'll give you a very specific example of this.

51
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:40.440
There's a famous case in the UK at the moment, man called Harry Miller.

52
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.320
He was a Docker from Humberside and, uh, the police,

53
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.740
he retweeted a poem that was perceived to be transphobic.

54
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.570
And people were upset about that, but he didn't even write the poem.

55
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:53.250
He just retweeted the poem. The police investigated his retweet and they,

56
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.150
and he said to them, have I broken the law? They said, this isn't a crime.

57
00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:01.720
This is a noncrime hate incident. And the actual phrase the police officer used,

58
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:05.350
I'm not joking was we have to check your thinking, right?

59
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.900
Whoa. Now that's sinister.

60
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.040
W w w and then when the police were Humberside, police were challenged on this,

61
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.970
but in the media, it turns out this is standard practice in the police.

62
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.040
This isn't just one rogue police officer going a bit mad.

63
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.030
This is standard practice.

64
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.520
The commissioning guidelines from the college of policing,

65
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.400
actually stipulate that this is what you're meant to do.

66
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.620
This is now finally being challenged in the courts.

67
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:29.410
But no one stood up to this stuff, you know? Does that.

68
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.970
<v 0>The phrase, check your thinking, thinking by a police officer no less. Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.360
Like the police, who's qualified to check your thinking. I mean,

70
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:39.880
you should be it's crazy.

71
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.390
<v 1>Difficult. Well, yeah, quite, I mean, the, the,</v>

72
00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:44.480
the college of policing who teach the police, what, what,

73
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.200
what the police officer actually said is he said, well, we've had a workshop.

74
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:50.590
And what you don't understand is that babies are sometimes born with a diff with

75
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:52.240
a male brain when they've got a female. But I mean,

76
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:56.290
literally he was trying to lecture him on this stuff. And, um, yeah.

77
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.220
<v 0>That might be true,</v>

78
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.050
but that doesn't mean that the police should be able to tell you that you can't

79
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:03.850
retweet something that you agree with.

80
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.910
<v 1>Right. And we have, you know, we have people in our country who have been,</v>

81
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.510
do you know how many people are arrested in the UK? I'll just ask, like,

82
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.370
how many people do you think are arrested every year in the UK for offensive

83
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.570
comments they posted online? What would you guess? Just as a, I mean,

84
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.030
it's not a trick, I'm just interested to know what you would assume.

85
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.880
<v 0>Rested for offensive comments online, say 300, three.</v>

86
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.440
<v 1>Thousands every year right now. Wow.</v>

87
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.640
And that's not including all the many thousands of noncrime noncrime hate

88
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:38.500
incidents that are logged on.

89
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.230
<v 0>Right. So 3000 people arrested and what.</v>

90
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.570
<v 1>Is it? Some of them will be horrible, by the way. I'm, I'm,</v>

91
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.880
I've been clear about like, some of those comments will be horrible, nasty,

92
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:49.360
racist, awful. A lot of them are between like rival football,

93
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:51.790
gangs and stuff like that. But some of them are jokes.

94
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.340
One guy served three months in prison for a joke about Madeline McCann. Uh,

95
00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:59.080
and it was a joke that he cut and paste from some website and put it on his own

96
00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:02.860
Facebook page three months in prison for that. So what was the joke?

97
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.450
I don't know. I don't know. Good. Yeah.

98
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.460
<v 0>It must as laughing for three months.</v>

99
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.630
Where does he exactly food that be worth it right now? He's a felon, right?

100
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:11.464
Yeah. Yeah.

101
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.100
<v 1>The famous one in the UK at the moment is the countdown killer case. Um,</v>

102
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.070
the nuts.

103
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.260
<v 0>Do you know that one? Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.140
<v 1>And, um, and because I used to explain.</v>

105
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.520
<v 0>It to people that don't know that story.</v>

106
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.800
<v 1>There's a guy called count Duncan,</v>

107
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:28.450
his real name's Marcus Meakin and he's a YouTuber. And he created his dog,

108
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.330
sorry, his girlfriend's dog. Cause he's cute. Little pug dog. Right.

109
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.990
And his girlfriend was only always going on about how adorable the dog was.

110
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.610
So he made, he trained the dog to jump about enthusiastically,

111
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:41.410
whenever it heard the phrase gas, the Jews,

112
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.430
and he trained it to do a little Nazi salute. Whenever it hurts Zeke Heil.

113
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.450
Right now, those phrases out of that context are unpleasant.

114
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.520
You can see why someone would be offended by that. Right.

115
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.300
But the joke was that this cute little dog is doing is behaving this vicious.

116
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.781
In fact,

117
00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:59.270
the joke is predicated on the idea that there's nothing worse than a Nazi. Well,

118
00:05:59.271 --> 00:05:59.810
also.

119
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.080
<v 0>So the joke is predicated on the fact that we all know the dog has no idea what</v>

120
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:03.560
it's doing.

121
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.170
<v 1>Quite exactly. Yeah. So that's what, that's what, that's him doing?</v>

122
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.160
The Z car there. So, but that's better the dog now acuity. Now look,

123
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.460
I accept that people can be like, you know, I might be offended by it.

124
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.050
I'm offended by all sorts of things and that's fine.

125
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.270
But no 3 million people saw that video before YouTube took it down, you know?

126
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.530
And, um, uh, 3 million people, not one complaint, no one complained.

127
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.610
The police actually went to the Scottish council of Jewish communities and said,

128
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.210
do you find this offensive? And understandably, they said, yes.

129
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.620
And the police are great. Now we can prosecute this guy. Two year investigation,

130
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.450
uh, found guilty in a court of law. Um, ultimately find 800 pounds.

131
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:41.991
That was what happened,

132
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:45.440
but he's got a criminal record now for whatever you think about the joke, right?

133
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.010
It's it's, it is clearly meant to be funny, whatever you,

134
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.760
not only that cyber crime intelligence unit investigated all of his tweets

135
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.271
emails,

136
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:57.200
his entire background to find any remote connection to a fascist group or a

137
00:06:57.201 --> 00:07:00.530
far-right group, nothing. They found nothing. So there's no evidence.

138
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.960
So basically they process it in the UK.

139
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:07.460
We now have someone who has been prosecuted because the judge believes that he

140
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:10.340
knows what secretly going on, what the, his secret intention is. And the,

141
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.050
the actual phrasing of the law that under which he was prosecuted is that it is

142
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:17.900
deemed grossly offensive, which is a very subjective idea.

143
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:18.800
Something that is grossly.

144
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.560
<v 0>Typically when the fact that you have 3000 different view or 3 million different</v>

145
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:29.000
views and no complaints, no complaints. Right. That's.

146
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.880
<v 1>That's crazy. And I know the guy cause I, I, I, I defended him at the time.</v>

147
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.220
And then of course, people send the I'm a Nazi apologist. Cause I, you know,

148
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.550
that's, which is utterly, utterly ludicrous. But I know the guy that he's,

149
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.560
he's a nice guy. He's not a tall.

150
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:43.840
<v 0>I've seen him interviewed. Yeah.</v>

151
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.870
<v 2>While you guys are talking about this, I found a story that happened last week.</v>

152
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:48.710
Um,

153
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.740
this was a tweet that I've kind of gone through it to verify it a little bit.

154
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:53.120
I don't want to say it's a hundred percent accurate,

155
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:57.680
but this guy got a job interview and I guess you signed up and they found this

156
00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:00.620
on his, on their own. He said he did not give them his information.

157
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.720
They sent him 351 pages of every tweet he ever liked it. Had the word in it.

158
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.583
Wow.

159
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.200
<v 0>He said, I had to get a background check for my job.</v>

160
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:13.340
And it turns out the report is a 300 plus page PDF of every single tweet I've

161
00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:16.370
ever liked. Liked with the word, in it.

162
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.620
Enjoy your dystopian BS.

163
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.940
<v 2>There's a bunch of tweets showing it.</v>

164
00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:22.490
But I looked up the company that does this. Hold on, go back.

165
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.830
<v 0>Sorry. What does it say? Update?</v>

166
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.780
I came home to a package containing a print out of all 351

167
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:34.160
pages of it. Obviously the dystopia cares about wasting paper. Here's like a.

168
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.120
<v 2>For instance of what it looks like.</v>

169
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.330
<v 1>And have they used this to justify not giving him the job?</v>

170
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.890
Is that the [inaudible].

171
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.460
<v 0>Okay. If you liked this tweet, Merry Christmas to the toddler.</v>

172
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:46.310
I saw running across trader Joe's with a giant bottle of peppermint,

173
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:50.750
vodka and mom running after him. Like no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

174
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.093
Only.

175
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.760
<v 1>So flag type bad flag. Reason. Alcohol. Yeah.</v>

176
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.290
Post type liked.

177
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.420
<v 0>Yeah. So they, they changed what he was saying.</v>

178
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.050
Right?

179
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:08.820
He's he's making a joke about a toddler that he saw running across

180
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.320
trader Joe's with giant bottle of peppermint vodka that it had taken from his

181
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:15.510
mom. And the mom was like, no, no, no, no, no. Give me that. Give me that.

182
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:20.370
Given that. So they flagged it because there was alcohol in it.

183
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:23.430
The baby had a bottle of alcohol. There's nothing offensive about that.

184
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.360
<v 1>I actually don't understand why that would be an issue because they want you to.</v>

185
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.243
<v 0>Be scared as.</v>

186
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.530
They want to be able to control your thinking and they don't want you to ever do

187
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:36.320
anything that could come back to hurt the company in any way and

188
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.850
mess with their bottom line. I mean, that is crazy.

189
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.530
<v 1>Even liking a tweet, not just writing the treatment, liking crazy,</v>

190
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:46.560
like things by mistake. Sometimes thumbs. I just say the wrong thing.

191
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.560
<v 0>Here's another one to this day.</v>

192
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.680
This is still the most in all caps,

193
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:56.700
big Dick energy I've ever seen in a video. I don't know what that is.

194
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.810
<v 2>I called his dad when he was one about twin who wants to be a millionaire to</v>

195
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:03.750
like celebrate that. I know the answer I'm going to win. Right?

196
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

197
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.310
So he called his dad tells dad that he's going to win because he knew he was

198
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.720
going to win. Now look at this flag. Reason, language, bigotry,

199
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.490
sexism, what's.

200
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.570
<v 1>The bigotry and the sexism.</v>

201
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.130
<v 0>There. I don't understand it.</v>

202
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.420
I don't see any bigotry or bigotry in protect sexism.

203
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.410
That he's a man and he's showing big Dick energy. Cause he's big.

204
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:26.700
Dick energy is an expression.

205
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.600
And it's an expression for someone who is SU super confident.

206
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.570
And the idea that you say, well, he must have a big Dick.

207
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.590
That's the joke without that. Oh, it's a joke. It's an internet meme,

208
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.720
big tick energy as an internet meme.

209
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:44.730
And that this is flag type bad language, bigotry,

210
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:48.570
sexism. And here's the best part. Post type liked. He just liked it.

211
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.590
Like you saw. I was like, ah, cause it is a big Dick energy move.

212
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.500
But to find your dad, call your dad and say, I'm about to win a million dad.

213
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.200
<v 1>Is that, what does that classify as big Dick energy? But it's not,</v>

214
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:01.590
it's not a phrase that we commonly use in the UK. We're too refined for that.

215
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:03.420
<v 0>Yeah, it was vulgar,</v>

216
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.500
but it's a new American thing over the last four years or so.

217
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.100
<v 1>Two, maybe two years. Yeah. It's having a big Dick sexist then. Is.</v>

218
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.780
<v 0>That the, I guess that's what they're saying.</v>

219
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.080
And it's bigotry is the hilarious part.

220
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.550
I'm I scour that forever and try to find some bigotry there. You know,

221
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.110
a gentleman's name. If you want to read this folks,

222
00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:23.760
you want to read along with his, his, uh,

223
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.740
internet name is K M L E F R a N

224
00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:30.840
C K M L E Frank,

225
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.520
F R a N C K M L E F R a N C on Twitter,

226
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.540
Bruce, Bruce almighty. Hilarious. So he's a funny guy.

227
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.420
<v 1>By the way, they don't know what bigotry means.</v>

228
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.400
I'm really sick of this word being thrown around. Right?

229
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.190
<v 0>A real problem right there. I mean, he should be able to Sue for that one.</v>

230
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.990
There's nothing bigotry about that.

231
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.150
<v 1>Is the dictionary.</v>

232
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:54.630
Definition of bigotry is an intolerance to those with different opinions. And,

233
00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.890
and more often than not, sorry, I didn't mean to patronize him,

234
00:11:56.891 --> 00:11:58.810
but it's just that whenever I hear the word being used,

235
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:02.410
it's always by bigots who can't tolerate your opinion. So you're a bigot.

236
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.870
You don't agree with everything I say. And therefore you're a bigger,

237
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.200
no that makes you, you just undermined your whole point. It's gross,

238
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.760
but liking tweets, I mean,

239
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.360
it's bad enough that people sort of troll through everything you ever wrote.

240
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.220
<v 0>And what's crazy about that is this is a company that's doing this.</v>

241
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:19.930
So there's a company that they hired.

242
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.830
That's willing to do this and the company labeled it bigotry.

243
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.830
So as the company Wolk, is this the company Fatima,

244
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.760
the smartest way to screen toxic workplace behavior? No,

245
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:35.500
there'll be famine is a talent screening software. Okay. So it's software.

246
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:40.060
That's part of the problem to help identify problematic behavior among

247
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:44.500
potential hires and current employees by analyzing

248
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.890
publicly available online information. Oh boy,

249
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:49.390
would I have a hard time getting a job.

250
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.880
<v 2>That, uh, another company used this company to get that information.</v>

251
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.290
So it's like a background.

252
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.183
<v 0>Check. Yeah.</v>

253
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.700
<v 1>Company, creepy company, insane. Like that's really sinister.</v>

254
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.550
<v 0>It seems like it's just software. It's just like the, yeah.</v>

255
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.630
It says a talent screening software. So it's basically,

256
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.260
they just scan you to make sure that you pass their purity test,

257
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.610
which no one will no one with any sense of humor. I mean, if that guy,

258
00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:18.940
the big Dick energy guy that gets you flagged you're a bad person.

259
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.640
Cause you thought that that guy who knew he was gonna win a million dollars.

260
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:23.920
So he called his dad. I mean, that's, that's funny.

261
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.400
<v 1>Is there anyone? I,</v>

262
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.440
there is no way that there's anyone on the planet who couldn't be canceled if

263
00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:33.110
you had unlimited access to their private texts and tweets.

264
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.920
<v 0>But that's part of why people want to cancel people.</v>

265
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.480
Cause they know it could come back at them.
