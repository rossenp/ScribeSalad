00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>So you, if it's fair to say you, it seems like you're writing,</v>

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:09.600
like one of the, one of the ways you collect data is almost like you're

3
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:12.330
reporting on these people. Like you're,

4
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:17.010
you're collecting real life interactions between people and real

5
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:21.660
life characteristics, and then you incorporate them into fiction.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.883
Exactly.

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.930
<v 1>That's fair to say. My degree is journalism.</v>

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.760
I have no idea how to be with people.

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.920
So I need to introduce a topic and see if it resonates and then

10
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:36.330
get everybody's take on these common experiences and then pick the very best

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.081
one. So in a way,

12
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:42.000
basically what I'm doing is kind of an ongoing field study that becomes

13
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.290
whatever my next book is.

14
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.420
<v 0>When you wrote fight club,</v>

15
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.980
you tapped into something that w it was really fascinating for me as someone

16
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.710
who's been involved in martial arts my whole life.

17
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.180
And I kind of understood the cathartic release of

18
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:01.950
violence, but I never saw it articulated the way you did.

19
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.030
And you made it enticing for a thinking person.

20
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.220
You made it like you would, you did it, you, you sort of opened up these,

21
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.530
uh, these doors of understanding for someone who may be

22
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.880
maybe had frustration or had some pent up rage, or had some,

23
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.570
some angst that just was not going to get out any other way.

24
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.690
And then you wrote about it. And then when you wrote,

25
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.580
you were reading what you wrote a bank made you go. Yeah. Okay. Oh, all right.

26
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.870
Now it's like, you,

27
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:38.430
you added an element to it that really didn't exist before in pop culture.

28
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.520
It was really fascinating for me, as a,

29
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.700
as someone who's watching that whole thing,

30
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.960
unfurl and watching people get like really resonating with people,

31
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:53.260
watching people really getting excited about your work. It's like, oh, he,

32
00:01:53.261 --> 00:01:56.160
he hit some nerve that nobody really hit before.

33
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.980
<v 1>All right. And it's not a nerve that gets hit very much, you know? And it, it,</v>

34
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.110
there's so many different aspects to it.

35
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.510
And one is just my classic thing is that there are so few social model

36
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.310
novels or stories for men, for, for women. There are, uh,

37
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.550
you know, every season, there's a new joy luck club,

38
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.410
a new how to make an American quilt, a new traveling sisterhood of the Yamaha,

39
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.023
whatever,

40
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.380
just all these different models in which women can come together and talk about

41
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.160
their lives. And if you're a man you've got either fight club,

42
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.410
or you have the dead poet society. And that is really it.

43
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.880
So we don't have a lot of narratives that, that depict to men,

44
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:46.830
a role or a kind of script in which to come together and talk about

45
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:50.970
their, their shed. Another thing is, uh,

46
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.460
Jordan Peterson, back to Jordan Peterson.

47
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.240
He talks about that need for really rough play.

48
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.040
And he talks it a lot. And a lot of my friends, they, they,

49
00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:06.040
they brag about how badly their kids hurt them. Oh my gosh,

50
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.670
my daughter came at me the other day. I had no idea how strong she was.

51
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.090
She pulled my arm out of the socket, and they're proud.

52
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.650
They're proud that their kid can play that rough in his growing up that strong.

53
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.320
But, you know,

54
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:23.950
we've kind of fallen away from this idea of consensual rough play.

55
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.530
And I think fight club resonated with that a lot.

56
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.020
And also the idea of Joseph Campbell's idea that there needs to be a

57
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:35.290
secondary father in men's lives that you're born.

58
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.680
If you're lucky with a biological father that you do not choose,

59
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.960
and that is the nurturing,

60
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:45.400
loving father that you eventually kind of have to reject, but in doing so,

61
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.140
you have to choose a new father.

62
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.490
And that that father by choice typically is, uh,

63
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.840
a minister or a teacher or a drill Sergeant or a coach,

64
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.370
one of those fathers.

65
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.630
And you kind of put yourself in apprenticeship to the secondary father,

66
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.910
and you have to sort of consign your life to the secondary father and agree to

67
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:10.630
learn what they're going to teach you, uh, just like in karate kid.

68
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.860
And that is getting harder and harder and harder to find.

69
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.840
So fight club was also depicting a new form of the secondary father with all

70
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:20.230
these,

71
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.730
these kids that were showing up on the doorstep of this ramshackle old house.

72
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.310
So there was just so many aspects of men's lives that were not being

73
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.050
addressed when fight club came out and it sort of reinvented so many of those

74
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:36.610
things that had fallen by the wayside.

75
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.770
<v 0>That's a huge part of martial arts.</v>

76
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.500
A huge part of martial arts is your relationship with the master,

77
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.390
with the coach, with finding someone who can guide you through the,

78
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:50.580
the most dangerous waters, uh, of competition that it's,

79
00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:54.820
it's absolutely imperative that bad relationships with coaches are absolutely

80
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:56.820
disastrous. And it it's,

81
00:04:56.821 --> 00:05:00.220
it's imperative that someone find the right coach find someone who they,

82
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:02.200
they really can trust and appreciate.

83
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.560
And you do develop it's so such a common theme.

84
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.210
They talk about this person being like a son or this person being like a father,

85
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.560
you know, I mean, it's, um, it's, uh, I, I never thought about it that way.

86
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.390
I forgot about that part of Joseph Campbell, but yeah, that is a huge,

87
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.030
huge issue with, with young men and, um,

88
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.030
young men getting into martial arts is something that I've talked about so many

89
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:28.570
times I don't discuss it as the need for rough play. I say,

90
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:32.410
there's human reward systems that are just not being, did not being met.

91
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.640
And that systems that have been in place for thousands and thousands of years

92
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:40.270
that are designed to reward us for fighting off the enemy,

93
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:45.220
running away from danger or developing physical skills and having

94
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.590
a body that's capable of,

95
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:51.520
of not just a physical activity, but violence.

96
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.880
<v 1>Well, and, and beyond just that, you know,</v>

97
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.520
it's also the whole idea apprenticeship in a,

98
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:03.500
whether you're apprenticing yourself to a fighting coach or to a metallurgist or

99
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.590
to a welder or to a brick layer or to a Mason,

100
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.180
you are apprenticing yourself to somebody that you're going to do all this grunt

101
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:13.580
work for, but in exchange, you're going to,

102
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.580
you're going to learn that kind of really master skill at something.

103
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.980
And so it's a way of mastering yourself as you master

104
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.010
this other thing. So, you know, it,

105
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.640
it's not just always a physical, you know, fighting thing.

106
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:30.530
It doesn't have to be in that form.

107
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.970
<v 0>Just difficult, something that's a struggle, something that's hard to learn,</v>

108
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.290
right? Yeah.

109
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.460
And that relationship that you have with that secondary father too,

110
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.720
it's almost in some ways more intense, the, the,

111
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.390
the pride of someone teaching you something,

112
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:49.640
and then you eventually developing those skills.

113
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:52.460
And then this person who is teaching you,

114
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:55.820
this being proud of your work is extremely satisfactory.

115
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.420
<v 1>Well, and do you remember officer and a gentleman? Yeah. You know,</v>

116
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.770
Richard Gere really has this drunken dis not their dad.

117
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.820
And then he has this drill Sergeant who's constantly trying to wash them out.

118
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.810
And then finally he reaches it at the existential crisis of saying,

119
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.650
you can't throw me out of the service because I have no nothing else.

120
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.670
I have nowhere else to go in the world. My life will amount to nothing,

121
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.170
unless I can master this thing. And he said a relatively young man,

122
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.170
but it is that existentialist moment where you,

123
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.180
you realize that you have to sacrifice your youth for something you're

124
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:33.320
not going to live forever.

125
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.090
It's a very Martin Heidegger moment where you realize you have to become a

126
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:40.940
being living towards death. You're not going to live forever.

127
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.010
And you've got to give your life to something.

128
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.330
<v 0>Now, when you approach a novel like that, when you have a story like that,</v>

129
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:52.310
that's brewing your head, how do you decide what to pull the trigger on? Like,

130
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:55.970
do you just go on instinct? Did you just have a concept in your head?

131
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.510
And it just seems more and more attractive and you just say, okay, this is it.

132
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.121
<v 1>You know,</v>

133
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:06.950
one really good test is if you can take it to a party and you can tell a very

134
00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:10.160
small part of it, as much of it, as, you know, at that point,

135
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.500
and people will Vive for a chance

136
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.520
to relate some aspect of their life. That is very much like that,

137
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.660
but an even more extreme example of that. So in a way, they're,

138
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.710
they're flushing out your theme with parts of their own lives.

139
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.420
And so you find yourself drawing from the experience of dozens or hundreds or

140
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:36.350
thousands of people. And at the same time, you're beta testing it,

141
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.240
you're kind of taking it on the road.

142
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.580
And you're seeing that it's an idea that resonates,

143
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.410
resonates with a huge number of people that everyone can relate to it.

144
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:46.640
Hmm.

145
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.211
<v 0>That's interesting.</v>

146
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:52.010
So do you purposely let go to parties with like a couple like bullets in the

147
00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:52.844
chamber.

148
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.590
<v 1>Sometimes,</v>

149
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.920
or sometimes just go to the party and I listen to hear somebody tell that that

150
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.630
personal anecdote that does evoke all those other anecdotes,

151
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.620
because a great anecdote doesn't leave people speechless.

152
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.390
It leaves them competing to tell a better version of the same thing.

153
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.350
And that's when a real writer just starts realizing, okay,

154
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:19.680
there's a pattern and that can be turned into something really big.

155
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.580
That's really interesting. There's a parallel there with comedy.
