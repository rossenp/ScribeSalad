00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You do spots late at night.</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:09.560
So you shut it down at some point during the day. Do you nap? No. No, no.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.710
You never nap? No.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.860
<v 1>No. I don't think I need it. Interesting. I don't feel it ever helps. Right?</v>

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400
Yeah. I'd rather power through. Right. But I get it if you need it.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.750
If I felt like I needed it, like,

7
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:23.940
I definitely took a bunch of naps when I got back from Italy.

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.750
Cause I was whacked out cause I was sleeping, me up, man.

9
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:31.020
I would sleep for like three hours and then I would wake up and I'd be like,

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.500
why am I wide awake? Right. Two in the morning. It's just so stupid.

11
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.440
And then I would be up and then I'd get really sleepy around six.

12
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:38.730
I try to sleep for an hour.

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.420
I had to wake up and I woke up again and then would take a nap in the afternoon.

14
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.670
Right. It took like a good four or five days before that level of out.

15
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.620
And I started sleeping on a normal schedule.

16
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.890
<v 0>Well, but you work out so much. You don't, you're burning energy.</v>

17
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:56.130
Like usually when you're really in shape, you don't need naps,

18
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.250
but you shouldn't use TM for your, for your brain.

19
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.640
<v 1>Yeah. That sounds like I should do it once. Just give me a mantra.</v>

20
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.000
Once you come up with a mantra for me. But once you become my instructor,

21
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.430
you've been doing it long enough. I don't want to go to some other dude.

22
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.650
T as just Diaz. Yeah. Which one? Nick or Joey? How about Nate?

23
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.733
Nate.

24
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.550
<v 0>Nate Diaz.</v>

25
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.330
<v 1>Now Joey, Joey. Joey deals. Just think Joey Diaz. Joey's going to yeah.</v>

26
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.590
<v 0>Joey D ideas. You could just do it. You could just create it.</v>

27
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.160
Just use own. I mean, I don't understand why. Yeah. Why do you have.

28
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.010
<v 1>A mantra? Yeah. What, tell us your mantra. I can't.</v>

29
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.420
<v 0>I can't, I'm not allowed. They'll come and get me.</v>

30
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.560
That's also not true.

31
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.700
<v 1>That's so not.</v>

32
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.650
<v 0>True. Now they won't come and get me,</v>

33
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:47.790
but it's kind of a personal thing because it has no meaning. If I say it,

34
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:50.520
then you're going to say something back now. There's something attached to it.

35
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.880
That's why you don't say oh, okay. You know what I mean?

36
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.280
It's a pure word.

37
00:01:56.281 --> 00:02:01.110
It's just a pure sound that has no mental attachments to it.

38
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.300
<v 1>Earliest days over religion. Wasn't it a problem.</v>

39
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.370
If you said God's name,

40
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.610
aren't there like certain sex of religion that don't think that you should say

41
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:18.150
God's name, whatever God's name is,

42
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.810
whatever it's a Todd Yeshua or whatever it is,

43
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.050
whatever the name of God is. Isn't it?

44
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.660
Why am I re I'm trying to remember this sounds.

45
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.680
<v 0>Like a Jordan Peterson.</v>

46
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.830
<v 1>Thing. No. Yeah. He would know he would know the answer to it. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.010
<v 0>Well obviously, well obviously says.</v>

48
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.260
<v 1>That's pretty good. It's very Canadian. You might be a Canadian spy.</v>

49
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.630
<v 0>Well obviously you can't,</v>

50
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:50.520
you can't how you say you can't talk about the

51
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:53.730
name without a coming back at you obviously.

52
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.360
Is that fair? That's pretty good. Right?

53
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.270
<v 1>He's one of the most misinterpreted guys. I think I've ever met,</v>

54
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.270
not just willfully misinterpreted,

55
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.210
where people take the words and the things that he's saying,

56
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.170
willfully misconstrue them. They,

57
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:16.030
they purposefully change what he's saying to make it more

58
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:19.300
offensive. More unreasonable. People are angry. Why?

59
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.900
Well, it's hard to say.

60
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.610
I think part of it has to do with the way he initially came onto the scene

61
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.100
because of the transgender thing was yes.

62
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.140
Was he was very concerned that they were forcing people to use certain language,

63
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.260
new pronouns. And people were saying like,

64
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.280
why do you have a problem with people's pronouns? And he's saying,

65
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.050
that's not what I'm saying, right?

66
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.130
The problem is not whether or not I would have a problem with someone's

67
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:52.890
pronouns. The problem's being legally compelled to use these new words.

68
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.440
If someone's inventing and he's like, I am not doing this right. The government.

69
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.300
<v 0>Telling me how I guess I can.</v>

70
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.040
<v 1>Speak. Exactly. Not just that.</v>

71
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:03.220
The government also being influenced by people who want you to be legally

72
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:08.170
compelled to say their, their, their pronouns. It's a slippery slope of control.

73
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:11.050
More than it is a thing of culture or of,

74
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.850
of morals or compassion or for being progressive.

75
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.860
He's not saying that he's saying it based on his very deep understanding of

76
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:23.110
history and of, uh,

77
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.160
some communist dictatorships that have gone horribly wrong.

78
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.640
Some Marxists philosophies that he's aware of,

79
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:33.550
that he thinks that horribly damaged, damaging, and dangerous.

80
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.770
If implemented on a large scale,

81
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.210
like if you allow large groups of people to control language, to,

82
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:43.900
to legally compel people to say these new words that you're inventing, right?

83
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:47.980
Like this is not good. This is a bad path for humans. Just historically,

84
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:51.460
it's a bad path. Right? And so that's how he broke onto the scene.

85
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:55.720
And in that time period, all of these people who oppose what he was saying,

86
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.220
they were labeling him as transphobic. They were labeling him as homophobic,

87
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:02.200
all these different things that are not true. Right.

88
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.190
Then he gets connected to this Pepe, the frog thing, right?

89
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:09.670
Because he thinks it's kind of hilarious that the internet has taken on Pepe.

90
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:11.710
The frog as like this meme,

91
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.570
the field's good man frog now gets, you didn't know the whole thing. The frog.

92
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.140
Wow. Where are you been living? Then you stop meditating. Read the newspaper.

93
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.860
You.

94
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.680
<v 0>Know what I listened to? I didn't know any of.</v>

95
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.730
<v 1>This. I didn't know. No Pepe. The frog is racist. No. Okay. This is serious.</v>

96
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.180
Okay.

97
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.750
You have to know this because if somebody wants you to take a picture with his

98
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.040
Pepe, the frog thing,

99
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.370
there are a certain group of people out there who will decide Tom Papa is some

100
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:41.230
sort of all white, white nationalist, white supremacist, Nazi person,

101
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.920
no. A frog, a frog. Yeah. You know why? Why?

102
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:49.090
Because some people have used that frog in a negative way. Some people,

103
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:53.710
most people use that frog as a joke. Like it feels bad, man.

104
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:55.420
And the frog is like, mm. And.

105
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.830
<v 0>Then it's an animated thing. It's just a frog.</v>

106
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.850
<v 1>A cartoon of a frog. But the alt-right,</v>

107
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.040
or I shouldn't even say the alt-right people on internet forums would

108
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.510
constantly and consistently use that frog as a joke

109
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.680
about everything. Like they had, they had Donald Trump's hair on that frog.

110
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.210
Right. But it's more humor and mocking and making fun of things.

111
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:24.230
And as the British would say, taking the said, he's taking the with the frog,

112
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.210
but there were a few that would have the frog with like a swastika

113
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:33.950
armband, a Nazi hat on why? Because they cause their internet people,

114
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.150
right? Like if you leave something on the internet eventually long enough,

115
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:39.440
someone's going to put a Nazi flag on.

116
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.250
It doesn't mean that it's a symbol of Nazis,

117
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.160
but it's a symbol of white supremacy because that's not what it was. Right.

118
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:50.750
And so he dared logically argue this people were very,

119
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:53.510
very upset. His actually he was defending, yes,

120
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.970
he's defending white nationalists. I keep saying no, no, no,

121
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:58.070
there's a cartoon frog guys.

122
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.460
And it's not only that it's a cartoon frog written by a guy who specifically

123
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:04.940
sued people to get them to stop using the cartoon flag.

124
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.970
Even Alex Jones had to pay out a lawsuit because info wars used an

125
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:13.190
image of that cartoon flat. Can you see if that's true?

126
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.670
I'm pretty sure that's true. I put it, it was a nominal amount.

127
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.820
It was like lost in corporate. I was like a very small,

128
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.150
$15,000 to pay for Alex. That's not a lot of money settlement. It's a setup.

129
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.260
So I'm sure he paid way more in legal fees, right.

130
00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:30.260
To deal with something like that.

131
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:34.190
I'm sure if they had to put together some sort of a defense for $15,000,

132
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:36.080
I'm sure that probably costs a shitload of money.

133
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.220
But the point is that this frog has like all these different meanings.

134
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.820
So as soon as it gets connected though, to an awful thing,

135
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.790
then immediately like you got to go, oh, okay,

136
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:50.630
well you can never use that frog again right now. The frog's corrupted now,

137
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.750
given what we know and here's where it gets really weird.

138
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.670
Given what we know about the internet and specifically foreign

139
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.750
influence on memes like Russia,

140
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.270
there was factories that were making funny means about Hillary

141
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:08.960
Clinton, right?

142
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.790
Funny memes about all kinds of things and doing so in order to get

143
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:18.740
people upset or to laugh or to mock mock certain ideas

144
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.580
and, and push the narrative one way or another through humor.

145
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:25.640
And they made some really funny ones. There's a woman named Renee de Resta.

146
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:28.190
She came on the podcast was explaining for a project.

147
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:30.890
She had to go through hundreds of thousands of these things. She's like,

148
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:32.000
some of them were really funny.

149
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.210
And these were ones that they know are made by Russians, right?

150
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:39.500
To try to get people upset about certain things. She, how many of those Pepe,

151
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:44.420
the frog things came from, came from that. How many? Because if you,

152
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:49.370
if you had a frog that was mocking everybody and the frog like

153
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.000
was a really good symbol to make someone think that you're a fool.

154
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.130
So like you say something ridiculous and you're trying to push for something.

155
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.700
Right. And then that frog is in a meme with you, what you're saying,

156
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:02.790
but he looks like an idiot. All of a sudden you look like an idiot, right.

157
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.030
And the frog's mocking you like, you can't beat the frog. Right.

158
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.960
But you can turn the frog into a Nazi. Right.

159
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.330
So then when you turn the frog into the Nazi,

160
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:11.700
anybody uses the frog is now a Nazi.

161
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.100
<v 0>So he got caught up in this.</v>

162
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.080
<v 1>Yeah. He took a photo with these guys and he's talked about Pepe, the frog. Um,</v>

163
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.130
on my podcast, I talked about explained the whole thing to me,

164
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.443
depth.

165
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.820
And yet I've seen articles connecting him to white nationalists because

166
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:32.400
there's a photo of him with the frog. Geez.

167
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.210
<v 0>Louise pull up.</v>

168
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.030
<v 1>Photo of Jordan Peterson with Pepe, the frog,</v>

169
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.990
because he took a photo with these guys where they had like a, a frog flag.

170
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.180
And he thought it, as what we're saying is these guys that are taking the.

171
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.040
<v 0>It's like a flat Stanley or something. Right. It's thinking innocent.</v>

172
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.470
<v 1>Man's internet version of flat Stanley. And it's primarily a four Chan thing.</v>

173
00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.210
Right? Jamie knows this more than I honestly, there he is. So see,

174
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.790
he's standing there with these guys.

175
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.020
Those two fellows are holding up this Pepe, the frog flag,

176
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.380
Jordan's laughing and smiling with them. And one of them has a,

177
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.530
I think it's a make America great. Again, hat on, look,

178
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.230
these kids are human trolls.

179
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.810
They're alive troll on the internet.

180
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.580
And then think of one that thinks it's hilarious to be out there in public

181
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:27.030
trolling with Pepe, the frog flag and a make America great again, hat,

182
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.740
oh my God, he's with people, right? This is what this is. This is obviously,

183
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:34.740
it's a lot of what internet culture trapped. He,

184
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.820
Jordan understands this and talks about it and discusses it in length and he

185
00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:40.350
makes it make sense. Right?

186
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.410
So that's one other reason why people were upset at him.

187
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.540
And it's just very easy to label people in certain ways today.

188
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:51.750
It's very easy to label someone as a misogynist, right?

189
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.630
<v 0>No, I know. But if you listen to the breadth of his work,</v>

190
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.260
this is not a bad person. He's a very good person, very enlightening.

191
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.700
Like there's a lot of like real practical ways to,

192
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.790
you know, as he says, clean up your room and live, right.

193
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.510
<v 1>It's a personal friend of mine. I like him very much.</v>

194
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.790
<v 0>Asleep. You, you, you, you, uh, how do you, how do you say you, you,</v>

195
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.590
you think about these things you're trying to, you're trying to,

196
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.420
to, you know, when you're trying to.

197
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.610
<v 1>Well, conversation,</v>

198
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.600
it shows how actually articulate he is because you can't come up with things

199
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:28.830
that he would say. That makes sense.

200
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.450
<v 0>I know it's hard, right? There's no catch phrase for him. Yeah.</v>

201
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.720
We'll obviously clean up your room,

202
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.590
clean up your room. Let's see.

203
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:45.180
<v 1>A lot of great advice. And he's also a very, very insightful person.</v>

204
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.090
What about all of his, on a bad guy at all?

205
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.720
Now this people have this horrible thing that they do today, where,

206
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.660
and when they want to dismiss someone, instead of, instead of listening to them,

207
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:56.080
it's,

208
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.730
they're listening to them and debating the points that they have or analyzing

209
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:03.700
them in a, an objective kind way. They try to attack.

210
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:06.700
Everybody's attacking every, everything sucks. Everybody sucks.

211
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:09.130
Everybody's stupid. Everybody's racist. Everybody's dumb.

212
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.930
Everybody's ridiculous. Everybody's a liar, everybody. Everybody's, you're not.

213
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.880
<v 0>On my team. You're on someone else's team.</v>

214
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.800
<v 1>There's just so much of that today.</v>

215
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.380
<v 0>Yeah. I really enjoy listening to them. I enjoy all those, um, those biblical,</v>

216
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.960
uh, speeches that he gives about trying to interpret the old Testament and stuff

217
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:32.620
like that. It's uh, it's, it's very, very interesting. It's very,

218
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.010
I've never heard somebody connect our practical,

219
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.850
trying to find our way through the woods to those writings.

220
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.540
Like you always just heard of it as growing up as a Catholic kid,

221
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.690
you can just kind of heard them as like their stories. And they're obviously,

222
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.740
you know, their metaphors and whatever, but I never heard somebody really say,

223
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.860
no, it's B it's how you treat your father.

224
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:57.520
And now the way you're trying to figure out your way through life,

225
00:12:57.521 --> 00:13:00.310
that's what these things mean. Like, you know, he is a,

226
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.410
it's a very fascinating listen.

227
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:06.460
<v 1>Yeah. He's got a very unusual way of, um,</v>

228
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:11.890
interpreting biblical verses and stories from the Bible stories from other

229
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.030
religions as well, where he's

230
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.670
explained like what and how it sort of interfaces with man's search for meaning,

231
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:19.653
right?

232
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.830
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. It's like, like a practical way to kind of,</v>

233
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.180
you know, approach the world to,

234
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.130
to in a time when we have nothing to hang on to.

235
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.440
It's kind of interesting stuff to think about.
