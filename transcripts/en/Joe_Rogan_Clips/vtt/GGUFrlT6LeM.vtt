WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>Teeing off on him. Just a moment ago. Yeah. Dude who won? Who won 2018 Olympia.</v>

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.950
<v 1>Oh, well he's not, he's not flex Wheeler at all. It's giant thighs,</v>

3
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.890
but to sized there, dude,

4
00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:16.970
his apps are black. He looks like weird. Yeah. They look like.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.250
<v 0>Insects. How come that's okay. But blackface isn't.</v>

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.430
<v 1>Well, I think it goes black. Joe. What? Yeah. He's black. Everybody does that.</v>

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.840
All. You got to do that too.

8
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.440
<v 0>I know. They'll do that. You know? Oh my God. Look at that. Wait a minute.</v>

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.860
Is he black? Well, if he's black, why did he look so whiter in that photo?

10
00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:35.390
When he was doing most muscular?

11
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.820
<v 1>I don't know who was.</v>

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.820
<v 0>Closing on that gentlemen through upper left-hand corner.</v>

13
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.900
Upper left-hand corner.

14
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:45.380
Like you had before the image in the upper left hand corner keeps rolling up.

15
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.670
<v 1>All the way up. That one. Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.600
He might be African-American but he kinda Tino.

17
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.000
We should probably pay attention. What do you think he is? Jamie?

18
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.160
<v 2>What is his national DACA? I'm not talking about that guy.</v>

19
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.820
<v 0>That's the same guy. The guy with the black abs. No, that's not him. Is it? Yes.</v>

20
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.320
Oh, he's that's what I'm saying black, right? Or if he is, he's very light.

21
00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:10.070
But what I'm saying is they are allowed to wear that stuff that makes your skin

22
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:12.400
look dark so you can see the muscles better,

23
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.380
but they get to a point where it's literally it's black face.

24
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.550
It's black body also face this from Egypt. Okay.

25
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.210
So he's Northern Africa, but he's much lighter,

26
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.190
more images, more.

27
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.690
<v 1>Maha, Maha.</v>

28
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.130
<v 0>It doesn't make sense. It's going to pass. If that one of them has an accurate,</v>

29
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:32.870
the one that most muscular that you just put up.

30
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.100
If that's an accurate skin tone car, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

31
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.250
God is huge. Aw. What?

32
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:43.250
That one picture where you see his whole body that isn't even look like a real.

33
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.960
<v 1>Person. He is an to that adoption dude. That, that dude,</v>

34
00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:51.980
how mad are people that we're talking about? that look like science. Oh,

35
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.430
Koreans with a straight left. She won the thing. This dude from Egypt.

36
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.890
<v 3>Debbie, Pete, Phil heat bomber. He's a beast man. And you know,</v>

37
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.120
this.

38
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.620
<v 1>This beautiful spiritual position.</v>

39
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.160
<v 0>Oh, look a double tap on the face. But Kai green.</v>

40
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.850
<v 1>Just stopped doing the Olympic because it was uh, like rigged. So he was like,</v>

41
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.660
this dude. Yeah. He'd be a good guy. Get on the podcast.

42
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.180
<v 0>Dig his rig. Uh, he had Jesus. God</v>

43
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.060
big Ramey. ZDC you say his name? Ramey. I think. Sorry. What is his full name?

44
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.160
We should be. I tried pronouncing. Cause.

45
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.900
<v 1>That's possible. Let me go back to it.</v>

46
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.300
You're much better at names than me Monday.

47
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.480
<v 0>I don't want to this up. Mama do ELLs. BA no mama.</v>

48
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.010
Let's listen to someone. Say it [inaudible].

49
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.490
<v 1>I don't want to it up, man. Sounds so authentic though. I feel like.</v>

50
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.790
<v 0>5, 10, 310 pounds contest weight.</v>

51
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.290
<v 1>Five, 10. Yes. Come on son.</v>

52
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.940
That's a thick dude.

53
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.300
<v 0>Especially type of girl, white guys like regular white guys.</v>

54
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.960
Who's the white guy. The big guy Gunther him.

55
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.160
He would compete with Ronnie Coleman. Those guys. No, his name was Gunther.

56
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:10.540
He was a giant Swede.

57
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.800
<v 1>Like colossal for max man. You'd go chocolate.</v>

58
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.130
<v 0>Face. Do they get chocolate? But you can't. Jay Cutler went chocolate.</v>

59
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.020
Jay girls show 10 girls do it too. And we just accepted. Yay.

60
00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:25.210
It's full chocolate body. It's full chocolate body and chocolate phase.

61
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.840
It's like, as long as you go full chocolate, they don't give a,

62
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.921
but you have to go everywhere.

63
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:33.700
You can have like one side chocolate and one side now have face trying to win or

64
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:37.300
not. Well, not only that, it's not legal. You have to pretend you're one color.

65
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.690
Either accept the fact that you were in chocolate, body and chocolate face.

66
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:40.930
What.

67
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.990
<v 2>Is that? That's not real. Is that real? Just as bodybuilder.</v>

68
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.950
<v 0>He will not leave my face mistakes. I think that might be real. If he went,</v>

69
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:52.600
leave my face, bro. Yeah, dude, he went chocolate body. He was,

70
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.330
he was a really progressive bodybuilder and he couldn't go black face.

71
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.080
So he went though in it, go back to that picture. He went chocolate body,

72
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.450
but his face didn't touch it. You can't give him that much. Did a little shake.

73
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:05.260
Give him a.

74
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.630
<v 1>He pretended he rolled around in there. Can't give him a metal bro.</v>

75
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.790
Yeah, man. He's going to win because he went.

76
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.430
<v 0>Only chocolate body, which is totally socially acceptable.</v>

77
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.200
He totally didn't go chocolate face.

78
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.000
<v 2>Hmm. Chocolate body. Look at this. They're literally spray tanning.</v>

79
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.070
<v 0>Exactly what they're turning that guy. Black go back home ma.</v>

80
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.460
But he keeps the face. Is this real? That's before he went out,

81
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.330
before he went out, this is like,

82
00:04:33.331 --> 00:04:37.770
he's like you are not taking a picture of me with black face on the show.

83
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:40.500
How ridiculous. Let's just call it chocolate face. Let's all call. Okay.

84
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.960
What's going on guys. Get shocked to those face.

85
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.640
<v 2>Pure chocolate. I mean I know he does.</v>

86
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.910
That'd be racist and I'm not saying there was no intent there to be racist.

87
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.800
Imagine, imagine.

88
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.430
<v 0>If from this conversation, what the is that guy doing? That's bronze.</v>

89
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.260
He's gets his body bronze up to, up to the neck and then he leaves it alone.

90
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.670
What has happened right.

91
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.980
<v 1>Before I went at him. Wow. Okay.</v>

92
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.810
<v 0>Imagine, just imagine if, because of this conversation we put boom,</v>

93
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.240
we bring awareness to chocolate face,

94
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.710
which is essentially a socially acceptable version of blackface.

95
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.390
We're basically telling.

96
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.990
<v 2>You this guy, you need to go to jail, sir.</v>

97
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.710
[inaudible] sir, look at the guy now.

98
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.630
<v 0>Listen, but even forget all that, you don't look better when you do that,</v>

99
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.210
you just look insane. Like.

100
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.860
<v 2>You, you have a black man skin color and you have blonde spiky hair.</v>

101
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.300
This is insanity. What am I looking at? This one, dude,

102
00:05:48.301 --> 00:05:52.320
I'm looking at a puzzle. I'm like, what is that? A hot mess? I'm like,

103
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:55.680
what is that puzzle? Oh. Yeah. Here with a nice head kick.

104
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.170
Maybe we should pay attention. This.

105
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.180
<v 0>Awesome fight through that white guy like skewed.</v>

106
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.470
<v 2>Chocolate body. Same guy. No, no, no. But like that's.</v>

107
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.900
<v 1>That's one guy dolled up and the other just natural.</v>

108
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.840
<v 0>They listen, man. I get it. Black eyes look better.</v>

109
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.680
You're just going to have to deal with you. See the muscle fiber. I agree.

110
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.370
Just be white body.

111
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.070
<v 2>[Inaudible] say this. No.</v>

112
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.270
<v 0>I'm sure. I think we might be the first to call it chocolate body.</v>

113
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.620
And I think that is going to stick.

114
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.110
<v 2>Oh, powerful spending over by.</v>

115
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.110
<v 0>Looking at it. Yeah. You're looking for the sweet,</v>

116
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.780
but thinking about fighters tan, they get, they.

117
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.260
<v 1>Try to get real tan toss.</v>

118
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.570
<v 0>Yeah, they do fighters get tan, but George St Pierre did, but you know,</v>

119
00:06:49.571 --> 00:06:52.570
there's a, there's actually got yellow. It was actually, there's a,

120
00:06:52.571 --> 00:06:55.870
there's an actual benefit, like in terms of your performance,

121
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.920
the increase vitamin D from getting tan, like, um,

122
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.990
I think Steve Maxwell told me about this,

123
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.340
that they did some studies look at this last position. Boys scrapped. Yeah.

124
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.050
I believe Steve Maxwell told me that there's a there's physical benefits

125
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.370
to uh, getting tan being out in the sun. Yeah. Well,

126
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:20.170
not just that while your tan and your body's jacked up on vitamin

127
00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:22.480
D from the exposure to the sun,

128
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.740
even I think probably not as good, but better than nothing.

129
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:31.090
Exposure to a tanning bed. That makes sense. It actually can benefit you. It's.

130
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.640
<v 1>Really crazy that your body makes a vitamin.</v>

131
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.060
I know it's the only way you suck in sunrise. Well, there's.

132
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.170
<v 0>Other ways to get it dietarily,</v>

133
00:07:38.171 --> 00:07:41.290
but most of the way you get it staring at the sun.

134
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.900
<v 1>Or being in the sun, it is crazy. Crazy. How bizarre is that?</v>

135
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.860
God, I wish one of these two went chocolate body. Yeah.

136
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.250
<v 0>Imagine if a guy fought, you know, see chocolate body and he's like, bro,</v>

137
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.180
I got to get contracts. I want to look ripped. You know, you can't say anything.

138
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.050
I see how guys who are fortunate enough to have more melanin in their skin.

139
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.450
They look better. They get more contracts. It's true.

140
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.700
He can't hold that back from me.

141
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.180
Like you remember when chocolate Dell used to paint his toenails,

142
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.750
then everybody wanted to paint their toenails.

143
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.000
<v 1>Black. Yeah. I'm talking about black.</v>

144
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.660
<v 0>Toes. Yup.</v>

145
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.340
All we need is one dude to go chocolate body and

146
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:20.800
everybody goes nuts and he gets a big endorsement contract.

147
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.210
We need Rodriguez with the beautiful kicks,

148
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.220
but don't give a.

149
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.000
<v 1>About your kicks. He's such a little monster.</v>

150
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.660
Good defense there by area. But your Koreans. Oh.

151
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.790
<v 0>Try it again. Try it again. But at the very least it's allowing him to escape.</v>

152
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.260
Oh, step in elbow. Look at that. A creative dude clip though.

153
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.390
Temple that right hand without the zombie dude.

154
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.590
He like your flashy and just come forward. Well, in a lot of ways,

155
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:53.500
this is a real good test for him after the Frankie fight. Right.

156
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.190
You test for both of them. Right? What's the matter

157
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.670
logo fighters. Definitely can't do typed in fake tan UFC fighter.

158
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.200
Oh Sam Alvey.

159
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.180
<v 3>Did he do that? 2015. Wow. You know the UFC.</v>

160
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.110
<v 0>Had to make in a policy about putting those, uh,</v>

161
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.250
fake tattoos on your back that said like, uh, you know, casino,

162
00:09:16.251 --> 00:09:19.190
something.com or box or donut. Yeah.

163
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.500
I think Bernard Hopkins was the first guy to do that.

164
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.560
There's some guys who did that. Yeah. UFC can't do that. You can't get tattoos.

165
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.770
<v 1>You know it's in your contract. No tattoos of logos. Ah.</v>

166
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.370
<v 0>Interesting. Last went to the air it on television. No basketball too.</v>

167
00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:31.870
Like Jared.

168
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:32.451
<v 1>Smith got like,</v>

169
00:09:32.451 --> 00:09:36.760
I think a Supreme tattoo and that day he had to cover it up a large one.

170
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:37.160
It's not.

171
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.640
<v 0>A big Supreme debt. Unless you have ownership in that business.</v>

172
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.660
<v 1>Don't do that. Yeah. What is that about? I don't know. He has so many tattoos.</v>

173
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.870
It's probably like, it. He's like, come on, give me free.

174
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.130
That's what he's doing.

175
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.240
<v 0>Is that what it is? Wow.</v>

176
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.640
It's got it right off the back of looking pretty sick though.

177
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.130
<v 2>Oh, look at that.</v>

178
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.260
<v 0>Yeah. You're spinning elbow. That was nasty.</v>

179
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.580
<v 1>Did you see that replay?</v>

180
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.090
We should pay attention to as far we've been talking about chocolate bodies.

181
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.370
<v 0>Yeah. I think we have a point though. Dude.</v>

182
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.430
<v 1>I feel like we're the first ones really call it out. Yeah.</v>

183
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.570
I've never heard of it before Jamie. I don't know.

184
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.320
<v 3>There's probably a reason why there was a bunch of them tagged together on a</v>

185
00:10:15.321 --> 00:10:16.040
website. I'm.

186
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.440
<v 0>Sure. True. I just think it's hilarious.</v>

187
00:10:18.441 --> 00:10:21.350
When you see the dudes who don't have chocolate face chocolate body.

188
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.750
That's so weird looking. It's just the faces just it's a normal color,

189
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.870
but I get it. I get it. It does make you look more defined.

190
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.410
<v 1>Yeah, it does. When you're tan, you definitely look more shredded. Right?</v>

191
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.430
<v 0>Oh. You're here. But the thing about it is like tanning.</v>

192
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.270
There's not really good for you, right? Like get that dark. Not all the time.

193
00:10:41.271 --> 00:10:42.710
Right? If you got that dark.

194
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.250
<v 1>I can't do it. That's why they have to spray paint. Um,</v>

195
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.850
and also I would think that I wouldn't be mad if Korean zombie had somewhat of a

196
00:10:49.851 --> 00:10:53.720
tan, but whatever. Oh, how dare you? That's what it looks like, bro.

197
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.400
So we're Korean going for the sand. Matches it up, dude. He does.

198
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.910
<v 0>Good head movement too. He looks, he looks good. Standing up, dude.</v>

199
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.460
<v 1>How, how fun of a fight would have been for beat versus CIA?</v>

200
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.370
That's a mother fight. Yeah. That would've been a really good fight.

201
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.150
I don't like that fight for as a B or a [inaudible]. Oh man. Nice.

202
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.170
<v 0>Right-hand by the current zombie. Well, uh, I like it for,</v>

203
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:19.010
to see entertainment wise. Oh I can just see. I want to see what's up. You know,

204
00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:20.930
it's like a lot of people thought that uh,

205
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.950
Mike Perry had it all day for cowboy and cowboy just showed everybody what was

206
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.460
up tonight. That's what's interesting. Right?

207
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.800
<v 1>You, you know, for a long time we know what cowboy brings.</v>

208
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.470
We don't know what Mike Perry brings. We don't know what yeah.

209
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.300
You're or ZigBee bring.

210
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.670
<v 0>We don't totally know what they bring the flyer tested.</v>

211
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.930
Yeah. Yeah. We've seen ye are tested against Frankie. Frankie.

212
00:11:44.931 --> 00:11:48.080
Edgar just destroyed. There was even a test that we test.

213
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.520
What is this? What's going on with the left picture? Yeah.

214
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.770
<v 3>I can't put that on YouTube, but what is that left.</v>

215
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.520
<v 0>Picture? Is that a guy or a girl? What's a woman. How come she's never shirt on.</v>

216
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.980
She allowed to, this was an.

217
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.490
<v 3>Art,</v>

218
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:07.320
an artist photographer or a photographer did like a series of photos on

219
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.330
the subject. So.

220
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:13.710
<v 0>What's a transgender. No, no, no. Son of a. How dare you?</v>

221
00:12:13.711 --> 00:12:17.490
That's a transgender woman on the left. No, no, no. That's a woman. Who's um,

222
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.100
how should we put this?

223
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.260
<v 4>A lot of muscle today.</v>

224
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.230
<v 2>That was not a woman in the.</v>

225
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.110
<v 0>Like that. This is a woman plant. No, it's a woman.</v>

226
00:12:28.111 --> 00:12:32.370
That's hooked up the or implants. Right. But my point is like,

227
00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:36.720
that looks like, like her body in her proportions.

228
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.510
<v 1>Look like that's a man, baby, like.</v>

229
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.540
<v 2>Like a different kind of thing, dude. If they.</v>

230
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.500
<v 0>Came up to you as a lady boy and tell him like, bro, the outta here do better.</v>

231
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.190
But this is what I'm thinking. She looks like she can.

232
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.760
<v 1>Be piecing them up. Is she, is he, oh, dad's going after him. Yeah. She.</v>

233
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.040
<v 0>Looks like she could be like, uh,</v>

234
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.080
a type of human that evolved on a nearby star. She looks like Steve Nash with.

235
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.830
Am I right? Like good type of human that evolved at a nearby galaxy.

236
00:13:07.831 --> 00:13:08.760
That's super similar.

237
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.940
<v 1>To us. Oh no bro. Hopefully not. Well.</v>

238
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.300
<v 0>The, the implant or if that wasn't an implant,</v>

239
00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:18.720
if that's just what the breast look like, just super muscular on top.

240
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.930
Just like a guy super jacked. It looks like a rugby player.

241
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.170
And then he gets to the and he's this weird sort of um,

242
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.800
bulbous bags, maybe they're horns.

243
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.660
<v 1>Or something or they're hard.</v>

244
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.480
<v 0>Rocks that they use for chess, bang and battle.</v>

245
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.970
<v 1>God, I that's a tough.</v>

246
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.880
<v 0>Co-project but that's not a classic female physique.</v>

247
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.440
<v 1>That's what I like the nails though.</v>

248
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.560
<v 0>Long white nails are strong touch. Go back to that. Jamie,</v>

249
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.020
if there was any nail whatsoever about the feminine entity. Yeah.

250
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:49.883
Leave them nails.

251
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.620
<v 1>Powerful. That's a man.</v>

252
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.173
<v 0>Demon hands</v>

253
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.310
[inaudible] full of veins and thick looked like they'd been just lifting heavy

254
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.950
for years. Jerking off dude.

255
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.000
<v 5>Boom, boom. Yeah. But.</v>

256
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.240
<v 0>Hey man, if that's how she wants to look, I don't give a. Do your thing, girl.</v>

257
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:13.880
People that love to get jacked. They love to just be preposterous.

258
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.570
Oh that lady total chocolate face. How dare you do.

259
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.290
<v 2>That? Chocolate face. She's dark.</v>

260
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.510
<v 0>Chocolate face. You need a new chocolate chip.</v>

261
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.820
<v 2>Full Coco. She looks.</v>

262
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.700
<v 0>Dude. If she was on the Megan Kelly show,</v>

263
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.890
if she walked out in the background started posing. Right?

264
00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:33.600
When Megan was talking about black face.

265
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.800
<v 2>It's the whole world. Oh wait, wait, wait.</v>

266
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.820
That's okay. Hold on. He telling me his. Okay.

267
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.520
It's okay, bro. It's a fitness car Olympia next week.

268
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.410
I'm just showing you how ripped my face is.

269
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.850
[inaudible] yeah. My face is shredded as son, dude.

270
00:15:03.851 --> 00:15:08.380
I'm trying to show off my muscles right here. I guess I chew gum all day, bro.

271
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.250
When I want to stop, I don't want my cheeks right here is wrapped.

272
00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:17.080
This makes zero sense. Blank faces. Chocolate faces ripped fro.

273
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.320
Oh bro. Getting that face.

274
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.680
<v 5>Oh, Hey fella. You can't.</v>

275
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.250
<v 2>Do that. There's an Aboriginal do that.</v>

276
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.170
Pave and someone has to translate the white man's language to them. dude.

277
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.110
That is, you got a guy. Why are we giving white people a pass on?

278
00:15:35.111 --> 00:15:37.990
This are looking for gold. That's exactly.

279
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.620
<v 0>What's up bro? Oh, how dare you, sir.</v>

280
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.930
How many people want to wear a black face?

281
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.550
Cause they're super racist and they can't.

282
00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:51.850
So body builders does that happen today?

283
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.300
<v 2>I'm not saying it happens a lot, but it's a few.</v>

284
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.980
Has it happened once as one guy? Just a bodybuilder bro,

285
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.850

288
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.200
That guy, it looks like somebody sprayed.

289
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.380
<v 0>Ank on him, dude. You know how hard that is to get off,</v>

290
00:16:29.381 --> 00:16:34.120
to do these competitions. That guy looks like here's this. They fell in an oil.

291
00:16:34.121 --> 00:16:37.990
Well, you know, unhealthy those people are you're the catalyst.

292
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.890
It looks like you fell.

293
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:42.580
<v 2>In oil. He liked, they pulled him out of an oil. Well, I got, I was in there.</v>

294
00:16:42.581 --> 00:16:44.470
I had a, of you, the kid, he went under,

295
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.970
he went under and saved somebody and he's a hero.

296
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.540
<v 0>You don't have to be black would say, whoa.</v>

297
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.890
<v 1>That guy might be black. Thanks. So how do you know Jamie? Don't get racist.</v>

298
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.930
<v 6>On this. Jamie Jesus.</v>

299
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.470
<v 0>Isn't that funny that you can get that would make you racist.</v>

300
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.550
Like if you thought that one of these guys in chocolate face and chocolate skin

301
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.280
and chocolate body, if you thought one of those guys wasn't doing it.
