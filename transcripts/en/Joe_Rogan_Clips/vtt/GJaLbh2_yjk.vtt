WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.880
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. You know, and, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.200
that's why I'm only coaching a few now too, is we gotta, we,

3
00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:10.680
we gotta be in this together and you gotta trust me. And I got,

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.720
I gotta be there for you. And if you trust me,

5
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.280
then every decision that I make for you, you've gotta trust whether it's, Hey,

6
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:20.200
don't take this fight. I mean, with the fight, the last fight, I was like, no,

7
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:22.790
you're not in a fight. And he's like, come on, coach. What, what fight is that?

8
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:25.470
This is the Tony fight. When he first got offered for the first time.

9
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.510
And I was like, no, we were at spar session and HES, like, why not?

10
00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:32.070
And I'm like, cuz you said you'd never take a short notice fight. I'm like, no.

11
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.530
Yeah.

12
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.030
<v 1>And then he, he was like 11 days. Right?</v>

13
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.270
<v 0>Crazy. And he, but we've, betrayd hard.</v>

14
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:38.590
Like all then he hit me with all these points and he's like, dude,

15
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:42.980
with the coronavirus going on, who cares? He's like, let me get in there.

16
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.260
I need to fight someone right now. I need to release all this.

17
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.420
And his little basic points. I looked at him. I said, all right, is it good?

18
00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:51.540
Are you gonna do it again? Are you gonna stick to your goal on the next one?

19
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.900
Cuz I, I might let you off on this one. And he said,

20
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.620
I will never take a short notice fight.

21
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.700
That's why the second time it was offered, he was even more about it.

22
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.730
And I was just look, he was like deal. It was seven days out.

23
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:04.970
Like I got nothing to lose, you know, I'll go out of my shield.

24
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.490
<v 1>So this was the let's let's be clear for everybody. Yeah. The,</v>

25
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:11.890
the first time was the, the LAORA California one, the Tai Chi palace. Yeah.

26
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:14.650
18th. Yep. April 18th. And that was how many days out.

27
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.370
<v 2>So I got the call, I think, I think it was 10 or something like that. No,</v>

28
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.360
I think it was, uh, it was like days before that fight.

29
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.920
I got the call one night. The next day I went, you know, I called him.

30
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.600
He said no, that night went to sparring the next day.

31
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:31.920
And then that's when I talked, you know, not talked him into it, but I,

32
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.080
I did like seven hard rounds. Uh, I felt great. You know,

33
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:39.760
I had been sparring so much. And so he was like, um, I was like, let's do it.

34
00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:42.000
You know, I talked him into it and then so we,

35
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.590
we go hard and then I think it was, when did they cancel?

36
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.070
I think it was 10 days before the fight they canceled it.

37
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:52.630
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that's when you know it went out the window and then,

38
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.070
um, they called, so did you, did.

39
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.990
<v 1>You fall right outta camp or did you, so I.</v>

40
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.430
<v 2>Tried, I was down to 1 68.</v>

41
00:01:57.431 --> 00:02:01.750
They called me at like 3:00 PM and that night I went to sleep at like

42
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.580
180 2. I went hard. I went, I, you know, just terrible choices.

43
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.580
I was like, what'd you eat?

44
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.413
<v 1>What'd you eat?</v>

45
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.980
<v 2>You go to, I went straight to a, it's called McGill's world of ice cream. I got,</v>

46
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.100
you know, double scoop with a WAFF of cone. And then we ate, uh,

47
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.300
pizza hu for breakfast. The next morning we had pancakes in my,

48
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:22.660
I had my cousin Quito there with me. He was helping me, uh, you know,

49
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:26.170
helping with my cookies and helping me around the house, uh, during that,

50
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.250
those hard, you know, 20 days and yeah, we went hard. Did you?

51
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.770
And then three days later they called me and they're like, you know,

52
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:37.450
it's May 9th. And I was like, that. I was like, I don't take short,

53
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.170
short notice fights. I was like, this last one was, you know,

54
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.320
10 days I get the benefit of the doubt of it being a late, late notice. Right.

55
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.680
And now they want me to do May 9th. You know that,

56
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.120
that goes out the window that you know me, that's not now.

57
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:53.560
It's not really a late replacement fight. It is, but it is for me.

58
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:55.640
And it is in general. But you know, the,

59
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.720
the general public would think, you know, this is,

60
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.080
he got a full camp and this is a real fight, blah, blah, blah. So I was like,

61
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.520
no, like I'm not doing it. So.

62
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.720
<v 1>You, well, let me get this straight.</v>

63
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.480
So you're not doing it because you fell outta camp and started eating again.

64
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.503
Because.

65
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.920
<v 2>Because so the, the, the 20 day notice was like something very special.</v>

66
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.910
Like that was something I definitely could have formed and I would've performed.

67
00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:21.910
And I think this is the April 18th five. This is April 18th.

68
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.470
I think I would've performed. Uh, and I think I would've won.

69
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.990
I wouldn't have been as C confidence. I was,

70
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.750
I was terrified when they called me that night.

71
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.070
I was terrified I couldn't sleep the next day. I woke up terrified. Um,

72
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:35.470
cause I knew, I knew that this is not what I do. This is not how I do it.

73
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:36.304
This is, but.

74
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.230
<v 1>Because you weren't fully prepared because.</v>

75
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.700
<v 2>There's no way to fully prepare in that amount of time. Right. My mind, my mind,</v>

76
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.500
what I go in there and do I have to get my mind in a very, very special place?

77
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.780
How.

78
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.540
<v 1>Much of it is that? And how much of it is physical?</v>

79
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.980
<v 2>You know, like physically I don't, I don't, I don't have that question.</v>

80
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.060
I don't answer that question. I can't answer that question for you,

81
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.620
but here's question, I don't process that,

82
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.340
but it's not something I ever processed. This.

83
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.810
<v 1>What I'm saying in this way. What, how physically prepared were you?</v>

84
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:02.644
Were you in training?

85
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.530
<v 2>Yeah, so I was just, um, I, I was my main,</v>

86
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.090
I was the main training partner for Neo Magney. Oh, okay.

87
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:12.650
Often Hubbard when they fought in Vegas. Oh. Um, I was, I was in shape.

88
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.130
I was in shape. Um.

89
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.530
<v 0>So the second fight, let me jump in here.</v>

90
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.360
The second fight I thought was a way better way, better a,

91
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.520
a place to be from a conditioning standpoint,

92
00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:24.680
because he was already in shape prior to the first one,

93
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.640
we just went two weeks so hard. Like we were trying to get, get his body in,

94
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.600
in shape quick. And that's, that's a hard thing to do.

95
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.160
Then he went and gained 12 pounds, which,

96
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.280
and we were four weeks outta that point, which is perfect.

97
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.280
Cuz the fourth week out, I always pull back on and let the body recover.

98
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:41.390
Cuz you're third in your second we car our peak weeks.

99
00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:44.710
Those are the weeks that we need to really hit, hit, hit prime and,

100
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.830
and really push hard. And it was perfect fit. I'm like, dude,

101
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:50.910
we take this time off. You're going up and eating now,

102
00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:55.110
you you're ready to go again. You, you got that little, that little, uh, uh,

103
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.790
fire back in your body cuz you're able to eat whatever you want.

104
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.860
And I thought it was perfect timing from how I train my athletes from a

105
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:04.900
conditioning standpoint. And I actually had to talk him into that one.

106
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.260
I was like, this is even better. Like, this is perfect for you for a five round.

107
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.580
<v 1>So for your perspective, it was like he had a chance to recover,</v>

108
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.580
eat all that food. Take a little break. Yeah. And that's good.

109
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:17.020
Cuz your body gets to charge back up again and then grind back down. Cause six.

110
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.020
<v 0>And five on, on week six and week five are hard weeks. They're like a,</v>

111
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.810
a start to those, those, uh, last two weeks of peaking cuz our, our fight week,

112
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:28.850
we slow down a little bit and we just turn the engine on, turn it off. So we go,

113
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.410
uh, six and five on, on the weeks are really hard.

114
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:34.050
Then we pull back on week four. We'll take like three days at,

115
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:35.650
are really light and then push it a little bit.

116
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.970
And then week three and week two are the ones that I'm trying to get him to peak

117
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.720
get hit five rounds. We're not doing six rounds, not doing seven.

118
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.680
We're making sure that we can go five minutes hard for every round. Be sharp,

119
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.720
not get lazy. And I thought it fit perfect two weeks. So.

120
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.520
<v 1>When you're saying week two, you mean two weeks out? Two weeks.</v>

121
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.480
<v 0>Out. Yep. Yeah. Right before we leave for the fight, what.</v>

122
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.040
<v 1>Do you prefer? Like if you had a blueprint, like they, they came to you Trevor.</v>

123
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.600
How much time do you want before a fight will schedule it around your time.

124
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.280
<v 0>If you're in decent shape, eight weeks, eight weeks.</v>

125
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.280
If you're outta shape 12 weeks, 12 weeks, cuz you take three or four.

126
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.320
If you don't lift weights for a little bit and then you come back and lift

127
00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:13.400
weights and you ain't lift for six months or three months,

128
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.720
you're gonna get real sore. Yeah.

129
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.950
So you you've gotta have that break in process where your body cause your body's

130
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:20.830
gonna be shut down and you start to Ugh.

131
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.430
So you have to get through that process at just the pretraining and then you

132
00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:26.830
start to hit it hard because you can't just go and hit it hard.

133
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.350
If you're 12 weeks out, you just can't. Mm. Interesting breaks you down. Yeah.

134
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.550
<v 1>You're gonna get hurt. Yeah. So why did you feel that that was not a good fight.</v>

135
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.443
The main nine fight?

136
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.020
<v 2>I had no idea. I can, my body would respond as well as it didn't.</v>

137
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.860
I didn't think I could be ready. A hundred to a hundred percent, uh,

138
00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:47.180
without I've always done 12 weeks. That's my that's all I've known.

139
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:47.780
That's all I've.

140
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.861
<v 1>Ever made.</v>

141
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:51.220
So you felt like the first decision was just like a split decision is the middle

142
00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:53.220
of COVID 19. I'm gonna do it anyway.

143
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.500
And then when they came to you the second time, you're like, no, no, no, no, no.

144
00:06:55.501 --> 00:06:56.334
I, I want a real.

145
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.170
<v 2>Kid. Yeah. So why can't we just push it to, to May 26th? Right. You know,</v>

146
00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:00.810
gimme three extra weeks. Then I get my whole,

147
00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:04.650
then I get my whole eight to 10 weeks. Right. And that's all I asked for. Um,

148
00:07:04.651 --> 00:07:06.170
so that was my mindset when they called me.

149
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:08.250
Cause I knew they were gonna call me the day before I was like, watch,

150
00:07:08.251 --> 00:07:09.170
they're gonna call me.

151
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.930
And they don't want me to fight May 9th or something like that. And I,

152
00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:16.330
and I knew it. And then my manager called me, he's like, May 9th, let's go.

153
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.520
I was like, that. I was like, no, he was so mad. No, I was like, that.

154
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.320
I was like, I ain't no puppy. I'm not gonna dance. When they want me to dance.

155
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.120
I was like I said, I don't take labor replacement fights.

156
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:28.800
This is now a late replacement. You know, this is different circumstances.

157
00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:32.440
These aren't the circumstances, everyone. And even he was like, flabbergass,

158
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:35.640
he's like, what are you talking about? It's the same thing. I'm like, no,

159
00:07:35.641 --> 00:07:37.960
it's not the same thing. Like to me, it's not, you know, like,

160
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.190
because I don't know. I just confidence is everything I know I can perform,

161
00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:43.230
you know, I.

162
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.350
<v 1>But you wanted everything to be done. Right. It.</v>

163
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.430
<v 2>Was the biggest fight in my life. Right. You know, of course, you know, and,</v>

164
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.790
but ultimately, and then, and then when I thought about it, I was like,

165
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.950
it's only it's if it's anybody's fault, it's my fault. You know,

166
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.430
cuz I knew this, you know, I knew I was gonna fight again. And if I am not,

167
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.660
if I would wasn't I was training hard, but I wasn't training with the mindset,

168
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.660
you know, that I need to, I have old school wrestling mentality, you know, you,

169
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.100
you have to see the prize, you know, every single morning you wake up, you know,

170
00:08:09.101 --> 00:08:11.300
the guy, the guy that you're gonna fight, you know that wasn't there.

171
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:12.620
That wasn't there when I woke up in the morning.

172
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.180
So I didn't feel like I was preparing in the proper way.

173
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.890
So for something at the, at that was at this level.

174
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.850
<v 1>In my life. So you don't just need 10 weeks for your body.</v>

175
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.330
You want it for your mind as well.

176
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.370
<v 2>That's the most. Yeah. I mean that's the most important part to me.</v>

177
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.370
I've been training since I was four. My body is, my body is a machine. Um,

178
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.970
you know, I do, I, I didn't know. I can get ready in that amount of time.

179
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:39.690
That what that's, what it comes down to. I had no idea, um,

180
00:08:39.691 --> 00:08:42.720
because I I've never tried it mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, but I was in better.

181
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.440
I had done better between fights. Um, since,

182
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.560
since I fought cowboy than I had ever done between fights in, in the, in the,

183
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.600
in the fact that I was staying in shape running, um, you know,

184
00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:57.880
I had a chereadmill at my house. I was still sparring. I never, you know,

185
00:08:57.881 --> 00:09:00.200
I took like two months off sparring, three months off sparring.

186
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.400
But then I was sparring for three, four months before I got that call rage.

187
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.960
<v 0>And rage is hard to settle down. When someone hits rage,</v>

188
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:09.080
like someone says something about your mama, I'm always like,

189
00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:12.640
they don't even know your mama, like stop that. Like stop.

190
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.710
<v 1>Well, there was a great moment after the second round,</v>

191
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.870
after you got hit with that upper cut where you,

192
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.710
you came back to the corner and you told them, take something off your punches,

193
00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:24.150
take about 10% off. Just hit 'em with clean shots. Yeah.

194
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:27.390
You try trying to murder 'em with every shot and then you made that adjustment.

195
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:28.310
Yeah. And that that's,

196
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.430
that was really interesting because a lot of times coaches would tell stuff to

197
00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:34.430
fighters and the fighters probably know someone in their head,

198
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.180
but it's with them that they're starting to get tired.

199
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.100
It's with them that they got hit and then they lose some composure. Yeah.

200
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:43.740
They get emotional and they go out there and they wind up making mistakes.

201
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.940
You immediately adjusted and you went out there and you would see like,

202
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.300
by the end of that second round, when Tony hit you with that shot,

203
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.820
people were like, well maybe this is a shift in the, the direction of the fight.

204
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.370
Nope. The, the shift was the opposite way. You came out in the third round,

205
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.130
more technical and you came out and did exactly what Trevor said. Yeah. It's.

206
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.970
<v 2>Uh, we worked long and hard on, on that. Um,</v>

207
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.250
I trust him with, you know, with everything as he said, you know,

208
00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:10.830
we wouldn't be,

209
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.570
he wouldn't be my coach if I didn't trust him with my life and with, with what,

210
00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.370
everything I go in there to do.

211
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.520
<v 1>What the. So when he said that to you, when he said he take 10% off. Yeah.</v>

212
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:21.120
So I I'm.

213
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.280
<v 2>Trying, the crazy thing is,</v>

214
00:10:22.281 --> 00:10:26.560
is you only see 10% of the interaction between us right. In between rounds. Um,

215
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.720
I'm right now I'm actually with talking to, thefc trying to get that whole,

216
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.880
that whole thing. But um, yeah, it was, um, I trying.

217
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.680
<v 1>UFC trying to get what the recording. He's.</v>

218
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.550
<v 2>Trying to get his, his audio from his mic. Oh. Cause.</v>

219
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.070
<v 1>Um, you want to hear it and watch it. Yeah. Cause.</v>

220
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.470
<v 2>I don't remember it, you know? Right. Of Soest and just like, uh,</v>

221
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.150
when it come to me in the fifth round and I was laughing mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I

222
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:51.030
had just asked the reason I was laughing is, cause I had just asked him, I said,

223
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:53.590
was that the end of the second or third round &lt;laugh&gt; and they're like,

224
00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:56.430
this is a fifth round. I was like, no, it way. I'm in that good of shape.

225
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.820
I was like, no. Oh, away. And that's what that's when they cut in, you know?

226
00:10:59.821 --> 00:11:02.420
So you don't see, there's so much, you don't see, uh,

227
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.500
in that interaction between me and him and it's.

228
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.300
<v 1>So important for fighters to see that adjustment and how his endurance leveled</v>

229
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.460
off. Cuz it was like you, you were having these wild exchanges. Yeah.

230
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.460
And you were put, you were fuckinghitting Tony, first of all,

231
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.610
Tony Orin is made out of metal. It's it's crazy.

232
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.090
<v 0>It's crazy. Especially when you're talking about a, a body type,</v>

233
00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:25.530
like you were talking earlier about this, someone with a frail body type,

234
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:29.170
he doesn't have a, a chised neck, right? He's not Billy like mark. He is,

235
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.370
it's so unique to me. He's so tough. He's.

236
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.210
<v 1>So tough. It.</v>

237
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.570
<v 2>Makes me want, is it a choice to go to sleep or not like, but there's,</v>

238
00:11:34.571 --> 00:11:35.404
there's also.

239
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.760
<v 0>A key. Like if, if a fighter could take something on, on understanding,</v>

240
00:11:38.761 --> 00:11:41.280
coachability is like, you have to have your reactions,

241
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:44.360
but you also have to have your responses. Like reactive stuff is like,

242
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.800
like jabs, positional stuff is reactive.

243
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:49.680
Like you have to be able to react to positions. First. I love, uh,

244
00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:52.160
jujitsu because it's uh, it's positioned before submission.

245
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:55.840
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you have to react to, to positions before anything else.

246
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.760
So there's reactive stuff. But the response is,

247
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.960
is why you have a copi-pilot to help you see what you can see and start noticing

248
00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:04.300
that.

249
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.120
Or how are you playing defense and using a jab to find openings where you're

250
00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:11.520
still working, but you're thinking and going, oh, every time he does this,

251
00:12:11.521 --> 00:12:13.390
he's dropping his hand. Andre. You're able to see things.

252
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.230
That's where you have to be responsive.

253
00:12:15.231 --> 00:12:18.710
And you have to be aware in the moment where a lot of times people can't,

254
00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:19.350
they just bite down.

255
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.950
They just bite down on that MI down piece mm&lt;affirmative&gt; and very similar to

256
00:12:21.951 --> 00:12:25.070
the way you used to fight was bite down. Their eyes are getting big.

257
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.870
Oh that's my response is like, continue to do this. And uh,

258
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:30.510
they'rere gonna fall. And a again,

259
00:12:30.511 --> 00:12:35.380
that is a very important point is a coach and the athlete understanding I am

260
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:37.620
there to help you with your responses in the gym.

261
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.140
I'm gonna create your reactions. I'm gonna create your patterns,

262
00:12:40.141 --> 00:12:41.580
your basic fundamental patterns.

263
00:12:41.581 --> 00:12:45.740
That's gonna help you win positions and slightly win rounds where you're

264
00:12:45.741 --> 00:12:46.574
controlling the fight.

265
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.460
The other piece is how am I slowly creating momentum to get finishes?

266
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.210
<v 1>It was pretty stunning. How well you,</v>

267
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:59.130
you adapted and then also how your endurance leveled off. Like,

268
00:12:59.131 --> 00:12:59.830
so cuz you,

269
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.730
you did seem like you were slowing down a little bit at the second round,

270
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.250
but it was because you were sprinting because you were throwing these full power

271
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.050
haymakers. But then when you leveled off in that third round,

272
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:13.410
then it's like you had an endless gas tank and that's,

273
00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:14.440
that was interesting in control.

274
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.440
<v 0>Yourself. Yes. If you're making decisions, it's a lot easy on your psyche. Yeah.</v>

275
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.040
When you're trying to just fight out of things all the time, again,

276
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:23.240
you're not in control. If you can't control your thought,

277
00:13:23.241 --> 00:13:24.600
you cannot control your breathing.

278
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.320
<v 1>How stunned were you that Tony could take those shots.</v>

279
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.280
<v 2>In the fight? You know, I there's there's no, there's no point where I,</v>

280
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.480
where I even understand you. Weren't.

281
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.430
<v 1>Thinking at all, just throwing him. No, I, you know.</v>

282
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.950
<v 2>It was crazy. The shots I hit, you know, John or, um,</v>

283
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.790
Vic barbboza and one with, I was so surprised they went to sleep. Um,

284
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.870
you know, I just, I didn't understand why I think it was positioned mostly,

285
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.910
but yeah, I was when I was hitting him with some of those shots, um,

286
00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:57.060
especially the one when I came through and he was throwing an uppercut.

287
00:13:57.061 --> 00:13:58.820
I couldn't believe he, he didn't go to sleep with that,

288
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.860
but I go back to the Michael Johnson fight when he hit me with that left hand.

289
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.500
There's no reason I shouldn't have went to sleep then. Um, so I, I don't,

290
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:08.180
I haven't figured that part. Johnson has a very good.

291
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.020
<v 1>Left hand. See when he knocked out Poer with that same point,</v>

292
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.940
one of the sharpest left.

293
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.170
<v 2>Hand and I was turning through it and it was on the chin. It was everything.</v>

294
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.730
A knockout shot should be. I don't know why I didn't go to sleep. I,

295
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.530
I gotta figure that part out. I know how people go to sleep.

296
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.730
I don't know how people.

297
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.290
<v 1>Don't go to sleep. They don't go to sleep. Yeah. It's random. It's weird.</v>

298
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:25.771
I mean,

299
00:14:25.771 --> 00:14:29.010
sometimes guys take head kicks full on head kicks and they don't go to sleep.

300
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.570
It's.

301
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.210
<v 2>Positioned it's position. Everything is.</v>

302
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.050
<v 0>Position. Well, Hey, can you base, can you, can you lock down? See it?</v>

303
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.170
<v 2>Did you see it? That's.</v>

304
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.520
<v 0>That's can you base you huge piece?</v>

305
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:39.360
Because if you don't see a ya brace in for it, so you're letting it is again,

306
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.840
the linear or rotational is what's causing a concussion.

307
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.240
And when you don't see a shot, those are the ones that cause the most damage.

308
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.040
If you're able to BR brace for it and, and, and bite down on the punch,

309
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.400
it's a lot better. So a lot of times when you're seeing two hooks,

310
00:14:51.401 --> 00:14:53.600
both people hooking, I throw like this, I turn away.

311
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.240
And then all of a sudden I come and I don't see it.

312
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.000
I'm causing that head on collision, but I'm not braced for it.

313
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.520
I'm not leaning against the wall. Where if I see a hook coming, I've got my,

314
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.440
my head carrying my weight. Yeah. And able to take the shots.

315
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.360
So a lot of times it's the shots you don't see coming. And that's the,

316
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.060
the timing.

317
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.790
But there are people who punch you in any moment and you're gonna go to sleep.

318
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.470
Yeah. That's's dancing. Power's so weird. And isn't that?

319
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:18.390
So that's like one of the craziest thing in this, in this world. It's it's no,

320
00:15:18.391 --> 00:15:18.670
if it.

321
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:19.670
<v 2>Was it, Tony would've.</v>

322
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.590
<v 0>Went to sleep. I'm telling you, I I've seen people who don't my.</v>

323
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.350
<v 2>Bull on one foot when I touched them. Hey, your low kick. So was, so.</v>

324
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.750
<v 0>Was low kick for many years, wasn't thrown with the right technique.</v>

325
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.780
But it is when you kick people, they're like, oh my gosh, like you have a sharp,

326
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.860
heavy bone. It's so unique. Got dense.

327
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.980
<v 2>Bones. They get the denses.</v>

328
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.660
<v 0>Bones in the UFC. There you go. So there's a spot. Yeah. So they've.</v>

329
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.900
<v 2>Done a scan on you. Well,</v>

330
00:15:41.901 --> 00:15:44.940
they said they can't confirm or deny got the denses bone in the UFC.

331
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.380
<v 0>Can't't it out? I know, right? No, it out.</v>

332
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.810
<v 2>They have a dense, they have a dexamous dexxa scan right at, uh,</v>

333
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.690
U F C P I mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And it, you know,

334
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.890
you lay there inch by inch scans.

335
00:15:55.891 --> 00:15:59.010
Their whole body tells you what you're made of. Um, but yeah, my,

336
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.050
your bones are denser than yo L's I would assume. So. That seems crazy.

337
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.753
That guy.

338
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:13.960
<v 3>I.</v>
