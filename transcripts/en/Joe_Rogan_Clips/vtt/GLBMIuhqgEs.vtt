00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I, I tell you an interesting story. I was,</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.760
when we were making that film, there was, um, a point where we went down to the,

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.440
the IWC, the international whaling commission meeting down in, uh, in,

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.720
in Chi. And we were trying to get a,

5
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.440
an interview with some of the top people there from that run the,

6
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.110
the organization. And because, you know, whales dolphins,

7
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:24.710
are're killing them in mass. And we had the footage at that point,

8
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.790
and we were just hoping to get an interview with somebody that worked for the

9
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:30.510
international whaland commission. And, um, it was,

10
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.950
I think it was going from Houston to San Santiago. The plane was full.

11
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.070
I couldn't even sit next to the, you know, my, my partners on the,

12
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.820
my buddies and the, on the film crew, there was one empty seat next to me. And,

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.260
you know, they're waiting for somebody else to come from another flight.

14
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.460
And right before the, the plane door closes, comess a ki knockai,

15
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.460
he's the head of overseas fishing for Japan, the,

16
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:55.540
the head bull gooseling Looney. And he sits down right next to me.

17
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.500
I'm looking at my buddies, you know, uh, on the plane to think my God,

18
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.050
if there is a God, you, he has a good sense of humor. So he sat,

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.250
sit down next to me and be, I didn't want, you know, him to like,

20
00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:08.570
find out who I was and then move.

21
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.770
So I waited till dinner was served like an hour or two later. And I said,

22
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.210
do you have any idea who I am? He said, no, I said, I know who you are.

23
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.290
I wanna show you a film. Yeah. And so we had a,

24
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.130
we had a condensed version of it, you know,

25
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.760
probably about 12 over 15 minutes of it at that point.

26
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.880
And I showed it to him and I said, how do you reconcile,

27
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.080
killing these sentient intelligent animals when you know that they're their,

28
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:35.120
their flesh is poisoned. You know, and you're,

29
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:38.720
there's recommendations for pregnant women to eat this, you know, this,

30
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:40.440
this flesh at, you know, on,

31
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.070
on the gen Japanese ministry of health site. And he said,

32
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.230
I'm not in charge of, uh, food safety. I'm in sure. In charge of food security.

33
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.350
In other words, he's, he doesn't have to worry about the health consequences.

34
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:57.230
Always he has to, his job is just to provide enough meat on the plate for the,

35
00:01:57.231 --> 00:02:02.150
for Japanese people. And it gives you an insight of how he's thinking, you know,

36
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:06.140
he's in charge of, of, I think there was 145 million people in Japan,

37
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.740
in an area about the size of our California. He says 17% of, of the,

38
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.260
the land area in Japan is only, you know, uh,

39
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:17.980
good enough for growing crops on or living on were. We have to li you know,

40
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.700
turn to the sea for food. And at that point,

41
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:25.610
they were also caught skimming about 200,000 tons

42
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.810
of endangered blue. Ftuna this is over about a 20 year period. Now,

43
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.370
when you start talking about big numbers like that, I can't imagine, you know,

44
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:37.370
it's hard to imagine it, but imagine like, how are they stealing this tuna?

45
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:38.210
Well, they're, they,

46
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:41.410
they have quotas and they're exceeding their quotas every year. And,

47
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.970
but which means that they're taken away from other countries, right?

48
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.520
It's not just like everybody, every country has their allotment.

49
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:49.240
And once you've reached it, you're supposed to go home.

50
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.880
But the Japanese kept on getting more so that the Australians actually caught

51
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:55.640
them. You know, they figured out over a,

52
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.480
this 20 year period that they went through the books and saw what they reported

53
00:02:59.481 --> 00:03:01.920
in was actually sold at thekegi market, found out they,

54
00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:06.160
they had skimed 200,000 tons. That's five big train cars,

55
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.600
like trains full of, you know, endangered, tuna, like not cars,

56
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.160
but the whole trains, like 110 car trains, five of 'em full of, it's.

57
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.040
<v 1>Weird to just reconcile the idea that tuna is endangered. You know,</v>

58
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:22.510
you think of tuna as being something that you just get at the store like

59
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.390
tuna. Yeah. Tuna's a weird one, right?

60
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:28.710
Because it's such a common food it's in cans. You,

61
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.270
you see it at the sushi place, you know what I'm saying? Like to,

62
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.110
to hear that tuna's endangered, most people like cuz tuna, inangered like,

63
00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:37.550
they're hearing this going is tuna endangered.

64
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.540
But when you talk to people that work at the fish market,

65
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.060
they they'll very clearly tell you that there's a radical difference between the

66
00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:47.380
amount of tuna that was available 30, 40 years ago versus now.

67
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.300
<v 0>10 Years ago. I mean,</v>

68
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:52.940
we're down to blue fin tunas particular is down to about 90, uh,

69
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.900
it's down to 4% of their historical levels. That's incredible. Yeah. And.

70
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.050
<v 1>And there's no way to stay this there's no, I mean, it seems like it's,</v>

71
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.250
everyone's waiting for someone else to do something. And during the meantime,

72
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.450
everyone's just trying to make money.

73
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.730
<v 0>A lot of money. Yeah. Unfortunately it's sort of the,</v>

74
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:12.450
what happens with endangered species. The,

75
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.170
the more rare it becomes more valuable, it becomes.

76
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.520
And so there's very little incentive to do the right thing and

77
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.280
you know, but this is happening with all the fish docs. I mean, I,

78
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.440
I probably gave our, my,

79
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.000
I run a little organization called the oceanic preservation society and I

80
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.880
probably gave out more seafood guides than anybody on the planet.

81
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:34.200
This is the Monterey seafood, seafood, you know, watches like mm-hmm,

82
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.880
&lt;affirmative&gt; like what, what fish are sustainable. And I've seen them,

83
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.590
you know, go through the fish docs so less. And, you know, we,

84
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:43.950
we started at the big animals and we start to, you know,

85
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.910
slowly go through all the fish docs until like, we're, you know,

86
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.350
like McDonald's used to do haibit now it's, which is a very small,

87
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.990
you know, white fish from Alaska. And now that's being, you know,

88
00:04:56.991 --> 00:04:59.550
had extinction. So we're going through these fish docs. It's, you know,

89
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:02.700
that's shifting baseline where you're seeing, you know,

90
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:06.300
each successive generation adapts to the diminishment of the, the previous one.

91
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:08.500
That's what that's going on. So I had just stopped, you know,

92
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:11.420
handing out seafood guyss and now I'm trying to sort of preempt it.

93
00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:13.380
So I don't think, you know,

94
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.900
the big question is there's seven and a half billion of us on this planet soon

95
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:22.290
to be 10. Is there enough wild animals to feed us all there? Isn't, you know,

96
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:25.370
you look at the biomas of mamals on the planet, you know,

97
00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:28.570
between livestock and humans, we, we, we occupy 90,

98
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.210
96% of the biomass of mamals on the planet.

99
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.450
4% are wild mamals and then, you know,

100
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.290
so we can't all be eating wild fish. You know, we, you think about that,

101
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.090
you know, you never go out and say, look, let's get some land food.

102
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.840
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you, you know, we, we we've commodmodified, you know,

103
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.853
sea animals. That is.

104
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.840
<v 1>Interesting. Right? You don't say land food. Yeah. That's a really good point.</v>

105
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.560
You know, they did at the turn of the century, I mean, uh, during the, uh,

106
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.520
late 18 hundreds, rather there was market hunting in north America,

107
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.920
and a lot of the soldiers were done with world with, um, the civil war, rather.

108
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.600
They were hunting and they, they hunted all the deer, the bear,

109
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.160
the antelope, the Buffalo,

110
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.080
and they got down to like incredibly low numbers, you know,

111
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.350
elk to this day, I think are only in 10% of their original arranged that,

112
00:06:17.351 --> 00:06:19.470
that they were at in the 17 hundreds.

113
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.390
And that was all from market hunting from people just going out,

114
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.270
buying, you know, meat from these, uh,

115
00:06:27.271 --> 00:06:28.830
market hunters that have shot these things.

116
00:06:28.831 --> 00:06:31.350
And they didn't really have refrigeration back then.

117
00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:34.190
So it wasn't like they could freeze it and store it. And, uh,

118
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:39.100
they got down to these incredibly low levels until Teddy Roosevelt and a

119
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:42.740
lot of other people that were conservation minded realized like what was

120
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:46.060
happening here. And they put a stop to it all and then started, uh,

121
00:06:46.061 --> 00:06:49.060
enacting programs to reintroduce these animals, to the,

122
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.460
the areas where they're extricrpated.

123
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.780
And now you see historic levels of especially Whitetail deer.

124
00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:58.530
There's more Whitetail deer in America now than we're when in Columbus landed.

125
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.570
Wow. So, so, but there's, that's been success, but it's also,

126
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:02.570
that's a weird one too,

127
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:07.450
because ytail deer almost a farm animal because there's so many

128
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.370
of them that exist in Iowa and Kansas and around farmlands,

129
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.650
like they literally exist in fields and a lot of them live off of

130
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.400
GMO crops. So it's very strange. So like, I have a, a buddy of mine,

131
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.360
my friend, uh, Doug, Doug drin, who has this, uh, huge, uh,

132
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.840
piece of land in Wisconsin. And he's like,

133
00:07:27.841 --> 00:07:32.840
the deer in my area are essentially eating these GMO corn.

134
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:37.040
They're eating Monsanto corn. Like, this is so weird. Like they, yeah,

135
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:41.950
they're wild, but the are also kind of farm animals, you know,

136
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:42.784
because they,

137
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.350
and they exist in record numbers because they've got so much food to eat and.

138
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.183
<v 0>No predators.</v>

139
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.390
<v 1>Yeah. I mean the only predators they have there, I mean, they,</v>

140
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:51.710
they have some wolves now, very few and some,

141
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.310
some parts of the driftlesss area in Wisconsin. I think they have,

142
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.620
they have some bears too. And coyotes, a lot of coyotes.

143
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:01.220
It will kill a lot of theaws.

144
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.700
<v 0>I lived in Boulder, Colorado for a while and we had a,</v>

145
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.980
a lot of bears and mountain lions come through our, our, our yard,

146
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.860
cuz we were right at the base of the foothills of the,

147
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:12.340
the Rockies and a neighbor. I woke up one morning,

148
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.700
the neighbor was like looking at his,

149
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.540
his mini van and there's a big dent in the side.

150
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.500
And he was trying to figure out like how to get a dent be,

151
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.770
cuz it was parked here all night and he found a, an antler in the bushes.

152
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.170
Oh and you thought, well, what the hell? How, how did,

153
00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:29.170
and then the question is how does the deer run into it? And then in the paper,

154
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.370
the next day there was a picture of a mountain lion on a house, down the block,

155
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.730
sitting on a hot tub cover. This is in the winter holding a deer with one,

156
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.850
you know, in his mouth with one antler.

157
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.400
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; oh, so it didn't slammed it into, oh Jesus Christ.</v>

158
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.720
I lost a dog in Boulder to Mount lion. Wow. Yeah.

159
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.120
I had a little dog. It was part, uh, American Eskimo P part Pomeranian,

160
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.313
mountain lion. Got it.

161
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.760
<v 0>Oh the mountain lion, I think got our cat. Yeah.</v>

162
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.840
<v 1>They'll get everything up there, man. If it's not them, it's a Fox, you know,</v>

163
00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:01.720
there's a lot of foxes up there to get things, but God, it's beautiful. Yeah.

164
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.080
Boulders gorgeous, incredible, incredible place.

165
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.520
And you'll be driving down the road and you see it's weird.

166
00:09:06.521 --> 00:09:11.120
Like the deer in Boulder know that they're safe. So like we were, we were, uh,

167
00:09:11.121 --> 00:09:12.440
looking at this house in,

168
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.150
in Boulder and we opened up the door to the backyard and there was this enormous

169
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.350
deer just standing there staring at us. And my wife thought it was fake. I go,

170
00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:22.070
no, that's a real deer. She's like what?

171
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.430
And then it just turns its head and starts moving around because it wasn't even

172
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.830
remotely freaked out that there were people, a stones throw away from it. Yeah.

173
00:09:29.831 --> 00:09:32.270
They're just so used to being around people. It's weird.

174
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.470
<v 0>Yeah. The neighbor, I remember a neighborhood,</v>

175
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.180
ours plant rose bushes on the front of their property and you know, all proud.

176
00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:41.500
And then I remember I was driving home like later on that day and they're so you

177
00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:44.740
coming to, snippping the tops of the roses just going, oh, love it. Salad.

178
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.260
<v 1>Bar. Yeah. Many people have turned on deer because of the loss of their gardens,</v>

179
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:53.860
the roses, especially they love roses. Yeah. It's um, I don't,

180
00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:58.570
is there anybody that has ever come up with any sort of a plan to do what they

181
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.490
did for wild animals in north America? Because it,

182
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:06.810
but I see you can't regulate it the way you can wild animals cuz in wild

183
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:09.010
animals, if they have a particular area, you could make it.

184
00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:12.570
So people can't go in that area, but the ocean is so enormous.

185
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.480
Like how is anybody come up with some sort of a repopulation plan?

186
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.480
Sure, sure.

187
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.640
<v 0>There's uh, uh, IEO Wilson. I'm on the board of uh, the advisory board of his,</v>

188
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.560
his group is called the, you know, the half the halflife project. Um,

189
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.440
you know who IEO Wilson is? No. Okay. IEO Wilson is a Harvard professor. Um,

190
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.600
has two pillars for his work on in biology. He's a, um,

191
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.590
wrote the book on biodiversity. He's considered the father of modern, um,

192
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:44.030
biodiversity. He's about, um, getting right around 90 years old now.

193
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.710
But uh, looking at he,

194
00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:51.270
he would do things like go to an island and pretty much exterminate everything

195
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:53.550
on it and then try to figure out, well, you know,

196
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.790
what rate do the animals come back and what's, what's sustainable.

197
00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.660
And he's figured out that to save 85% of the,

198
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.260
the, the wild animals on the planet yet to put aside half of it for them,

199
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.580
you know, that's possible half of the planet, half the planet.

200
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.420
<v 1>Yeah. So the ocean,</v>

201
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.140
you would have to literally make half the ocean when people couldn't travel in

202
00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:15.840
it, uh.

203
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.330
<v 0>Not travel and it just not a exploit it, you know, through no fishing. Yeah.</v>

204
00:11:19.331 --> 00:11:23.650
No fishing. Yeah. And so Sylvia Earl is working on hotspots, you know, these,

205
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.730
uh, um, they're, they're called, I think what she, what she calls.

206
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.650
It's like a, like, like blue zones where, um, you know,

207
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.530
you have a lot of biodiversity, you know, try to keep those, uh,

208
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.880
away from fishing, uh, exploitation. How do they.

209
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.880
<v 1>Do that though? Like how, I mean it's you would have to get everybody on board,</v>

210
00:11:43.881 --> 00:11:44.800
right? Yeah.

211
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.480
<v 0>Well the high seas are, you know, that's, that's tough, right? Yeah.</v>

212
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.200
Although the Japanese were fishing in a, you know,

213
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:56.040
international Marine sanctuary for decades, you know? So you have to,

214
00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.080
you know, this is really tough when you have, um,

215
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.520
organizations that really don't have any tease to it. It's.

216
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.201
<v 1>That the,</v>

217
00:12:03.201 --> 00:12:07.800
the attitude that he has that pragmatic attitude about feeding the population,

218
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.040
you almost can sympathize with him. Right.

219
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.950
I mean a hundred plus million in people in this tiny place,

220
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.670
the size of California and just

221
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.590
pulling mostly fish outta the ocean. I mean, it's a,

222
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.190
it's a crazy place to be in terms of his, his position.

223
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.910
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I, I don't enviate at all. Um, but you know, what, what do you do?</v>

224
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.083
Some don't some.

225
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.660
<v 1>Slaughter dolphins. That's what you do.</v>

226
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:41.260
<v 0>Yeah. Well or endangered species or, I mean, I, I don't know. What's um,</v>

227
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.620
you know, what's sustainable anymore. I.

228
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.220
<v 1>Mean, is it possible? I mean, I know they've done this in,</v>

229
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.460
in some places outside of Hawaii where they've, uh,

230
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:55.450
they've bred animals, fish rather like sushi fish,

231
00:12:55.451 --> 00:12:59.970
like hamachi and they've had these pens set up and then a lot of times, uh,

232
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.570
a storm will come by like a huge storm and they break these pens and then those

233
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:06.530
fish get wild. Then people start catching them.

234
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.890
<v 0>Yeah. Well that's, I mean like, like Sam, like, well, you know, I went,</v>

235
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.720
they were trying to, in Japan, when we were doing the Cove, we went to a,

236
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.440
a university where they were breeding the first blue fin tuna.

237
00:13:17.441 --> 00:13:20.040
These are from eggsches, you know? So this is when, like,

238
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.240
like where they do at some places where they, they,

239
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.440
they catch 'em and then they put 'em in these pens and they fatten 'em up.

240
00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:28.560
These were they're make making blue fin from scratch,

241
00:13:28.561 --> 00:13:32.160
basically from eggs mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and really hard to do really skidish.

242
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.950
And when I went there, they were shoveling this, uh,

243
00:13:34.951 --> 00:13:39.830
this is back when I ate fish. Um, they were shoveling these macro rolls,

244
00:13:39.831 --> 00:13:42.790
like what I would feed my family with like a family of four,

245
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.630
they were shoveling it to the tuna. And I said, hold on a minute, like,

246
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.190
how many, how many, how much, you know,

247
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.790
macro does it take to make a pound of tuna?

248
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.590
And they said about seven for up until about 150 pounds.

249
00:13:54.591 --> 00:13:56.220
And after it takes 14 pounds,

250
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.460
so seven pounds of wild fish to make one pound of farm raise fish. I mean,

251
00:14:01.461 --> 00:14:04.380
this is like going to the bank and, you know, you know,

252
00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.820
cuz you want a crisp $5 bill and say, you know, gimme a, you know,

253
00:14:07.821 --> 00:14:12.100
here's a couple, a couple twenties. Wow. But that's, you know,

254
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.740
if you look at, you know, what are they feeding?

255
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.850
A lot of these fish are feeding 'em, you know, parts of farm animals and fish,

256
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.810
wild fish. Wow.

257
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:26.810
And I was just reading this morning of Los Angeles magazine that uh &lt;laugh&gt;

258
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:32.050
and the cover, it says, you know, fish fish are and it has, uh, and it,

259
00:14:32.051 --> 00:14:36.520
it talks about like the fish that are raised and I, I dunno the data behind it,

260
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:40.880
but they're, they have eight times more pollutants in it than wild fish. Right.

261
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.320
Um,

262
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.240
I dunno if it's what they're feeding or maybe cuz they're sitting in a they're

263
00:14:44.241 --> 00:14:44.960
stationary.

264
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.880
<v 1>I think that's a big part of the problem mm-hmm.</v>

265
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.400
<v 0>&lt;Affirmative&gt; yeah. Yeah. And apparently they don't taste as well. But when we.</v>

266
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.000
<v 1>Were, um, in Hawaii recently.</v>

267
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.920
<v 0>Um, we went scuba diving and uh, you know, snorkeling.</v>

268
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.960
So you jump off the boat and you're swimming around and you know,

269
00:14:58.961 --> 00:15:03.120
what's really weird about that is how few fish there are.

270
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.360
Like when you're under the, you like you expect,

271
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.840
you're gonna dunk your head underwater with those goggles on. You're gonna see,

272
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.230
oh this, all these fish swimming around the Snells not much.

273
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.950
Yeah. You don't see much. Yeah. There was a about, uh,

274
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.710
10 years ago I was down in the Caribbean.

275
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.590
A friend was getting married and I took his daughter out to,

276
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.390
I didn't know it at the time, but it was her first time snorkeling.

277
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.740
And we were in an area that I'd been to about 20 years before.

278
00:15:31.741 --> 00:15:36.020
And there was nothing, there was nothing there. It was just like a desert. Yeah.

279
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.500
And then I heard her screaming through a snorkel and I thought, what,

280
00:15:38.501 --> 00:15:42.540
what what's wrong? And she was screaming cuz she saw a single orange tank.

281
00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:47.220
That was the only life form we saw there where I used to see clouds of schools,

282
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.660
of these, you know, orange and blueang now there was nothing. And I thought,

283
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.250
my gut God, she thinks that that's beautiful. And it is, it's just, you know,

284
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:57.570
the single fish, but you know, again,

285
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.770
a shifting baseline the generation before when I was there was probably looked

286
00:16:01.771 --> 00:16:05.090
like the land before time. Right. These places I went to with, with Clark,

287
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.930
you know, Raja, onpot where you'd see, you know, if you go to the Caribbean,

288
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.000
you might see 30 fish on a different species of is E fish on dive and,

289
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.400
and rajapi, you can see 300 and it was just miraculous.

290
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.800
And when you're taking pictures,

291
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:22.000
you actually see more detail with the picture than you can with your, your,

292
00:16:22.001 --> 00:16:23.600
your eye can't comprehend it all.

293
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.200
So it's only when you get back and you see these reefs that we, you know,

294
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.840
we lit like jewel boxes. You see how much life that there is there,

295
00:16:31.841 --> 00:16:35.590
but there was just, uh, unbelievable stunning amounts of, of wildlife.

296
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:40.510
But that's going on all over the world and the great bear reef, you know,

297
00:16:40.511 --> 00:16:43.310
we lost over half the great bear reef in the last two years.

298
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.070
It was never that good. Anyway, you know, 15 years ago, I, you know,

299
00:16:47.071 --> 00:16:47.950
after being to these,

300
00:16:47.951 --> 00:16:50.390
some of the best preserved places in the world that I'd been to with Clark,

301
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.460
we looked at the Gary great bear reef and we'd be like, oh my God,

302
00:16:53.461 --> 00:16:56.300
this is not that great. Now they've already, then they've lost half again.

303
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.820
So I mean,

304
00:16:57.821 --> 00:17:00.980
if you're just the putting your head in the water for the first time and you

305
00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:05.340
come from, you know, Iowa or Wisconsin or Boulder, that looks pretty good.

306
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.860
But if you knew what came before that you're, you're seeing this, this,

307
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.660
you know, assault against, you know, nature going on.

308
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:21.370
<v 2>I.</v>
