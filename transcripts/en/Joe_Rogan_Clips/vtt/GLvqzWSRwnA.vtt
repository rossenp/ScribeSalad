00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.120
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.960
I've always wondered what it's like when you are. Uh,

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.760
when you're beginning as an artist, you know, you're, you're idealistic.

4
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.080
You have all these ideas about what the future could be,

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.640
who knows it's all wide open. And then all of a sudden, many years later,

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.190
you are a massive superstars selling out arenas.

7
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.110
How difficult is it to find people who understand where your

8
00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:30.590
head is at impossible? Do you,

9
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:34.390
do you like seek out other superstar musicians and talk.

10
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.630
<v 1>To each other? I other I did. And I, I got nowhere there either. Really? Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.950
I, I had a, I've had a hard time ever getting like good day.

12
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.060
Let's put it that way. Mm.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
The freakiest thing was I saw how it changed my inner world,

14
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.660
meaning friends and family. How so?

15
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.740
My step-grandfather who was a world war II vet,

16
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.580
very closed down classic Eisenhower, Republican type of guy smart.

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.890
You know what I mean? Had literally zero interest in me as a kid.

18
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.890
I mean, negative zero interest. And,

19
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.090
and one day I'm sitting there at Christmas and now grandpa wants to talk to me

20
00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:16.970
about the economics of my success. Whoa. And it's like,

21
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.640
like that got through to him because some guy at work or somebody at the

22
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:26.120
church brought me up and it was like, oh, that's my grandson. You know,

23
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.880
&lt;laugh&gt; nothing about childhood, you know, childhood tears did anything,

24
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.960
but that, you know, I saw where it warped the gravity in my family.

25
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.840
And then you get the friend, like, you know, you're different. It's like, yeah,

26
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.640
I'm different. Of course I'm different. You know what I mean? &lt;laugh&gt; I, I,

27
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:44.470
you know what I mean? It's like, I've got a million dollars in my pocket,

28
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.670
you know what I mean? Yeah. I could buy, you know. Yeah. I mean, you know, I,

29
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.750
one day walked into Beverly Hills and paid cash for a Ferrari and it's just dumb

30
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.070
stuff. Like, that's kind.

31
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.670
<v 0>Of awesome though. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. I remember the people.</v>

32
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:00.470
Don't like the idea of that. I think it's funny. Right? It's it's amazing.

33
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.660
You bought a Ferrari with money that you have on you. That's.

34
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.940
<v 1>Crazy. Yeah. And it was, and it was the classic story I walk in, you know,</v>

35
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:09.500
the guy didn't know who I was. Of course. He's like,

36
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.580
so how are you gonna pay for this? And I was like, cash.

37
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.660
<v 0>You have a brick with you. He's like, wow. That,</v>

38
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.980
that's just an awesome thing to be able to do stupid. Its.

39
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.690
<v 1>Like, so I'm saying you go from like literally complete, not abject. Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:28.850
I pop poor. I had no money. Right. You know? And then one day I'm like throwing,

41
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.530
you know, GS around for yeah. Dumb cars and well.

42
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.110
<v 0>It's also,</v>

43
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.570
you you've reached such a high level that there's nothing

44
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.693
above that.

45
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.960
<v 1>Like I have the, I have the dote, my manager, uh, who was,</v>

46
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.620
you know,

47
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.640
we were with the metallic guys at the time he called me on like a Wednesday or

48
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:51.760
something. And he said, I can't say for sure,

49
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.320
but more than likely based on the calls we're getting,

50
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:59.000
you're gonna be number one this week. Meaning melancholy. And I,

51
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.960
I literally said, is there a position higher &lt;laugh&gt;

52
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.870
Yeah.

53
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.840
Like I couldn't process that there wasn't like another step you couldn't keep

54
00:03:08.841 --> 00:03:09.520
going. Yeah.

55
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.400
<v 0>Yeah. Well that's what I always wondered.</v>

56
00:03:11.401 --> 00:03:15.000
Like when you reach a certain level and you're selling out these giant arenas

57
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.000
and you're one of the biggest bands literally ever,

58
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.750
you look at one of the top 100 biggest bands of all time. Mmhmm right. Arguably.

59
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.510
<v 1>Yeah. It we're in there. Yeah. It's in there. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.110
<v 0>Where the do you go? Like it had to be this weird madness. Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.270
I would imagine that that madness is the only option.

62
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.910
<v 1>Yeah. Madness sort of becomes attractive at that point.</v>

63
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.230
<v 0>God, that's gotta be so strange to be just crushing it,</v>

64
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.980
selling out these giant arenas. Number one songs going now. What,

65
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.940
what the do we do? Do we.

66
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.780
<v 1>Fade away? No, we went crazy. Yeah. We just lost our minds.</v>

67
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.900
<v 0>Like what happened? What was the process? Did you see it slipping away? Oh yeah.</v>

68
00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:51.690
Did you see the madness?

69
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.500
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And it became, you know, it's like,</v>

70
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.380
it's like a bad relationship or bad relationships. You,

71
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.250
it becomes a lot clear when you're out. You know,

72
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:02.890
at the time you sort of do your own rationalization like,

73
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.730
oh he or she's going crazy. Not me.

74
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.130
We all went crazy in four different directions. Wow. And this and the, and the,

75
00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:15.330
and the great shame of, of, of my band was musically.

76
00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:18.890
We were super tight and we never disagreed on music.

77
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.640
It was like this phenomenon where musically, we were like totally in sync,

78
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.400
we could produce and write music very, very quickly.

79
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.760
And it was always the other stuff around us. So that sort of ate at the core.

80
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.960
And then when, when we lost our personal relationship,

81
00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:35.560
that's what diminished the musical relationship. Ah,

82
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.070
But you don't know it at the time because you sort of, I don't arrogance,

83
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:43.990
not the right word, but it's like, you have a sort of a, you know,

84
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:46.670
you got a little bit of a thing in your walk and you think you, you know,

85
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:49.310
you got the world by the, you know what, and all good.

86
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.590
You think you can power your way through anything because you have right.

87
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.830
You don't understand that you do actually need the people standing next to you.

88
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.030
I have such a greater appreciation for my man mates now that now that I've seen

89
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:04.740
what we actually did a accomplish in, in, you know, is surrounded by cast.

90
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.380
But then we created our own cast. And then at some point it all blurs.

91
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.940
<v 0>What were the things that it up? Was it the money and the fame?</v>

92
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.820
And was it the tension? Was it the ego?

93
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.540
<v 1>Um, I think, uh, we were, we were like one of those bad, um, behind the musics,</v>

94
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.770
the, it was very early convers. Um,

95
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.290
I remember we had these managers very early on and,

96
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.810
and they were coming to town, sort of courting us before we had a record deal.

97
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.570
And one day they came to town and they said,

98
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.650
can we just go out to breakfast with you? Which was weird,

99
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.170
cuz it was always the whole band, like, you know, democracy. And they said, um,

100
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.400
they said, uh, now who writes the song? And I said, well I do. And they said,

101
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:46.360
well, that's gonna be a problem. I'm like, what do you mean?

102
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:47.640
That's gonna be a problem. They said, well,

103
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.000
songwriters and bands make a lot more money.

104
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.720
So our suggestion is you should share your songs with your band mates to keep

105
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:56.840
sort of a, kind of a democratic stasis.

106
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.320
And they used some examples of bands who did it. And I thought, hell no,

107
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.640
I'm not. I'm I'm not giving them my work. I mean, it's my songs.

108
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:06.680
And they were like, you don't understand, you're gonna make a lot more money.

109
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:08.880
And I was like, tough. You know what I mean?

110
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.360
It's like live and learn kind of thing. Why'd.

111
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.520
<v 0>They think you were gonna make more money because success.</v>

112
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.550
<v 1>Songwriters get, if you, uh, quick, uh, live lesson, uh,</v>

113
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.550
the songwriter gets paid separate statutorily by the government than the,

114
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.110
than the actual copyright of the recording. So if you,

115
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:30.230
if I'm on Joe Rogan's label, you pay the band for the recording,

116
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.470
which of course in that case would be split four ways.

117
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.670
But you owe me a statutory rate as a songwriter for the sale,

118
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.100
which I think these days is about 10 cents.

119
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.620
So every record we sold where I was the sole songwriter,

120
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.580
I was getting 10 cents that they weren't getting, ah,

121
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.460
or 8 cents or whatever it was at the time.

122
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.740
So you can imagine over a gazillion record, sold it, added up. Yeah.

123
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.860
So I start pulling away financially. You know what I mean?

124
00:06:55.861 --> 00:06:59.370
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but when you're a kid and you're 23 and somebody's having

125
00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:01.810
this conversation with you and you literally don't even have an apartment

126
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.970
&lt;laugh&gt; right.

127
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.210
And somebody's trying to tell you how you're gonna make a lot more money.

128
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:07.890
It's like, what does that mean? Right. Fast forward, four years later.

129
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.450
And it's like, I'm making a lot more money. Mm. So that sort of sows a,

130
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.650
it, it organically sows discontent. Yes. You know, it's a,

131
00:07:16.651 --> 00:07:20.200
whether you call it jealous or not. And then as I emerged as sort of the,

132
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.880
a tour and the big mouth in the band and maybe the person who was most willing

133
00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:25.240
to be contrtroversy or whatever,

134
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.760
we'd get in a room with journalists and they would just talk to me. Ah,

135
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.760
and then we'd get outta the interviews. And they,

136
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.920
the band members would yell at me for them not being asked questions.

137
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.680
So it's like this weird thing,

138
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:42.310
like it was my responsibility to push them more as stars.

139
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.231
<v 0>Or, yeah.</v>

140
00:07:43.231 --> 00:07:46.590
So it's not just about the music it's about being appreciated and successful.

141
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.910
<v 1>And famous. Yeah. Now in hindsight and in fairness to them,</v>

142
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.350
I didn't appreciate why it was important to them cuz in their minds we're all

143
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:57.710
equal. We're in the room together. Yeah. You write the songs. That's cool.

144
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.860
But at least gimme social currency. Right, right.

145
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.140
Of being recognized or yeah. You know,

146
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.020
or somebody would offer me alone a magazine cover. And if I was smart,

147
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:13.700
which I wasn't, I should have said no, only the band or nothing, but I was like,

148
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.980
sure, put me on the cover. I'll take it. You know what I mean? Right. And.

149
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.290
<v 0>You probably would've saw thought they would do the same thing if someone came</v>

150
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:21.080
into. Absolutely.

151
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.450
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. And then of course it becomes tit for tat then like, uh,</v>

152
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.450
two of the band members went on their own and made a record deal. Um,

153
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.250
without me, they got somebody to give them a bunch of money to start a label,

154
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.850
which they had every right to do. You know what I mean?

155
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.730
So suddenly they're like making side deals and it starts getting all that weird

156
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.120
business and right. It, and now again, it's like an erosion factor.

157
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.000
You don't appreciate it from within, there's a lot of compression,

158
00:08:45.001 --> 00:08:45.681
there's a lot of money,

159
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:49.000
there's a lot of stuff going on and then one day it sort of hollows out and then

160
00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:49.801
it's too late, you know,

161
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:52.280
you can't just sort of sit down and have a meeting and make it all. Okay.

162
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.360
Cuz the wounds are deep and in our case, I mean the wounds lasted for,

163
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.960
I didn't talk to Darcy for 17 years. Whoa.

164
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.200
And I didn't talk to James for I think 16. Wow. So we, that,

165
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.400
I mean the heat was, was real. I mean we didn't,

166
00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:10.360
there were lawsuits and all sorts of stuff and it's.

167
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.880
<v 0>Such a common story that I hope someone listens to this part of your oh they</v>

168
00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:14.100
were.

169
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.790
<v 1>As well. Well they won't &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

170
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.910
<v 0>It's just human nature. Right. Is that what it is?</v>

171
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.710
<v 1>Power corrupts man.</v>

172
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:21.893
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

173
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.350
<v 1>And again, you know, no sympathy asking.</v>

174
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.150
<v 0>Well wouldn't today though. I mean it wouldn't today.</v>

175
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.550
Like I feel like if you were in a similar position today,

176
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.270
you'd have hindsight in your favor. Oh yeah.

177
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.260
<v 1>No, no I would. Yeah. I mean, and, and even talking about the band,</v>

178
00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:38.340
going back on a tour and the possibility of that, it's like,

179
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.100
I approach it completely different.

180
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.940
<v 0>Yeah. See, that's what I'm saying.</v>

181
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:44.620
Like power doesn't necessarily corrupt it corrupts.

182
00:09:44.621 --> 00:09:46.540
If you don't know what the it's gonna do to you.

183
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.700
<v 1>Sure. Yeah. But again, and I'm not,</v>

184
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.580
I'm not preaching for sympathy, but the,

185
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.650
and I can't speak for the modern music business, but business. We were in,

186
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.623
in the nineties,

187
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.210
we were surrounded by people who were giving us wrong information. Mm.

188
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.330
Now were they giving us wrong information on purpose or because they weren't

189
00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:07.770
bright enough. I don't know. But we weren't getting the right information.

190
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.890
Very few people actually try to sit us down and say, look,

191
00:10:10.891 --> 00:10:15.050
this is gonna be a problem. Trust me. You know,

192
00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:17.120
it's like you're in there with, at the hounds and there's just.

193
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.920
<v 0>Right. And they probably don't have the time for psychological management.</v>

194
00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:21.350
Anyway.

195
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.000
They're probably in the middle of just trying to figure out how to make money

196
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.080
off you. And my.

197
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.040
<v 1>My under my understanding is they and I, and again,</v>

198
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:29.800
going back to the conversation I had with the executive,

199
00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:32.200
they just basically look and they say, you've got four years. If you're lucky,

200
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.080
if you're lucky, so why are they gonna, yeah.

201
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.670
Why are they gonna spend a bunch of time trying to hold your hand,

202
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.430
knowing you're gonna lose anyway, what.

203
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.430
<v 0>A crazy relationship between the record labels and the artists it's.</v>

204
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.710
<v 1>It's similar. I guess, probably to like the pit boss, if you're ha,</v>

205
00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:50.110
if you're having a hot run at like roulette mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and the pit

206
00:10:50.111 --> 00:10:54.710
boss is just like, enjoy it now. Yeah. Cause we're gonna get it back.

207
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.910
That's what it feels like. What.

208
00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.180
<v 0>Percentage of musicians or musical, uh,</v>

209
00:11:01.181 --> 00:11:04.700
artists that get signed by, uh,

210
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.620
a label and put something out,

211
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.540
ever wind up having an actually successful career.

212
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.860
<v 1>Probably less than 10%. Jesus Christ. I would say it's probably even smaller.</v>

213
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.140
What a meat grinder.

214
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.210
<v 0>Of a business you would think like, Hey man, we're on Warner brothers, dude.</v>

215
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.730
We made it it's happening. They're gonna promote USHMM they're gonna push us.

216
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:24.610
They signed us.

217
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.770
<v 1>And, and sorry to interrupt again. But the other weird thing is the, again,</v>

218
00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:33.010
the system I was in was even if you were successful,

219
00:11:33.011 --> 00:11:36.130
it was set up to make you feel like you weren't successful. Right.

220
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.080
Because that was the work. That was the manipulation.

221
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.463
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

222
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.080
<v 1>I, I once said to somebody who is a very famous name in the business, um,</v>

223
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.321
it's like,

224
00:11:47.321 --> 00:11:50.080
you guys find a needle in the haystack and then you spend the next 20 years

225
00:11:50.081 --> 00:11:54.040
telling 'em they're not a needle in the haystack. &lt;laugh&gt; right. It's it?

226
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.160
What I'm trying to say.

227
00:11:55.161 --> 00:11:59.760
And I'm not saying it well is you would think you would be surrounded by people

228
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.920
or telling you your talent. You're special.

229
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.360
We wanna help you because the more you succeed we'll succeed and will all

230
00:12:06.361 --> 00:12:09.480
succeed together. It's was the exact opposite. It was like, no, you're dumb.

231
00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:13.070
You're wrong. No, you're crazy. Don' do that.

232
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:18.430
You're gonna ruin it. And then, and even if you'd say, I wanna wear this hat,

233
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.550
okay, I'm gonna wear this hat. And when it wouldn't work, they'd say, see,

234
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:22.384
you should listen to us.

235
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.870
<v 0>Ah, is that universal? Have you heard the other,</v>

236
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.350
other musicians say the same thing? I.

237
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.910
<v 1>Would guess it was universal because looking back, it doesn't feel personal.</v>

238
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.860
To me, it felt like I, I, you know, use your bad analogy. Pimpo I don't know.

239
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:39.700
Right. It's a weird connjob thing. That was my experience.

240
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.060
It was a lot of Conn jobs.

241
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.780
<v 0>That Courtney love, uh, piece that she wrote about the music business.</v>

242
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.100
I'm sure you're aware of that. Was she explain, was it recent or no? No.

243
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.380
A bunch of years ago where she, it was,

244
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:56.250
I think it was actually before digital got really huge.

245
00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.810
And it was, uh, a lot of people thought she had a ghost rider,

246
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:04.690
but it was really eyeopening to a lot of people that didn't know anything about

247
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:05.291
the music business.

248
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:07.850
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like where the money actually goes and how,

249
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:13.010
how much money has to be spent and how little you actually make.

250
00:13:13.011 --> 00:13:15.480
Even though if you sell a, a ton of records, you've never seen this.

251
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.400
It's pretty funny.

252
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.040
<v 1>No. From 2000 actually is on salon.com. Yeah. It might been one of the years.</v>

253
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.720
We weren't talking &lt;laugh&gt; oh, there you go.

254
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:27.160
<v 0>Yeah&lt;laugh&gt; Well it's for people who haven't read it,</v>

255
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:30.640
it's pretty eyeop I've, I've, I'm, I've nothing to do with the music business.

256
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.760
I've always been absolutely fascinated as a completely objective observer.

257
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:38.030
Just looking at it, a gone. Yeah. This whole thing seems so crazy because it's,

258
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.790
if you do not get signed and if you do not get promot, at least until recently,

259
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.190
you had no chance. They,

260
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.110
they literally controlled the reigns in the direction of your career.

261
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.990
Almost like an actor. Like you can't make it as an actor,

262
00:13:50.991 --> 00:13:53.790
unless you get an audition and someone chooses to put you in.

263
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.700
<v 1>A film, but like a great Greek mythology type myth thing. The,</v>

264
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.020
the music business has made two critical mistakes over the last 30 or so years

265
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.740
that led to its current sort of reduced status.

266
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.860
One was they let MTV run a muck on free content.

267
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.300
And when they tried to reign MTV and MTV basically told 'em to take a hike and

268
00:14:14.301 --> 00:14:18.250
the music business back down. Um, so when MTV stopped playing music content,

269
00:14:18.251 --> 00:14:20.650
there was nothing the music business could do cause they'd given away all their

270
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.570
leverage to the, to MTV. Ah,

271
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.850
and then the second was when Napster showed up and they acted like Napster was a

272
00:14:26.851 --> 00:14:29.290
virus that they just needed to stamp out.

273
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.250
Not really realizing that Napster was just the beginning of a whole wave of new

274
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:38.000
technologies and new sort of social interactions or something.

275
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:42.800
Those two critical errors led to the music business reduced position.

276
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.720
<v 0>And it's this music, I mean, music has been around forever,</v>

277
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.400
but the music business has been around what a hundred or so years.

278
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.720
<v 1>Yeah. I think we're into 120.</v>

279
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.520
<v 0>Plus years of recordings. Yeah. It's just amazing how,</v>

280
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.760
what an iron fist they've managed to control the, the business with and,

281
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.960
and to sort of wrangle all the artists for the most part.

282
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.920
<v 1>Well, it's weird of wizard of Oz, you know, you know, don't, don't, you know,</v>

283
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:12.070
don't look by behind the curtain. Have.

284
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.870
<v 0>You ever thought about being on the other side? Yeah, I have.</v>

285
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.510
<v 1>But I, I just don't have that much. I'm actually,</v>

286
00:15:16.511 --> 00:15:19.190
that's why I'm more interested in wrestling. I think I like that. I like the,

287
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.150
even though it's a sort of weird business, I,

288
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.270
I sort of like that because it doesn't have anything to do with music.

289
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.750
I have too much damage and too many, I don't think I could see clearly.

290
00:15:27.751 --> 00:15:30.950
Doesn' it make sense? It's like, it's still too weird for me. Yeah.

291
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.060
<v 0>Yeah. No, it does. It does make sense. It.</v>

292
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.220
<v 1>Does. When you first,</v>

293
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:38.660
when I first came to LA and whatever 90 and had the meetings and you'd be in

294
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:39.580
that, that, you know,

295
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:42.300
hit the office and the people with the beards and everything. Yeah.

296
00:15:42.301 --> 00:15:43.134
And they'd be like,

297
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.780
so when we put the product out and every time they would say product,

298
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.340
I would sort of winnce the product. Like,

299
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.690
how can you call my art pro you know what I mean? And that's, to them,

300
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.450
it's just, it's cookies and toilet paper. It's just, it's whatever. Wow. And,

301
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.050
um, and it's not to say they're not fans and they don't appreate, you know,

302
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.170
or they don't care. But at the end of the day,

303
00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:05.850
it's just some sort of weird business, you know,

304
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.530
and like all institutional cultures that are sort of,

305
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.680
kind of corrupt at their core, it just sort of runs on its own show. It's just,

306
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.350
it just.

307
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.080
<v 0>Does. When you see someone like chance, the rapper break out of that system,</v>

308
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:17.521
do you,

309
00:16:17.521 --> 00:16:20.800
do you think that that's a model that can be followed or is he just like an

310
00:16:20.801 --> 00:16:21.634
outlier?

311
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.240
<v 1>No, it's certainly a model that can be followed, but you know,</v>

312
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.720
it probably works because he's so talented. It's like a weird combination,

313
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.040
right? I mean, use the McGregor example.

314
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.070
It's like how many mcgres are there in the world and,

315
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.510
and beyond being a skilled fighter, I mean,

316
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.150
the guy's an a level talker speaking from a professional wrestling standpoint,

317
00:16:39.151 --> 00:16:41.550
the guy's probably the best promo in the world. Yeah.
