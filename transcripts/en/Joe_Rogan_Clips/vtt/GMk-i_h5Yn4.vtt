00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.580
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. First of all,</v>

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.570
look how good you look in there on the cover there. Handsome bastard.

3
00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:11.960
Look at ya. Looking good there. What year is that from.

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.880
<v 1>1968 November. I just come off the last mission in Vietnam. Wow.</v>

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.990
It was on a Hilltop. We got stuck in the rain in the Asheville valley.

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.260
It was the first cavalry. And, uh, we really,

7
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.370
the helicopters couldn't get in for 11 days. It was awful. Wow.

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.390
We had leaches everywhere. Oh. And the enemy, we didn't know where they were,

9
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:34.490
but we felt that they were going to close in. I was,

10
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.660
but it was too wet ultimately for them to close in, but they knew we were there.

11
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.680
So we were praying the whole time was kind of nerve wracking because it was my

12
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:47.510
last few days. You understand? I was supposed to get out of there with DeRosa,

13
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.870
leave the country. I was due out. Uh, I had volunteered.

14
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.650
I had volunteered for an extra three months in order to get out of the army

15
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:58.460
three months sooner. In other words, they had there. Normally you have to serve,

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.980
uh, if a two year deal you had to serve six,

17
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.610
six months stateside on the backside of it. So, uh,

18
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.370
I didn't want to do that cause I was going nuts with the rules and the

19
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.400
regulations, and I'd gotten into some trouble with that.

20
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.090
So I extended in combat for another three months.

21
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.190
And that ended up in this mission.

22
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.240
<v 0>How much did your time serving impact your,</v>

23
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.860
your directing and you you've had these life experiences as someone who's just a

24
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:27.980
filmmaker. They really can't draw upon,

25
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.980
like you you've had actual combat experience.

26
00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:33.830
And when you're making movies about combat, I mean,

27
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:38.180
that has to be a gigantic advantage or at least it

28
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.010
adds layers to it that are almost impossible to create, to recreate for someone.

29
00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:44.630
Who's just trying to imagine what it's like.

30
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.970
<v 1>Yeah. And that was very important when we did platoon, uh,</v>

31
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.850
I w I was trying to get the exact distances

32
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.410
and what, and the amount of firepower is not as huge. It's not as intense,

33
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.020
generally speaking as the movies make it. Yeah.

34
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.860
And that's the problem because the movies have so much to play, you know,

35
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:07.370
so much to show they bring the enemy much closer. They,

36
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.950
they condense things and they,

37
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.710
they amplify as much as possible. Now I did that too here and there. So I'm,

38
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.700
I'm guilty too, but I think overall it's way over done. And, uh,

39
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.540
the newer stuff that's come out since 2001, you know,

40
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:28.130
with the patriotic stuff and the heavily, heavily militaristic stuff is way off,

41
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.110
way off. And, uh, people don't die that way. Like, you know, in the,

42
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.400
uh, type of films like mark Walberg made, or, you know, those kinds of films,

43
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:41.660
they just way, way over done anyway, went in one way or like,

44
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.000
well, uh, what was the name of the lone survivor? Was it the name of it? Yeah.

45
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.410
They get dropped off whatever. And 10 guys,

46
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:53.170
and they managed to kill how many Taliban for each guy, you know, much of.

47
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.520
<v 0>That was based on, I mean, it's all about Marcus Luttrell.</v>

48
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.970
I haven't had a chance to talk to Marcus. I'm a friends with him,

49
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.660
but I don't know how much of it, they,

50
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.460
they monkey with everything whenever they make it. Well.

51
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.910
<v 1>We're done. It was way over done.</v>

52
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.260
And that what I heard and what's been reported is that they, you know,

53
00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:12.330
they got trapped right away. That was pretty quick.

54
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.910
And the ambush went on and they, and they got,

55
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.530
they got the kicked out of themselves. And, uh, you know, I can't, I can't be,

56
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.060
I don't remember exactly the details,

57
00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:24.010
but he did get away and some people did scam,

58
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.090
but it doesn't look like it does in the movie where one's.

59
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.790
<v 0>A hero. Right. That is a problem.</v>

60
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:33.030
And that's one of the things that I really loved about platoon. Everyone.

61
00:03:33.031 --> 00:03:36.960
Wasn't a hero. I mean, the Tom Berenger character.

62
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.250
<v 1>The I existed. It's in the book. Yeah. It's based on a guy called Sergeant.</v>

63
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.880
Well, I called him Sergeant Barnes, but he hadn't, I wouldn't use his real name,

64
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.190
real guy gunshot in the face.

65
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.230
And it was a scarred distorted kind of handsome like

66
00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:55.680
that, but he was a serious guy and he knew what he was doing.

67
00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:58.620
He was the leader of the platoon. See,

68
00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:02.550
I made clear that the leaders of the platoon were not really the lieutenants.

69
00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:06.030
They were this, the platoon Sergeant and this and the squad sergeants.

70
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.200
And they were very important in our lives. So I rarely saw officers.

71
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.040
I was dealing in the jungle. You deal with what's right in front of you.

72
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:17.190
So the Sergeant was crucial. Barnes is a crucial character.

73
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:22.050
So is the other character Sergeant Elias played by William Defoe was the,

74
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.880
in another unit that I had combined four different units.

75
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.600
I was in three combat units. I combined them into one, one unit,

76
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.490
one platoon for this movie purposes.

77
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.030
<v 0>So the Willem Defoe character was also based on a real person. Yeah. Yes.</v>

78
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.960
<v 1>He was. He was based on a guy I'm in the loops, long range, recon patrol,</v>

79
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.400
who was a great guy. He was an patchy kind of an Apache Mexican, uh,

80
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.550
mix, uh, uh, not quite sure what he was,

81
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.990
cause I didn't get to know him that well,

82
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.940
but I admired him because he had that life grace.

83
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.790
So a guy who fought a lot, he'd been around, he'd been in,

84
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.320
he'd been in before he was on a second tour and a very much a love,

85
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.760
a beloved figure. And he was killed after I left the unit.

86
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.800
Uh, he was killed about a month later in a friendly fire accident.

87
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.510
Now friendly fire is met. We talk about it in the book quite a bit, you know,

88
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.460
because it's also underestimated people, never, the Pentagon cuts it all out.

89
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.590
And especially in the movies that come from the Pentagon approval, they, they,

90
00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:26.850
they don't like to emphasize how difficult,

91
00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:31.710
how often I would say 15 to 20% of our casualties in that

92
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:33.900
war were friendly fire. Wow.

93
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.010
Now that's not just ground fire from when you get into a jungle situation,

94
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:40.380
you're close to people. You don't really know where you're shooting.

95
00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:43.230
Sometimes you don't know where the sh where the incoming fire is,

96
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.210
is coming from. So it's quite a mess. It's chaotic the radio people,

97
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:53.130
screaming, shouting, noise, confusion, and a lot of fear.

98
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.370
<v 0>Yeah. That was highlighted for us.</v>

99
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.070
When the pat Tillman incident happened, very important. One pat Tillman,

100
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:03.140
who is this spectacular athlete,

101
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:07.910
decided to postpone his NFL career and go over and serve and was

102
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:11.300
killed in friendly fire. And it wasn't really reported that way for awhile.

103
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.310
<v 1>That's absolutely correct. Which is the point is that they don't,</v>

104
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.720
they really don't want the parents to know what's really going on. So if,

105
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.880
imagine if imagine 15,

106
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:26.710
maybe 20% are dying from that friendly fire and that this is

107
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:31.300
not just ground fire. This is of course bombing and certainly artillery fire,

108
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.670
because that is often this placed.

109
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.790
It's not that easy to get the coordinates down in a tense situation where you,

110
00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:43.630
you can hit your, where artillery 20 miles away, 40 miles away.

111
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.880
It has to hit, you has to hit the spot.

112
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.800
<v 0>Right when you're making a movie like platoon. And this is in many, much,</v>

113
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.920
much of it is based on your actual real life experience,

114
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.460
how much preparation is involved in it, and how much,

115
00:06:56.461 --> 00:06:59.230
how much is it different than when you're making another movie?

116
00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:03.040
Because this is something that's intensely personal to you, obviously.

117
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.070
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, how much preparation? Well,</v>

118
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:14.020
I got, I got a great combat advisor. He'd been there as a Marine Dale dye.

119
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.690
Uh, he came in out of the blue and, uh, he, he was a real, a lifer type.

120
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.650
So he remembered all the details of uniforms and, uh,

121
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.970
fire and the, and, uh, the firepower. I mean, it's,

122
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.010
it took a lot of details to put this together. Uh, but the preparation was,

123
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:36.940
I'd been doing it for 10 years. I started the picture in 1976. I wrote it.

124
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.620
I wrote it. It wasn't made, it was rejected by the,

125
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.600
by the powers that be the first time. And then it was, uh,

126
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.230
it was considered great, great script, but to re you know, too realistic,

127
00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:51.460
a bummer, a downer,

128
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.780
if you remember back in the seventies and apocalypse now and deer hunter. Yeah.

129
00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.100
Those were big films and mythic beautiful films, but they were not realistic.

130
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.550
Then they had, uh, Sylvester Stallone to his, uh,

131
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.120
Rambo series where he goes back and fights the war. Again,

132
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.770
those drive you crazy. Yeah. Although the first one was pretty good. Uh,

133
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.950
but the first one was different. They're playing up the, you know,

134
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.710
the whole sympathy card, the pity card. I don't buy that. You know,

135
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.610
that there's a lot of that veteran feeling that, you know, we were,

136
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:26.260
we were, we were beaten.

137
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.320
We had our hands tied behind our backs and we couldn't win.

138
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:31.630
And that kind of thing believe me, uh,

139
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.980
it was a badly conceived war with a lot of misinformation.

140
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.810
I go on in the book and talk about the lies that were spread by the military,

141
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.610
the propaganda that were winning the whole time they were using the body counts,

142
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.060
heavy body counts. And they'd say, well, if we're killing so much,

143
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.640
so many of them, they're not going to be that many left. And,

144
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.400
but on the other hand, as the years went on, more, more of them kept appearing.

145
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.510
So they, the Vietnamese were indestructible in a way. They were like aunts.

146
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.800
They were, they were fighting for their independence, their, for their land man.

147
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.980
It was their country. And, uh, they never gave up ever.

148
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:09.330
And then you could have nuked them.

149
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.470
And that's what Curtis LeMay at one point suggested you could have dropped a

150
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:14.071
nuclear bomb.

151
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:17.610
It wouldn't have done it wouldn't have made the difference that God they didn't.

152
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.130
But, uh, America went to extremes to win that war with poisoning,

153
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.420
the bombing, the bombing of not only Vietnam,

154
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:31.950
Laos and Cambodia was intense, intense, bigger, bigger than by far,

155
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.290
then world war two for this crazy war.

156
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.661
<v 0>Well, it also,</v>

157
00:09:35.661 --> 00:09:40.520
it set a precedent for our lack of trust in the military and lack of

158
00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:42.650
trust in the government that guides the military,

159
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.710
particularly in how they deal with the veterans that are dealing with things

160
00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:48.080
like agent orange or, you know,

161
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.680
people that have come back that were sick,

162
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:54.770
where they denied that this was part of the problem. Sure.

163
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.280
<v 1>We didn't even have PTSD. We didn't, we didn't know what that was,</v>

164
00:09:58.281 --> 00:10:01.940
but it started prop up when I got back. And I talk about it here,

165
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.620
a bit about PTSD, which I'd never heard of, but I think we all have.

166
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.150
<v 0>What did they call it back then? Just shellshocked or.</v>

167
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.620
<v 1>Yeah. So, but I wasn't,</v>

168
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.660
it was not an diagnostic diagnosable ma it was not an

169
00:10:14.661 --> 00:10:17.990
ailment that you could officially, uh,

170
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.760
catalog because if you did,

171
00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:24.380
the army would be admitting to a huge amount of insurance problems and all kinds

172
00:10:24.381 --> 00:10:28.370
of medical problems they would have to cover. So it was, you know,

173
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.930
it was something that there was no word for it, but frankly,

174
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.220
uh,

175
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:39.170
to get back to the issue of w the original question was H the platoon was

176
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.910
rejected on for these two. It almost came to be again in 1983,

177
00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:48.620
a fellow party. Again, it's a heartbreaking story. It's in the book. And,

178
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.860
uh, uh, it's resurrected. I mean, I forget about,

179
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.210
I just put it in the closet. After those movies came out,

180
00:10:56.211 --> 00:10:58.550
I said that they don't want to know about Vietnam and it, in this country,

181
00:10:58.551 --> 00:11:02.060
they really forget it. It's not going to happen. Fine. I live with it.

182
00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:06.710
I was moving on with my career. I had midnight express. I had Scarface. I,

183
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.590
I was, uh, I had other things in my life, but, uh,

184
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.180
Michael Cimino who had directed the deer,

185
00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:18.470
hunter told me he wanted to produce it with me as the writer,

186
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.130
as a director. And that, uh, we would, he would,

187
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.640
we would resurrect it because he said, Vietnam is coming back. I said,

188
00:11:25.641 --> 00:11:28.070
that's nonsense. I don't think it's kind of come back. He said,

189
00:11:28.071 --> 00:11:30.650
look at Stanley Kubrick's pictures. He's going to make a picture.

190
00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:34.280
It's called a full metal jacket. And, uh, it took,

191
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.060
it took three years or two years for him to make it. But the fact that,

192
00:11:38.061 --> 00:11:40.880
that he made it certainly gave us some impetus to make,

193
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.450
we made it very low budget. And by the way,

194
00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:47.720
it was made by the same company as main Salvador, my previous film,

195
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.610
they made him, I made him back to back in Mexico and the Philippines, uh,

196
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.470
back-to-back financed very low budget by Hemdale.

197
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.850
A British company led by a gentleman named John Daley, who I met,

198
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:06.100
who was my mentor and much credit name in the book. So,

199
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:12.160
uh, we were nothing filming out of nowhere. I mean, we were the bottom. I mean,

200
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.660
we're in the Philippines in making a film that nobody really knew much about.

201
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:19.960
And at the bottom, you know, we were struggling to get it made.

202
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:23.110
And there was a weather problems. There was all kinds of

203
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.390
logistical problems, but we'd been through hell on Salvador,

204
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:32.170
as I describe in the book in Mexico. So we were a unit by this time, we,

205
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.110
we got used to the difficulties of making low budget films.

206
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.770
<v 0>In between the time you wrote it. And the time it actually got done,</v>

207
00:12:37.771 --> 00:12:42.450
was there ever any effort by the studios to try to water it down or to try to

208
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.830
doctor it up? And.

209
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.280
<v 1>Sure, now that went on quite a bit, uh,</v>

210
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.580
everyone read the script at one point or another everyone going to rejected it.

211
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.080
So, and when I finally almost got made with Chimino in 1983,

212
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:01.170
uh, we thought we were in, we thought we'd get it made now. But, uh,

213
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.033
the, uh,

214
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.610
the resistance to it at the very end with the MGM was supposed to be the

215
00:13:05.611 --> 00:13:10.020
distributor. And Henry Kissinger was on the board of directors along with, uh,

216
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.780
Hague Alexander. Hey, do you remember him?

217
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:17.370
Military guy who was secretary of state? Very bad tempered though.

218
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.130
They were both on the board and whether they went to that board, I don't know,

219
00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:21.030
but that's what the story,

220
00:13:21.031 --> 00:13:23.520
they cover their by telling me we can't make this movie.

221
00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:27.300
We can't distribute this movie because the board would be against it. Now,

222
00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:30.510
sometimes they say, they tell you that without checking, but in this case,

223
00:13:30.511 --> 00:13:35.040
I don't know. So as a result, the film fell apart again,

224
00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:36.750
this was a hard, did you ever.

225
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.200
<v 0>Think, like maybe I can move it a little bit or change it a little bit,</v>

226
00:13:40.201 --> 00:13:41.070
or would you just stand.

227
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.490
<v 1>Up the Pentagon said to me, forget it. We're not going to help you at all.</v>

228
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.020
And this thing is completely distorted.

229
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.830
They were upset as hell about the fragging. I mean,

230
00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:54.510
that's to say dragging is yeah. Yeah. There was a lot of that towards the end.

231
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.270
It started in 67 8,

232
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:02.250
but there was more and more discontent when Lyndon Johnson pulled out of the

233
00:14:02.251 --> 00:14:07.110
presidency in March of 68. That was a big moment. I think all the souls,

234
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.980
everyone kind of knew that this thing was not going to work out and who wanted

235
00:14:10.981 --> 00:14:13.590
to be the last guy to get killed in Vietnam. Right.

236
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.250
And so I think 69 70 were more and more fractions,

237
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.560
more fractions, fractious, and there was more and more incidents. At one point,

238
00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:24.570
there was a Pentagon document that came out.

239
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.460
I've seen it that said this situation in the army is getting so

240
00:14:29.461 --> 00:14:32.220
poor, so bad. The morale is so low that it's,

241
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.680
it resemble is beginning to resemble the French mutinies in 1917 in the

242
00:14:37.681 --> 00:14:41.400
world war one, that was a big concern of the Pentagon.

243
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:46.050
They knew the thing was not going to work. It was cracking from within. So we,

244
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.670
we gave more and more, let's say more and more,

245
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.290
uh, credit to the Vietnamese, south Vietnamese,

246
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.120
and saying that they were going to take our place.

247
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.400
We're going to put more money. We put a fortune into them,

248
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.730
south Vietnamese army, like we're doing now or the African army.

249
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.050
<v 0>Yeah. It's interesting. When you look back, what year did platoon come out?</v>

250
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.720
I finally made it out in 86. Remember when, when you really think about it,

251
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.100
you're only talk,

252
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.240
you're not talking about that much distance distance between that movie coming

253
00:15:16.241 --> 00:15:18.790
out and the Vietnam war ending. I mean,

254
00:15:18.791 --> 00:15:22.450
in terms of how we look at the world now, I mean, if we look at it's 2020,

255
00:15:22.451 --> 00:15:25.270
if we look at 2000, that doesn't seem like 2003,

256
00:15:25.271 --> 00:15:26.470
that doesn't seem that long ago,

257
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:31.450
but that's kind of the timeline you're looking at. And so in a lot of ways,

258
00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:34.030
it was probably very fresh in a lot of people's eyes,

259
00:15:34.031 --> 00:15:35.320
particularly people in the Pentagon.

260
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.760
<v 1>It was quite something when it came out, it was, uh, it was, uh,</v>

261
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.180
it was like a bomb went off, went around the world. First of all,

262
00:15:43.181 --> 00:15:44.500
it wasn't just America.

263
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.760
This film played everywhere and was,

264
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.820
I guess it was a shock at the time because it was more realistic than any

265
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.830
Warfield that they had seen. And of course it was dirty. And,

266
00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:01.660
you know, I mean, it was, we had drug use in it, which was, you know,

267
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.220
the description of the division. There was a division in the, uh, army.

268
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.500
We were, we were draftees many of us, so it wasn't all volunteer, you know,

269
00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:16.240
and it wasn't all like gung-ho at all. It was a split.

270
00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.590
Uh, I just, I D I described, I showed this split as much as I could.

271
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.350
Uh, I would be in the,

272
00:16:23.351 --> 00:16:27.250
I joined the camp where the people who I would say were anti

273
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.690
authoritarian.

274
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.690
I wouldn't say they were anti-war because we didn't have anything like that

275
00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:35.740
going on. You know, it was just the army sucks. The man sucks. You know,

276
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.420
a lot of the black troops knew this.

277
00:16:37.421 --> 00:16:39.580
So there was a lot of dissension with the black troops too.

278
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.720
Cause when Martin Luther king got killed in April of 68, that had,

279
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.460
that had a negative impact over there.

280
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.080
So it was a lot going on in the country and people were seen feeling it.

281
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.480
And, uh, new,

282
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.540
new troops were coming in all the time from the country draft teams. So we were,

283
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.060
you know, you get a feeling for what's going on.

284
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.050
<v 0>The Mo did the movies feel different to you than anything else you've ever done</v>

285
00:17:02.051 --> 00:17:03.760
in terms of your obligation?

286
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.950
Because I really do think that that was the most realistic at that

287
00:17:08.951 --> 00:17:10.990
point, for sure war movie ever made.

288
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.910
And the one that left people with the most conflicted feelings

289
00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.920
and just this,

290
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:22.780
this feeling of as much as you can relay it in a film with notable

291
00:17:22.781 --> 00:17:24.930
actors that you, you,

292
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:28.840
you showed the horrors of war in a way that I don't think had ever been

293
00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:30.520
portrayed before film.

294
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.470
<v 1>When we got the details, right? I mean,</v>

295
00:17:32.471 --> 00:17:35.740
when you see a dead body and you'll see it being lifted into a helicopter,

296
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.570
that's really, it looks like a dead man and the pain of death. I mean,

297
00:17:40.571 --> 00:17:44.240
you feel the danger. It's,

298
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:48.820
it's never what you think it's going to be. It's always comes up in another way.

299
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.810
It's like sloppy sometimes and battle.

300
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.150
And that's why I don't like about a lot of the movies.

301
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.680
Battle is often just confusion, breaking down things don't work.

302
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.780
It's like Mike Tyson said, you know,

303
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.950
your plan goes out the window and you get hit in the face.

304
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.510
It's that's the way it goes.

305
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.280
It never see the Americans had a methodical way of doing it.

306
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.120
We will, we go into the jungle. We send, uh, the little guys into the jungle,

307
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.800
they meet resistance, pull back bomb, artillery, do anything,

308
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.370
take minimum casualties. That's not what the Marines did,

309
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:27.300
but that's what the Army's idea was. And that it works to a degree,

310
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:30.630
but it eradicates the hole that the bombing is,

311
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.100
is very sloppy. And not only do you have friendly fire,

312
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:37.470
but you have a lot of civilians killed too.

313
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:42.800
<v 0>Imagine when you finish a final cut of that movie and it got real,</v>

314
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.090
it had to be a very strange, almost like you're,

315
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:49.190
you're releasing a child and you're you're you, I mean, it was,

316
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:53.240
it had to have been so much more personal and so much, so much more. Yeah.

317
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.440
<v 1>I'd been through so much. I really, I didn't, I, I didn't think it was good.</v>

318
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.400
I thought it was a good movie. I thought it was a good script.

319
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.780
I didn't think I didn't expect anything. I had just done Salvador,

320
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:07.220
which was about a dirty civil war down in the, in the central America,

321
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.050
in which America, again, supported some pretty bad guys, some desk squads.

322
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.450
And I showed that and that picture had not done very well because it had been,

323
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.660
America had been very little,

324
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:24.350
no interest really in the central American issues of the 1980s to remember the

325
00:19:24.351 --> 00:19:26.510
Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua,

326
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.190
there was a lot of turmoil and Guatemala turmoil in Honduras,

327
00:19:31.191 --> 00:19:35.000
where I went down there to research Salvador.

328
00:19:35.001 --> 00:19:38.870
And what I saw in Honduras was the beginning of another Vietnam.

329
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.890
That's one of the reasons I really committed to Salvador heavily.

330
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.660
When I saw the troops, the American troops. Now there were women, men and women,

331
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.800
uh, young in uniform, many of them, national guard, troops reserves,

332
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.410
they were there building up for this.

333
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.360
I think it was pretty clear that Reagan was going to attack Nicaragua in some

334
00:19:59.361 --> 00:20:03.650
way, but it never happened because of a fortuitous accident. When the

335
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:09.710
CIA got busted for flying a cargo cargo over

336
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.770
Nicaragua. And it was a huge scandal that led to the Iran,

337
00:20:12.771 --> 00:20:14.840
Contra unraveling with Reagan.

338
00:20:14.841 --> 00:20:19.790
So Reagan was unable to do what he wanted to do in, uh, in,

339
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:24.110
uh, Nicaragua. Although we had mined the port, we'd done everything possible,

340
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.560
supporting the contrast, all that me off. In other words,

341
00:20:27.561 --> 00:20:30.830
it was like 20 years after the war, 15 years after the war here,

342
00:20:30.831 --> 00:20:33.080
I am back in central America. I'm seeing the same thing,

343
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:37.430
young guys like me in a country yet. Uh,

344
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.020
you know, just believing what they're hearing from their superiors.

345
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.740
<v 0>So you felt like this obligation to not just release Salvador,</v>

346
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.870
but also release platoon as in platoon,

347
00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.680
your experiences showing what the Vietnam war was really like.

348
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.800
And with Salvador saying, Hey, this is happening again.

349
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.120
<v 1>Yeah, I did them simultaneously, except I didn't really believe,</v>

350
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.360
I didn't believe platoon was going to work come out.

351
00:21:03.361 --> 00:21:04.890
So I didn't have much faith in it.

352
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.430
<v 0>It did come out. How much of a surprise was it when it was a giant hit? Well,</v>

353
00:21:08.431 --> 00:21:09.060
I knew that.

354
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.390
<v 1>In the moment, put it this way, the shooting was,</v>

355
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.360
you can tell from the young people, the actors and the,

356
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.920
their enthusiasm for this, they, there was a hunger, uh, to me,

357
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.640
they were so delighted, delighted to become so,

358
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.400
so soldiers for the purposes of the movie,

359
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.380
we trained them on a 24 hour basis for two weeks. And it was an eight worked.

360
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:35.820
I wanted them to get no sleep. And Dale dye helped me with that week.

361
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.990
We put them in a bivouac training situation, but a real one, I mean,

362
00:21:39.991 --> 00:21:44.130
where you don't sleep and you, you basically pulling century duty all night,

363
00:21:44.131 --> 00:21:48.810
kind of you have you split your duty with foxholes three guys and Dale would

364
00:21:48.811 --> 00:21:51.060
stage attacks and stuff in the middle of the night,

365
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.160
they were nervous and they were, they were tired beyond belief, which is good.

366
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.480
That's where you want. So how did.

367
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.550
<v 0>How did you plan this out? So when you were,</v>

368
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.570
when you were about to start filming, you had it in your head,

369
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.630
we have to make this more realistic. What's the best way to do it.

370
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.170
<v 1>From the beginning, from the beginning of the way I cast it, I wanted the,</v>

371
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.470
I wanted young people as much as possible in the, in the roles,

372
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.430
people who were fresh, who didn't look like they'd done other movies, right.

373
00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:21.640
And types. They were based on everybody. I knew in my platoon,

374
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.140
people from the south, a lot of people from the south,

375
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.030
the people from the Midwest, a lot of, uh, inner city people, uh,

376
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.260
Chicago, especially, uh, St. Louis, new Orleans,

377
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:40.610
um, and, uh, you know, Californians.

378
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:42.060
And I try to mix it all up.

379
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.510
But the whole idea from the beginning was that we're gonna make this with our

380
00:22:45.511 --> 00:22:47.970
little bit of money. We're going to make this as realistic as we could.

381
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.970
So we planned it that way. And we, the camp worked,

382
00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:56.190
we got the full cooperation of the Philippine army and some helicopters that

383
00:22:56.191 --> 00:23:00.150
they had, but very dangerous ones. But at least that was w all right.

384
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.180
<v 0>Had that ever been done before the camp that the idea of having them?</v>

385
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.510
<v 1>I don't think so. Cause that has bothered me a lot in the field,</v>

386
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.190
maybe in the oldest, but I don't, I don't know a one. No. What.

387
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:14.040
<v 0>What made you fall on that? Like what, why was that? Well, I've lived, it.</v>

388
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.780
<v 1>I've lived it, so I wanted them to above all. I wanted them to be tired,</v>

389
00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.060
irritable. It gives you a sense of what it's like in it. There's bugs,

390
00:23:24.061 --> 00:23:29.040
there's heat. It's, it's a jungle. And, uh, it's uh,

391
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.060
how do they respond to that? At first, there were a lot of.

392
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.010
There was a sag sag, the sad, sad union send you,

393
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.170
you have to have 12 hour turnaround. So a few of them quit. Really? Yeah. Wow.

394
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.910
And we replaced them.

395
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.610
I had a long list waiting list of people that I'd seen over the years. Wow.

396
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:50.241
I actually,

397
00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:55.100
Charlie sheen was the younger brother of Emil Emilio Estevez,

398
00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:59.870
who was my first choice to play it in 1983. And after the movie went,

399
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:02.480
peeled back to 86, uh,

400
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:07.190
Emilio had gotten older and I went with Charlie who came of age about that time

401
00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:10.910
was my age when I was over there. Oh, wow. So he was 1920.

402
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.620
So, you know, that's what I w I wanted those faces. Once you get the faces,

403
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.080
you can train them. And, uh,

404
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.410
Berenger and Defoe were the oldest and they, that helped enormously. They,

405
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.720
they were this, you know, anchors of, of the operation.

406
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.080
<v 0>When the film was this gigantic success that did that.</v>

407
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:36.490
How did that feel to you? Did that validate this idea that you had and.

408
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:42.070
<v 1>Shocked me. It shocked me. I mean, for years, has it been rejected 10 years?</v>

409
00:24:42.071 --> 00:24:44.590
You know, I mean, I was sick of it. I was saying,

410
00:24:44.591 --> 00:24:47.680
I'm not going to make this movie because it's going to go wrong. You know,

411
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.420
I didn't think it was possible, but because of this, you know,

412
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:56.230
Kubrick picture and the support of the English company, uh, John Daley, they,

413
00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:57.820
they wanted to make it.

414
00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:02.020
This is news for me because all my life I'm fighting to make against somebody's

415
00:25:02.021 --> 00:25:05.110
wishes. All of a sudden I got some people on my side, that's a big,

416
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.250
that's a big difference.

417
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:11.770
And the enthusiasm of the cast and Dale dye and all these great people

418
00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:16.720
and my camera, man, everybody, they loved it. And, uh, we made it and frankly,

419
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.220
we finished it. We did it on budget. And 50 was 50 days. We went 54 days,

420
00:25:21.221 --> 00:25:24.610
but that was in, we had the money in the, uh, in the, in the,

421
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:30.070
that 10% contingency. We finished it in 54 days and it was tough.

422
00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.380
Uh, and we got out of there just in time because the pontoons came and

423
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.480
in the editing right away,

424
00:25:37.481 --> 00:25:41.920
you could feel that people were reacting to it in a different way. We edited it.

425
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.970
There was no, we, we, we edited a little bit, but you know,

426
00:25:45.971 --> 00:25:49.030
we played with it playing with it. You massage it. But right away,

427
00:25:49.031 --> 00:25:51.310
I would say from the first screening on, you could tell,

428
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.690
people were responding to saying, this is real. This is, I've never seen this.

429
00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:00.460
This is real. So it, it took care of itself in a way. I mean,

430
00:26:00.461 --> 00:26:03.790
they didn't put much money in the distributing company was Orion pictures

431
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:08.140
existed that they, they put, uh, they said, well, give it a quality release,

432
00:26:08.141 --> 00:26:10.690
a few theaters at Christmas in 86.

433
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:15.700
And it opened huge first day in New York. Uh, there was a line of veterans,

434
00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:20.620
young meat, you know, veterans who were look young. I mean, not world war II,

435
00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:24.130
enters young veterans. They were around the block at the Loews Astor.

436
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.350
And I wasn't there, but people who told me that they were,

437
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.660
they went in quietly, there was a mute mute,

438
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:36.130
and they sat through the film and very little talk, very little, anything,

439
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.670
not a lot of the gung-ho stuff you hear. And at the end of it,

440
00:26:39.671 --> 00:26:42.790
they were quiet and they, some of them wouldn't get up out of their,

441
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.600
quite a few of them were sitting there, still in their seats, you know,

442
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.180
somewhere crying. He took off. Uh, and then it took off. Like, I can't,

443
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.051
I've never, you know,

444
00:26:52.051 --> 00:26:55.590
it's a phenomenon you rarely see in the world is like the top third,

445
00:26:55.591 --> 00:26:59.190
highest grossing film in America that year. And it was,

446
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.870
it was a blockbuster because no children are allowed in, you know,

447
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:06.870
and you don't have much of a woman's audience at first,

448
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.170
so you don't figure on these things, you know, uh, it,

449
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.150
it took off and kept going.

450
00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:14.430
And then the women started to come in and the third week,

451
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:19.070
as it was getting more and more talked about, there was no stopping it. Okay.
