00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now,</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.150
what is the timeline in terms of like,

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.080
does space X have a multiple stage timeline,

4
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:15.000
like a timeline for incorporating the dragon crew and then a timeline for

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.320
the star hopper and then a timeline for additional projects in the future?

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:23.720
Like as, is he thinking along these lines of like, of,

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.680
of like charted out progress?

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.760
<v 1>Oh yeah. Yeah. He's uh, in fact he,</v>

9
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:33.240
he measures pretty much every major decision by whether or not it brings the day

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.370
when we have a self-sustainable colony on Mars sooner or later,

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.360
that's the prison by which he makes every, like every single decision he makes,

12
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:44.670
he makes it through that prison. Jesus. Yeah.

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.110
So he's got an idea and he'll keep pushing and, and uh, you know,

14
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.480
he gives us aggressive timelines that we have to work to,

15
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:53.580
and we work really hard to try to try to meet him.

16
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.360
It's hard when you're doing stuff that this does this complicated to predict

17
00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:00.300
exactly how long it's going to take. So, you know,

18
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:03.990
we end up often falling a little bit behind, but we do our best. That's what.

19
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.470
<v 0>The case though, with everything that's that crazy, right? Yeah. I mean, no,</v>

20
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.930
I mean, especially with Elan, he's never writing his predictions.

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.590
All's wacky inventions. They're always a little off, you know.

22
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.720
<v 1>But, but, but he's so driven, you know, and he's such a smart guy and, um,</v>

23
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.120
and he's, he's, he's the most,

24
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.230
he's really the most driven person I think I've ever met. Uh,

25
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.120
I'll give you a story that, that kind of illustrate it once. Um,

26
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.770
when I first got hired by space X,

27
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:35.810
we did an interview with 60 minutes and they interviewed, uh, Elan and,

28
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:39.660
and myself, uh, and Scott Pelley was, uh,

29
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.720
an anchor. He talked to us and he said to me,

30
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.800
why did you leave NASA and come work for space X.

31
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.070
She had like the best gig in a world, you know, going up on rockets and stuff.

32
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:53.310
Why would you do that? And, um, I said, well,

33
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:55.800
if you can go back in time and you were a young engineer and you had the

34
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:59.280
opportunity to like get in on the ground floor and work with Howard Hughes,

35
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.180
when he was like doing all the crazy stuff he was doing. And in his day,

36
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.710
when do you want to be a part of that?

37
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.340
It's got Pelley looked at me like with a deer in the headlights look,

38
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.790
cause I don't think he knew what I was talking about, but I was like that's.

39
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.310
But then I realized, as soon as I said that, like, oh my God,

40
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.160
I just made a terrible strategic error.

41
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:20.910
I compared my boss to Howard Hughes, you know,

42
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:24.690
things didn't end up that well for Howard, you know, he went crazy, right.

43
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.020
<v 0>He went kind of crazy, became washed his hands too much. And germaphobe.</v>

44
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.230
<v 1>He was peeing in jars and like his fingernails grew out like.</v>

45
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.993
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.540
<v 1>And I was like, God, no, I really kind of stepped in it. Right.</v>

47
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.020
You don't want to say that about the boss. Right. So, um, it took a while.

48
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:46.410
It was like months later we were driving in a rental car,

49
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.120
just the two of us in Florida.

50
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:51.780
We were had a mini at NASA and we're driving back to the airport to get on his

51
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:54.930
airplane and come back to LA and I'm driving the car,

52
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:57.330
he's sitting in the passenger seat and I said, Hey boss, uh,

53
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.470
remember that time we're on. And I compared to the Howard Hughes, you know,

54
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.570
I just want you to know, I was comparing you to the young dashing,

55
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.640
starlet, dating Howard Hughes,

56
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:12.400
not the old decrepit ping and jars fingernail guy.

57
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.490
<v 0>It's all about the timeline.</v>

58
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.050
<v 1>Yeah. And I as, and, and all I got back with silence</v>

59
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.120
and now I'm really scared. Right. And, uh,

60
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.940
I'm sitting there like waiting for him to say something in any land will do

61
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.180
this. And I, he did this on your show, right. He kinda like, if you,

62
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.120
if you pose to him a serious question, he'll consider it.

63
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.930
And he'll kind of go into this almost like a trance they'll stare off into space

64
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.190
and you can see the wheels turning. He is like focusing all of his intellect,

65
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:45.850
which is considerable on his one question and that's what was happening.

66
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.430
So I waited and then he turned back to me. He said, you know, Garrett,

67
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.650
I don't think it's an apt comparison. I said, oh, okay. Uh,

68
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.570
could good. Uh, why, I'm curious, why do you think that? And he said, well,

69
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.600
none at Howard, none of Howard's designs,

70
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.070
as brilliant as they were ended up really changing the way we live our lives.

71
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.340
So we don't send, like he made the disperse goose,

72
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:15.280
which is an incredible airplane, was all wood, you know,

73
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.910
trying to solve the problem during the war of rationing.

74
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.370
So we don't send our, our,

75
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.600
our goods across the oceans and giant wooden airplanes. We don't do that. Um,

76
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.450
the H one racer was a beautiful airplane, but it was a one-off.

77
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:32.740
It never really led to a large designs that changed the way people lived their

78
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:36.160
lives. So that was his objection was not that like,

79
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:41.080
I was comparing them to some creep, but that he wants,

80
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.120
it's really important to him to have the legacy of drastically

81
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.340
impacting the way all of us live our lives.

82
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.340
So kind of the way Steve jobs did or, or others that,

83
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.640
that really moved the ball down field for humanity. That's what.

84
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.110
<v 0>He's such an unusual human. I mean, there's very,</v>

85
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.420
very few people that you could make any kind of rational comparison to other

86
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:08.190
than maybe Nikola Tesla, will you really stop and think what he's done? Yeah.

87
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.830
And the fact that he does them all simultaneously that he's involved in the

88
00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:14.340
boring project, he's involved in Tesla and space X,

89
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.690
all simultaneously and Tesla, home, solar,

90
00:05:18.691 --> 00:05:23.010
all the solar panels in the making solar tiles for roofs.

91
00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:26.610
And he's doing so many different things at the same time. It it's,

92
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.110
it's almost impossible. Like it, I don't understand how he does it.

93
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.130
<v 1>Yeah. I, I seen him do it and I still don't understand it. You know, it's like,</v>

94
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I, I kind of burned myself out just trying to do one of those things.

95
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.980
He does all of them. And, um, and he does have all the advantages of wealth,

96
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:45.420
which helps, you know, so like,

97
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:49.470
he'll have meetings with us and he'll walk out of his last meeting and he'll

98
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:52.200
walk across the street to Hawthorne airport, hop on his jet.

99
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:54.450
And he's at Palo Alto in a couple hours.

100
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:56.880
And he could be first thing in the morning at Tesla,

101
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.060
and he's got a staff to help some and you know, he's got those advantages. Um,

102
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.860
but he, he, uh, that isn't in any way,

103
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.320
describe what, or that doesn't explain why he's able to do what he does.

104
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.640
I don't know how he does it to be honest.

105
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.650
<v 0>Well, he's the next stage of humanity. Yeah. If people are evolving,</v>

106
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.610
he's, he's like looking at us from the next spot and he's like, Hey guys,

107
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.743
I've got some ideas.

108
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.510
<v 1>He's just an idea factory. And, and, um, he, his, uh,</v>

109
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.980
uh, w what's really remarkable to me is, is, is the breadth of his knowledge.

110
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.730
I mean, I've met a lot of super, super smart people, but they're usually super,

111
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.020
super smart on one thing.

112
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.510
And he's able to have conversations with our top engineers about the software

113
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.420
and the know, the most arcane aspects of that.

114
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.510
And then he'll turn to our manufacturing engineers and,

115
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:55.340
and have discussions about some really esoteric welding process for

116
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:56.910
some crazy alloy. And,

117
00:06:56.911 --> 00:07:01.010
and he'll just go back and forth and his ability to do that across all the

118
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:05.840
different technologies that go into rockets and cars and everything

119
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:08.590
else he does. That's what really impresses me. Well, also.

120
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.290
<v 0>Lack of burnout, cause he's been doing it at this incredible rate,</v>

121
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.390
16 hours a day for how long.

122
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.430
<v 1>His whole life. I think that's nuts.</v>

123
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.290
<v 0>I know. And he's still hungry for it.</v>

124
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.530
And he is still taking on these new projects and new ideas. And.

125
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.190
<v 1>Yeah. You know, at that pay seven, seven years was about as like,</v>

126
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.790
as much as I could take. I was like, I need to do.

127
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.490
<v 0>Yeah. I just don't. I, you know, I mean, I'm very happy, exists, you know? Yeah.</v>

128
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.650
But it's very confusing to me. I just feel so stupid when I'm around him.

129
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.320
You know, I, the conversations I've had with him, like, God, I'm dumb.

130
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.230
Nah, you gotta do what you gotta deal with what you got.

131
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:51.800
<v 1>I wouldn't go that far.</v>

132
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:57.110
<v 0>So his, uh, his ultimate goal is to,</v>

133
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.150
uh, create some sort of a colony on Mars,

134
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:03.770
but he believes that this technology will continue to expand to the point where

135
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:06.350
we will be leaving our source system.

136
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:11.270
We will be making human trips into other solar

137
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:13.010
systems into actual deep space.

138
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.090
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, certainly hopefully that's, you know, at some point,</v>

139
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.450
if we're going to survive, you take the really long view. You know,

140
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:22.610
the solar system is not going to last forever. Right.

141
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.430
It's going to last plenty long. If my kids are listening at home, don't worry.

142
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.440
<v 0>Freaking out right now. Oh, no daddy said we're going to die.</v>

143
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.210
<v 1>No, we got plenty of time.</v>

144
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.030
<v 0>Couple of billion years, kids relax, not in our life.</v>

145
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.290
<v 1>Um, they're so funny, but, uh, but eventually, uh,</v>

146
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.660
we're going to have to find a new home if we're going to last forever.

147
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:45.890
And we all hope that we last forever as a species, right. So, um,

148
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.730
at least most of us do. So, uh, eventually we got to get there,

149
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:52.430
but we got plenty of time in, in a, in a short term.

150
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.260
New important thing is at least getting out.

151
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:59.100
So not in just one place in the solar system because this, you know,

152
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.340
something bad could happen to this planet and we've got no backup.

153
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.050
<v 0>Right. Uh, particularly if there is a natural situation, supervolcano,</v>

154
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.970
supervolcano.

155
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.050
<v 1>Um, or, you know,</v>

156
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:13.110
we're doing a pretty good job at trashing this place all on her own. Yes.

157
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.210
We don't really need an astroid to hit us.

158
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.760
Uh we're we're kinda going down that road of,

159
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:19.530
of making displacement uninhabitable.

160
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.490
<v 0>Well, what we need is someone like Elan who concentrates on the solutions.</v>

161
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.930
I mean, he's already obviously got a full plate, many full plates,

162
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.550
but someone like him to concentrate on solutions to some of the environmental

163
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:34.050
problems that we've created for ourselves here.

164
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.440
<v 1>Well, that's really that's. That was the thought behind Tesla. I mean, so,</v>

165
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.590
so Tesla's kind of like plan a, save this planet in space.

166
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.500
X is kind of plan B uh, if you look at it that way.

167
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.040
<v 0>It's just so weird to have a guy like that amongst us.</v>

168
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.510
<v 1>You know, especially having him as your boss, it was really.</v>

169
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.000
<v 0>Weird. Do you, have you talked to him at all about simulation theory?</v>

170
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.120
<v 1>We never, the thing is when every time I talked to him,</v>

171
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:59.550
we focused on and this is what he does, you know,

172
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.290
he focuses on the thing that we are working on. Um, so it just,

173
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.720
that's one of the ways he does his time management.

174
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.720
That's one of the ways he is able to do all these things is like he doesn't sit

175
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:13.740
around and, and, and, and, and BS with you about like,

176
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.160
what's going on with, um, was a neuro link,

177
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:18.810
the company where he's making the chips that go into.

178
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.921
<v 0>I forgot about that.</v>

179
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:22.860
That's the other thing he does that one changing the way humans interface with.

180
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:24.390
<v 1>He never said to me like, Garrett,</v>

181
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:26.640
what do you think about having a chip in your head that they never,

182
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.170
he doesn't do that.

183
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.560
He talks to the people who really know about chips and PE and putting chips in

184
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:32.880
people's head. He talks to them about it.

185
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.790
<v 0>You're going to sign up for that. No,</v>

186
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.953
your face

187
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.020
expression you made. You're like, no.

188
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.540
<v 1>My website got hacked and it freaked me out.</v>

189
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.080
<v 0>Well, they they're going to put wires in your head. Right.</v>

190
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.960
That's the idea behind it. That's the idea Christ.

191
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.940
It's probably going to be inevitable. It, once it happens, I mean,

192
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:04.440
I don't want to be an early adopter,

193
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.540
but once it does happen and it really does remarkably

194
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:14.010
increase your, your ability to interface with data, because that's the idea,

195
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:18.300
right? Instead it ramps up the bandwidth in which people can access ideas and

196
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:21.270
information, and it's going to change the way we interface.

197
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.170
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I could see it being kind of an extreme have,</v>

198
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:29.220
and have not situation. Like you think about how far behind you are today,

199
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.980
how left behind you are, if you have no internet access. Right.

200
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.090
And then this will be kind of, this could be like another level of that. Yeah.

201
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.070
<v 0>I'm worried. I'm worried about that.</v>

202
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.620
<v 1>Yeah. I got other things that keep me up at night. I got.</v>

203
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:41.840
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

204
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.680
<v 1>I mean, what is it going to crazy nine-year-old and.</v>

205
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.040
<v 0>Real real-world problems.</v>
