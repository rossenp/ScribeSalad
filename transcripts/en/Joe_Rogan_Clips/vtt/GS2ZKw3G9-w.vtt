00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now,</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.490
when you came back and w w what do you do with

3
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:11.190
this information? Do you report it? Do you talk to people?

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.320
<v 1>So the typical process, anytime we fly, everything gets debriefed.</v>

5
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:18.930
So because there was a two seat airplane, uh,

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.410
usually the junior person in the jet goes down. So I was the boss,

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.680
so I wasn't going down there. So we have a thing called civic CVIC,

8
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:29.550
which is the carrier Intel center. So they go down,

9
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.190
we always take our tapes because we record stuff. When we're fighting,

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.571
they take it down.

11
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:35.940
And it's really to exercise the system when we're in training.

12
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:38.190
So that when we actually get over to, in this case,

13
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:40.260
we are going over to the Persian Gulf. You know,

14
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:42.570
anything that we do comes in and gets debrief, then it all gets sent off.

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.220
That's how you get the CNN video and all that.

16
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.090
So they go down in a debrief and I have to tell, Hey, we,

17
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.530
we chase this object. We don't know what it is, you know, and of course,

18
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:54.930
everyone now is going to make jokes because we know we're going to catch,

19
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.470
because that's how the Navy works. You know? And I told him, I said,

20
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.650
I remember telling the guy in my backseat. I said, dude, you know,

21
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:05.430
we're gonna catch maximum for this. And he goes, yes, sir.

22
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:09.600
I'll show you the comics. I have him on my phone. We do the air plan comes out.

23
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.200
So we know it's going to come down. So he goes in, he did, they debrief this,

24
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.690
both crews go in and, and, uh,

25
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.700
of course everyone at Intel thinks this is hilarious. So the flight that,

26
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.740
you know, Chad comes in with his tapes, you know,

27
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.740
and when he lands and here's the thing, oh, VFA 41 guys,

28
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:32.130
see any UFO's out there. And he pulls out that tape and drops it on the counter.

29
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:36.810
He goes, yeah, it's on here. So they're like, oh. So they copy it.

30
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.090
They play it. And there's a big, it looks like a rack system.

31
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.900
They put the 8 million, it gets copied to a hard drive and then they,

32
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.700
they archive it. So you go, okay, so they got this video and then, you know,

33
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.420
the ship, the spreads, you know, if you have a rumor on the ship,

34
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.900
5,000 people are gonna know about it within probably 30 minutes. I mean,

35
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:56.430
it spreads the F it's like a virus.

36
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.160
So the whole ship now knows that we chase this.

37
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.320
I guarantee the whole Princeton knew this stuff was going on.

38
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.990
And it goes all the way up. The Admiral knows about it.

39
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.580
The captain of the ship knew about it. And, uh, and then all the movies,

40
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.180
cause we have,

41
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.790
they play movies for us on the ship and they run like a 12 hour loop.

42
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:16.470
So of course the movie selection is men and black men and black two signs

43
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:19.680
independence day. Um, and,

44
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.170
and we know we're going to be on the airplane comment cause there's always a

45
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.960
comic. So you do some stupid or like this,

46
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:26.100
then you're going to be on the common,

47
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.870
I'll show you the comics here a little bit. They're pretty funny. Um, but, uh,

48
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.090
you know, so that went on for two days, but you know,

49
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:36.000
we're in the middle of workups and I got a squatter neuron. So it's like,

50
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.820
you know, there was after about the first day and a half early died down.

51
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.230
And then it was the,

52
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.080
there's always that closet people that you don't think that are really like UFO

53
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:45.390
buffs and you know, like we had one on one,

54
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.760
one of the Marines would always come and eat, sit down, Hey, Hey,

55
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:50.670
skipper kind of sit with you. I got it. If you want to talk about the UFO. Yes.

56
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.950
Yeah. I just, I can't get it out of my mind.

57
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.500
And then we would just sit there and talk about it, you know,

58
00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:58.730
and to me it was like, you know, we were just saying, you know,

59
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.130
my now flying career is defined by five minutes of chasing this white tic-tac

60
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.400
vise, almost 4,000 hours, you know, flying.

61
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.870
So did you encounter anyone else that had a similar experience?

62
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.560
I've talked to the guys, a couple of guys from the east coast event,

63
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.030
the gimbal video. Um, one of my talk to Daley, um,

64
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.420
he's pretty good friend of mine. Um, totally different. Now keep in mind.

65
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:25.000
Ours is 2004. Um,

66
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.120
the gimbal video is 2015.

67
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.140
The funny part about the gimbal video and the east coast stuff that was going

68
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:34.420
on. Cause that's off the vacate. So, uh,

69
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.630
off the coast of the United States are they're called warning areas and all they

70
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:40.030
are is there. If you look on a aviation map there,

71
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.620
these big areas that are blocked off by blue and they say like whiskey 2 91,

72
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:45.910
or whiskey 2 43.

73
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:49.750
And is the gimbal video available in the same way that that video is available?

74
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.740
Yes. Yeah. Okay. Find that champion. So,

75
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.310
and I was talking to him about it cause I actually a buddy of mine,

76
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.630
he just retired. He was the,

77
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.230
he led the fighter wing on the east coast and I had called him up because we

78
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:06.190
start finding out that these things were so prevalent out off the east coast of

79
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:07.540
the United States. And there's a couple of them.

80
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:09.070
So there's the we're going to talk.

81
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.010
What they started seeing originally was these things.

82
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:14.950
And one of them almost hit the airplane, almost hit one of these things,

83
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:17.950
but it looks like a cube inside of a clear beach ball.

84
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.650
So they don't know if it's actually like a surrounding or it's.

85
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:23.680
You don't know if it's a force field and you see kind of in the gimbal veal

86
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.000
video, it's got like an aura around it where ours didn't I always laugh. I go,

87
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.560
ours was a tic-tac these are not,

88
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.140
that means there's different stuff out there that we don't know,

89
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.030
but they had two airplanes flying and we fly when we go out to, to train. Uh,

90
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.430
we usually we have a distance, you know, and we'll just say, we're, you know,

91
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.900
a mile apart as we're flying out. So they're flying out and there, you know,

92
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:46.810
the airplanes are deployed, we call it combat spread. And uh,

93
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.360
one of the airplanes almost hits one of these ghosts close down,

94
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:54.310
like 50 feet down the side and almost hits one of these floating cubes inside

95
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:58.150
of the beach ball. And someone goes out and it's a, it's a balloon.

96
00:04:58.151 --> 00:04:58.931
It's not a balloon. I mean,

97
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:03.250
these things are literally sitting still they're there no effect from the wind.

98
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.230
So if you've got 90 knots of wind and they talk about it,

99
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.730
these things are just sitting there.

100
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.200
So 60 or 70 people had seen it because the radars,

101
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.910
the newer radar in the super Hornets is extremely, extremely capable.

102
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.630
Okay. And at first, when they started seeing stuff, they were like, ah,

103
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.120
it's just like, maybe it's the radar. Just give me a false target.

104
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.400
And that radar really doesn't give false targets.

105
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.960
And then someone did exactly what Chad did is they threw their targeting flare

106
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.870
out there. And all of a sudden, when you see a heat signature, there's a return.

107
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:33.730
There's obviously something out where that blip is at.

108
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.800
W what is it targeting flare? Uh, that's uh, the, we call it the 80 flirts.

109
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:41.380
It's an advanced targeting FLIR. It sits on the left side of the airplane.

110
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:44.050
And it's a, when you launch it like a flare? No, no, it's a,

111
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:46.480
it's a FLIR forward looking infrared receiver. Oh.

112
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:49.180
So when you see the bombs blowing up on TV and it's,

113
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.210
that looks like a black and white and you see it play, that's the targeting pod.

114
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.180
It's got a laser in it. It's got an iron marker in it. It's,

115
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.450
it's a very capable system, syncs up to the S to the Hornets.

116
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.630
Everything kind of marries this. So this is the go fast. Now this is go fast.

117
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.520
No, it's the other one. It's.

118
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.353
<v 2>The, what is this one?</v>

119
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.970
<v 1>What is that? That's called the go fast.</v>

120
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:10.460
That looks like a tic-tac and that was another one taken off the east coast,

121
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.220
but they grab it and it's marked that one. It's going,

122
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.770
it's screaming across the ocean at a very high rate of speed.

123
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.540
And there's been some debunkers that say, well,

124
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:18.950
that's really not going that fast.

125
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:21.560
It's just the way the airplane is and how the mechanics of the Potter work.

126
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.420
And when you talk to the crew, cause it's actually, uh, I could ask, uh,

127
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.230
my blood, I'm pretty sure it's the same backseat or took both of these videos,

128
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.830
took the go fast video and took the gimbal video.

129
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.640
And my buddy was on the flight with the gimbal video, but they, these things I,

130
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.300
so I call my bud cause I'm like, Hey, how many people are seeing these things?

131
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.090
Are I got like 60 or 70, 60 or 70,

132
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:47.780
60 or 70 people had seen these things on radar. And I said, well,

133
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:49.670
what are you doing? They said, well, we put out a no Tam,

134
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.060
which is a notice to airmen that just says, Hey, these things are out there.

135
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.100
So just be careful because we don't want you to hit one. Yeah. And, uh,

136
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.250
it's kinda like our, she go, cause you had asked, you know, who do you tell?

137
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.490
Well, everyone knows or what do you do? And I said, well,

138
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.640
cause it was all white and it didn't have any markings on it and it didn't have

139
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:11.180
any wings and it didn't have any rotors. And it was just outperformed.

140
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.140
Anything that we have.

141
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.130
I think if I would have painted China or Russia on the side,

142
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.350
is this the gimbal video? Yes. Okay.

143
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.410
So it's the same pod from the beginning chairman,

144
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.540
what we're looking at and when the crew finds it, now, what you're not seeing,

145
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.110
you're seeing the targeting. When you hear him start talking,

146
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.780
when you listen to the video, you'll hear the guy go, dude, look,

147
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.940
they're all over. Look at the essay page.

148
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:38.240
So we have a situation awareness page and whatever the radar is getting returns

149
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:41.360
on. It'll show up. It's kind of like our God's eye view in the airplane.

150
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.900
So the pod can only look at one thing.

151
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.450
So he designates that as his primary target.

152
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:51.290
So that's where the pod is steering. The radar is still seeing everything else.

153
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.440
So what they're actually seeing this video is what you're, when you see the,

154
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:56.900
the object that he's tracking. Um,

155
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.360
when I was talking to one of the other pilots, he said, there's actually,

156
00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:01.490
when you see the radar video, there's like a,

157
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.470
almost looks like a formation in front of them,

158
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:06.530
like five smaller ones that are moving in front of it.

159
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.260
And then they turn so like a formation,

160
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.930
these things turns and starts going the other way. And then the,

161
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.390
and while they're filming the gimbal video and that's kind of the comms.

162
00:08:14.391 --> 00:08:15.890
When you hear a dude, holy cow.

163
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.880
<v 2>Oh look, they're all over.</v>

164
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.380
This is a unreported new information that he's actually saying right now,

165
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.000
everybody knows this video.

166
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.660
This is the one that they say turns like the Lasar craft like belly first.

167
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.470
However, what he's telling you right now is something that is not public yet.

168
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.400
He's telling you that there was a V formation of other objects that the public

169
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:38.000
has yet to see. You're not going to, you're not going to the radar tape,

170
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.150
but there were more objects surrounding.

171
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:42.230
This is what he's telling you right now,

172
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:46.550
which is fascinating because the world doesn't know that yet. Just so you know,

173
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.370
I mean, that's brand new. That's never been reported by New York times anybody.

174
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.840
Okay. So.

175
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.253
<v 1>You can go ahead and play.</v>

176
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.160
So the cool thing with this is, you know, when he goes into, so he's an,

177
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:03.990
I R I R mode right now. You're still seeing no plume. He's looking 47.

178
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:05.370
So they're actually turning into it.

179
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:07.260
So it's starting to pull it back towards an OCL.

180
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.160
The number at the top is decreasing and it's against the wind.

181
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:14.070
Now he's in TV mode and this thing's going to just start to run.

182
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.670
You can kind of see it's got that aura around it. He said,

183
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:18.504
they were saying that the,

184
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.080
the ones with the squares inside that looked like the beach ball were the same

185
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.450
and this thing is just hanging out.

186
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.420
So it's on the airplanes in a left-hand turn. And it's,

187
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.860
so now it's right in front. Yeah. It's just rotating.

188
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.110
<v 0>No, this is how Lasar described. You don't put that up.</v>

189
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.680
Right. Um, Lasar described that,

190
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.510
that these things would lay flat and then when they would travel,

191
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.040
they would turn up on their side and that's, that's how they maneuvered.

192
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.690
So this is very similar.

193
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.280
<v 2>Eerily, similar to the propulsion system that Lasar talked about.</v>

194
00:09:56.281 --> 00:09:59.430
And that's why this video we're seeing it very differently now,

195
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.920
especially with what we know about Lasar.

196
00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:05.250
But the idea is that it would fly belly first in high speed mode.

197
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:07.830
So if they have, these are gravity propelled,

198
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:09.570
this is something that's known within the government.

199
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.240
They're trying to back engineer it. They're trying to understand it.

200
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.410
We know there's a program currently that they said is, is gone. However,

201
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:21.210
it is currently active to study this. These things will turn belly first,

202
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.650
the saucer type looking ones. And then that's the high-speed mode because they,

203
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:29.970
they focus allegedly, you know, these gravity wave amplifiers, look,

204
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.090
this thing turns mechanically there again,

205
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:38.070
no typical form of propulsion as an expert is telling you,

206
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.910
this is not a glitch. This is seen by multiple radars, multiple people,

207
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.830
commander Fravor was so close to it.

208
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.570
This is something that is not aerodynamic and it could move in ways and fashions

209
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:52.830
when he's underplaying it. When we first talked the idea of this thing,

210
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:57.270
going up, up, up, up, up, up it's instantaneous, acceleration, back and forth.

211
00:10:57.271 --> 00:10:59.790
There's no slowing down, no turning like a ping pong ball.

212
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:03.390
He said me our first talk, ping pong ball in a glove, in a glass,

213
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.200
nothing moves like that. With traditional reactionary propulsion,

214
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.490
somebody has technology that we don't have in our inventory

215
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.380
at all.

216
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.270
<v 0>So this is counterintuitive the way it goes from being aerodynamic to being</v>

217
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.560
an aerodynamic, when it goes sideways and then flies belly full.

218
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.640
<v 1>That's correct. It's well, it's not it's, uh, you know, if you talk,</v>

219
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.240
cause I was just talking to that guy the other day and he said the, the,

220
00:11:29.241 --> 00:11:33.150
the irony with is, is these things would be out there for hours. We don't have,

221
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.750
you know, a high-performance airplane does not have hours where the gas, I mean,

222
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.870
you know, harness, we, if we don't have aerial refueling, you know,

223
00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:43.260
and we're actually out doing a mission and fighting and going fast, you know,

224
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:46.530
you're talking hour and a half and you're coming back to land.

225
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.310
Some airplanes are even less, you know, based on their size. You know?

226
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.500
So if like an F 16 doesn't have external fuel tanks,

227
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:56.440
it doesn't have a lot of gas. Um, and the Soviet airplanes are the same way.

228
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.710
The make 29 does not have a lot of gas, the SU 27 seat, thirties,

229
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.180
heavy weight because of its weight, performance, uh, size of the airplane.

230
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.740
Um, so, you know, even, even our Intercontinental bombers like B2,

231
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:10.780
they still take off and the error or fuel,

232
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:14.620
they keep topped off so they can get to range. That's how we extend things. Um,

233
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.900
you got something like this, that's coming down, you know,

234
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:19.990
just think of the physics. So just the I'll use my instinct.

235
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.140
Cause that's the one I really know the best is you've got an object coming from

236
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:27.310
above 80,000 feet. So I'll just tell you, the 80,000 it's somewhere around 70,

237
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:30.190
80,000 feet is where you can actually start to see the curvature of the earth.

238
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.540
You know, so that's considered space. So they're coming from above that.

239
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.280
They're coming straight down. They stop at around 20,000 feet.

240
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.450
They hang out for three hours and then they go straight back up. So,

241
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.130
and I know you had Ilan on the show.

242
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.020
So space X is really excited because they can launch a rocket and then they can

243
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:52.870
have the booster come back to earth and actually land on a pad.

244
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.240
Very impressive engineering feat next to this technology.

245
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:03.190
That's like a model T next to a Porsche. I mean, it's like, wow, really?

246
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:04.450
That's it. You know,

247
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:07.420
and you've got something that can just at-will and move around. Now,

248
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.880
take it to the next level. And I know this is, there's a lot of talk about this.

249
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:11.710
So things was going to go into speculation mode,

250
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:14.230
but when you take a shape like that, so just take the tic-tac shape,

251
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.200
which is shaped like a submarine. If you're,

252
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.580
if you're using a propulsion that's,

253
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.480
non-reactive where you're just manipulating the media in that you're in air,

254
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.860
whatever you can go into the water. So when you, you hear the,

255
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.250
all the reports of, Hey, we've seen these things since world war two,

256
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.630
that would come out of the water and fly. If you have a technology like this,

257
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:36.010
as long as the object is sealed,

258
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:37.390
where you're not going to get water inside of it,

259
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:40.930
there's nothing that says you can't do that because all you're doing is you're

260
00:13:40.931 --> 00:13:41.764
not, you know,

261
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.130
we're a jet engine sucks in air and blows it out the back or a propeller

262
00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:47.290
actually pushes the water. It's a forest.

263
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:51.010
Now you've got something that's actually manipulating the gravity field and it's

264
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:55.990
just moving through a void. Then it doesn't then air. You could literally,

265
00:13:55.991 --> 00:14:00.430
in theory, fly, go into the ocean, cruise around, pop, back up,

266
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.180
fly around, go to space. You're nothing you,

267
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.000
you remove the barriers of the normal propulsion that we have today.
