00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.690
<v 1>Experience. That tells you that the calls.</v>

3
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.510
<v 0>Are not the problem was who was he running against?</v>

4
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.910
I don't think that would've worked. He was running against Obama.

5
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.970
I think Hillary is such a deeply flawed candidate.

6
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.860
And so many people despised her.

7
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:17.910
And during the me too era like her creepy

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.460
husband is just looming in the distance like Nosferatu. I mean,

9
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:28.380
how many women have come out and accused that guy of sexual assault and rape

10
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:30.990
and, and he's still hovering. I mean,

11
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:34.140
he's still around and that's always going to haunt her.

12
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.180
She's connected to that guy forever.

13
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.130
<v 1>On this topic. There's an amazing story. So during, uh, the election,</v>

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.510
remember when the story broke of Trump on video saying I grabbed by the.

15
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.591
I don't even wait.

16
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:49.500
And everybody blew up and all the mainstream media talking heads were like,

17
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.890
oh my God, it's over. He's going to drop out. It's over. It's done.

18
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.870
What did Trump do at that next debate?

19
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:58.140
This was actually low key political brilliance instead of doing what every other

20
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.130
politician would have done,

21
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:01.320
which is basically kind of given a little bit and be like, all right,

22
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.520
you got me what he did.

23
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:04.860
He leased a short apology video real quick out of the way.

24
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:08.490
Then the next night was a debate at the debate, Joe,

25
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.500
he brought like eight bill Clinton accusers put them in the audience and

26
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:15.900
then he goes out there on stage. And when he's asked the question,

27
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.990
the first thing he says is, listen, I'm not proud of what I said.

28
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.890
It wasn't a good thing. What I said. But what I did was just words,

29
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.280
what bill Clinton did was actions, folks. It was actions.

30
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.020
So if you want to see who the real problem is,

31
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.880
he's sitting right there in the audience.

32
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.870
And the brilliance of that move is this is politics 1 0 1,

33
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.230
never really go on defense. Your best defense is a really good offense.

34
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.530
So he made it a wash, all of a sudden this issue, which was supposed to be,

35
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.340
oh my God, it's the end of Donald Trump. Now the whole conversation shifted to,

36
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.610
I mean, there are a lot of accusations against bill aren't there.

37
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:49.980
So maybe this is a wash and we need to just kind of move on from this topic

38
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:51.630
completely. That's all he had to do.

39
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.690
And you see it with every single scandal that Trump's involved in.

40
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.410
You see how incredibly pathetic and ineffectual and weak the Democrats are at

41
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:02.700
marketing and strategizing and you see how good he is because he is no matter

42
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:05.460
what it is. He's going to flip it. He's going to flip it back on you.

43
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:06.870
So the new thing is the Ukraine thing.

44
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.370
I don't know how closely you've been following this,

45
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.810
but the Ukraine thing you basically got caught on a phone call asking for dirt

46
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:14.460
on his political opponents, Joe Biden.

47
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:17.610
He was talking to the president of Ukraine and he said it in so many words.

48
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:19.440
I mean, he likes say there was no quid pro quo,

49
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.210
but there doesn't have to be it's implied.

50
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:22.380
Everybody knows what you're asking for.

51
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:24.180
You're asking for dirt on your political opponent, right?

52
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.910
Everybody's melting down and going, oh my God, man, you can't do that.

53
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.250
This is violating. Every rule is violating every norm.

54
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:30.780
This is not something any president should be doing,

55
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:33.330
relying on a foreign power to get dirt on your political opponents.

56
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.330
What does Trump do? Again? It goes right back on the offense.

57
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.380
And he goes out there and says,

58
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.170
I have every right as president to investigate corruption.

59
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.250
And Joe Biden is incredibly corrupt. And all I'm doing is I'm, you know,

60
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.030
trying to figure out why was hunter Biden getting $50,000 from an energy

61
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:51.360
company? He doesn't know anything about energy. Why is he getting this?

62
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.240
And so now again, the conversation isn't man,

63
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.330
Trump shouldn't have been doing that. The conversation is okay, sure.

64
00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:58.440
Maybe Trump shouldn't be doing that,

65
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.480
but Joe Biden's son and Joe Biden's family has really corrupt.

66
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.970
<v 0>Well, how about the video where you, you saw the video where Trump released it,</v>

67
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.160
where it was Biden, talking about the loan, like explaining.

68
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.791
<v 1>Okay.</v>

69
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:16.180
So this one I'll give you what the Democrats say and I'll give you what the

70
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:18.400
Republican side the Democrats say, Hey man,

71
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.430
that's a misleading video because yes, it's true. Uh,

72
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:24.310
Biden was holding a billion dollar subsidy over the head of Ukraine to fire a

73
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:25.144
prosecutor.

74
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.860
But Biden wanted to get rid of the corrupt prosecutor and bring in a non-corrupt

75
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:30.521
prosecutor.

76
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.250
That's why he was doing what he did and holding that subsidy over their head.

77
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.360
And they say the prosecutor that eventually came into place actually

78
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:41.890
investigated the Biden family more. So that's why the Democrats say there's,

79
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:44.710
you know, you're, you're kind of misleading by putting this out there.

80
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.500
The argument that Trump is making is, well, no,

81
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:51.670
you're holding a billion dollar subsidy over the head of a foreign government

82
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.400
and saying you have to listen to us and do X, Y, and Z.

83
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.410
That's problematic in and of itself. But furthermore, it's like it's corruption.

84
00:03:59.411 --> 00:03:59.711
Anyway,

85
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:02.530
we know that the only reason hunter Biden was getting paid $50,000 a month.

86
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:06.070
And actually now people are saying it's not 50,000, that's $83,000 a month. Um,

87
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.780
is because his last name is widen. And so it's, pay-to-play corruption, $83,000.

88
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.613
<v 0>A month. There's a lot of.</v>

89
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.460
<v 1>Money.</v>

90
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.820
And this is where I think like Democrats are silly because they always find the

91
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.950
weakest anti-Trump argument possible.

92
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:21.160
And now they're put in a position where they have to try to say like, oh,

93
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.940
the Bidens did nothing wrong at all. And Trump is all bad. And bottom line,

94
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:27.490
nobody's going to believe that the Bidens did nothing wrong when you're getting

95
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:30.940
$83,000 a month. And you know anything about natural gas, right? What was.

96
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.130
<v 0>The justification for the $83,000?</v>

97
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.070
<v 1>I don't even know what they give is there's the justification. I mean,</v>

98
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:38.680
the only thing I heard from, I think it was Ted Lou was a,

99
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:41.290
he's a democratic Congressman was, you know, Hey man,

100
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:45.340
people sit on boards and there was nothing wrong there, which is really weak.

101
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:46.570
But here's the thing. And this is again,

102
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:50.080
why the Democrats drive me crazy is like they picked the weakest of all

103
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.930
anti-Trump arguments. So they wanted to use this as like, oh,

104
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:54.430
we're going to try to impeach him over this.

105
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:56.740
And this is going to be the thing that we're going to hang our hat on.

106
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:57.940
And Nancy Pelosi even said,

107
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.880
we're going to limit the scope of the impeachment investigation to only this

108
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.220
only the Ukraine phone call. And then somebody like me,

109
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:06.550
I'm sitting there and I'm pulling my hair out because I can actually give you

110
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.150
like three or four super legitimate things. They're impeachment worthy.

111
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.250
Not that I think it strategically makes sense.

112
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:13.450
And we can get into that if you want to.

113
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:18.220
But like the one that drives me crazy is Donald Trump has a

114
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:20.380
hotel in Washington, DC that he owns, okay.

115
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.940
He took $300,000 through that hotel from the Saudi government.

116
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.820
So they're funneling him money through his hotel in DC.

117
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.630
And then Donald Trump turns around and gives a multi-billion dollar weapons deal

118
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.750
to the Saudi government. As they're committing a genocide in Yemen,

119
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.970
we know they're committing a genocide in Yemen.

120
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.110
We know that we're arming them and he gave them even more weapons because he got

121
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:44.560
that money through his hotel. So for me, I'm looking at that and I'm going,

122
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.370
oh my God, this scandal has everything. It's got personal corruption.

123
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.600
It's got guns going to a vicious genocidal country. What was.

124
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.510
<v 0>The money for the money in the hotel? Okay. So.</v>

125
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.590
<v 1>What they did is they had these like little retreats at the hotel and Saudi</v>

126
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.940
Arabia would pay for us veterans to go and stay at these hotels. And they would,

127
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:07.550
I don't know if it's like tours of the capital or whatever it is,

128
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.010
but they pay for these veteran groups to go to the hotel.

129
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.260
But then of course you look at it and you go, I don't know, man, $300,000.

130
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:17.900
And the speculation is, well, of course they overpaid on purpose,

131
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.880
but furthermore, even if they didn't,

132
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.660
Jimmy Carter had to sell his peanut farm when he was president,

133
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.950
because the idea was, Hey, we're not even saying you're doing anything corrupt,

134
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.340
but just the fact that you have this personal private business,

135
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.390
it is theoretically possible that foreign governments want to give you money

136
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.590
through your peanut farm.

137
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.560
So you have to sell it because just the existence of it enough,

138
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.310
it is enough to say it violates the emoluments clause of the constitution,

139
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.360
which is just a fancy way of saying that the president can't be corrupt and take

140
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:50.300
money from foreign governments. And Trump is doing that. And he just is.

141
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.080
<v 0>All right, so this $300,000 though, this is for services rendered.</v>

142
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:55.250
This is for hotel rooms.

143
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.020
<v 1>Well, that's what they say is it's for,</v>

144
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:59.090
I guess the meals and the hotel rooms and whatnot.

145
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.110
<v 0>I hate to say it this way, but that's not a lot of money to someone like them.</v>

146
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.040
Well.

147
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.280
<v 1>Then what I always think about when people make that point is you have to flip</v>

148
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:08.570
it. What would we be saying?

149
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:12.950
If it was the Clinton foundation getting $300,000 from the Saudi government and

150
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:16.970
then Hillary Clinton as secretary of state approving a weapons deal to Saudi

151
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:17.210
Arabia.

152
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.240
And the fact of the matter is that actually is almost exactly like what happened

153
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:21.110
with the Clinton foundation,

154
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:24.530
because bill Clinton was going around and giving speeches at all these,

155
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:27.200
you know, Gulf dictatorships. And then he was getting, you know,

156
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:29.240
500,000 bucks a pop or whatever it was.

157
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:31.760
And then Hillary Clinton was approving weapons deals, the secretary of state.

158
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.983
<v 0>So, but the see that,</v>

159
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.380
I feel like that's a little bit more agregious because he speeches are

160
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:41.090
worthless. Like at least the, the hotel rooms, it's like real,

161
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.990
it's real food. He's it's meals like that actually costs money.

162
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.220
These speeches are worthless. That's a, in my opinion, in my opinion,

163
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.790
those speeches are a transparent bribe.

164
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.750
<v 1>So do you think though that a president should be able to have private</v>

165
00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:59.300
businesses, the foreign governments can pay him any amount of money? No.

166
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.870
<v 0>I think so. I don't, I don't, but I just don't think they're comparable.</v>

167
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.000
Like I think with the Clinton foundation,

168
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:08.120
I think the Clinton foundation was agregious really gross.

169
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.261
<v 1>Right? Well,</v>

170
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:11.960
I think both of those things are egregiously gross and I do think it influences.

171
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.620
<v 0>I think it sure it sure influences him because there's a deal, right?</v>

172
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:17.780
They have a deal, even if it's only $300,000,

173
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:20.270
which I know most people hear this, or like that was a lot of money.

174
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.020
It's a lot of money to me, but is it a lot of money to a billionaire?

175
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.800
I don't necessarily think it is. And it's,

176
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.610
it's also a lot of money that goes through his organization and that it costs

177
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:32.870
money to make that money.

178
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:37.670
So how much profit is that at a $300,000 is not that much profit with

179
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.020
$500,000,

180
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:43.970
a speech that's one talk for one hour and it costs

181
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.840
nothing for him and he's making a half a million dollars and he did it over and

182
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:51.710
over and over and over and over again. And it was all under this.

183
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.580
The guys of the Clinton foundation is doing this great charitable work all

184
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:58.650
across the country and all across the world.

185
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:01.350
And that to me was more transparently.

186
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.220
<v 1>Yeah. So I understand, I understand why you would say that,</v>

187
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.450
but I also think that, um, there's a problem with it in principle.

188
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.720
So I would just nip it in the bud. No questions asked, but beyond that,

189
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.000
there's also other stuff too. I'm just giving you one example.

190
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:16.890
There's so there's the other thing, which again,

191
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.700
very few people spoke about or recognize that during the campaign,

192
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:24.990
Donald Trump registered eight new businesses in Saudi Arabia. So again,

193
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:27.480
when you're running for president, it's, you know, you're,

194
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.710
it's a public service you're trying to serve your country and you shouldn't

195
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.160
intertwine business with that in any way, shape or form.

196
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:38.040
There's another one I believe he has. He has a hotel in, uh,

197
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.420
in Turkey and now his argument by the way is no it's okay because I transferred

198
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:45.600
all this to my kids. So while I'm president my kids take,

199
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:47.040
run my businesses and take care of it.

200
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.340
But I think that's just a total nonsense Dodge because you're still,

201
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:53.120
your family is still profiting from it. And here's a crazy fact, Joe,

202
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.730
then this one w really just blew my mind, um,

203
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.040
with Trump in office in one year, Jared and Ivanka made,

204
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:06.150
I think it was 82 or $83 million in one year,

205
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.330
how through, through their businesses. And they say, oh,

206
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:10.800
there's nothing to see here. There's no problem.

207
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:12.540
But then you dig into the specifics. And yet again,

208
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:16.860
you see so many sketchy things like Jared Kushner got like millions of dollars

209
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.030
from Israeli banks. Why? And then this is the guy who they say, it's okay,

210
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:23.190
he's going to broker a peace deal between Israel and Palestine.

211
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.800
One of the sides is given him millions of dollars.

212
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:27.210
You think that's going to be a fair piece deal.

213
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.540
It's going to be the most lopsided peace deal in history.

214
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.570
And this is the problem is that. And again, for the Trump example,

215
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.660
it's just that he kind of ripped the mask off and shows you what everybody's

216
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:40.470
doing. Um, but it's not like it didn't happen with bill Clinton. It's not like,

217
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.760
like with Barack Obama, it was wall street appointed his entire administration.

218
00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:47.730
I believe he got a list from city group to, to, you know,

219
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.070
put people in his cabinet and it's like,

220
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:53.790
this is the way the system functions and my opinion is it,

221
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:56.010
should you shouldn't be taking money from foreign governments.

222
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.500
You shouldn't be taking money from corporations.
