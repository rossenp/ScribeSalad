00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's the same with Khabib Khabib didn't find buddy,</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.360
no mother. He makes them look like they're fighting me. That's the difference.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:09.680
Look what he.

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.040
<v 1>Did to just engage you. That's all you need to know. If you say Justin gauges,</v>

5
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:16.100
a nobody, you're crazy. You watched that Tony Ferguson fight just engage.

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.750
He's a animals Savage.

7
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.280
And he just closed that gap and he ate a lot of leg kicks to men.

8
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.800
He had a lot of leg kicks. That would, I mean,

9
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.840
I don't know how many of those you can eat from Justin.

10
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.420
Maybe he had like five or six more in the tank, right?

11
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.300
You're on E but he closed the gap.

12
00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:35.540
And then one of them finishing with a triangle off of his back. I mean, God.

13
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.480
<v 0>A serious question about this. Cause I went through it a couple of times.</v>

14
00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:42.590
So from the moment he got kicked and he initiates the take downs, it was a kick.

15
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.130
He tried the first round. He did it over the head inside single didn't work.

16
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.650
Second round. He tried it off a double from the outside lake kick.

17
00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:52.370
First run was an inside liquor cuts. Hence the inside single didn't work.

18
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:56.360
So then he goes to the double it's 22 seconds from that until the finish.

19
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.890
So 22 seconds we're apart 22 seconds later. You're unconscious. I mean,

20
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.930
this is my question to you. Is that the best Bactec you've ever seen in MMA?

21
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.110
Because what he does is when Gacy is sprawling in this contest,

22
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.810
he's not just sprawling. He is sprawling and turning.

23
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.340
So he doesn't get pushed into the fence.

24
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:15.770
He was very diligent about that and the Alvarez and the gateway fights,

25
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:18.360
you can go back and you can watch it. So in this fight, when you was,

26
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:23.090
you see the level change that could be pits. You see automatically gateway turn.

27
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.710
Cause he doesn't want to get turned that direction.

28
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:28.610
But what could be does is he actually scoots under him, pulls him up.

29
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.970
And then with his head, posts them over, gets the hands to plant. Well,

30
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:34.040
once the hands are planted, the double is over.

31
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:36.830
He doesn't care about it anymore. Now he just wants the tight waist.

32
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.610
And from the tight waist, he's holding his elbows. Aren't flared.

33
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.440
They're tight here, right? Like he's T-Rex.

34
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.910
And inside at that point you have created, if you're just engaging,

35
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.000
putting your hands,

36
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.810
you've created a stable structure for this guy to now Mount plus,

37
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:55.160
if you want to skip to the fence to like stand, he can control the ascent.

38
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.810
So he goes, double turns, pushes hands to the mat,

39
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.570
forces Gatesy down. And then with his, uh,

40
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.430
his Gable grip then keeps it there and then replaces it with the hooks and then

41
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:11.900
turns into it. Turns it to a fake, not a real Joe Rogan, a fake,

42
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.810
uh, had an arm triangle attempt, just so gates.

43
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:16.490
He gets his elbows away from his body.

44
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.270
Then he chair sits to occupy the space,

45
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.470
then throws the leg over and then sits back and takes mercy upon him.

46
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.520
As we learned later from Daniel Cormier, rather than armbar him from his moms,

47
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.340
I'm just going to try and give you, cause that's the merciful.

48
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.260
This guy is at her taking pity on his opponents and he's doing back ticks

49
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:36.681
like that.

50
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:40.550
He is John Jones to me is the most accomplished fighter we've ever seen.

51
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:43.520
Like the, the, the things accumulate over time.

52
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.270
No one is as flawless as could be number command off. Okay. Not even.

53
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.580
<v 1>Close. I think that is the argument, right? Like who is the goat?</v>

54
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.250
I think if you look at Jon Jones, his early career, right?

55
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.800
John Jones wins the title in 2011 and from then on has fought more

56
00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:00.820
fights as championship fights. Then he has other fights.

57
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.790
So he's the most accomplished for sure wins the title,

58
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.350
earliest youngest guy to ever win the title in the UFC beats.

59
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.600
Maricio Shogun Hua. Who's a legend.

60
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.640
And then the way he dominates all these other fighters up until you

61
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:17.170
get to Alexander Gustafson,

62
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:20.260
you could make the argument that he had a similar career.

63
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.230
You could make the argument. Like if you look at what he did,

64
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.930
John didn't lose any rounds. John was smashing people.

65
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.220
You look what he did to Rashad Evans, rampage, Jackson, look what he did.

66
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.860
Liotta Machida look what he did to everybody. All, everybody,

67
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:36.610
he fought up until the Gustafson fight, but the Gustafson fight,

68
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.930
then you have to say, well,

69
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:42.460
how much slack do you give him for admittedly not training because it was a

70
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.950
really close fight. He pulls it out in the championship round.

71
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:47.620
Even though he's out of shape, even though you talked to Greg Jackson,

72
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:51.250
he didn't train for that fight. Didn't train, like barely worked out,

73
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.290
but definitely didn't go through a training camp.

74
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.750
Still managed to beat one of the best guys in the division.

75
00:03:55.751 --> 00:04:00.040
After getting taken down for the first time in his career, then goes on a tear,

76
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.940
right? Beats look at the way he beat Daniel Cormier in the first fight,

77
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.240
took him down like who the takes Daniel Cormier down. Right?

78
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.070
And then you look at him in the second fight.

79
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.980
Even though it was ruled a no contest, we know what the happened.

80
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.910
He had kicked him and stopped him. You know, it was spectacular.

81
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.070
You look at what John has done.

82
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.220
Then you have to take into account the things that didn't go that well.

83
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.430
And we haven't seen those from Khabib yet you have to take into account the

84
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:28.840
fight, like Tiago Santos, right? That. It goes to a split decision.

85
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.230
And you're like, whoa, Dominick, Reyes, Dominick Reyes thought he won the fight.

86
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.080
Right? Real close, real close fight.

87
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.740
So those fights haven't happened with Khabib yet.

88
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.820
And we don't know if they ever could. We don't know. Right? Like right now,

89
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:45.640
would you see flawless victory after flawless victory?

90
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.430
You can maybe make the argument that could be lost two rounds,

91
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:49.264
his entire career,

92
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.670
maybe the second round against Justin or a first round rather,

93
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.010
maybe first round, rather against Justin and maybe the third round with Connor.

94
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.680
That's right. That's it. And either one of those didn't get cut.

95
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.330
Didn't get dropped. Didn't get hurt. Right?

96
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.880
<v 0>Never get cut into, never get dropped.</v>

97
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:05.580
I don't think folks understand what that means in a sport filled with.

98
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.920
It's not a scientific measurement per se, right?

99
00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:09.240
Who gets cut the most or something,

100
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:14.220
but in a sport built on unpredictability on violence, uh,

101
00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:17.220
you know, St. Pierre went to wrestling to get away from all of that in large,

102
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.950
in large part. And then to never experience that, it's like,

103
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.950
it is shocking beyond description. It's shocking.

104
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.290
I don't know how to explain that to folks it's uh, but to your point,

105
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.560
the thing about could be where we fall short is that it's just an inevitability.

106
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.420
Like you're run through 29 fights is the best one I've seen through 29 fights

107
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.260
ever, ever. But you know, and John's not my best friend or anything,

108
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:38.550
but I just don't.

109
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.370
That is the best total resume I've ever seen.

110
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.580
John is the best resume. It's just, it's not, I mean, I know he got, he was,

111
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.570
he was getting all salty on Twitter being like these cubby fans. It's like,

112
00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:53.700
dude, here's shouldn't do that. Oh, you shouldn't do it.

113
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:55.530
But here's my point to John. It's like, dude,

114
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.980
put the keyboard down for just a second. Here's what's going to happen.

115
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.520
You're going to go to heavyweight and you're going to probably win. I mean,

116
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:02.241
I don't know, that's a guarantee,

117
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:04.760
but let's assume that you do all of the conversation.

118
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.570
Everything that happens right now is just recency bias and could be retired and

119
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.620
his father died and it was this incredibly sad and like yeah, inspiring moment.

120
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.560
Let the guy have his moment. Because when you have your moment,

121
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.740
all of the con the warm is going to turn and then Aaron's going to be like,

122
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.360
John's the greatest it's he's going to get his just not today at this moment.

123
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.010
Recency.

124
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.360
<v 1>Bias. That's real recent biases. That's a real thing. Like,</v>

125
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.141
you know,

126
00:06:29.141 --> 00:06:33.670
we just watch cubby and then the fact that could be did supposedly retire. Come.

127
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.300
<v 0>On. So yeah, I know. I haven't eaten much. So my head is spinning a little bit.</v>

128
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.390
That's all right. Everyone asks me when they, when I go on, I was like,

129
00:06:40.391 --> 00:06:42.730
are you going to smoke weed? I'm like, there's no chance I'm smoking.

130
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.350
<v 2>Joe. Rogan's stuff.</v>

131
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.730
<v 1>There's no chance I'm smoking it right now. I haven't done anything in a month.</v>

132
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.070
I had a couple glasses of wine last night and I was like, woo.

133
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.800
<v 0>Yeah, I'm feeling it a little bit. Careful.</v>

134
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.020
<v 1>The, um, the John Jones situation is also a, it's a contrast in personalities,</v>

135
00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:02.680
right? It could be, who's a really religious,

136
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.910
very moral, ethical person who doesn't drink.

137
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:09.310
He doesn't party doesn't do anything. He just trains.

138
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.320
He's always in phenomenal shape.

139
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.090
He takes every fight incredibly serious. He's never been out of shape.

140
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.130
He's never been fat has never, I mean,

141
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.320
he's missed weight a couple of times earlier in his career,

142
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:24.790
but he got that dialed in. He's he's just so dedicated.

143
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.850
Whereas John is a wild man. It's just wild.

144
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.490
<v 0>I mean, you're talking about not training for the ma so excuse me for the, um,</v>

145
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.800
the Gus of some fight, buddy, that ain't the only fight he didn't try for.

146
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.080
<v 1>Cormier. I did Coke. I still beat you.</v>

147
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.500
<v 0>Like, I don't think he's lying. I mean, the stories I've heard,</v>

148
00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:43.540
I don't want to repeat them because I cannot verify them,

149
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.080
but I've heard stories. Like, if you all think that was the one fight,

150
00:07:47.081 --> 00:07:48.210
he just like, oh, I'm going to take that.

151
00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:50.920
I'm going to pump the brakes this time. No. I mean,

152
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.210
here's the other part about it? It's like, um, when you, so who's a guy,

153
00:07:55.211 --> 00:07:57.150
for example, who maintained dominance with the game,

154
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.950
it took significant amounts of time off in boxing.

155
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.960
Floyd Mayweather would be a great example of that.

156
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:07.150
But Floyd has been training as a family affair from adolescents,

157
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.190
right? For the long part of his life.

158
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.100
And he is so gifted that he can take time off.

159
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.880
And the game is so developed that people aren't going to make warp speed

160
00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:18.070
development in his absence. And so they got a little bit better.

161
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.920
Every time he took a little bit time off like the Madonna first fight with the

162
00:08:20.921 --> 00:08:25.000
corkscrew punch. It was a little bit of a, of a wild card there. But in general,

163
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:27.280
he was able to maintain that dominance in MMA,

164
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.750
the game changes rapidly super fast because people are still discovering best

165
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:33.670
practices. In two years,

166
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.420
people will not be doing the same kinds of things to the same degree they do.

167
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:41.230
Now, the calf kick and its explosion, as a result of an obvious example of that.

168
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:46.450
John was doing things like not training between camps. I mean,

169
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:49.390
that's something only elite boxers do because they'd been doing this since they

170
00:08:49.391 --> 00:08:53.470
were five, six years old and they can take the time to not necessarily do that.

171
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:57.300
Whereas most MMA fighters are, I'm a lawyer, I'm an everyday martial artist.

172
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.300
I just ramp it up. He would do nothing.

173
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:04.830
And then something and still go out there and beat world champions in what at

174
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:09.660
the time was the UFC's marquee division that is out of this

175
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.180
world bonkers. I'm going to train,

176
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.980
I'm going to beat you as like a part-time guy.

177
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.860
What you just couldn't wrap your head around.

178
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.970
<v 1>I wonder if maybe there's some benefit to it.</v>

179
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.620
Cause it's not like you got totally out of shape,

180
00:09:21.621 --> 00:09:24.980
but I wonder if there's some benefit to that and that he's not getting beat up.

181
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.350
He's not getting his joints wrecked. And you know, there's probably is a launch.

182
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.190
Yeah. It's a real question of like, what is, what's the best way to approach it?

183
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.800
Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.

184
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.950
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

185
00:09:42.951 --> 00:09:44.120
they're going to be available everywhere,

186
00:09:44.121 --> 00:09:47.690
but after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

187
00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:51.710
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

188
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.780
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much.

189
00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:57.890
Buh-bye.
