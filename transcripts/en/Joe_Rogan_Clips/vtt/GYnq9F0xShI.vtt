00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.880
<v 2>It's really interesting watching someone's path when you know that they already</v>

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.080
did it. That's, there's something about that,

4
00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:13.000
like reading about Kinison like knowing that he already did it like to,

5
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.160
just to read the path and how it all.

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.440
<v 1>Went down. Yeah. And it's interesting too, if you look at like, you know,</v>

7
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:19.800
prince had a really good book and it was actually a collection of things he'd

8
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.270
written with somebody just before, uh, that he passed,

9
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.390
but you read the book and like, it's interesting, cuz you're like, you are,

10
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:26.911
of course, you know,

11
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:29.630
he's gonna be prince one of the more talented people that may ever, you know,

12
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:30.464
walk the planet.

13
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.990
And so you're reading it and you're hearing him get denied with demo tapes and

14
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.270
you're hearing no one's believing in him that he's a weird kid and all that,

15
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.990
but you know that he's prince. Yeah. You have like, as you read the book,

16
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.700
you kind of have a secret that like you're unstoppable.

17
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.700
Like this stuff doesn't really matter what you're going through in your high

18
00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:49.420
school and you like basketball and this person denied and that person didn't

19
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.940
wanna be like, none of this is it's interesting,

20
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.340
but what's actually most fascinating is you literally were,

21
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:55.700
you were destined to be prince one way or another. Yeah.

22
00:00:55.701 --> 00:01:00.020
This stuff is almost inconsequential. You're going to be prince someday. Well,

23
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:00.180
it.

24
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.970
<v 0>Is fascinating. No knowing that he, he did become prince,</v>

25
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.810
but you kind of feel the anxiety of the journey, right?

26
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.810
Like when you're reading about someone, even though, you know,

27
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:12.170
it is inconsequential, you are, there's no denying, he became prince,

28
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.570
but he didn't know that while it was all going down. No, that's, what's.

29
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.890
<v 1>Cool about it, but it's fun to read.</v>

30
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.530
You can read that and you can hear the people who don't believe in him and he

31
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:22.280
can be, you know, like we all have a, uh,

32
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.960
I missed that one kind of moment or I didn't see that. But like

33
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
imagine be the guy who's like yeah. You know, I had prince came into my,

34
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.800
I didn't hear it. Yeah. I didn't hear it. &lt;laugh&gt;.

35
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.840
<v 0>I remember the exact moment. I first listened to prince.</v>

36
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.120
I was in an Audi Fox. I had an Audi Fox, this,

37
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.150
his little front wheel draw I car.

38
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.990
I was driving on the Massachusetts turnpike and I had a cassette that I just

39
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:49.910
bought and I just unrepped it.

40
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.390
And I popped it into the cassette player and it was, uh, I, listen,

41
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.310
I'm gonna be your lover. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I wanna be your lover, that song.

42
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.990
And it was the one where, you know, the cassette where him it's like,

43
00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:02.550
he's got no shirt on and it's like, he's just staring at the camera.

44
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.060
And I remember thinking like, holy, like who is this guy? Yeah.

45
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.900
Like this is just different. Yeah. You know, it's like,

46
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:13.700
he's singing in a falsetto about being in love with a girl and his,

47
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.100
his voice is incredible. Well, you.

48
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.460
<v 1>Could be that outrageous if you're gonna be really good. Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.340
We get a lot of the other,

50
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:22.260
which is people who are outrageous and they're compensating for not really

51
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:26.170
having much to sing or say, but like right. He had, he was fully loaded.

52
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:26.650
He had all.

53
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.210
<v 0>Of it. Well, he was that guy. I mean, that's who he was. I mean,</v>

54
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.850
it was outrageous because he was an honestly eccentric human being.

55
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.970
I mean, that really was who he was and insanely talented, eccentric human being.

56
00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:40.130
Yeah.

57
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.400
<v 1>You know, I met him once. Actually I met him with Dean Delray, no way. Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.760
At a club out in, uh, in New York, uh, maybe it's early two thousands.

59
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.400
And I forget what the club was. It was very, very, it was crowded and somebody,

60
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.600
this is a true story. Somebody had come to me and said, uh,

61
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.440
tap me on the shoulder said, you know, prince is here.

62
00:02:56.441 --> 00:03:00.600
He wants you to come sit down. And uh, I seriously,

63
00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:03.640
I heard I followed and I thought I was gonna go sit with prince William. Ah,

64
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.960
&lt;laugh&gt; that, that sounded more believable to me. That sounded like I,

65
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:12.160
that I believed. And then we went over and it was obviously prince Roger Nelson.

66
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.120
Yeah. But it was a, it was a really funny night. I'm glad Dean was there too.

67
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.070
Um, we sat in a booth and it was prince and it, his lawyer bodyguard.

68
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.710
<v 0>He had a lawyer slash.</v>

69
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.950
<v 1>Bodyguard. That's what he was.</v>

70
00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:26.630
And he was a very big guy and we sat in a booth &lt;laugh&gt; and it's hard to imagine

71
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.190
now that like, you know, the guy,

72
00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:32.870
he wasn't like being swarm with people in the sprints, you know? But, um, it,

73
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.110
the, he, it it's awkward. It's like, you know,

74
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.510
he sitting four of us from the booth, just kind of like you don't.

75
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.540
I know what to say. And it's kind of, so if he did,

76
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:41.700
if I did wanna really have a conversation, it'd be difficult,

77
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.140
but the bodyguard kind of nudges me and he says, you know,

78
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:48.620
it's been 25 years since, uh, purple rain. And I was like, oh, that's awesome.

79
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.740
And then he, he he's sitting next to me. He goes, excuse me. I said,

80
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:56.380
that's awesome. He goes, what's awesome. I go, the,

81
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.130
the purple rain is 25 years old. What, what a great record. And he goes,

82
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.810
great record. I say, yeah. He goes, well, tell him he he's pointing at prince.

83
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.730
So now I'm like, he's a very large man.

84
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.610
He's like nudging me when I'm thinking that's amazing prince. You're just like,

85
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.610
he is, he, he cannot be insecure that people don't love purple rain,

86
00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:17.370
but I lean over and I say, you know, purple rain like, wow, 25 years,

87
00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:20.320
what a great record. And he kind of fanned himself. He's like, well,

88
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:21.480
you think so? And like,

89
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.200
even prince needed to hear once in a while that he was awesome. How.

90
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.560
<v 0>Weird is it? His bodyguard, his big giant dudes,</v>

91
00:04:27.561 --> 00:04:29.960
like nudging you to tell prince that he's awesome. I.

92
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.560
<v 1>Felt like I got set up, like he knew prince needed a compliment.</v>

93
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:33.800
Maybe I'd be nervous.

94
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.080
<v 0>That he would be going. Of course, it's good.</v>

95
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.720
<v 1>Yeah. I was nervous. Well, it was awkward. Like, what is it?</v>

96
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:39.800
It's like the night at the rocks for you just kind of sit in the booth,

97
00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:44.590
just like, know, uh, it is, it is him. It is, it is prince, right. It is.

98
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:46.150
And then like, you know, and so you guys.

99
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.110
<v 0>Aren't really interacting.</v>

100
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.470
<v 1>A little bit. Um, not a lot. I think he just,</v>

101
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.270
he invited me just to come sit just in his booth. Yeah.

102
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.070
&lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; but it's also very, it was very loud,

103
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.110
but that wasn't the problem. I think he just, you know, I,

104
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.340
I don't know why I was asked to sit, but he, he was very nice. He was, you know,

105
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.733
he's very, very cool.
