00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, Colin Kaepernick thing. All right.</v>

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.380
Don't you think that at least some good has come out

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.200
of him doing that,

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.610
where it sort of raised awareness for police brutality?

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.330
Just let it just put it to the forefront. Let people like,

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.490
let people understand that this is a problem.

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.210
<v 1>No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Because I think that he made a serious error,</v>

8
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.230
which is that the most positive movements in American social history have been

9
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:35.750
ones that don't kneel for the flag, but say in the name of the flag,

10
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.590
you should do X, right? So Martin Luther king said in the name of the flag,

11
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.220
civil rights are necessary. Booker T Washington said in the name of the flag,

12
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.350
civil rights are necessarily,

13
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:47.000
they didn't say the American flag stands for racism, Jim Crow.

14
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.970
They said the American flag stands for something beyond that live up to the

15
00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:51.980
American flag. But here's, here's my trashing.

16
00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:54.470
The American flag is like endemic of police brutality is first of all, it's.

17
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.663
But second of all,

18
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.730
it's actually divisive on an issue that does not need to be divisive.

19
00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:01.400
Like nobody's in favor of police brutality, nor should anyone be.

20
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.660
<v 0>Counterpoint. Why is it trashing the American flag to take a knee?</v>

21
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.480
Isn't that in some ways,

22
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.540
just another gesture of respect,

23
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.750
like you are not doing what everybody wants you to do,

24
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.700
which is put your hand over your heart,

25
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.470
but you're doing something that's also respectful and silent.

26
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.910
You're not standing up and going, the American flag. these people.

27
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.540
You're actually taking it to another level of respect. You're taking a knee,

28
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:30.830
you're bending the knee.

29
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.930
Whether you're doing it for something that you want to talk about later saying,

30
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:40.430
I'm not going to stand up because this is my way of acknowledging the fact that

31
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:45.260
there have been a lot of people that have been mistreated by police and murdered

32
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:49.580
by police. And this is how I do it. This is how I treat racist police,

33
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.180
killing black people. I take that moment to take a knee.

34
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.800
Like how has that so disrespectful? Like how has that any, it's a,

35
00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:01.250
just a silent gesture. It's not uniform.

36
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.920
Like it's not doing this thing that everybody else is doing,

37
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.430
but you're doing something that's very respectful. You're taking a knee.

38
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.300
<v 1>Well,</v>

39
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.030
that's certainly not the way that he intended when he first started that way.

40
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:13.040
I mean, if you want to interpret it that way you can. Well,

41
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.410
how do you know what his intention? Because he literally talked about it.

42
00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:18.680
I mean, he said that marijuana is a highlight that, right? He said it,

43
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:21.020
but he said, America is a systemically racist country.

44
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:25.220
He wore socks with pictures of cops, pigs on them. Oh yeah.

45
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.640
Oh yeah. I mean, Colin Kaepernick is a terrible spokesperson for this moment.

46
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.620
Like again, like these.

47
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.280
<v 0>Are these humans. Well,</v>

48
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.480
the people that have taken a knee and don't you think that if you just look at

49
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:40.430
the gesture itself is taking a knee even more respectful than standing with your

50
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:41.264
hand over your heart.

51
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.130
<v 1>Than I imagined millions of us would routinely take a knee for the American</v>

52
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.090
flag. I mean, the idea.

53
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.750
<v 0>Of that was the thing you had to do if the, if the D but again,</v>

54
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:54.410
this guy decided to stand and put his hand over his heart. Really? It's just,

55
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:56.900
it's sort of a traditional thing where we're arguing over.

56
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.800
<v 1>Well, I mean, it isn't the way that it was expressed.</v>

57
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.950
It's sort of morphed over time to the point where it doesn't necessarily mean

58
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:03.970
what he originally meant. That to me.

59
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.620
<v 0>He's going folk you while everybody else has their hand over their heart and</v>

60
00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:09.330
silence, but he's taking a knee.

61
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.910
<v 1>He didn't mean it as an F-you. I mean, there's no question.</v>

62
00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:13.200
That's what he meant it is. He,

63
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.330
and it wasn't even over something that actually made sentence.

64
00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:17.040
Like you understand, during the civil rights movement,

65
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.670
when people are raising the black power fist at the Olympics to say like,

66
00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:21.720
we're fighting for civil rights,

67
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.940
Jim Crow is still an operation around the country, right?

68
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.590
Colin Kaepernick taking the needs,

69
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.840
who symbolized in America's police are systemically brutal,

70
00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:31.530
and racist is just it's factually untrue.

71
00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:34.100
And to attribute that to the American flag is really kind of nasty.

72
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.730
<v 0>Not a statistician, right? So he's looking at things like the Eric Gardner case,</v>

73
00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:40.590
or, you know, [inaudible]

74
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.590
, which is a terrible one, right? There's there's cases that you see, like when the 

75
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.590
guy's just selling loose cigarettes and they're straight out of

76
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.590
 the store, it's terrible case you see something like that. And that motivates him to do that. And I know what you're saying that these are anecdotes and this, 

77
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.590
this

78
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.590
 doesn't encompass the full statistics of cops versus black men. And how, what, what is 

79
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.423
it exactly is happening, but that's not his area of expertise. Anyway, he has.

80
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.980
<v 1>He has a nation through that.</v>

81
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.740
So making him a spokesperson for a movement where he has no expertise is a weird

82
00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:11.370
thing to do.

83
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.180
There are plenty of people who talk about this with actual statistical knowledge.

84
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.350
<v 0>Person. And you, you decide to take this big stand publicly like that. Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.000
<v 1>After you get benched for Blaine Gabbert. Yeah.</v>

86
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.260
If you get blend bench for Blaine,

87
00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:24.530
Gabbert and take millions of bucks from a major corporation currently,

88
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.950
is that the guy? Yeah. The immortal blink Albert, the hall of Famer, Blaine,

89
00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:33.930
Gabbert who played like Glenn Gabbert was an NFL quarterback who sucked. I mean,

90
00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:36.150
he was terrible and they benched Colin Kaepernick for him.

91
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.330
And it was after he got bench that he started doing the kneeling for the,

92
00:04:38.331 --> 00:04:42.720
for the American flag sports broadcaster, who knows nothing about sports.

93
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.930
<v 0>People try to talk to me about athletes, explain me.</v>

94
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.300
<v 1>If you'd explain it the way that you're explaining it.</v>

95
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.910
Meaning we're not living up to the American flag, which is why I'm kneeling.

96
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.450
I wouldn't be arguing with it. He didn't explain it that way. That, that wasn't,

97
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:55.284
that wasn't the way it went down.

98
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.780
<v 0>But it's just him. What do you think about God?</v>

99
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.190
There's certain guys that like lock arms during the American flag. Okay.

100
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.510
Locking arms. Okay. But kneeling.

101
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.510
<v 1>Well, no. Well, the way that he characterized his kneeling was bad. Okay.</v>

102
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.550
Meaning like, um, but what about other people that kneel?

103
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.100
If they characterize it differently, it means a different thing. Right? I mean,

104
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.460
meaning like what it originally was is what it was. I'm not going to,

105
00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:17.670
retcon what he meant at the time he was the first to do it. Right. Right.

106
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.160
And then he, and then he made millions of dollars for his bravery.

107
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.821
I think again,

108
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.310
I don't think it takes a whole hell of a lot of bravery to be benched for blend

109
00:05:23.311 --> 00:05:25.890
Gabbert, take a knee, make millions of bucks from Nike.

110
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.370
<v 0>Claiming that Robert fellow's terrible.</v>

111
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.960
<v 1>QB rating is all you really need to know. Not,</v>

112
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.100
not a good quarterback is the answer.

113
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.910
<v 0>Sure. So as Colin Kaepernick, I mean, I don't as a, an athlete,</v>

114
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.350
is he not good?

115
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.920
<v 1>He's a terrific athlete. He just not a very good quarterback. So, I mean,</v>

116
00:05:40.921 --> 00:05:44.250
he had one fantastic season. He led the 49ers to the super bowl.

117
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:46.890
And then like a lot of kind of one hit wonders in sports.

118
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.010
People kind of figured them out season two and his QB rating started to decline.

119
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.150
But I mean, look,

120
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.040
bottom line is that the making him the spokesperson of a movement where he

121
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.933
really,

122
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.280
I don't like the idea that you are going to attribute to all of America,

123
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.400
a sin that is number one, anecdotal in nature.

124
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.610
And number two can not be attributed to America's highest ideals.

125
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.100
You're doing it wrong. If you want to fight police brutality,

126
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.390
say America is not living up to her promises. Say that the promise of America,

127
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.200
like there is a way to convince every successful social movement in American

128
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:19.820
history has done this. The gay rights movement to this,

129
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:20.780
the gay rights movement said, listen,

130
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.900
everybody in America has been guaranteed a certain level of freedom and we're

131
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:25.760
not being guaranteed. That level of freedom, right?

132
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.880
The freedom to pursue happiness is not being guaranteed to us.

133
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.060
We're just asking that we be left alone, leave us alone. And it took time.

134
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:33.680
But most Americans came around to that perspective,

135
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.140
that the same thing holds true on race.

136
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:37.700
The same thing holds true on police brutality.

137
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.820
If you make an invocation and you say to Americans as Americans,

138
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.380
I know that over time,

139
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:45.500
my fellow Americans are going to come to realize that they need to live in

140
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:47.900
accordance with the fundamental principles that founded the country.

141
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.430
That's unifying to say that the American flag is inherently non unifying is,

142
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:55.820
is really bad. Like to the point where you now have college campuses,

143
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:56.900
where if you fly an American flag,

144
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.880
there there've been cases where people are asked to take it down because it's

145
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:02.200
too divisive like that. That does seem crazy.

146
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.270
<v 0>When you say it's anecdotal that he's reacting to something that's</v>

147
00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:07.841
anecdotal,

148
00:07:07.841 --> 00:07:11.080
but there's many of those anecdotes and that you see them over and over again,

149
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.330
the problem is they're so there's, they're so prevalent. There's so many videos.

150
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.991
So this, his friend,

151
00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:21.850
Joe Schilling is a kickboxer and his entire Instagram has been dedicated to bad

152
00:07:21.851 --> 00:07:26.380
cops over the last few months. Just showing all these videos of bad cops.

153
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.610
I mean, yes, it's anecdotal, but God. There's a lot of, yeah. Oh.

154
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.540
<v 1>There's 330 million police interactions every year. So yeah. Yeah. Now what.</v>

155
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.520
<v 0>Was the initial interaction that Juan, what was his motivation to do that?</v>

156
00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:43.450
Was there an, uh, a single instance of police brutality that caused him to do.

157
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.210
<v 1>That? I don't remember which season he did this. This would have been three,</v>

158
00:07:46.211 --> 00:07:48.150
four years ago. So I'm trying to remember.

159
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.200
I don't think it was the Michael Brown situation.

160
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.790
Cause I remember there were protests in the NFL over Michael Brown, right.

161
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:53.950
Which was actually a bad anecdote.

162
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:55.930
Like that was a bad one for people to pick people were doing the hands up.

163
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:57.460
Don't shoot. That didn't actually happen. Right.

164
00:07:57.461 --> 00:08:00.610
He actually tried to grab the gun from the copy. The gun went off in the car.

165
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:04.150
He charged the cop by witness testimony. All the witnesses were black. You know,

166
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.580
the theater gardener one is a much cleaner, right? Well, the,

167
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:08.770
the Eric Garner one is cleaner in terms of police brutality.

168
00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:11.590
It's not super clean in terms of racism or even cause of death.

169
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.250
So this is one of the problems, police brutality, police brutality, for sure.

170
00:08:15.251 --> 00:08:16.990
It's kind of like, it's actually, you know,

171
00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:20.410
I'm warning people now that what happens in the George Floyd case with Derek

172
00:08:20.411 --> 00:08:22.990
Shelvin, like they should be warned upfront.

173
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.550
I want this police officer punished.

174
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.380
I think everyone wants the police officer punished.

175
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.420
The defense is going to make a case that the police officer is not responsible

176
00:08:31.421 --> 00:08:34.450
for George Floyd's death in exactly the same way that the New York police

177
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:36.670
officers made the case, that they were not responsible for Eric Garner's death.

178
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.020
And that the autopsy, the, the initial autopsy tends to support that.

179
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:45.340
So what that suggests is not that Derek Shelvin is good or clean or decent,

180
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.310
but if you're going to charge him with murder, that's,

181
00:08:47.311 --> 00:08:49.510
that's a hard charge to make just on a legal level.

182
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.170
So I'm warning people now of that because the mood, the next move will be,

183
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.380
obviously the system is racist. If they're Shaolin,

184
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:56.970
doesn't get convicted of first degree murder,

185
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.820
it's going to be very hard to convict him. I think you're catching with second.

186
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.370
It's going to be very difficult to, to be charged with second.

187
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.590
<v 0>Right? Because at first would mean premeditated, right? Third.</v>

188
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.630
<v 1>Well, he was charged with third originally and then Keith Ellison,</v>

189
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:08.430
the ag over there elevated it to second degree.

190
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:11.070
I think that it's very difficult to make the case for second degree murder.

191
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.500
<v 0>What were you pulling up? Jamie? You had something you want to say.</v>

192
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.330
<v 2>Yeah, well, I had the part of when this actually started in 2016,</v>

193
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.670
he started studying. Let's keep doing that.

194
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.050
He started by sitting and people started getting video of him sitting as a

195
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.720
preseason was starting. So he then talked to a teammate.

196
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.070
They discussed kneeling was the best thing for him to do at the time. Um.

197
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.440
<v 1>Do you remember, do you know which incident kinda kicked it off? That's.</v>

198
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.520
<v 2>Why I was going to play the video,</v>

199
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.520
but that's why I had to hear the actual first video of him talking about him

200
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:42.510
donating a million dollars community. I think he had guns drawn on him,

201
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.500
which is probably what started. Okay. Here's him talking about that.

202
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.370
<v 3>And I've been very blessed to be in this position and be able to make the kind</v>

203
00:09:52.371 --> 00:09:56.360
of money I do. And I have to help these people.

204
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.690
I have to help these communities. It's not right,

205
00:09:59.691 --> 00:10:04.160
that they're not put in a position to succeed or given those

206
00:10:04.161 --> 00:10:08.840
opportunities to succeed. And as far as taking a knee tonight,

207
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:14.630
uh, Eric, as well as myself, had a long conversation with Nate Boyer,

208
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.060
who is a military vet. And

209
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.750
we were talking to him about how can we get the message back on track and not

210
00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:26.420
take away from the military,

211
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.270
not take away from five in our country,

212
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.410
but keep the focus on what the issues were.

213
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.110
And as we talked about it, we came up with taking a knee, um,

214
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.720
because there are issues that still need to be addressed.

215
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.970
And it was also a way to try to show more respect to the men and

216
00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:47.930
women that fight for this.

217
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:48.950
<v 1>Country because that's better,</v>

218
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:52.430
obviously that's him scroll down for a second because I think.

219
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.440
<v 0>That that's his, that's 2016. So.</v>

220
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.320
<v 1>Look at this one. Okay. Look at the one right below that. Okay.</v>

221
00:10:57.321 --> 00:10:58.460
This is the one I'm talking about.

222
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.300
<v 0>I'm not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses</v>

223
00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:05.240
black people and people of color to me, that's the sentence right there.

224
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.260
So that's a different.

225
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.910
<v 2>That was four or five days after these statements were made.</v>

226
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:14.450
So he said he changed after talking to someone who made oh, okay.

227
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.610
<v 1>Right. So the initial explanation is the one that I was talking.</v>

228
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.790
<v 0>About. Okay. So he revised his feelings on it.</v>

229
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.050
<v 1>And then, well, that's not a reasonable. It started with this.</v>

230
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.570
<v 0>Cabernet,</v>

231
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.190
had guns drawn on him by cops for being one of the only black guys in his town.

232
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.880
Yeah. That seems super reasonable. What he said there, about how.

233
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.630
<v 1>Military military rather,</v>

234
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.930
although he recently released a video that sort of goes back to the original

235
00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:42.350
explanation, suggesting that America is endemically and systemically racist,

236
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.400
which is, which is a problem.

237
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.280
<v 0>That's a hot take right now. It's good. It's very popular.</v>

238
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.010
<v 1>Yeah. No, that's, that's a big one. Yeah. That's a big one. Yeah.</v>

239
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.810
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
