00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.710
<v 2>I tried watching the Bordain documentary, but I just think I got too sad.</v>

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.040
I couldn't do it. And it did it feel weird? Did you watch it Roadrunner?

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.080
Oh yeah. Did it feel weird when you knew that the voice was AI sort of a

5
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:18.930
recreation of his words?

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.720
<v 0>It didn't feel weird to me because honestly it was less than 45 seconds in a two</v>

7
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:28.170
hour film. So no, it didn't feel weird. I,

8
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:31.890
I knew exactly where one of the places was that it was the AI,

9
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:36.600
but the vast majority of that film is Tony's actual voice.

10
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:39.970
And I think that really got lost in the discussion around.

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.100
<v 1>We did. Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.850
I was under the impression that the whole thing was that's how people are

13
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:47.730
they're so gross. They always want to find the one thing that's negative.

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.450
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. It really bummed me out because that was the,</v>

15
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:55.500
that was the dominant conversation on opening weekend.

16
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:58.440
And it really kind of took away for me from, you know,

17
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.860
the it's a beautiful film. I was a, uh, consulting producer.

18
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.710
So obviously I have a dog in the fight and I want people to love the film,

19
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:07.470
but I think it's, I think it's great. It is really sad.

20
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:08.700
How far into it did you get.

21
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.800
<v 1>Started? Uh, no, shut it off.</v>

22
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.330
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.570
<v 1>I just got too sad. It just,</v>

24
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.050
maybe it was my mood that just wasn't.

25
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.720
I just wasn't ready to watch something like that. It was just like,

26
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:22.500
I can't do it.

27
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.000
<v 0>Yeah. I understand. You know, I've been steeped in all things,</v>

28
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.850
Tony for, you know, over a decade, but since he died,

29
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.170
I've been making these books and working on the film and talking about him.

30
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:38.490
And so I've kind of got, I think, a layer of numbness in a way,

31
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.200
but sometimes stuff gets through one of the first time I saw the film,

32
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:47.940
I cried like a baby. When I was home by myself, I was really glad to be alone.

33
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.013
You know.

34
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.410
<v 1>It's always his feeling when someone takes their own life.</v>

35
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.680
Like if I could have just talked to them,

36
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.600
like if I was there, if I could have talked to him, that's,

37
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.010
you know, I talked to David Joe, and he had, he had that same.

38
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.320
He had that same take on it, you know, just, you just don't know,

39
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.820
you know, you feel like you something up or you feel like

40
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.930
it's just it's there's no, there's no, there's no peace.

41
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.530
You know, it's, you're always, if I think about him, I

42
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.200
just always think like what a shame,

43
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.190
what a shame, you know,

44
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.800
like a guy who was so interesting and so loved, you know, to,

45
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.620
I found out about it from, um, Maynard, Keenan from tool. Do you know the story.

46
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.560
<v 0>I listened to you? Uh, talk to, uh,</v>

47
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.280
Tom Papa right after Tony died. So yeah,

48
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.990
he made kind of a joke.

49
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.200
<v 1>Right. She made her funny guy and he was joking around.</v>

50
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.460
He had said that, you know,

51
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:07.900
he knew that Tony was really into jujitsu and Maynard really into jujitsu too.

52
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:10.610
And it's like, we should have a celebrity match, you know,

53
00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:14.020
that would be awesome. And he was talking about it and then he texted.

54
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.070
<v 0>Me and said, I guess the celebrity matches off. And I was like,</v>

55
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:19.330
what does that mean? Like,

56
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.910
I guess he just assumed that I would have already known about it,

57
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:23.770
but I was in Chicago and I had just woken up.

58
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.240
So then I Googled it and I was just like, oh

59
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.330
yeah, it's not a great way. I mean, there's no good way to find out that news,

60
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:38.950
but that's sounds like a particularly painful way to, uh,

61
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.000
to hear it.

62
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.210
<v 1>It was confusing, you know, it's, it's painful, but it's like pizza.</v>

63
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.220
It's almost like it's painful later in the beginning. It's just like shock.

64
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.720
You're baffled. Like how, what that, not there anymore.

65
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.170
Like this person's not there anymore. Like if I text them, it's not there.

66
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.300
I have a phone that I won't get rid of because it has text messages from him.

67
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.580
That's like, I can always go back and look at them.

68
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.070
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Same. I have,</v>

69
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.460
I'll never get rid of my last texts with him. I mean,

70
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.980
it's and what you were saying about, you know,

71
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:17.680
you just wish you could have done something. I mean, believe me, that is,

72
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.330
that is a conversation I've had with so many people. And I think to myself,

73
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.250
like if I had just been a little more, I don't know something, if I had said,

74
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.290
if I had said something or if I had been more supportive or, you know, I just,

75
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.200
I knew he was in trouble that week, but I didn't,

76
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.790
it never occurred to me that he would take that action that he did. And, uh,

77
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.180
and,

78
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.320
and the fact is he had a lot of people around who were very close to him who

79
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.700
loved him. Uh,

80
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.810
and he had other people that were offering to come and be with him because they

81
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:52.930
knew he was having a hard time that week. And he said, no, don't come.

82
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.830
<v 1>So it's why was that week? So particularly hard.</v>

83
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.270
<v 0>He was, there was some stuff in the media with, uh,</v>

84
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.230
with him and his girlfriend that was, you know, not great. Uh, you know,

85
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:08.980
he was very, very in love. And, uh, I think there was some, I mean, this,

86
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.210
I'm not saying anything that isn't public record and I'm always hesitant to talk

87
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:16.930
too much about, about all of that, but it's, you know, it was it's out there.

88
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:21.910
It was in the, uh, Italian press and maybe the French press that, uh,

89
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.020
that his girlfriend had been maybe, or maybe not with another guy,

90
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:29.110
there were a lot of pictures that made it look not great.

91
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.730
And I think that was really hard for him. Um, and you know, you'll see,

92
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:36.520
they talk about it. He, it gets talked about in the film,

93
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.970
it gets talked about in my book. Um, you know, I think he was,

94
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.920
he was deeply in love and I think he was realizing that this relationship,

95
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.740
maybe wasn't what he thought it was or that it just,

96
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:51.070
I think he felt humiliated honestly, you know? And I mean,

97
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.050
that's a hard,

98
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.530
that's a hard thing for a private person to metabolize.

99
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.760
And then, you know,

100
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:03.620
you're extremely public person who has been extremely public about

101
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:07.730
this relationship. I think it was a lot for him to handle in that week.

102
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.970
There's not much you can do when that happens in terms of like talking to a

104
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:18.110
friend, like words just don't work, you know, like they don't,

105
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.870
you don't, you're not going to absorb them.

106
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.000
<v 0>Yeah. It's uh, you know, it's,</v>

107
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.380
I don't know that someone, I don't know that a normal thing,

108
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.910
I don't know what that a normal reaction to romantic trouble is to take your own

109
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:37.790
life. I don't, I, you know, clearly there's, you know,

110
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:42.710
there are plenty of people who have trouble in their relationships who

111
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.970
stay alive. Uh, you know, he was a really complicated guy.

112
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:51.200
He was a really, uh, I think as, as public, as he was,

113
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.980
and as much as he shared about the way that his mind and his heart worked,

114
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:56.870
I think there was a lot that he didn't share.

115
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:01.820
And I think he was more troubled and more lonely

116
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:05.540
and sad than I think any of us knew at the time, uh, you know,

117
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:10.220
in the intervening three years, I've learned a lot more about him.

118
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.820
And I thought I knew him inside and out. I was his assistant for 10 years.

119
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.330
You know, we wrote a book together. Uh, I had done some traveling with him,

120
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:21.020
not extensively, but I did a handful of trips over the years. You know,

121
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:25.040
we were in contact every day. And, um, you know,

122
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.670
when I started to talk to people after he died, there was just a lot,

123
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.980
a lot more to him, a lot more to his story.

124
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.900
<v 1>Yeah. Whenever anybody, um,</v>

125
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.680
recovers from a serious drug problem,

126
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.410
but yet still parties, I was always like, Hmm, how was he pulling that off?

127
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.810
Like the first time I hung out with him,

128
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.260
I knew that he had gotten over the heroin thing,

129
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.780
but I didn't quite realize how hard he drank. I was like, whoa.

130
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.550
<v 0>What's that in Montana, when you go.</v>

131
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.760
<v 1>That was later. That was after I'd known him for quite a while. I mean,</v>

132
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:09.590
I think the first time I hung out with him was in Vegas, pretty sure. Um,

133
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.640
it was when he was married to Octavia and, um,

134
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.370
they were there for the UFC and I met him backstage. It was like,

135
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:24.050
wow, watch the entire episode for free, only on Spotify.
