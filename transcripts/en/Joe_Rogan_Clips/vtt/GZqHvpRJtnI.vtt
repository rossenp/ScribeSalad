00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 2>Well, there's a, you know,</v>

3
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:06.270
there's this suspicion like people have suspicion about the government.

4
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:08.250
Like there's a lot of people that don't want to get the vaccine.

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.400
Cause they're worried about the government, that, that it's also that,

6
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:15.870
that exists in minority communities. And then in more poor communities,

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.710
what are your thoughts about this vaccine passport concept?

8
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.450
Because a lot of people find that deeply problematic giving the government this

9
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:29.310
ability to let people travel or not travel based on whether or not

10
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:30.390
you've been vaccinated.

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.290
<v 0>The left cannot let go of COVID. They can't let go of it.</v>

12
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:37.540
They want it around. They want to keep spending money based on,

13
00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:42.090
on this sort of moral stance that we need to keep supporting

14
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:43.710
communities because of COVID.

15
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.670
And that we needed to keep doing things and taking excessive action because of

16
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:51.660
COVID they cannot let it go because they love collectivism and they love

17
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.990
centralized control of the economy and society.

18
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.970
I recall a definition we were looking at earlier, which sort of against that,

19
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.640
but, and again,

20
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.330
I always distinguish between liberals and progressives on this one. Okay.

21
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.010
I think, I think there is a, there,

22
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:11.670
there should be an Alliance between real liberals and conservatives in the

23
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:11.971
future,

24
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:15.360
and that's how we're going to solve problems that I talked to Brett Weinstein

25
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.320
all the time, you know.

26
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.410
<v 1>Weinstein. If you talk to him all the time, he knows his last Nash,</v>

27
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.580
Maybe Harvey Weinstein, Bret Weinstein.

28
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.800
<v 0>All right. Anyway, I think anyway, he's like, I'm a hardcore liberal. He's like,</v>

29
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:30.120
I'm a radical liberal.

30
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:33.930
And we just agree on so many things because he's a classical liberal.

31
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.700
And if you're gonna describe yourself as liberal,

32
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:39.390
you mean in the classical sense, in most cases, and you want nice things,

33
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:42.000
you have the sense of compassion and you want nice things for people.

34
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:42.900
Maybe it's healthcare,

35
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.390
maybe it's to take care of people when they fallen on hard times.

36
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:47.520
These are good things. These are not bad things.

37
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.710
They're not things that conservatives even disagree with.

38
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.260
We now we generally have a different philosophy on how to S how to find

39
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:56.910
solutions for those problems. That's the, that's the center. I guess if we're,

40
00:01:56.911 --> 00:02:00.510
if we're always like grasping for the center, which a lot of people are. And I,

41
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:02.670
you know, I always kind of questioned like, what do you mean by that? Well,

42
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.230
but maybe that's the right way to look at it. Liberals are good at,

43
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.880
at having enough empathy and compassion to see what might need to be

44
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:12.714
changed.

45
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.550
Conservatives are good at finding the solutions for that change that

46
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:21.360
maintains the good things that got us here in the first place.

47
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.590
You can't burn down all the foundations of a society just because you're not at

48
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:30.330
utopia yet. Remember utopia is defined as in Greek, as being nowhere.

49
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.870
And you'll always, you'll always burn things down to grasp for that.

50
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.550
You can't get to that point. So I think that's the right Alliance. Um,

51
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.900
kind of, I, I kind of forgot what the initial question was, but.

52
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.980
<v 1>Well, it's all w w you're talking about the difference between, uh,</v>

53
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:51.060
a classical liberal, well, when you say classical liberal,

54
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:52.860
I always think you're trying to like, pretend you're,

55
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.380
you're liberal when you really conservative, like,

56
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.260
cause there's a lot of people that use that term classical liberal,

57
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.930
and it's like, well, what do you believe? Like it's like things get sneaky.

58
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.590
I think there's a real problem with definitions. There's a real problem with,

59
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:08.290
like, you got to focus on the definition. Chris rock was saying though,

60
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:11.200
about like gangs like that. You, you have like,

61
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.830
I'm more conservative and I believe you have these predetermined patterns of

62
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:18.220
behavior that people subscribed to without any independent thinking,

63
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:22.000
without any objective thinking. And it's a real problem with human beings.

64
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.920
Like I think ultimately what everybody wants is what's good for the community

65
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.500
that everyone, what they want for themselves, selfishly,

66
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.310
but they also want for their friends and neighbors and loved ones and family

67
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:35.260
members, they want what's good for everybody,

68
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:37.600
but they can't agree in what is good for everybody.

69
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.770
And then when people don't have, they look at people who do have, and they go,

70
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:43.030
well, how the did they have?

71
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.580
And then some grifter will come along and they have,

72
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:49.240
because they've taken from you. And that, that there in lies the problem,

73
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.140
because if you're not educated or if you haven't like deeply researched the

74
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.840
ideas, especially with an objective perspective,

75
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.090
you can sort of believe a lot of these Grifters,

76
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:00.790
a lot of these people that come along and they, they say crazy,

77
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.740
like tax the rich or eat the rich and like, oh Jesus Christ had,

78
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.970
how did they get rich? Did they, did they get rich from stealing?

79
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:13.840
Or did he get rich from discipline and hard work and decades,

80
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.340
decades in the trenches? So you're dealing with two very different things.

81
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.960
<v 0>Well, classically liberal philosophy would ask that question because,</v>

82
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.680
because there's a,

83
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.010
because there's a sense of justice involved with any question.

84
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.200
And in that sense of justice,

85
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.670
is that somebody infringe on your rights and what are rights,

86
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.420
life, Liberty, property, generally speaking in the classical sense.

87
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.470
Now you can go,

88
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.730
you can go further back in time before classic enlightenment principles came

89
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:47.350
about in the, you know, 18th century. Um,

90
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.480
but then you're, but then you're dealing with feudalism.

91
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.650
Then you're dealing with tribalism.

92
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:52.510
Then you're dealing with what I think a lot on the left.

93
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:57.490
One to bring us back to the sort of subjugating people into different identities

94
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.600
and hierarchies based on those identities, that's a really bad place to be.

95
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.060
They want to bring us back to that moment in history.

96
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:06.730
What w w what the enlightenment period did was say, look,

97
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.250
you can keep dividing people up all day long.

98
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.530
Eventually you just get to an individual.

99
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.620
So maybe we should look at how individuals act and then have a,

100
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.380
have a really rational structure about how we,

101
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.070
how we define incentives and how we define justice.

102
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.880
And justice should be defined as, as, as somebody infringing a person,

103
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:29.320
a infringing on the rights of person, B, or person a, you know, making it,

104
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.070
um, in a hierarchy for, for unworthy reasons,

105
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:35.830
something other than a meritocracy, that would be an injustice.

106
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.020
<v 1>And I know you said that the left is fascinated by COVID or obsessed with</v>

107
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:43.210
COVID, but we didn't really cover it. Like.

108
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.910
<v 0>That was the original question I got really philosophical in that, that, that,</v>

109
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:50.680
that was the original question. What do you think, obviously, a bad idea.

110
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.490
It's not, and it's obviously a bad idea because like,

111
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.880
and a lot of the well-intentioned people on the left tend to they're

112
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:02.360
well-intentioned, but they do tend to live like they're still in grad school.

113
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.930
And I know, because I went to Harvard in a, in a policy school,

114
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:07.970
I went to the Harvard Kennedy school after the military,

115
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.220
and there's an infatuation with being able to design the perfect policy on

116
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:16.340
paper. Now that's the first step. Of course.

117
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:19.520
Now the second step is how do you implement it? And also, again,

118
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.460
whose rights are you infringing on when you implement these things?

119
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:23.840
These are the questions they don't ask.

120
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.060
This is what a conservative always asks again.

121
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:29.870
When I talk about how to solve problems through a framework of limiting

122
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:34.430
principles, this is what I mean, you have to ask these questions. And so what,

123
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.600
how, you know, what is the practicality of this? And it's not practical at all,

124
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.860
frankly. Um, depending on what they mean by a COVID passport also. I mean,

125
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.610
maybe we should define that first. Um, but, but it's,

126
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.850
it's one thing to ask people like, Hey, I don't know, wear a green bracelet if,

127
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.090
uh, if you already got the vaccine and you've already had COVID or both,

128
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:54.290
or either, or.

129
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.290
<v 1>But it's not that it's like limiting your ability.</v>

130
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.790
<v 0>To travel, which is an excessive infringement on your rights. And also,</v>

131
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.930
and also, is it really even scientific given the trends that we're seeing?

132
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:10.070
I mean, all in all, no matter how you approach this question,

133
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.560
it seems like a really bad idea. When you.

134
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.510
<v 1>Say, is it even scientific? What do you.</v>

135
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.860
<v 0>Mean by that? Meaning we've been traveling for a year without vaccines.</v>

136
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.820
<v 1>Uh, in a limited aspect. Some people have travel a lot.</v>

137
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.900
<v 0>And then capacity. Yeah. I mean, it's somewhat limited somewhat.</v>

138
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.980
<v 1>Well, no, if you look at the airline trends, it's severely limited.</v>

139
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.620
<v 0>Fairly. Yeah. I, I spent a lot of time at airports over the.</v>

140
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.453
<v 1>Last year.</v>

141
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.320
<v 0>But I know, I know, I know how crowded they are every time I'm there. And yeah,</v>

142
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:41.360
there was definitely a time period where they were ghost towns,

143
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.300
but that hasn't been the case for many, many nights, still.

144
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.060
<v 1>Not even 50% of what it was a year ago or a.</v>

145
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.180
<v 0>Year and a half ago. I don't know the exact numbers. I don't know what it is.</v>

146
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.520
I just know that we've been living with it.

147
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.520
Just like you have to live with a pandemic because you don't have a choice.

148
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.840
Here's a big difference. Maybe, maybe everything boils down to this difference,

149
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.170
the right beliefs, look, you don't have a choice. You gotta make the best of it.

150
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.010
You gotta keep living. You gotta, you gotta mitigate risk where you can,

151
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.850
but you can't mitigate risk at the expense of everything else.

152
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.740
And the left says, no, no, no, no, no.

153
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.980
You have to mitigate risk at the expense of everything else.

154
00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:18.230
No cost is too high because if it just saves one life,

155
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.620
this is the fundamental different problem they don't.

156
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.140
<v 1>Take into account is it costs a lot of lives.</v>

157
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:27.620
It costs a lot of lives who have suicide, depression, drug addiction.

158
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:28.400
There's a little.

159
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.230
<v 0>The rules closing has been excessively bad and there's no</v>

162
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.590
