00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.600
<v 2>So first of all, man, congratulations. You're the first guy to beat the system.</v>

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.810
You're the first guy to get over by the system,

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.740
go public with it and then get your money. I've never heard it happened before.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.090
I don't think it's ever happened before.

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.290
<v 1>Bro, bro. I still can't wrap my mind around it,</v>

7
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:23.880
but I do have to shout out, uh, Chris McCarthy over at CBS Viacom,

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.940
that guy, you know, when we were working this out,

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.290
his approach was someone who was actually trying to resolve something,

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.270
came through. It was amazing, man.

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.810
<v 0>Amazing. It's a, it's a happy ending because usually those artists gripes,</v>

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.190
they never get resolved,

13
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.700
not not to where the artist feels comfortable or happy with it.

14
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.650
They always feel bitter and angry.

15
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:47.130
They got over and someone else is a producer and they make millions of dollars

16
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:50.550
off of your work and they continue to sell it and make money off of it. And.

17
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.590
<v 1>Well, I can say, I could say with a, with a high degree of honesty,</v>

18
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:57.600
not to say I was never angry about it,

19
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.400
but I don't think I was ever like bitter by this point in my life.

20
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.923
I wasn't.

21
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.590
<v 0>You would joke about it. You were angry about it,</v>

22
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.670
but not to the point where it with your head, but you would joke about it.

23
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.200
<v 1>Well, I mean, you know, you know,</v>

24
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:17.130
the bottom line is no matter what happens to you, you got to keep going.

25
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.180
You gotta keep going. And, and bitterness is quite cumbersome. It's bad for you.

26
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.140
Right? So, you know,

27
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:26.730
jokes is a way of shaking that off or processing something with the alchemy of

28
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:27.210
levity.

29
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
<v 0>Yeah. Holding grudges, bitterness. very bad for you. It doesn't ever help.</v>

30
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.190
<v 1>No. And now we're getting on in age, you know what I mean? We were younger.</v>

31
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.550
It's just find a whole aggression. You didn't realize, you know.

32
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.360
<v 0>I didn't realize it was with you. What does that expression that it's about? Oh,</v>

33
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:44.940
it's about jealousy. The jealousy is the only poison that,

34
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.280
that affects the container. That's holding it.

35
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.050
<v 1>Right. That's exactly right. But bitterness, the same thing. It's not good.</v>

36
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.650
<v 0>Yeah. It's just not good for you. You gotta be able to let go.</v>

37
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.810
<v 1>Yeah. I mean.</v>

38
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.120
<v 0>But in your case you made a ploy. Like you, you,</v>

39
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.830
you said what happened, how you felt about it. And they were like, he's right.

40
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.690
<v 1>I think, yeah. It's giving the money. It wasn't, it wasn't a court of law.</v>

41
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.410
I don't believe I would have gotten anything in a court of law.

42
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:18.180
I think in a court of public opinion.

43
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.300
That was a good time for me to say my piece.

44
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.420
And through the years it wasn't something that I would Hart,

45
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:25.680
but I'm when I did the interviews and stuff,

46
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.000
people would always ask me about it.

47
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.420
But it was something that I was actually reluctant to talk about. It was, yeah.

48
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.351
<v 0>Well,</v>

49
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.960
it's hard for other people to relate to this idea that you want more money.

50
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.430
You know, you talking about regular people and you're saying this thing,

51
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:40.870
even though it is yours, monies.

52
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.630
<v 1>Money is if you look at life, anything in life,</v>

53
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.710
through the framework of money, you'll miss most of the picture. Yeah.

54
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.000
And you know, in business,

55
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.610
especially at this stage in our careers,

56
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.600
you realize through the years people playing sentence, you know what I mean?

57
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.670
That they're, if they incentivize a certain way,

58
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.590
that's the way they're going to behave. So,

59
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.780
so what they want is never really surprising how

60
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:14.020
they get there is where all the surprises are.

61
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.450
So I feel like I can forgive somebody for playing an incentive.

62
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.740
It's disappointing,

63
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.870
but what was so remarkable when I walked away from the show, right?

64
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.280
Is that, uh, it was against incentive.

65
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.550
So people couldn't understand it at the time, it was so much money.

66
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:36.190
How could you do that? And blah, blah, blah. But you know,

67
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.720
if I had taken that money and finished the show and would have got the money,

68
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.280
but I might never have been the same.

69
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.850
<v 0>I think it was one of the most gangster moves in the history of entertainment.</v>

70
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.630
And it made you a legend. And the fact that you then started doing shows,

71
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:52.570
like I heard, like Dave's doing a show in the park in Seattle.

72
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.390
It's kind of like a box. He pulls out of speaker.

73
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.620
<v 1>That was important. Yeah. Because,</v>

74
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.280
but because in that sense it was freeing. Yeah.

75
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.950
Something about, you know,

76
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:09.670
I was geared a certain way growing up cause I wanted to make it in show business

77
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.640
and, and, and boy, that fell all up all the way apart.

78
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.410
And as far as I knew my career was over, sweetie, go from there. Yeah.

79
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.880
<v 0>Well your career wasn't over,</v>

80
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:22.210
you just decided you were going to just sorta label.

81
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.680
<v 1>Back for awhile in hindsight. Yeah. But when it was happening,</v>

82
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.740
you really felt like it was over. I never seen these things before.

83
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.120
I didn't see anyone else do this and get back up. I didn't see. Uh, you know,

84
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.340
and, and the drum beat is he's crazy smokes.

85
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.280
Crack is this is that it was a while. It was a wild experience.

86
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.710
The way people close to you react to it. Like he,

87
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.710
like I had failed or I ruined my life, you know? Uh,

88
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.590
and then, and then, you know, when you're cold,

89
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.100
that phone don't ring that often. Right. And then I,

90
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.580
and then I had over a decade of, of sitting in that choice,

91
00:04:57.581 --> 00:05:00.610
but I didn't languish. And just that experience,

92
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:02.710
I started doing standup for,

93
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.070
for much better reasons than making it and still enjoyed it.

94
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.330
I started seeing the places where I was performing. Normally,

95
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:13.900
when you're like successful in comedy, you know,

96
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.600
you'd get off the plane or the bus, you hit the, you do the hit,

97
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.730
you go back to the hotel, you get back on the bus.

98
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:21.220
You don't really see anything. You don't really like, even now,

99
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.970
like this last run we did here in Austin and what was here for weeks.

100
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.130
And I got to see Austin, I got to find restaurants. I like,

101
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:33.610
I met people that I probably called cause I'm in town, stuff like that.

102
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.820
And it was like that all over the world, not just the country,

103
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.610
I started going around and just seeing the world,

104
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.380
I got overwhelmed with this idea that none of my information was firsthand.

105
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:46.750
I just read it in books or I heard it from friends and I,

106
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:49.600
and I was eager to just, just see something for myself.

107
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.890
And I kind of entrenched this philosophy that my memories

108
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.690
are some of the most valuable things that I have. These firsthand experiences.

109
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.910
Can't take that away from. If I F I reminisce on a nice day, then you know,

110
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.600
it feeds you remembering something is neurologically almost identical.

111
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.860
I've read to experience it. Any, any information is valuable.

112
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.940
I call it the expensive knowledge, right?

113
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.060
It's like your buddy, that's a war veteran or something.

114
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.940
You don't want to know the. He knows.

115
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:26.300
If you knew what he had to do to know these things,

116
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.100
that's what they call expensive knowledge.

117
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:32.850
I would not recommend quitting your show the way I did, if you can avoid.

118
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.250
<v 0>Yeah. But you, but it was the way he did. It was so cool.</v>

119
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.860
Cause you know, you kind of drifted off.

120
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.140
<v 1>I promise. I wasn't trying to be cool. It was,</v>

121
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.580
it was a series of troubleshooting. It just like, it, man. Like we,

122
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.690
ain't gonna do, you gotta, you gotta, whatever you go through, you gotta,

123
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:54.290
you gotta live. You gotta make a way and find your happiness. And,

124
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.700
and you know, I'm lucky I'm in this, I'm in, I'm in show business, which is

125
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.970
a pretty, uh, it's a multi-dimensional career path.

126
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.190
This thing could go a lot of ways. Yeah.

127
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.670
<v 0>Especially today. Oh.</v>

128
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.840
<v 1>My God. Yeah. Yeah. And another time when I've ever gotten that money,</v>

129
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:15.674
I don't think.

130
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.800
<v 0>No, because there have been no social media, no pressure.</v>

131
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.390
<v 1>Right? No dropping specials on the gram. No, no comm section,</v>

132
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:24.950
no move on.org. You know.

133
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.760
<v 0>And if you had gone to say like, uh,</v>

134
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.070
the tonight show and made a pitch like that,

135
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.540
they probably wouldn't even aired it.

136
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.710
<v 1>Now. Of course not. I had a great with someone that owned a sixth of the media.</v>

137
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.410
Yeah. Well, I'm going to tell the media on them.

138
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.120
<v 0>Right. They would, they would definitely edit that part out and be like,</v>

139
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:45.860
why is Dave section only four minutes long.

140
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:51.290
<v 1>Edited, spin it, whatever, whatever it is they do. But yeah. But,</v>

141
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.500
uh, again, you know, all parties involved,

142
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:59.030
I thought in repairing that situation and I don't want going all into

143
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.580
what those conversations were like other than to say,

144
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.450
and this is not like I'm just happy because they pay me. It was class act.

145
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.660
It was like, that's beautiful. It really was. It was it wasn't.

146
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.090
It was a very encouraging. That.

147
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.923
<v 0>Is very encouraging.</v>

148
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.260
<v 1>I think that coming up behind us,</v>

149
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.700
these kids are going to be playing in a whole new ball game that we did.
