00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.480
<v 2>Uh, this is the third time on your show, by the way I am so honor.</v>

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.100
<v 1>Oh, please. I'm honored to nothing but massive amounts of respect for you.</v>

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.450
<v 0>I really want it to be your, your, um, Regis Philbin. You're Tony Randall.</v>

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.030
I am local. My brother, whenever someone canceled,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.510
I figured Cosby couldn't make it. Joe was like, Hey man, can you come on Monday?

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.960
Can you come on Monday to the show? Like, Cosby.

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.750
<v 1>Could you imagine if I had Cosby on, oh.</v>

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.120
<v 0>Nah, I don't think you could as a man.</v>

10
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:33.420
I don't think we could actually be around a guy like that. I have daughters.

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.850
It would be, of course I have two stepdaughters and my own daughter was.

12
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.300
<v 1>It was a crazy thing to see the news that he was getting out. I was like,</v>

13
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:47.070
wow, that's wild. And then how many people were defending it?

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.210
It was, it was interesting. They disingenuously defend the,

15
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.560
they wrote this article, you know, they do clickbait, um, about, uh,

16
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.270
Geraldo Rivera defending it. And he wasn't defending, defending the legal.

17
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.103
<v 0>Process.</v>

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.330
<v 1>He wasn't defending him at all, but he was, he w th the way,</v>

19
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.050
see if he can find a headline for the very disingenuous,

20
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:10.890
the way they labeled it.

21
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.900
Cause Geraldo Rivera was essentially saying they tried his

22
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.920
character versus trying his acts.

23
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.390
The problem is he had made a deal with the prosecutor to, um,

24
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.170
PR under immunity, under immunity. He testified in a civil.

25
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.080
<v 0>Case. And then they played that grand jury.</v>

26
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.490
<v 1>Prosecuted him. Yeah. And I don't know, what did he say in the civil case?</v>

27
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.970
<v 0>It was something to the effect of yeah, yeah, yeah. I drugged him.</v>

28
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.493
<v 1>He apologized.</v>

29
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.060
<v 0>I'm trying to find out them, but you know,</v>

30
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:45.960
what what's interesting is the response. So this is a, and I,

31
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.340
I believe 100% in the law and there's obvious people who are at fault here who

32
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:53.880
made these deals and use this, this information incorrectly,

33
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.580
but the law is the law, but the response,

34
00:01:56.581 --> 00:02:01.320
the public outcry or lack of it will be very different. I predict. And,

35
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.210
um, I don't want to equate these things,

36
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:06.240
but I think the damage he's done to women is pretty severe.

37
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.880
Derek Shovan may get off on a technicality somewhere down the road. Y I,

38
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.580
you know, there's still the Maxine waters thing.

39
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.280
Let's just say it happened waters thing. She was,

40
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.230
she was tampering with a possible jury pool by talking about,

41
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.090
by traveling to the state, by, uh, talking about it publicly. Th this is,

42
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:31.590
this is an old story, but regardless it's possible,

43
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:33.630
that can happen to Cosby. A couple of years,

44
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.970
Derek Shovan could get off on a eat,

45
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.310
forget why he could get off on a technicality.

46
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:42.150
What the do we know that's going to make people crazy.

47
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.670
So, you know, is it, is it equal? I mean, what Cosby did?

48
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.230
I mean, that's, I mean, where's the outrage. I think this is,

49
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.280
I think it's, even though technically the law is correct, you know,

50
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.290
the people who it up need to be held to account.

51
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.840
<v 1>I think people coming to grips with it right now where they're like, holy,</v>

52
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.050
is this real? Is he out? Yeah.

53
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.900
So I think the dust is not even remotely settled.

54
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.000
And the thing that Geraldo is saying is that this could possibly apply to Harvey

55
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.550
Weinstein as well. Oh, well, there you go.

56
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.350
<v 0>And this is what he was saying that they tried to Harvey Weinstein based on his</v>

57
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:24.850
character versus based on the actual legal

58
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:27.280
facts. I don't know if that's true though. I don't know if that's true,

59
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.140
but Harvey, Weinstein's still,

60
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.280
there's still other cases out there that have the law is a crazy thing. And Joe,

61
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:36.940
I mean the way it's all about interpretation, it's how a judge interprets it,

62
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:40.360
or, you know, a Supreme court. I mean, it's, again,

63
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.870
we all look at the same movie, but we might be the same screen.

64
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.823
You might be seeing a different.
