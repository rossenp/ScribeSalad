00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>Talk to, uh, Ben Shapiro about it today on his show,</v>

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:05.320
but it won't be out until Sunday. What is, um.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.320
<v 1>Do, have you ever encountered her in the world?</v>

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.560
<v 0>I'm I know Roseanne, um,</v>

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.080
I talked to her on the phone and I believe every word she said,

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.320
she told me that she was taking Ambien and that she was drunk a Memorial day

7
00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:22.670
weekend, and she tweeted a just stupid and she's out of her mind.

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.230
And she said, you know, in her words, I need to adjust my meds.

9
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.710
You know, I'm, I'm not thinking straight.

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.190
And she was talking about how exhausted she got doing that television show and

11
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:37.470
she got bronchitis and she was overworked. I think she's stressing the out.

12
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.710
She also told me that she did not know that that lady was even,

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.100
she thought that lady was Jewish. And she said to me, like,

14
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:47.660
do you really think that I would make a joke about a black lady and say planet

15
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.260
ACE, I wouldn't do that. She's like, I thought she was Jewish. Look at her.

16
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.900
So I did look at her like pull up her Wikipedia page, this lady,

17
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.220
she, um, I mean she most cer pull it up so we could see it.

18
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.613
I mean,

19
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.540
she most certainly could be African American for sure. But she also,

20
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.460
most certainly could be like Hawaiian or native American.

21
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.700
<v 1>Or point being that Italian.</v>

22
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.420
<v 0>Maybe she thought Jewish. That's what Roseanne said, Jewish.</v>

23
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.050
This is what she said. I do not know. I don't think, think she's lying to me.

24
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.250
Um, I don't think she's racist. Have you ever taken.

25
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.250
<v 1>Ambient? No. I've.</v>

26
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.130
<v 0>Never taken Ambien. Do.</v>

27
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.090
<v 1>You, anybody here.</v>

28
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.370
<v 0>Ever take Ambien? A good friend of mine about it today. Okay.</v>

29
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.290
And he got up in the middle of the night, cooked himself, a meal, ate. It,

30
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.570
went to sleep, got up in the morning and had no recollection of it.

31
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.600
He had to be told that he did. He was trying to figure out who put,

32
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.720
put the plates in the sink who ate this food, where this food come from.

33
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:50.080
Couldn't figure it out. He got up in the middle of the night.

34
00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:54.240
Doesn't remember a thing. Right. And cooked himself. A meal sat down, ate, it,

35
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.960
went back to bed as zero recollection of it. I hate, hate to be this guy scared.

36
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.200
<v 1>The out of him. But during that meal at any point,</v>

37
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.040
did he get racist or anything like that? Yeah. I wonder,

38
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.070
you know what I'm saying? Like, he's literally like, it's one thing. It',

39
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.270
it's a spooky story to be like, I took Ambien and I made myself some food.

40
00:02:10.271 --> 00:02:13.510
It's an even spookier story to be like, I took Ambien and I killed somebody,

41
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.070
but it's a, it's a stretch to be like, it is,

42
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.790
I took Ambien and I said something I would never say in a million years. It,

43
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.430
it heartens me to hear,

44
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.420
say that she said that she wasn't aware of the lady's race. Yeah.

45
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.180
Cause it, you know, I don't know her. All I know her from is Roseanne.

46
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.740
All I know her from is decades of watching her in media, her TV show.

47
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.620
I followed her before the TV show. Um, it didn't seem like

48
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.810
the rose in that I've watched for 30, 40.

49
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.650
<v 0>Years. Well, see, that's the thing. I'm not close to her on a daily basis.</v>

50
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.970
Right. You know, I have tremendous respect for her as a comedian. Um,

51
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.330
I think she's, she was a, a real pioneer in a lot of ways. She was this brash,

52
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.720
like really confident lady who on

53
00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:08.360
stupid men. And she did it in this like really bold way. And standup,

54
00:03:08.361 --> 00:03:10.080
that was very unique for the time. Right?

55
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.880
Like if people go back and you watch like some of her early standup,

56
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:13.760
when she was coming outta Denver.

57
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.040
<v 1>The domestic goddess stuff, she was a.</v>

58
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.430
<v 0>Beast man. She was a beast. She was crushing. Yeah. She was crushing, you know?</v>

59
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.350
And then she got that sitcom and it's absolutely one of the greatest sitcoms of

60
00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:29.190
all time. Yeah. But now she's 65 years old and it's hard for her.

61
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.443
And that schedule,

62
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.950
she was telling me was absolutely brutal and that they were killing her with all

63
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:38.430
the work. Um, I don't know her very well,

64
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.381
but you know,

65
00:03:39.381 --> 00:03:44.340
there was another time where she said something about Susan Rice who

66
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.980
is, uh, another African American woman. And she,

67
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.820
she said something about her and compared to her swinging balls. Yeah.

68
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:56.060
Something like swinging ape balls, you know?

69
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.730
So that's two for two it's two. Yeah. Well this one for sure. Right?

70
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:02.650
Cause this one there's no excuses for, right.

71
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:06.410
This is one from the past that there was no, you know, like, oh my God,

72
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.730
I was on ambient. I tweeted this, no one said anything.

73
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:11.810
Susan Rice is a man with big swinging ape.

74
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.770
<v 1>Balls. And that wasn't meant to be a compliment.</v>

75
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.010
<v 0>That's 2013 case. That's a long that's five years ago. That's five years ago.</v>

76
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.320
<v 1>Oh. And you can, I mean, I don't know if it's still available,</v>

77
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.520
but if you can go through a timeline and see a bunch of things that yeah.

78
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.280
Are not like a comedian being funny, but right. You know, beliefs.

79
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.800
<v 0>Right. That one is, um, now it's a rough one.</v>

80
00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:38.560
That to me is a way rougher one it's way rougher. Like that one is like,

81
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.950
that's what you said. I mean, it is what it is. Mm. You know,

82
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:44.510
if you said that the other lady looked like plant of the apes,

83
00:04:44.511 --> 00:04:48.670
just because of her haircut. Cuz she looks like the, the lead woman in, in zero.

84
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.390
Yeah. She looked like zero. There was like a photo of her back.

85
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.750
It was just like the way her haircut was and her outfit was right.

86
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.470
I think some people, you know, would, but if you didn't know that she was black,

87
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.340
it's a totally different thing. Yeah. Do we know that for sure. You know,

88
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:06.540
only she knows for sure. You know, it's uh, were.

89
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.500
<v 1>You surprised at how quickly it all ended?</v>

90
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.340
Yeah. Well that, that was the part of the story. That again,

91
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.220
I no skin in the game other than I watched the old Roseanne. Yeah.

92
00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:23.650
And I was enjoying the new Roseanne as well. Yeah. I came, uh, home from like,

93
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:27.290
I was Vegas the other day and I flew home yesterday morning and then I had a

94
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:30.210
meeting, uh, over the studios, like at noon.

95
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.090
So I took a nap when I got home. Like,

96
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.650
and also my wife wakes me up and she goes, you got a meeting, don't forget,

97
00:05:36.651 --> 00:05:41.130
like it's 1130. Oh. And Roseanne's been canceled. And I'm like, that's,

98
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.920
that's in Palm possible. Like what? I was groggy, but I'm like,

99
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:47.960
that's impossible. It's like 20 million people are watching that show.

100
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.520
And she said, uh, she tweeted something racist.

101
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.480
So I pick up my phone and I look at it and stuff.

102
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.440
And by the time like this had happened in the span of like the hour

103
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.120
I took a nap. They, the,

104
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.480
the network acted so incredibly fast. There was no prevercation equivocation.

105
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.360
<v 0>No dude. They had that act sharpened and ready. It.</v>

106
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.200
<v 1>Was nuts. Like all of a sudden they were just like, we're done.</v>

107
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.560
We don't know or dis about. And, and, and it was,

108
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.110
I think it so surprising because it's been a while since somebody did something

109
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.270
even, uh, superficially, uh,

110
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.310
um, moral. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Right.

111
00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:30.230
Like I I've read a lot of articles online where people are like, Hey man,

112
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.270
ABC didn't own the show. So of course they have had,

113
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:35.990
they didn't have as much skin in the game. So it was easy for them to cancel it.

114
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.180
Would they have canceled the as fast, if they own the show and.dot, dot,

115
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:42.900
you can, you can make a bunch of kind of caveats. But at the end of the day,

116
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.260
something bad happened. And then the network reacted a major, the network,

117
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.540
a major company, major corporation reacted. You think what they did enacted.

118
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.700
<v 0>You think is the right way to handle it. To just immediately cancel the show.</v>

119
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.820
I personally.

120
00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.530
<v 1>Would've maybe fired her and kept everybody else done. Like the,</v>

121
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.050
you know, valorery covered, die.

122
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.890
<v 0>Off. Yeah. Or just used computer animation. Oh, I.</v>

123
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.170
<v 1>You could replace her with a Pixar character,</v>

124
00:07:07.171 --> 00:07:11.330
but I think you can tell equally compelling stories. Like without her,

125
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.730
honestly like the nine episodes that they've done this season,

126
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.490
she really hasn't been the driving factor of the stories.

127
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.880
It's been more her about Darlene.

128
00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:22.240
That's who I felt bad for when this whole thing imploed cuz I'm like,

129
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.440
she's she put this show together of, of Sarah Gilbert mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh,

130
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.760
and she was like crushing on it.

131
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:31.120
She was like really good showing off like what a great actor she is.

132
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:33.240
But now everybody's outta job. Feel bad for John Goodman.

133
00:07:33.241 --> 00:07:36.000
I've worked with him before and he was wonderful on the show.

134
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.310
Like can they could have sustained the show without her? I think.

135
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.590
<v 0>Can she be forgiven?</v>

136
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.230
<v 1>Sure. I mean can, how does someone, Mel Gibson get forgiven? Isn't he working.</v>

137
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.590
<v 0>Again? Wellmel Gibson. It was also a case of him being intoxicated. Right?</v>

138
00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:52.910
He was yelling some antisemitic stuff at a cop. Well, I mean, nevermind.

139
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.910
<v 1>That didn't he also punches ex-wife like's a more action</v>

140
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.500
than him. Just G Hey, sugar. Like there was some,

141
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.820
his wife had recorded him or the woman. She recorded.

142
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.980
<v 0>Him yelling at her on the phone.</v>

143
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.420
<v 1>So we, nobody knows if he truly hit him. I don't know. All.</v>

144
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.620
<v 0>Right. My Badt I thought that was, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know the,</v>

145
00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:13.620
even the specifics of any accusations.

146
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.540
<v 1>And also, I also didn't follow that closely and not because I'm like, man,</v>

147
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:20.930
that's Martin Riggs and I don't wanna hear him in bed. I just didn't follow it.

148
00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:21.764
Cuz I'm like, Ugh.

149
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.570
<v 0>Um, yeah man. It's it's.</v>

150
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.130
<v 1>Can she be forgiven? It's very, very, will she be forgiven? I, I don't know.</v>

151
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.083
I mean, look,

152
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.370
she should have tweeted what you said instead of uh, oh my God.

153
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.970
I took Ambien mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, you know,

154
00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:41.920
that turned into an opportunity for a major farm eutical company to

155
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:44.800
like put out one of the best zingerers Twitter's ever seen a zinger.

156
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.320
I mean like, this is a company they're not normally used to like, Hey,

157
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:49.920
what should we say to be funny? Right?

158
00:08:49.921 --> 00:08:53.400
Like they have to put out very stayed information. And for once they were like,

159
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.720
how about this guys? We say racism. Isn't a, you know, a byproduct of our drug.

160
00:08:57.721 --> 00:08:58.760
It was really well said. It.

161
00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.640
<v 0>Was, it was funny. It was well.</v>

162
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.200
<v 1>Worded. Whoever makes you sit there and go, like, why didn't I tweet that?</v>

163
00:09:02.201 --> 00:09:02.640
Whoever.

164
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.800
<v 0>Wrote it, it was pretty, whoever wrote it rather, it was pretty slick. Um,</v>

165
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.160
the thing ambient does do though, it definitely makes you act bizarre. You,

166
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:13.080
you there's, there's some people sleep.

167
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.950
<v 1>That's one sides. This is the one that's make you.</v>

168
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.790
<v 0>Go sleep. I mean, if you just there's, uh, there's websites, dedicat.</v>

169
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.670
<v 1>Dedicated eat, eat.</v>

170
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.350
<v 0>Edibles that would help. Right.</v>

171
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.350
There's websites dedicated to people that have had crazy experiences on that

172
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:25.580
stuff.

173
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.590
<v 1>I've seen a few of those stories.</v>

174
00:09:26.591 --> 00:09:28.830
And it's the one that you told me about your friend cooking dinner.

175
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:30.230
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is about the fourth time.

176
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.110
Somebody's communicated that story. Now you could drive home.

177
00:09:32.111 --> 00:09:32.710
It could have been,

178
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.750
cuz they've been listening to your show and you may have sold. Its said,

179
00:09:34.751 --> 00:09:36.220
so had that story. They probably have.

180
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.300
<v 0>Uh, people drive cars on it. They go places. They realizing, yeah,</v>

181
00:09:40.301 --> 00:09:41.580
they don't know what they're doing to get places.

182
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.900
<v 1>It's like, theerpen in the rainbow man. You become zombified. And you're like,</v>

183
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.500
I'm not dead. You're bill Pullman in a casket.

184
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.380
<v 0>Well, there was a,</v>

185
00:09:48.381 --> 00:09:51.900
there was a guy that got pulled over a few years back who was famous.

186
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.460
And I forget what he said,

187
00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:57.130
something about like I gotta get to the dance or something like that.

188
00:09:57.131 --> 00:09:59.490
And the cops were like, what the are you talking about?

189
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.130
And they realized like he was kind of out of it. And then after it was over,

190
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.570
it was revealed that he had been on ambient and that he had gotten in his car

191
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.970
and really had no idea what the.

192
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.890
He didn't even know he was talking about when the cops were pulling him over,

193
00:10:09.891 --> 00:10:11.490
like literally the guy was in a dream.

194
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.250
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; it reminds me of when I was a kid, this was not, not drug related,</v>

195
00:10:15.251 --> 00:10:18.240
but I was a kid. I was sleeping. I fell asleep on the couch, watching TV.

196
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.760
And before my, like my brother had lost his wallet at a school dance.

197
00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.200
And my mother was like, I'll drive you up there and try to find it.

198
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.880
And my father would get up for work at about nine o'clock at night and then head

199
00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:31.720
to work at 10 o'clock. And I think he started work at 11 o'clock at night.

200
00:10:31.721 --> 00:10:36.240
He worked at the post office. Cancel and fuckingstance. Um, so he,

201
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.290
I, my,

202
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.630
my mom tells me that and I fall asleep on the couch watching like dynasty or

203
00:10:41.631 --> 00:10:42.790
some sort of. It was the eighties.

204
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.510
And then my dad wakes me up cuz he woke up and nobody was home.

205
00:10:46.511 --> 00:10:50.190
Like my mom wasn't around, nobody was there and he is like, uh,

206
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:53.870
where is everybody? And he startled me awake. So I was like, what? Oh,

207
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.140
Donald Donald, they had to go to the school cuz Donald lost his thriller.

208
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.340
And my father goes, what? And I was like, Donald lost his thriller.

209
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.660
And he was like, I don't know what you're saying. And I was like,

210
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.420
but Don mom said that Donald lost his thriller.

211
00:11:07.421 --> 00:11:10.740
And I kept replacing the word wallet with thriller.

212
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:14.300
And my father looked at me and literally set me aside the next day to be like,

213
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.930
are you using drugs? And I was like, no, I, you woke me up. I, I,

214
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.890
I guess I was in some sort of, maybe I was dreaming about thriller. It was 1982,

215
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.570
you know like.

216
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.330
<v 0>Yeah. Your brain just never clicked back over into waking life. Right.</v>

217
00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:28.370
Just stayed in this weird zombie land. Where.

218
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.290
<v 1>Where wallet meant thriller thrill. Did.</v>

219
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.330
<v 0>You find that? Uh, no. I'm trying to figure out what we were looking.</v>

220
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:36.450
Dude got pulled over and I'm trying to remember what he told the cops where they

221
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.960
realized that something was going on. I think it was,

222
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.320
it was in one of the articles that I tweeted.

223
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.080
The story was in one of the articles that I tweeted.

224
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.440
<v 1>Um, what happens in that instance? You get in trouble.</v>

225
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:47.560
I don't here's but here's thing. Can they,

226
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.440
can they arrest you for being the ambient driver? It's this.

227
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.600
<v 0>Is, it's a rare reaction cuz a lot of people take that. Right.</v>

228
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.880
<v 1>You know, a lot of people and you't hear this story all the time. There's.</v>

229
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.200
<v 0>Not a web page selling just a couple of those pills a day. Right. Theres.</v>

230
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.520
<v 1>Other there's what page devoted to stories of people who took Ambien and,</v>

231
00:12:04.521 --> 00:12:05.720
and got fired for being racist.

232
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.440
<v 0>Right. Well even better.</v>

233
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:12.000
There's no stories of people that took Ambien and uh,

234
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.750
you know, became, uh, addicted to it and became some sort of a,

235
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.590
where is there? Is that addictive is Ambi addictive probably.

236
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.590
<v 2>Yeah. Probably would say probably, yeah.</v>

237
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.750
I think the like getting addicted to falling asleep and needing it to fall

238
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:26.584
asleep probably. Yeah.

239
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.390
<v 1>Yeah. I guess if you were somebody who was like, I can't go sleep without that.</v>

240
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.740
<v 0>Yeah. Wonder if it's addictive? Like maybe like a heroin is of no right.</v>

241
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.060
Or like a speed, you know?

242
00:12:35.061 --> 00:12:37.180
Like people get like physically addicted to things where.

243
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.100
<v 1>It kind of changes the receptors on, on your yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

244
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.980
I don't know if it dulls the sense to the point where like when you,

245
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:45.661
I mean that's what,

246
00:12:45.661 --> 00:12:50.580
the way I heroins always explained to me was when you're on

247
00:12:50.581 --> 00:12:53.770
heroin, the senses are get dulled, the nerve up.

248
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.170
Like just don't take in as much. But when you're not on heroin,

249
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.530
that pain of withdrawal,

250
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.210
part of it is the receptors coming back to life all at once. Wow.

251
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:10.010
And it was liken. Yeah. Jason jasonuse long time ago. I had problems with that.

252
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:14.320
So it was one of the rehab doctors communicated at thusly said,

253
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.080
you know how, when you sit on your hand and it falls asleep, I'm like, yeah,

254
00:13:18.081 --> 00:13:21.080
totally. He's like, imagine that was your whole body in times to buy a million.

255
00:13:21.081 --> 00:13:24.320
That's what he's going through. Wow. And I was like, oh, and then I, you know,

256
00:13:24.321 --> 00:13:28.640
cause up until then I was always like, just stop doing heroin, just stop it.

257
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.280
And then meanwhile, I was eating a lot of sugar,

258
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.720
just stop doing your drug &lt;laugh&gt; and eating my drug. But uh,

259
00:13:33.721 --> 00:13:37.150
once that dude had explained it that way, I was like, oh, that would be,

260
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.190
that would be painful.

261
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.590
No wonder the kid doesn't want to get off heroin cuz he's like,

262
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.870
I know the path to not being on heroin is full of pins and

263
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.430
needlesof but you never die from it. That's the good thing about that.

264
00:13:50.431 --> 00:13:55.300
Like you don't die from heroin withdrawal. We know from, uh, Amy wine, I us,

265
00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:59.900
in other cases that you can die from alcohol withdrawal. Like you can,

266
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.420
you can get off like when you're in jail and you're kicking heroin, you know,

267
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.900
the cops just be like, uh, you know, here just keep throwing up and.

268
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.100
But if you're kicking booze,

269
00:14:10.101 --> 00:14:12.900
they have to give you booze cuz your heart could stop. What are we looking at?

270
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.061
<v 0>We could,</v>

271
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:17.970
this articlely pull up and estimated hundred 46,000 people in the

272
00:14:17.971 --> 00:14:21.610
United States were current misusers of ambient.

273
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.890
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;. Now what does a misuser.</v>

274
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:28.250
<v 0>Mean dangerous dependency onto Ambien can develop after just two weeks of use.</v>

275
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.330
Don't attempt to quit without proper knowledge.

276
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.010
And before putting a medical treatment planned into place. Wow.

277
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:36.640
<v 1>Two weeks is a, all it takes.</v>

278
00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.880
<v 0>Two weeks and you're gonesville sun &lt;laugh&gt; maybe, maybe not.</v>

279
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.000
<v 1>Maybe you're driving, having conversations. Maybere.</v>

280
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.160
<v 0>One of those guys that uses Ambi gets a good night's sleep and you know,</v>

281
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.520
or the worst performance at the job in the morning, you.

282
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.760
<v 1>You kind where you're like, you just lose a word,</v>

283
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:55.560
like you're like Donald lost his thriller and that's the lowest mildest form.

284
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.240
<v 0>Of your hand. Yes. Every now and then you skip a word.</v>

285
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.040
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; which I do now I call that hit in a pothole.</v>

286
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.560
<v 0>You know, Roseanne is, she's an older lady, she's in her sixties and you know,</v>

287
00:15:05.561 --> 00:15:08.160
she's had some mental problems and uh,

288
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.070
and she's drinking and she's taken getting that stuff to go to sleep.

289
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.950
And uh, and she's not taking it for just two weeks. She's taken it a lot,

290
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.470
you know? And she says she needs it to go to sleep.

291
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.110
And I think there's a lot of people that feel like they need something to help

292
00:15:23.111 --> 00:15:24.430
them go to sleep. That's fine. But then.

293
00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.470
<v 1>Me, people think.</v>

294
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.270
<v 0>It worse. Yeah. I.</v>

295
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.430
<v 1>Don't think that at the end of the day,</v>

296
00:15:27.431 --> 00:15:30.030
it's not like she took Ambien and that makes her bad. Like no,

297
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.420
it's that's she tweeted what she did. Yeah. And it's like,

298
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.380
if you think for a second that if in using this drug,

299
00:15:37.381 --> 00:15:39.980
which I need to go to sleep because I'm late sixties,

300
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:44.020
woman mm-hmm and I need my rest or whatever. Um, or you just deserve sleep.

301
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.140
Like, you know, I've mercifully, I've never suffered from a lack of sleep,

302
00:15:47.141 --> 00:15:51.060
but I know people who have, and it's mind bend. So, but if, you know,

303
00:15:51.061 --> 00:15:53.250
you have to do that and you know,

304
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.370
there's the slightest chance that you could become somebody else or
