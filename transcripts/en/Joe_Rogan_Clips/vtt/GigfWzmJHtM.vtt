00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The general good experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.260
I'm also not a big fan of the government saying when an industry is supposed to

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:08.160
end. Yes,

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.390
I'm a big fan of the government empowering the private sector to innovate,

5
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:16.320
to get to the next, you know, affordable, renewable source.

6
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.830
That's going to happen. It's my opinion. If Jeff Bezos doesn't get there first,

7
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.900
the first trillionaire, in my opinion,

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.470
who's already born is going to be the person that comes up with an abundant,

9
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:29.970
renewable source for the future that everyone can't afford. Now, I,

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.380
I get the green new deal and the tenants of it, what they're trying to do,

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.300
but what's not addressed in that is global warming and the operative word

12
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:40.350
being global.

13
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.780
If we don't get India and China and Russia and Africa and south America to

14
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:47.670
reduce their carbon footprint with us,

15
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:52.230
you can literally destroy the oil and gas industry here in the U S at no

16
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:55.170
gain to the globe. That doesn't make sense to me.

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.870
That is such an important point. That's so important.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.400
Nobody's talking about the other countries.

19
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.270
So China and India are building four coal plants per month.

20
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.810
And it's not a case of if we build it, they will, they will come.

21
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:08.730
That's not how this works. In fact,

22
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:12.030
our energy independence is also an issue of national security as well.

23
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.950
We're energy independent. Why?

24
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.020
Because of fracking that are frankly Joe Biden and Carla Harris actually want to

25
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:22.560
do away with, by 20, 35 as well as actually a national agenda.

26
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.960
And so we are reducing our carbon footprint because of fracking because

27
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.980
natural gas burns cleaner, but most importantly, Joe, 20 years ago,

28
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.220
we would kill a bad guy in the middle east.

29
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.090
And then we have to turn around and ask these same countries for resources and

30
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.140
oil. That's a conflict of interest if you could imagine, of course,

31
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.530
so we don't have to do that anymore. So when we kill cost,

32
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.720
some Soleimani outside of Baghdad airport,

33
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:53.010
who was a bad guy responsible for actually killing some west point graduates,

34
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.850
actually in Iraq, we don't have to ask them for oil.

35
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.250
So this is an issue where we have to marry economics

36
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.200
innovation and of course,

37
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:08.340
make sure that we are good stewards of this earth, right?

38
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.530
But right now there's roughly 1 billion with a B roughly 1 billion

39
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.650
light trucks and vehicles in the world today that are gas powered.

40
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.110
And over the course of the next 20 years,

41
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.910
the world is going to add another billion vehicles and of that billion

42
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.510
750 million of them are going to be gas powered.

43
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.020
Again, it's not a California problem.

44
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.410
It's a global issue that we have to take a look at.

45
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.630
From a defense standpoint,

46
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.070
I flew Apache helicopters and we have a joke in the army. How do you know if,

47
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.820
if somebody flew Apaches, we will tell you,

48
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.523
we always do.

49
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.810
And what's funny about the Apache and about destroyers and

50
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:53.220
about [inaudible] and that's,

51
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.910
you can't fuel them on solar and wind.

52
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.270
We literally aren't going anywhere for the next few generations.

53
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.790
What I want to hear the conversation shift to is more of the idea of us

54
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.510
working with these oil and gas companies to innovate for the future.

55
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.250
And they want it to it's a matter of time until we get there,

56
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.600
but let's bring them along with the conversation and not demonize them.

57
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.510
And as somebody that's Houston born and bred,

58
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.930
this is the conversation that's near and dear to my heart. Because again,

59
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:30.310
it's the energy capital of the world. And I am all for solar. I am all for wind.

60
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.560
I am all for renewables. I get it.

61
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.850
But it's a combination of all of the above, not an,

62
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.290
not an or conversation.

63
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.110
<v 1>Now. Let's what is the green new deal? Can you lay that out for us?</v>

64
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.910
What are they, what are they looking to.

65
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.440
<v 0>Do deal? You know,</v>

66
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.800
one big thing that Joe Biden talks about and what Bernie Sanders was talking

67
00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:52.740
about as well as being carbon neutral by 2035,

68
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:56.760
which effectively is an end to the oil and gas industry United States.

69
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.200
That that's one, that's one tenant of it. Uh, another one is, uh,

70
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.250
fracking bans. And again, as I just articulated,

71
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.430
this was the very technology that's actually reducing our carbon footprint.

72
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.380
Also just more restrictions on oil and gas companies to be able to

73
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.920
drill and find resources as well. Um,

74
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.930
and it is a job killer in Houston, Texas,

75
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.490
particularly as we recover from COVID-19 and we've been hit pretty

76
00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:30.630
hard because if you notice the oil and gas industry has been hit pretty hard

77
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.860
too, started off, uh, with just a,

78
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.560
obviously a shortage of, uh, of,

79
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.600
of demand because people just stopped driving and that really drove cost down

80
00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:43.434
tremendously.

81
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.000
And so we have to recover from this thing and the way to do it is not to employ

82
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.740
more restrictions on an already hurting industry that quite

83
00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:56.490
frankly has got to be around or rather you like it or not.

84
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.070
Also the byproducts of petrochemicals as well. This microphone,

85
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.080
this mug, your phone,

86
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.410
it's hydrocarbons the shoes on your feet.

87
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.440
It's all byproducts of the oil and gas industry.

88
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.580
And so what people don't realize is that the chairs that they sit in,

89
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.720
the silverware that they eat off of, where they eat, sleep, breathe, and live.

90
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:21.960
The mattress that they're sleeping on is fossil fuels.

91
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.410
We literally aren't going anywhere.

92
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.280
I understand the benevolence of the green new deal. It's always good in theory.

93
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.110
I got it. I think,

94
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:34.170
I think if we could magically snap our fingers and the world could be just

95
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.820
carbon neutral. That, that, that, that sounds great. That sounds great.

96
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.940
But that's not how they're, that's not how this works.

97
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.810
We are always about progression.

98
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.740
This country is always about innovation and progression.

99
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.450
We've been doing this for generations.

100
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.590
Let's continue that progression by enabling again,

101
00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:57.980
the private sector to innovate to next level.

102
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.620
If we're paying attention to what the green new deal says,

103
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.440
it basically just demonizes an entire industry.

104
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.580
And I think for a lack of understanding what the industry does for the world.

105
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.660
<v 1>Is there in the green new deal,</v>

106
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.550
is there a solution for what they deem the problems of the oil and gas

107
00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:19.390
industry? Do they have a replacement for those resources? So therein lies.

108
00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:20.224
The point.

109
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.090
<v 0>Hydrocarbons are a storable energy that have a lot of</v>

110
00:06:28.091 --> 00:06:32.890
power in them. And that's actually the reason why the world uses them. Uh,

111
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.360
bottom line is, is this. You can't turn your lights on the world.

112
00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:40.930
Can't turn their lights on the U S can't turn their lights on for the time being

113
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.020
without oil and gas, oil, and gas industry.

114
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.510
If we were able to miraculously even attempt to turn this entire country into a

115
00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:52.540
renewable source, it's just not possible.

116
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.180
I don't know exactly what the numbers are,

117
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.790
but we would actually only be able to fuel less than last.

118
00:06:57.791 --> 00:07:02.560
I read 8% of our world of the United States is energy demands.

119
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.590
If we were able to completely transform to renewable resources.

120
00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:06.880
So that's just wind and solar.

121
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.890
That's when solar and battery lithium ion,

122
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.420
you know, these kinds of these kinds.

123
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.160
<v 1>Of things. It also requires something to charge them. What about nuclear?</v>

124
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.300
Because yeah,

125
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.800
one of the things that is really uncomfortable for people is that

126
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.090
nuclear power is one of the cleanest sources of power that we know of.

127
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.840
It's just, we know about disasters. We know about Fukushima.

128
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:33.280
We know about three mile island.

129
00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:37.120
We know about all the Chernobyl Chernobyl we know about these disasters,

130
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.890
which in many cases are indicative of old technology like

131
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.440
Fukushima. They just really didn't know how to shut it down,

132
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.460
which is bananas that decided to build it anyway. Mind-boggling.

133
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.350
<v 2>They're like, we'll figure it out later, but.</v>

134
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.600
<v 1>They there's, there's ways of doing nuclear, right?</v>

135
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:03.100
Where you have very little environmental damage that's right.

136
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.170
But that's a, you just bring up nuclear power and everybody's like die.

137
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.010
<v 0>Right. It really freaks out. Yeah. And they, they, they Trenoble,</v>

138
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.340
what do you think about nuclear? So this is, this is again,

139
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:19.330
the importance of innovation. You brought up an excellent point. You see,

140
00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:20.560
in the past technologies,

141
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:24.160
we didn't have the ability to be able to really create something without

142
00:08:24.161 --> 00:08:27.130
understanding what the worst outcomes could possibly be.

143
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.590
Do you think over the course of the last 50 years,

144
00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:32.410
we've actually advanced to know more and to be able to do better and to be more

145
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:36.880
effective with how we, how we do this. Of course we have, right.

146
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.400
But it kind of goes back to the oil and gas industry as well.

147
00:08:39.401 --> 00:08:42.460
When you have the overt demonization of an energy source,

148
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.670
people just as we were talking about, they just shut it off. Right.

149
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.790
It becomes a headline that said, I don't want anything else to do with it.

150
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.710
Oh no. We thought about incidents. That's it?

151
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.160
It becomes headline news instead of us saying, well, wait a minute,

152
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.080
if you're going,

153
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.490
try to tell me that 2020 was the same as the seventies and the sixties and the

154
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:03.600
fifties from a technological standpoint. It's ridiculous. I mean,

155
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:06.280
look at your Tesla that you drive. No, I mean,

156
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.320
that is a technological Marvel and advancement in itself,

157
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.120
and now we're producing it on a mass scale. Thank you for Elon Musk.

158
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.960
And again, even the production of the Tesla that,

159
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.660
that doesn't mean we do away with the oil and gas industry. Oh,

160
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:25.920
we could have both. Let's continue to do both. So from a nuclear standpoint,

161
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:29.580
I also think that that's gotten demonized as well because of some incidences.

162
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.280
And we need to realize that from a technological standpoint,

163
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:36.450
we are certainly further along than we were before. Let's pursue this.

164
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:42.090
Let's empower these companies to come up with a safe way of building

165
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.953
these,

166
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.470
these plants and also making sure that everybody can stay safe in the future.

167
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.710
<v 1>I've actually heard discussed. That's kind of fascinating is, um,</v>

168
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.590
technologies that could be on the horizon that can actually pull carbon and pull

169
00:09:57.591 --> 00:10:02.570
particles from the atmosphere that they can develop essentially

170
00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:07.340
enormous air filters that can be used in high pollution

171
00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:09.890
areas and, you know, cities and urban centers.

172
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.450
And they actually can pull pollution out of the air and potentially

173
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:19.160
use that carbon. And it can actually be a resource that's exactly. Right. Right.

174
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:22.610
So tell me, people think about that pretty crazy that they kind of make sense,

175
00:10:22.611 --> 00:10:26.420
right? Like if you can put it out there, then it's there. Well,

176
00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:29.150
if you can push it out, can you extract it?

177
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.220
It seems like you should be able to meet,

178
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.130
we re extract nitrogen from the atmosphere. Right. I mean,

179
00:10:34.131 --> 00:10:35.960
that's how they make a lot of fertilizer. That's right.

180
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.240
There's gotta be a way to take that carbon out. Of course there.

181
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.840
<v 0>Is. And, and, and again, people want to look at where we are right now.</v>

182
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.150
Maybe we aren't there now. Right.

183
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.710
But we can easily be there in the, not so distant future. Sure.

184
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.190
<v 1>But 150 years ago, we were riding horses. Thank you. Yeah.</v>

185
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.650
<v 0>And think about what you just said that wasn't.</v>

186
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.850
<v 1>That long ago, by the way, that's pretty recent. That's crazy. Yeah.</v>

187
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.080
<v 0>In world war one and world war one, they were still using livestock. Yeah.</v>

188
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.730
<v 1>Yeah. Bananas. I mean, think about that. I know. Yeah.</v>

189
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.290
It's, uh, it's hard for people to,

190
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.860
once they have it in their mind that they're doing a good thing. Like the,

191
00:11:15.861 --> 00:11:18.260
the proponents of the green new deal, they're doing a good thing.

192
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.030
This is the way in anyone who opposes that,

193
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.990
or anyone who even has debate about it is on the wrong side.

194
00:11:23.991 --> 00:11:26.840
You are on the side of the fossil fuel industry. You've been paid off.

195
00:11:26.841 --> 00:11:29.390
You're a shell. You don't care about the environment.

196
00:11:29.391 --> 00:11:30.500
You don't care about our children.

197
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.080
And then they'll propose it this way that you know,

198
00:11:33.081 --> 00:11:35.660
this person does not care about the future of this country.

199
00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:39.380
We're going to burn look, what's happening in California. This is Trump's fault.

200
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.900
This is like, we were discussing this in the podcast yesterday.

201
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.530
It didn't matter who became president in 2016,

202
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.990
the exact same conditions would be in place.

203
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:51.650
Here is battleship is an enormous thing. It's hard to turn around.

204
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.023
And you think that,

205
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.200
or another of Hillary Clinton was president that California wouldn't be on fire

206
00:11:56.201 --> 00:11:58.600
right now. Of course the exact same thing would be happening.

207
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.270
Would it be a hundred percent? There's no other way around it.

208
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.340
<v 0>And, and what I always say to people that have, have this conversation with,</v>

209
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:05.860
and again,

210
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.900
I have two kids at the house and it is my opinion at this point with two baby

211
00:12:09.901 --> 00:12:10.734
girls,

212
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:15.480
that it is incumbent upon us to make sure that we hand them a better world than

213
00:12:15.481 --> 00:12:20.340
we inherited. Yes. We were like, again, you know, the birth of a child is a,

214
00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:21.600
is a spiritual thing.

215
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.810
<v 1>We were saying this before the podcast and talking about your,</v>

216
00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:29.060
your youngest and how crazy it is. It's crazy. It's like,

217
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.270
life-changing, my youngest is 10, but still I think back. And you know,

218
00:12:33.271 --> 00:12:34.830
there's times when I'm alone, where I just go,

219
00:12:34.831 --> 00:12:37.050
I can't even believe I have children like Canada. I can't even believe that.

220
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:41.970
It's a thing that a person who comes out of your own DNA is now

221
00:12:41.971 --> 00:12:45.090
walking and talking and hanging out with you. Yes, yes.

222
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.550
<v 0>And, and destroying our living room.</v>

223
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.690
<v 2>That's we live and breathe. Yeah, for sure. So of.</v>

224
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.700
<v 0>Course I care about, of course I care about them.</v>

225
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.730
And of course I care about the environment. I just have,

226
00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.190
I just want to take a pragmatic approach to making sure.

227
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.510
<v 1>That yeah, well, we're so polarized today. If you don't agree with me,</v>

228
00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:07.710
you must be evil and this is, or you must be naive or you must be foolish.

229
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.100
This is,

230
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.970
these are the perspectives that are the narrative that you see on social media

231
00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:12.211
today,

232
00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:16.260
which is where so many people are forming their opinions and then arguing them.

233
00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:18.670
And it's insanity. Yeah. It's,

234
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:21.990
it's such a crazy time where people want people.

235
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.880
I was having a conversation with a friend of mine today.

236
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.080
They were talking about this new social media platform where this person was

237
00:13:28.081 --> 00:13:31.620
arguing. Don't hear people's opinions. What we need to do is de platform them.

238
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.540
Right? Like what? This is, that's insane.

239
00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:37.290
So everybody has to agree with you and you don't, I don't even know if.

240
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.090
<v 2>You're right. You don't even know if you're right.</v>

241
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.860
The way you find out you're right.

242
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.390
<v 1>You got to talk to other people.</v>

243
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.140
I think there's a lot of times I've talked to people and I went, huh? Okay.

244
00:13:46.141 --> 00:13:49.590
Yeah, I'm wrong? Okay. Like that's important the whole point. Yeah.

245
00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:52.530
You have to be able to have these conversations, um,

246
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.860
what the proponents of the green new deal,

247
00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.150
what are they proposing in terms of replacing fossil fuels

248
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.410
and the,

249
00:14:01.411 --> 00:14:05.970
these things that we're relying on currently to power everything and have the

250
00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:09.720
country running exactly how it's running now and therein lies the problem.

251
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.930
They're not, they're not, so what are they saying now, when they're,

252
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.130
when they're questioned on this, like,

253
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.650
what are we going to do in 2035 in terms of like,

254
00:14:16.651 --> 00:14:18.600
how are we going to keep the lights on? I.

255
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.480
<v 0>Have no idea, really. And this is, and this is literally,</v>

256
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.180
this is literally part of my problem. And that is, if you,

257
00:14:24.181 --> 00:14:28.310
weren't going to tell me a substantive viable solution. But if, so,

258
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.680
if you want to say it, that's it snap my fingers like Thanos, that's it.

259
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:36.240
We're going to be carbon neutral here and okay. Okay. So what's the path to do.

260
00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:39.270
So what resources are we going to use to get there?

261
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.380
How are we going to replace these resources? And again,

262
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.920
I'm not a climate denier. I keep saying this over and over again, but,

263
00:14:46.921 --> 00:14:50.370
but nothing's being proposed. That's rational and reasonable.

264
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.190
That's actually addressing global warming. Yeah.

265
00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.380
It completely leaves out the other countries.

266
00:14:57.381 --> 00:15:00.980
It completely leaves out the globe and that's problematic. Yes.

267
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.300
<v 1>Yeah. What they, so they're not even discussing it at all. No,</v>

268
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.170
they're just conveniently. It sounds good. It's it's it's it sounds good.

269
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.620
<v 2>Yeah. It sounds sound good. Sounds amazing. It sounds great. But it's.</v>

270
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.470
<v 1>Like the name of it. Green new deal, who doesn't like green thing.</v>

271
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:20.890
Beautiful episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on

272
00:15:20.891 --> 00:15:25.780
Spotify. That's right. They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

273
00:15:25.781 --> 00:15:28.180
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

274
00:15:28.181 --> 00:15:31.900
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

275
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.890
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

276
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.720
That's all we're asking you. Just go download Spotify. Buh-bye

277
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.710
okay.
