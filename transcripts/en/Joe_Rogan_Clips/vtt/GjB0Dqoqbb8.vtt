1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So in that section,</v>

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.110
I pulled out a book and I was like six years old and I see a guy

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.240
chained to the side of a building, staring out, looking like death is upon him.

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.710
And that was who DV. And I didn't know anything about what that all meant.

5
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.770
I looked through the pictures and he was hanging upside down and stuff like

6
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:24.450
that. But when I went to sleep,

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.380
I would have these dreams of this guy chained to the side of a building.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.490
And that began my curiosity and love of, of Houdini.

9
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.560
And then that began my curiosity of like,

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.960
not just like the magic tricks stuff, but like this stuff that's, to me,

11
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:41.900
it's more like real. Yeah.

12
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.730
<v 1>How do those two worlds collide? Because some of the things you're doing there,</v>

13
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.570
they're just insane endurance and mental exercises,

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.880
and then other things you're doing or what you would consider magic. Right. So,

15
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.150
so.

16
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.840
<v 0>I love both separately, like independently. Like I always love,</v>

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.100
like I had a karate teacher at the Y YMCA that used to make us all run barefoot

18
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:07.820
in the snow, in the winter in Brooklyn. And the, all the kids were young.

19
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.160
We were like six, seven, all the kids like, ah, you know,

20
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:12.740
and afraid they were going to cut their feet on glass or whatever.

21
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.330
And I would run in it and I felt like I could do this because I wasn't good at

22
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.820
other things physically, like I was born at my feet,

23
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:24.110
turned in and stuff like that. So I felt like this, I could do these things.

24
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:26.840
So then I've learned how to hold my breath.

25
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.320
And the reason I learned to hold my breath was simply because I was on the swim

26
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:31.520
team at the Y also,

27
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.880
and the other kids would swim back and forth and they'd destroy me.

28
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.740
Cause my feet didn't function perfectly well.

29
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.270
And what I learned is that if I didn't breathe, if I just swam,

30
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.480
it would save me time because I didn't have to move my head, dip it out and,

31
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.780
you know, right. So I would just swim and a coach would Gale at me,

32
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:51.350
but suddenly I was no longer in last place. I was like now second.

33
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:55.100
And sometimes first and that began my like, oh God,

34
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.920
you can actually do what the coach doesn't think as possible.

35
00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:00.320
You could swim there and back without breathing in,

36
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.660
then the older kids would come to see me do that.

37
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:06.050
And I would like challenge them. I'd be like, um, let's see,

38
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:09.320
you could stay under the longest and you can go up and down five times.

39
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:12.590
I didn't understand the physiology of it that like going up and down,

40
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:13.251
doesn't help.

41
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:16.640
It's more effective to just sit through the pain and just kind of chill.

42
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.090
But I would just sit there and they'd go up and down and come back down at which

43
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.440
makes it worse that they'd be out and I'd still make it worse because, uh,

44
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.040
the breath holding thing is all about like a CO2 buildup in your bloodstream and

45
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:32.330
it's about a tolerance level to it. So if you relax and efficiently,

46
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:35.420
keep your oxygen and not make this CO2 build up more extreme.

47
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.550
You can actually hold more efficiently. So.

48
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.750
<v 1>When you have that feeling,</v>

49
00:02:38.751 --> 00:02:42.110
everybody has that feeling where you'd need to breathe. And that's.

50
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.590
<v 0>Not an OTU deprivation. It's a trigger from a CO2 buildup,</v>

51
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:50.060
which is giving you an alert that for example, in 20 minutes from now,

52
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.440
you will not recover.

53
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.630
And I didn't believe that either some magician friend of mine, who's amazing.

54
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.880
Um, and one of my like heroes in life, uh,

55
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.020
he, he told me a story as I was doing like buried alive, only thing he said,

56
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.980
you know, you know, the Navy seals, you know, they black them out under water,

57
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.140
so they're not afraid of drowning. And I'm like that. Can't no way like,

58
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.830
cause it seems so abstract to me, you know? So,

59
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.510
but it stuck in my brain.

60
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.050
And then when I wanted to do the water tank stunt and I started learning about

61
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:27.340
free diving and stuff like that,

62
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.940
I suddenly realized blacking out is pretty straightforward.

63
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:33.550
Like you black out and then you get your head above the water and if you're

64
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:36.910
supervised, you're fine. So when I went to San Diego with the seals,

65
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:39.910
I watched what they do and I actually did it, but I didn't black out.

66
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:42.010
I went back and forth a few times and pulled,

67
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:46.210
but they have that viewing pool and they wrote the seals up to some 45 pound

68
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:49.690
weights and they have to walk across the bottom of the pool and the instructors

69
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:53.260
are swimming above them. And when the, when the seals blackout,

70
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:55.750
they cut the rope, bring them up to the top and they're fine.

71
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.530
But what that teaches you is that you do not need to worry about being

72
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.680
underwater because if you're with a team and by the way, nobody's try this,

73
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.420
you know, there is extreme, dangerous to shallow water blackouts,

74
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.680
which leads to death.

75
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.600
But if you are in somebody that's training and you have a

76
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:16.420
team and we want to push it, as soon as you black out,

77
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.940
it's like getting knocked out. But it feels better.

78
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.080
It's not like getting knocked out with a punch. It's like, it's your fault. No,

79
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.830
but no. Yeah. But it choked out as before, right? Yeah, exactly.

80
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.070
Except this one's even better. And then you have all these dreams.

81
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.760
<v 2>No, it sounded exciting that part.</v>

82
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.190
<v 0>Of it, when, whenever I wake up from a blackout, I'm like.</v>

83
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.630
<v 2>Well, that's how people wake up when they get choked out.</v>

84
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.760
<v 1>Really the same. Yeah. When people get choked out,</v>

85
00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:43.350
they wake up almost like they were dreaming.

86
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.550
Like sometimes they think they're at a disco. Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.460
<v 2>It's amazing. They're like, oh wow.</v>

88
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.880
<v 1>And, uh, it's not the best thing in the world for you,</v>

89
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:57.390
but it's way better for you than getting knocked unconscious. Yeah. Yeah.

90
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.400
Chose the head. Yeah. Choked out is just, uh,

91
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.870
just shuts off the blood to the brain and the brain shuts off and then it comes

92
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:07.860
back online, but there's no trauma, right? Yeah. But it's not. Yeah.

93
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.220
So it's like blacking out underwater thing.

94
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.890
Probably not a good idea to do too many times though. Right.

95
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.160
<v 0>You could do it. I mean, I've blacked out underwater a lot. How many.</v>

96
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.220
<v 2>By the way, so, okay. Times, I.</v>

97
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.360
<v 0>Don't know, like between 20 to 30, I mean, I like, wow,</v>

98
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.370
by the way you guys are talking about me,

99
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:27.930
I'm a thing about the breath hold things.

100
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.170
So one time I went 20 minutes and two seconds,

101
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:32.850
I almost did what you were talking about.

102
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:35.340
The length of a show that I did 20 minutes and two seconds.

103
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.730
And I had telemetry there and I had pulmonary experts and everything like that.

104
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.760
And my heart rate dropped to eight beats per minute.

105
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.710
<v 3>Eight shape. And they pulled me up cause they were freaked out. Like, yeah.</v>

106
00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:47.910
But back.

107
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.630
<v 0>To what I'm saying is the reason besides the Navy seal story that I knew that it</v>

108
00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:55.560
was, it made sense. It was because you hear about the kids in the news,

109
00:05:55.561 --> 00:06:00.380
like in 1984 or whatever was a kid was under an icy river for 45 minutes

110
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.350
with nothing blacked out unconscious underwater for 45

111
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:10.100
minutes, they rescue him out, pull him back,

112
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.860
recover him and full recovery.

113
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.270
So there's something that the body does it. We don't understand it,

114
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.560
but if you actualize. So because he blacked out and because it was so cold,

115
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:22.700
the blood shunting occurred.

116
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.550
We're all like the same as when you get called the blood rushes away from the

117
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.440
extremities and protects the vital organs.

118
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.420
And because he didn't inhale the water, cause it was completely out of it.

119
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.830
When they recovered him,

120
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:36.680
they didn't even have to get water out of his lungs and he was perfectly fine.

121
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.630
Wow. So, but,

122
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.990
but that just shows you that there's like a certain levels of,

123
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.800
of what the body can tolerate, that we have no idea.

124
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.200
<v 1>So you, in,</v>

125
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.760
in learning how to swim and learning how to go all the way back and forth and

126
00:06:51.761 --> 00:06:52.420
holding your breath,

127
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.620
this started this idea of holding your breath for an extremely long period of

128
00:06:56.621 --> 00:07:01.360
time. Like what had been the record before you had like 20 minutes and how many

129
00:07:01.361 --> 00:07:04.090
seconds? Two seconds. That's what you did. What did you done?

130
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.580
What had you done before that would have been your record?

131
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.000
<v 0>When I was a kid, I heard as I start reading about Houdini,</v>

132
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.350
his like proud record of his lifetime and he's the underwater escape king for a

133
00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:15.700
hundred years ago. And he had,

134
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.370
he was around the best swimmers and he had access. So,

135
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.960
and he got up to three and a half minutes. So by the time I was like a

136
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.450
teenage Earl, early teenager, I got to three and a half minutes. And.

137
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.570
<v 1>You think that that was a barrier that couldn't be crossed at while.</v>

138
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.680
<v 0>I came, I blacked out as I came out, but I didn't know what that all meant.</v>

139
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.890
Right. So I blacked out and was that size like, okay,

140
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.930
three 30 seems like the edge.

141
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.120
But then when I started working on the actual concept of like,

142
00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:49.180
how long can you hold your breath for? Then I started looking into it. I'm like,

143
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.060
oh wow. There's like people that can do five minutes, six minutes,

144
00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:57.010
seven minutes. And then there was a hypothetical record of, um, of,

145
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:03.040
uh, a hypothetical 13 minute record, but no evidence of it.

146
00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:06.970
And that was on Piero too. So it was a hypothetical bureau to record of 32.

147
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:07.450
When you.

148
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.870
<v 1>Say on bureau two was your process. If that flushes everything out</v>

149
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.760
[inaudible] yeah. Yeah. You go purge really.

150
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.630
<v 0>Hard on pure Tusa, which is like hyper vented,</v>

151
00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:23.320
which gets rid of the CO2 and gives you more room for oxygen. And by the way,

152
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.510
I just went up to 25,000 feet in an airplane ascending at 500 feet per

153
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:31.570
minute doors open and everything, no oxygen.

154
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.210
And I was with Luke Akins who jumped from 25,000 feet with no parachute land in

155
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:39.850
that he was with me and two other, the pilot and two other guys,

156
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.720
we just right under 25, this was a 24 7, whatever. And um,

157
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.660
he S I said, let's see who goes hypoxic first. Right? So, no, no, no,

158
00:08:49.661 --> 00:08:52.180
but we have no, but you have to take the ox. The O two,

159
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:56.070
you have to take the O two monitors. You have to be on top. Right. So,

160
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.840
and I was already in a hypobaric chamber with the FAA in Oklahoma city.

161
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.930
And I started purging just to see what it would do and my levels,

162
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.410
my oxygen levels shot up, which nobody believes is possible.

163
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.450
So I get into the airplane and we put the monitors on and everybody's around the

164
00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:16.230
same. I was actually lower than Luke. I was like at 90, whatever,

165
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:20.670
5 96, he was at like 97. He's like, oh, get a jokey with me.

166
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.610
And as soon as we crossed 15,000 feet,

167
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.830
his slowly starting to come down and I start doing the breathing technique.

168
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.950
Yeah. Purging out, like I said,

169
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.230
right. My oxygen levels.

170
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.050
And we filmed all this shot up to 98.

171
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.760
And then 99% is I went up to 23

172
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.560
plus thousand feet. Now these guys think I'm a magician. So they're like,

173
00:09:48.561 --> 00:09:50.600
yeah, aha. Like fake there's,

174
00:09:50.601 --> 00:09:53.660
that's what he wrote on the paper next to the levels. Cause he was recording it.

175
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.460
So I took his monitor off of his finger and he took mine.

176
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.230
I put his monitor on my finger, put mine on his bang.

177
00:10:03.231 --> 00:10:07.520
His was dropping around 70 and mine was 98, 99.

178
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.623
Then I switched.

179
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.830
I switched with everybody on the plane and the oxygen levels with the breathing

180
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.540
all the way up to that altitude.

181
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.390
And I'm not recommending this because I haven't tested enough in it,

182
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.260
but they did stay up at 98 99.

183
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.090
And so my evidence for that was you hear about all the Sherpas.

184
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.100
It go up to the top of Everest up to 29,000 feet and they're

185
00:10:31.101 --> 00:10:33.710
not bringing oxygen. I get it. They're acclimating six,

186
00:10:33.711 --> 00:10:37.040
but they're still at 29 plus thousand feet.

187
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:42.040
So they're doing something that's allowing them to rewire their ability to NACO

188
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:42.973
go hypoxic.

189
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.250
<v 1>So this breathing technique,</v>

190
00:10:46.251 --> 00:10:48.620
you're essentially exhaling more than you're breathing in.

191
00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:50.120
So you're breathing a small amount of man.

192
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.940
<v 0>And that I fill up everything for full,</v>

193
00:10:55.941 --> 00:10:57.710
but I mean full like top to bottom,

194
00:10:57.711 --> 00:11:02.450
hold for a second and then exhale slowly. And I like, for example,

195
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.180
if, when we're done here, if you have 20 minutes,

196
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.620
I'll get you up to a four and a half minute breath, hold it in 20 minutes.

197
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.520
And this is just through these breathing techniques. When we're done with this,

198
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:14.930
I'll show you how to do it.

199
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.620
And you will get up to four plus minutes for sure.

200
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.671
<v 1>Did you,</v>

201
00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:23.390
so you you've learned that you could go three and a half minutes or three

202
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.910
minutes plus, right. And, and blackout.

203
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.950
And then how did you have it in your head that you were going to eventually get

204
00:11:30.951 --> 00:11:31.784
to 20 minutes?

205
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.540
<v 2>Right. Okay. So you really want to hear all that? Yeah. It's a long, oh God,</v>

206
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.460
let's go. Can I forget where I'm going?

207
00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:41.180
Sometimes you might have to remind me where we're going. Okay.

208
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.610
So I know the process because [inaudible].

209
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.640
<v 1>Well, first of all, I.</v>

210
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.740
<v 0>Like Houdini, so I love magic,</v>

211
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:51.650
but I like Houdini and Houdini was like king of cards as well,

212
00:11:51.651 --> 00:11:55.450
but he's a guy that's doing real. And then I like guys that are like, as I go,

213
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.260
I go to the museum of broadcasting. Cause there was no YouTube or whatever.

214
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:02.710
So I'd look at like these Matt, you search magic. And I'd find like,

215
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:07.570
guys that would like drink a gallon of water, drink a liter of kerosene.

216
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.390
He would float all the kerosene on top of the water.

217
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.300
And then he would spit out kerosene out of his mouth,

218
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.750
look like a human dragon and then put the fire out with a gallon of water.

219
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.040
So it's that it is magic, but it's uh, it's art.

220
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.910
It's mind blowing. It's an art, it's a performance piece. It's not like,

221
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.350
it's incredible. Now look, there's guys that are card guys that are like that.

222
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:31.900
Also like lots, lots of people I love.

223
00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:35.140
And they do the cards in a way that's like, but,

224
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.270
but that act to me was what pressed a button. It was like, whoa,
