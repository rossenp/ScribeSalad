00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um,</v>

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.120
but to share that with everybody nationally in my world,

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.160
in the thing green line,

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.920
and for them to start having it happening on their refuges,

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.760
and even just to know this,

6
00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:16.240
stuff's getting back to their parts of the world and poisoning their,

7
00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:20.360
their cannabis users, you know, unsuspectingly horrible information, right.

8
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.750
But we need to know it. And a lot of guys didn't know it.

9
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.910
And so that was one thing to see, Hey, we need to have a baseline training.

10
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.870
And the way we do it here in California is we all go through a really stringent

11
00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:34.470
academy. Everyone gets their basic tools, arrest control, and defensive tactics,

12
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:35.990
you know, and firearms training and all of that,

13
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.590
and get good at being the traditional game board and doing all the traditional

14
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:43.620
stuff. And they get, you know, know, get, get their feet wet out,

15
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:45.060
doing their own thing for a couple years.

16
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.980
And then we start to find the people that have the motivation or want to get

17
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:49.980
onto a specialized unit,

18
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.300
like our met team or one of the watershed teams or the wildlife trafficking

19
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:58.220
team. Very seldomly do we put a fresh person there because you know,

20
00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:01.420
I think to really be a good game warden, you gotta cut your teeth,

21
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.930
all the traditional stuff. That's critical of just having to,

22
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.130
having to check guys with guns all the time. You know,

23
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.170
most cops look at that and go, that's crazy. I mean,

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.810
everybody you check has a knife or a firearm. Yeah. Well,

25
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:17.250
fortunately 99% of 'em are guys like you and me that wanna see a game warden and

26
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.690
game war wants to see us, but for the one felon,

27
00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:23.320
that's on parole and he's in the woods hiding. And we run across that a lot.

28
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.040
And I, I run across a ton of that down here in SoCal,

29
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.520
really at the start of my career.

30
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.360
And I've got some interesting stories about that, but so guys who are like,

31
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:33.840
they skip bail and then they go and hide. Yep.

32
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.280
And they've got like a no bail warrant they're wanted on some warrant somewhere.

33
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.880
And so they're off fishing. They have an illegal firearm.

34
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.750
Maybe they're a felon in possession of a firearm. They can't even have of,

35
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.270
and now they're out in a remote area where no cops gonna find me here.

36
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.030
And then I'm the new game warden in Riverside county, you know,

37
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.270
all fricking motivated, really green. I don't know totally what I'm doing yet.

38
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.890
Right.

39
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.190
And I'm in that truck cruising and something I got into down here that was just

40
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.750
crazy, but I will say this, it was a heck of a learning curve and I'm,

41
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.460
I'm really blessed. It went out the way it did and it was, I was safe in it,

42
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.540
but, um, we would get gang bangers from, from LA here.

43
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.540
And they would go over into Riverside county and get into my kind of rural,

44
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.780
you know, foothills and on the edge of the national forest.

45
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.660
And they'd have AK 47 S and they'd have, you know,

46
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:21.620
automatic pistols and they would spotlight through these canyons gunning for

47
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:24.330
everything. They'd kill rabbits, they'd kill coyot. They kill deer.

48
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.570
They get to the end of like a canyon that has like a, an outlet of a dam,

49
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.530
throw a gillnet out and spend all night there,

50
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:34.010
just gillnetting fish and hunting freely and shooting,

51
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:36.810
killing everything with their spotlights, grab their gillnet,

52
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.410
grab hunters of fish pack up, and then head back, you know,

53
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:43.250
back to the LA basin, gang bangers. I'm not kidding.

54
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.680
And like craziest part fishing, gang bangers. Yeah. Commercial,

55
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.800
almost commercial fishing does it does. It sounds nuts. Right. So strange.

56
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:52.800
And what would they do with the fish? Oh, they'd eat 'em maybe they'd sell 'em.

57
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:55.440
You know, who knows? Usually with quantities that big, they were getting sold.

58
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.960
But the thing that was crazy is I would be, you know, alone, I'd be in my truck.

59
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.880
I didn't have a canine yet, you know? And now I just, uh, I just retired with,

60
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:06.920
well, like you're a Marshall, I have Apollo yellow lab, English lab.

61
00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:09.240
She's amazing. Never gonna bite a bad guy,

62
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:12.480
but she's gonna lick him to death and try to try to, you know, uh,

63
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:13.920
turn 'em all away. Um,

64
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.360
but I didn't even have a companion dog at the time and I would go and run into

65
00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:20.110
these guys and go, okay, this is to what I learned in the academy that you know,

66
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.990
that, that head on spotlighting stop that you never want to have,

67
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.390
or getting behind him, blacked out and tracking 'em down. Um,

68
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.310
and next thing I know I got AKs and I got all these freaking prohibited,

69
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:34.070
exotic weapons, and I'm going, this is crazy. I'm pulling these guys out alone.

70
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.230
I don't have a lot of, so it was just you. It.

71
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.150
<v 1>Was just me. How many guys.</v>

72
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.300
<v 0>Did you run into sometimes B two, one night.</v>

73
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.340
I pulled like eight people out of a van. Oh. And I was alone. Oh.

74
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.580
And they were all armed. And it was one of my heaviest, most intense cases.

75
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.060
And I had been on one year, so this was 1994.

76
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.500
And what we were doing in the Riverside squad is we were just saturating the

77
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:58.260
area. Cause we were getting everybody from over in the LA side here,

78
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.170
spotlight and all our G aim. So we like, okay, let's saturate this.

79
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.210
And back then, Joe,

80
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.890
the game was to catch a spotlight or red handed cuz they're so deliberate.

81
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.970
Explain spotlight to.

82
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.850
<v 1>A lot. People listen to.</v>

83
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.570
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, I should, I should have done that.</v>

84
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:13.250
But spotlighting is where you use an artificial light,

85
00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:15.410
whether it's a handheld spotlight, a flashlight, whatever.

86
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.210
And you go into remote areas and you look to find animals at night because they

87
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:22.840
freeze. They're really relaxed, their eyes glow. And then you shoot,

88
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.680
'em that way you kill 'em illegally at night after dark, which is never allowed,

89
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.040
you know, it's usually in or outta hunting season.

90
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:32.200
Cause anyone's gonna spotlight a deer nine times outta 10 they're they're not

91
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.000
licensed or they're not gonna do it during season. Like we do. Um,

92
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.600
so they're doing that. So in the, in our world as game wardens,

93
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.470
that's the ultimate all life criminal because they're gonna kill doze. You know,

94
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.710
that, that have that unborn trophy buck for good genetics.

95
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:49.950
They're gonna kill a trophy deer way in the rut, you know, that, you know,

96
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:51.950
needs to go another year or whatever. Um,

97
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.790
so that's what we focused on that was like, if I can cut my teeth and get,

98
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:58.230
you know, become a, a, a reputable game war and of going after the hardcores,

99
00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.150
that was the game then.

100
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.060
So it was 94 and I'm these guys out and calling 'em out on a loud speaker.

101
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.140
I've got my weapon on 'em and I'm like, oh man, there's a lot of guys out there.

102
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.940
I can't get 'em to jail. I'm calling back up. I got Riverside county coming in.

103
00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:11.940
I mean, we even have the, the,

104
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:14.020
the Sheriff's office helicopter come in several nights.

105
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.460
Once we got to know each other and they realized who is this game warden?

106
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:18.300
And what are these game wars,

107
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:21.180
Riverside county going out into just crazy areas by themself,

108
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.010
they'd monitor our traffic and they'd come in on the helicopter and light it up

109
00:05:25.011 --> 00:05:25.731
and call 'em, you know,

110
00:05:25.731 --> 00:05:28.370
call these bad guys out on loud speakers just to make sure we were okay.

111
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.410
And it feels good when the calary comes on those nights, man, let me tell you,

112
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.330
well, so's crazy.

113
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.290
<v 1>In those sort of situations,</v>

114
00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:38.090
they just didn't know that you would ever run into someone that's that arm,

115
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:41.770
that many guys yeah. In the van or what have you eight people it's.

116
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.080
So the reason why you're patrolling by yourself is cause they didn't anticipate

117
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.870
anything like this.

118
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.480
<v 0>Well, and we didn't have the bodies, right?</v>

119
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.080
This was one of the things that was crazy.

120
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.880
We get back to the thin green line concept and realize that one game warden is

121
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:57.280
responsible for 200 to 250 square miles,

122
00:05:57.281 --> 00:05:58.480
give or take whoa.

123
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.080
And you know how big Riverside county is on the inline empire empire,

124
00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:04.920
200 square miles, maybe more, you know, depending on what part of game,

125
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.480
game warden, one game warden.

126
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.680
So a squad of seven game wardens to put it in perspective,

127
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.360
check this out brother. So when I was supervising traditional patrol,

128
00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:16.790
before we started the special op met team in Santa Clara CA county,

129
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.110
we always had vacancies because we always low on bodies.

130
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.430
We couldn't hire game wardens, fast enough.

131
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:24.150
We weren't funded for it or where the case may be.

132
00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:27.190
So we might have four or five game wardens for seven positions.

133
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.470
And we had to cover all of Santa Clara county,

134
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.990
which is everything from the city to all those foothills.

135
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.510
And there's a lot of it in Silicon valley. People don't realize

136
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.780
all of San bonnito can county, which is huge Hollister Gilroy, right,

137
00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:40.620
where I'm from in Gilroy,

138
00:06:40.621 --> 00:06:44.580
that whole area down to the south that is just massive mountain country full of

139
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.100
wildlife. Um, and then like part of Monterey county.

140
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.060
And I had five people in myself as a Lieutenant that is insane.

141
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.420
And I can't believe that. So to go out on a spotlighting patrol to that point,

142
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.090
um, and have a partner with you, just one other game warden, that's tough.

143
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.210
You know, you're basically pulling a whole nother area.

144
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.810
You can't work night hunters. So is spotlighting that common. It,

145
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.330
it is still going on in the state and it's going on a lot. Um,

146
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.490
back then here,

147
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.170
because there had been so little presence here in Southern California,

148
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.800
it was off the hook. It was crazy one week in 9, 18 94.

149
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.240
I remember I was, uh, I had a really good ride along with me,

150
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:26.040
a wildlife biologist, just a savvy hunter, great eyes.

151
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.480
He became kind of like my right hand, man, Brian. Um, and we,

152
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.400
I said, we're gonna catch a spotlight every night, this week. He goes,

153
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:35.920
you think? So I go, it's that crazy? Let's see if we can do it.

154
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.070
And so we went and worked all night long. We started on Monday night.

155
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.070
How do you catch 'em? Do you look for a spotlight?

156
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.230
Like what do you get to a vantage point glass it's yeah.

157
00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:47.550
It's just like glass in a big basin for elk. Right? Right.

158
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.830
You get in a really good Overwatch that you get the most visibility, you know,

159
00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:55.550
hide the truck and um, you watch and you find areas where it's likely to happen.

160
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.830
And it, it takes a while to learn where that's gonna be,

161
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.700
just because you got the huge district and you could have 20 places where guys

162
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.600
spotlight,

163
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.700
but until you get into the area as a new warden and really get to figure it all

164
00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:08.980
out, you don't know where to be. And it's a trial and error, but you know,

165
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:10.820
it took me six months. Give or take of just,

166
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:14.500
just going out there and scouting hard and, and seeing where this road goes.

167
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:17.260
And how does that canyon look? What type of water do I have down there?

168
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:20.210
What am I seeing at low light in the evening when animals are coming to water?

169
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.090
Ooh, I got a whole herd of elk here. I got a whole herd of deer.

170
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.410
I got some bucks, you know, I'm seeing other animals run around.

171
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.050
This is gonna be a hotspot because guys can get to it.

172
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.450
And if you just put the time in, you just kind of lie and wait, you know,

173
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:36.130
kind of put your little hide together. Um, just like hunting a big game.

174
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.050
Eventually it starts happening.

175
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.240
And by 1994 and I've been in district a year down here,

176
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.040
I pretty much had my spots figured out my partners and other parts of Riverside

177
00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:45.460
did too.

178
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.720
So we'd all be out alone so we could cover more area and talking back and forth.

179
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.360
I mean, and I'm gonna date myself here, but cell phones are brand new.

180
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.760
So we all had those flip cell phones and we were, how old are you? Uh,

181
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.600
I'm gonna be 51 in November. I'm.

182
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.560
<v 1>52. Yeah. We about it. No, no. Yeah.</v>

183
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.320
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; so we're right there. You know, all that era. So when I started, I mean,</v>

184
00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:05.680
it was the flip phone, you know, let's start track communicator. Sure.

185
00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:08.040
Calling my partner, Jerry, like, I love those. Where are you at? They're great.

186
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.440
I'm like, where are you at? He goes, I'm over here in Thomas mountain. I'm like,

187
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:13.880
I'm over here. You see anything yet? I go, I got one light working. I gotta go.

188
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.910
And then all go.

189
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.550
<v 1>So, but that's crazy. Like you're talking about enormous pieces of land. Oh,</v>

190
00:09:18.551 --> 00:09:21.150
it's that you guys are responsible for. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, for,

191
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.270
it's hard for people to put into perspective that don't spend any time in the

192
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:25.100
woods, right.

193
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.830
That you would be able to even find these folks in this enormous area. Yeah.

194
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:30.980
Yeah.

195
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.150
<v 0>It's starts off as a needle in haystack type thing, you know,</v>

196
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.340
but once you get into it, you get fairly good at it, but it,

197
00:09:37.341 --> 00:09:39.060
it always is difficult because again,

198
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.100
just the percentages of catching a guy on the right night that he's gonna be out

199
00:09:43.101 --> 00:09:43.800
there.

200
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.460
And then you got the guys that kind of get savvy to knowing where the game war

201
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:49.220
lives, driving by his house,

202
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:51.580
looking for his patrol truck to see if he's out that night.

203
00:09:51.581 --> 00:09:54.180
Whereas the truck parked. Wow. We start getting into that problem. Oh wow.

204
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.850
So we always kind of, you know, kind of maintain as cover as we can, you know,

205
00:09:58.851 --> 00:10:01.330
we're known in the neighborhood and the thing is we live at home.

206
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.050
We work out of our homes, home office.

207
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.450
We're close to our community because if we kept our truck at a field office,

208
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.970
we'd have no response time, all spread out.

209
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.290
So we get very community oriented in,

210
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.530
in community functions and conservation groups. And everybody knows us rather,

211
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:17.880
it's a big city or a small little town in the mountains.

212
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:21.600
So you got guys doing the cat and mouse thing, looking for us and you know,

213
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:24.120
making sure, Hey, is this truck there or is he out pet patrolling? Well,

214
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:27.560
maybe I won't go out tonight. Mm. Um, but, but that, that era Joe in,

215
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.560
in 1994 was, was off the hook. I,

216
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.240
I didn't get a spotlight every night that week,

217
00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:35.080
but I got six outta seven and one night I had a double. So it was crazy. Wow.

218
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.350
And seasoned a ton of guns. And you know, some guys were going to jail,

219
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.670
some weren't, um,

220
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.390
but a lot of wildlife was saved that night because they would've, they would,

221
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:43.270
would've done a lot of harm.

222
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.270
<v 1>You know, you know, most of these guys,</v>

223
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:47.750
are they doing this recreationally for fun? Are they're doing it for food? Like,

224
00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:48.070
what are.

225
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.790
<v 0>They the, the group I was getting into down here, it was, it was recreational.</v>

226
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.990
It might have been to sell the meat. I couldn't prove that.

227
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.460
Or it was just to go kill stuff. Um, you do get it, people that need meat,

228
00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:58.861
you know,

229
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:02.620
that do spotlight after dark because they need the meat and stuff like that.

230
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:05.780
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, and it's still a violation. We still deal with it as such.

231
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.900
But if we ascertain that, we're gonna be fair about it. You know, we said, okay,

232
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:12.540
look, you're poaching. I know you're starving. It's outta season.

233
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:15.900
It's in season, you have a tag, but you just really gotta get that meat. I mean,

234
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:18.490
there are certain cases where you just kind of feel for that person to go.

235
00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:21.130
Right. I see where the motivation was, you know,

236
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.450
and a very small percentage of poachers are that way, but some of them are just,

237
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.370
you know, they're just trying to feed their family. Right. And they're,

238
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.170
it's a whole different game and we're, we're gonna be fair about it.

239
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:32.250
Or we should be fair about it were.

240
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.850
<v 1>Most of em, gang bangers or most of em criminals, like, what is it?</v>

241
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:37.090
Was there a down here.

242
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.720
<v 0>Average here, 70, 80%. Yeah.</v>

243
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.800
Had criminal histories had illegal weapons associated with gangs. So.

244
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.400
<v 1>It was almost like recreation for them.</v>

245
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.400
<v 0>It almost was. That was like what practice. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

246
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.360
And I remember one case down here that was a pretty crazy one. It was,

247
00:11:53.361 --> 00:11:57.080
it was three guys, pretty inebriated, pretty liquored up. And, um,

248
00:11:57.081 --> 00:12:01.000
it was a head on stop. And one of them had a, uh, like a $50,000,

249
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.320
no bail warrant for cocaine trafficking outta Mexico. Jesus.

250
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.480
And that was in that week that we had, you know,

251
00:12:06.481 --> 00:12:07.920
crazy spotlight and things going on.

252
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.830
So it was just the demographic of down here where up north that into

253
00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:14.190
it wouldn't be necessarily that felon,

254
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.990
but that guy that just wanted that trophy buck and to get it cheap, to get it.
