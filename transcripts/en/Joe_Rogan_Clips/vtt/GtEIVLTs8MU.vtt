00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.570
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I mean,</v>

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:07.230
I've experienced intense stress from doing the thing I love the most,

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.450
which playing, playing concerts, you know what I mean?

4
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:14.340
I've experienced it firsthand where it's like, and that's way different.

5
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:15.720
When does it hit you? Like when,

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.930
obviously I'm not like telling someone their loved ones,

7
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:22.650
like about to die, but, uh,

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.010
do you still feel it mandatory for me?

9
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:30.000
It's all about just being in the right head space. Um, you know, I mean,

10
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.540
like when we first started playing, we would play these indie rock clubs,

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.520
you know? Cause we, we come from that background,

12
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.480
like I guess what they would call now, hipster or whatever.

13
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.290
And that was just people who liked, you know,

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.630
really passionate about certain types of music that wasn't massively

15
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:48.210
appreciated. You know, it was just still kind of what we're into.

16
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.410
But because of that,

17
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:52.080
most of the people that were coming to our shows were like the high fidelity

18
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:53.580
type record store clerk, you know,

19
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:57.870
you're playing the show and it's just like arms crossed. But then afterwards,

20
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.800
like pretty good, you know, we'd be, we'd be like 20 to 22 year old kids.

21
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.780
And the, the, the gatekeepers were like 30, you know, 32 year old.

22
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.340
Now I would look at them as maybe being like, uh,

23
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.890
you know, uh, supportive. But at the time it was more supportive,

24
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:19.620
but at the time it felt more like judging mean.

25
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.850
So if I get in the wrong headset, headset, Headspace,

26
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.380
and I'm on stage and I'm like, oh man, everyone's here to like judge,

27
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.740
judge us or something. You know what I mean?

28
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:30.810
Like what you're looking at this big crowd, but then I have, you know,

29
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:32.580
I ultimately do. I ultimately tell myself, I was like,

30
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.560
the worst band of all time has probably played the more, more, you know,

31
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:42.300
like some terrible, like Menudos played the more people, you know what I mean?

32
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.550
Like this isn't that many people it's like,

33
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.730
like tonight we're playing the Wiltern. Like there's like 3000 people.

34
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:51.000
It's like, this is be honest. Like the worst standup comedian, like,

35
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.240
I don't know. Or I don't know, man, like,

36
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.990
like the fifth Jonas brother could sell 5,000 tickets in LA, probably.

37
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.990
So it's less stressful when you or Gallagher to comply sell 3000 tickets in Los

38
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:08.730
Angeles. Come on. That's how I look at it. You know, I'm like, oh,

39
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:12.600
we deserve to be here more than that person. We put our time in.

40
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.050
That's a hilarious way to look at it. I'm serious.

41
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.440
Why would you concentrate on things that you think that sock is that alleviate

42
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:21.300
anxiety? Does it actually work? No,

43
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:24.900
I read this thing that captain Beefheart one of our favorite musicians said,

44
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:27.270
and it was like, if you started, if you think about what you're doing,

45
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:31.180
you've already lost the battle. And the reality is,

46
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:34.170
is that I don't need to think about, and I know Dan, doesn't it.

47
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:35.550
We don't need to think about what we're doing. So,

48
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:38.310
because we're not thinking about what we're doing.

49
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.670
Like the trick is to stay in the moment with the music,

50
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.640
but I can play and not think about it. And then I start thinking like,

51
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.970
what's that person thinking about? I'm like,

52
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.980
I got this other conversation happening here. I'm like,

53
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.830
and then like an intruder. Yeah. It was like,

54
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.810
I liked it like temporary schizophrenia, like pat,

55
00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:01.840
what if you just stopped playing like a devil and angels? Yeah. There's like,

56
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.560
I actually remember thinking that I'm on stage at Glastonbury. There'd be like,

57
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.010
you know, there's a 200,000 people or close to that and like, oh,

58
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.930
I just stopped playing. Like what would happen either?

59
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.970
Maybe don't do that. Don't do it.

60
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.960
<v 1>Just keep going. Yeah. He, he, yeah, pat, sorry.</v>

61
00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:22.210
I had to almost sign a breakdown and a lot of losing one new year.

62
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.660
<v 0>We both, it was intense for both of us actually, because you know, it was,</v>

63
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.910
I mean, you should tell a story.

64
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.170
<v 1>I mean, I just remember it from my point of view. I don't know.</v>

65
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.350
I don't know what was going on through your head at the moment, five.

66
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.183
<v 0>Red bulls.</v>

67
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.320
<v 1>He was getting into this thing where he would be really anxious and drink a lot</v>

68
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.610
of red bull. Oh no.

69
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.560
And so we got on stage and it was like a sea of people and he was on his fifth

70
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:51.310
red bull and his eyes were like saucers and he was just staring at me.

71
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.280
I had to like talk him off the ledge. Right.

72
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.020
Like I had to like put my foot up on the riser and kind of lean in and kind of

73
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:05.530
talk in a voice, calm voice. Hey man, how you doing?

74
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.630
<v 0>You know what I mean? I was just, I was just.</v>

75
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.760
<v 1>Exhausted. Really? I'm like, what do you want to do?</v>

76
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.640
Whatever you want to do is cool. Me. You know what? Just let.

77
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.780
<v 0>Me know. He had to call me down.</v>

78
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.360
<v 1>How many red bulls does it.</v>

79
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.510
<v 0>Before it becomes speed? I don't, I don't drink that anymore. But you know,</v>

80
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.080
I think we also have been playing these shows and it was exhausting.

81
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.020
<v 1>Most of it had to do with our, our, uh, schedule, our.</v>

82
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.750
<v 0>Stress. And it was in the middle of summer. It was hot as hell.</v>

83
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.160
And I would think I was severely dehydrated, but, but I mean, I was,

84
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.830
cause we played this one show in Des Moines right around this time that this was

85
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:40.630
in 2010. Right? So this is, this is when this happened was at Lollapalooza 2010.

86
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.640
And this is the festival that we had played like, um, four times before.

87
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.630
So it wasn't like something new and we weren't even headlining this time.

88
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:51.640
It was just like, we were on stage doing something.

89
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.230
I'd actually looking forward to the show.

90
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.760
But this was like a pivotal moment for me. It was like, I,

91
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.450
I just kinda missed a beat of a song.

92
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:04.030
Something that no one else even noticed other than probably Dan.

93
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.240
And then I was like, oh. And I got like,

94
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.820
I spun out and then I just kept spinning out. You know what I mean?

95
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:11.530
Like a panic, like a panic attack on stage.

96
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:14.830
And when you have like a panic attack, like, you know,

97
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.110
you tend to get a panic attack doing the same thing you did before. So I,

98
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.540
for a while I was having a like little mini panic attacks.

99
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:26.290
Every time I was on stage, but I got through the set and everything was fine,

100
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:27.820
but I was like. And a part of it was,

101
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.270
I looked out and there were like 50,000 people we've been playing this festival

102
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.040
four or five times before. And to like crowd starting that maybe 5,000 people.

103
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:40.960
And now here we are the way most of the festivals watching us play.

104
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.040
And I was like, oh, like what? The happening? Finally,

105
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:49.210
people were here and I was like, I can't it up now. And then like, boom.

106
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.783
But you know,

107
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.200
I went to go see this dude here in LA, in Santa Monica,

108
00:05:57.201 --> 00:06:02.150
named Kerry Gaynor, who like he specializes in like either the test.

109
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.460
I mean, look, man, I didn't know what to do. Wait a second. This get so good,

110
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.850
dude. I didn't know what to do because I did it.

111
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.310
I got a couple of friends that are like, man, let's get some beta blockers,

112
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.210
get some, get some, a value, drink some beer.

113
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.930
I can't do any of that before I go on. I can't be relying on that before I play.

114
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.610
So I was like, I,

115
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.190
I got a recommendation to go see this hypnotist who specializes in like

116
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.570
quitting smoking and fear of flying and also stage fright.

117
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.930
There's a lot of like actors who are going to do like plays for the first time.

118
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.120
So I went to go see Carrie at his house.

119
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.050
And uh, we were playing some shows at the palladium and he,

120
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.210
he did this thing hypnotize me. And the second night,

121
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.210
like I went that first night we played, it was like better.

122
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:55.550
The second that we played, it was like pretty much gone.

123
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.140
And then I woke up in the hallway of the Roosevelt hotel and the stairwell in my

124
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:05.030
underwear at like seven in the morning. And I'm like in the, in the,

125
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.590
in, I'm in the staircase,

126
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.990
in my underwear seven in the morning. And I'm like,

127
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.880
what the? And I just remembered like this number, like 7 0 8,

128
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.690
I think it wasn't like I had only been to the room one like two, two times.

129
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.500
And my girlfriend at the time was in there.

130
00:07:24.501 --> 00:07:26.330
Luckily and I went and knocked on the door. She's like, what the?

131
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.670
Where the were you going? I was like, I just don't know hypnotism.

132
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.580
It's real. Jeez. Have you ever been hypnotized?

133
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.130
<v 2>Yes. Did it work? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. There's a guy who was on yesterday, actually.</v>

134
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.080
His name's Vinny Shoreman he hypnotized a lot of fighters. Okay. And, uh,

135
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:50.150
he, uh, has his fighters. Yeah. He gets them into this. It's really interesting.

136
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.980
Like I I've never had it before and I wanted to try it. I was like, okay.

137
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:59.540
I had these thoughts that it was probably or for people who have weak minds,

138
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.770
but it's a state that they can talk you into. And someone who's really good.

139
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:07.340
Like Vinny could talk you into this state and then you're totally conscious,

140
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:12.140
but you're definitely you definitely in this weird tunnel where you feel safe,

141
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.550
like mentally safe,

142
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.300
it works and you can talk and think about things in a way that's almost free of

143
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.950
normal, regular anxiety. You can, you can address the anxiety. You can see it,

144
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:27.100
but it's for the brief amount of time while you're really in that state, you,

145
00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:29.300
you can get rid of all that. Oh.

146
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.240
<v 0>This dude's been weird. This guy, uh, Kerry.</v>

147
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.810
I remember a couple of things specifically that he said,

148
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.730
and I went so that he said like, you know, you're, you know, you're,

149
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:40.880
you're afraid of messing up.

150
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.060
That's the whole point of like being in a rock band is like,

151
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.410
it's okay to mess up. It's not supposed to be perfect. You, I mean, perfection.

152
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:52.520
Isn't something that anybody even wants. You know what I mean?

153
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:55.190
Like if you go to like the art gallery and you see like a Thomas Kincade

154
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.860
painting, no one wants that. You know what I mean?

155
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.580
