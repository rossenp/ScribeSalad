00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.140
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So Jimmy Smith,</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.150
once the first time they have you working well,

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:08.400
I'm doing the pre and post for two 20. Okay.

4
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.830
So you're in the Fox desk in California. In California. Yeah. And then.

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.910
<v 1>Um, they have they've, they've offered me, uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.580
a couple and I've accepted them, but they haven't. Yeah. Yes.

7
00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:23.870
I don't know if it's official yet, but soon, soon as I'll put it,

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.360
they just color. I'm assuming.

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.340
<v 0>They just trust you or you don't have to do any,</v>

10
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.120
like test shows or anything like that. Cause I've heard it guys.

11
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.180
I've heard of guys doing test shows. I try people out and.

12
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.120
<v 1>Not that I'm aware of. No. I mean that's already. Yeah. I mean obviously,</v>

13
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.980
you know what the you're doing? Yeah. It's.

14
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.670
<v 0>I would imagine that the real hard gig has gotta be finding one,</v>

15
00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:46.400
them play by play guys that doesn't annoy the out of you. Here's the.

16
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.110
<v 2>Deal. That's a real job like that. Colors, colors,</v>

17
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:55.610
easy doing play by play. That's a real job. That's like they do a lot more news.

18
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:56.870
Anchor was that.

19
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.600
<v 1>Different gene coloring and play by play is, is,</v>

20
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.610
were specific to a particular sport.

21
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.370
And we can call grappling and combat sports and whatever, uh,

22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.060
play by play guys do I'll do basketball one week and then hockey and then this,

23
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:11.840
and then that gets, it's a job, but there are a lot more of them. You can go,

24
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.070
okay, he's good at basketball and soccer, you,

25
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:16.250
you can see a body of work before they jump in.

26
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.370
Because a lot of times it's we need a guy who knows a sport and they're only so

27
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:20.204
many.

28
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.900
<v 3>Yeah. It's a very different job, very different skillset. But.</v>

29
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.570
<v 0>People get they're real angry. If you don't know MMA,</v>

30
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.680
if you're like a play by play guy and you say some goofy and you don't really

31
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:34.220
know the sport, they do,

32
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.640
they get out. I'll forgive you either. They don't.

33
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.790
If they don't think you really know the sport or really love the sport,

34
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.620
those two things are critical. Yeah.

35
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.720
You have to really know it and really love it. Otherwise,

36
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.940
otherwise they're like, you. People hated me.

37
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.740
<v 2>When I w when I commentated for Kingston.</v>

38
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.960
<v 3>That'd be. So I had to say something stupid. Every show I had to say,</v>

39
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.250
he just did.

40
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.930
<v 4>It. They just showed it. They just show the,</v>

41
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.320
the big Jeremy Stephens haymaker.

42
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.840
<v 2>Oh, I saw sucked. Oh my God. That was terrible.</v>

43
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.990
<v 0>Think of it as a, you know what? You were really good at.</v>

44
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.790
You were really good as the guy in between the rounds that was explained,

45
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.340
uh, who won the fight. Like when you, you and I,

46
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.180
people don't even remember this, but we worked together. Uh,

47
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.410
it would be Goldberg and me, and then for a bunch of cards,

48
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.180
you would be beside.

49
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.580
<v 3>Us. He was a scorecard guy. Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.870
<v 0>So he had, but Eddie had a real system, like we talked about it and I was like,</v>

51
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.070
how are you doing this? And he had a,

52
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:37.910
like a really well thought out system where he had a line down a piece of paper

53
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.530
and he had a bunch of categories.

54
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.950
And he had all these different things where there was take downs or,

55
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.090
and so he marked all these things on top of watching the fight.

56
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.690
He wanted to know, like, be able to look down on it, like, wow,

57
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.100
he landed all these right hands.

58
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.330
<v 2>Look at the end of the fight. Yeah. They go to me.</v>

59
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.210
I have to talk about what happened in the first time I gave him the second.

60
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.010
Cause remember that second he had two takedowns, but if I didn't write it down,

61
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:06.670
I would forget. Yeah. So as I'm waiting to go on,

62
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.280
I'm revealing that first round. I'm remember, you know, it's,

63
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:12.490
it's a lot easier to see what, what actually happened. Cause you forget.

64
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.580
Or anyways, I do, I would forget unless I wrote it down.

65
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.840
<v 1>The funniest thing to me or the most frustrating thing in music is they wanted</v>

66
00:03:18.841 --> 00:03:21.420
me to do scorecards calling unofficial scorecard, you know, whatever,

67
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.370
just like you did. And I would do it.

68
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.620
And every time I never wrote down a number without explaining what I

69
00:03:28.621 --> 00:03:30.900
was talking about. I gave it tonight as close round,

70
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.100
but I gave it because of this, this and this,

71
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.760
and people would always act like you just threw out a numb without saying

72
00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:39.630
anything. What was he thinking? I said, what I was thinking,

73
00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:42.180
I ex I never just wrote down nine, 10. I always said,

74
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.160
and here's why here's you may disagree.

75
00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:47.550
But here's my logic behind what I'm saying. You can disagree with me. Fine.

76
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.000
But the people that act like I just write down a number without explain.

77
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.960
It's insane.

78
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.840
<v 3>I'm so not going to miss that. Commentators.</v>

79
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.150
<v 2>The interviews. Once I said congratulations to Randy couture. I said,</v>

80
00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:01.590
congratulations, Chuck.

81
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.500
<v 3>No, that's what you did. And I didn't realize, I said that.</v>

82
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.630
<v 2>Out of the octagon, uh, who was it? Joe Silva goes, dude. He said,</v>

83
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:14.820
congratulations, Chuck. I said, what.

84
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.520
<v 3>What? I thought I was.</v>

85
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.180
<v 2>Going to get fired right there. And I went up to Joan and said, dude,</v>

86
00:04:20.181 --> 00:04:24.720
did I say congratulations, Chuck? He goes, you go, yes. I'm like, oh no,

87
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.703
this is mine.

88
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.240
<v 3>I totally thought I was getting fired. Oh, 100. I can talk.</v>

89
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.810
<v 1>About this because we joke about it. We joked about it and belt over it. But uh,</v>

90
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.580
uh, Jen brown, one time we were in and it was alive, it was a live piece.

91
00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:40.680
It was just at the house. So it didn't go out on air or anything.

92
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.340
It was just for the house. Jim brown football, Jim brown, Jim brown,

93
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:48.930
Jim brown does stand up stuff for both. Okay. We were in, uh, Vacaville,

94
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:53.070
Oklahoma. And she said we had been in Kansas the week before. And she goes, Hey,

95
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:54.210
Kansas. And.

96
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.470
<v 3>The, she goes pretty. She goes.</v>

97
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.830
<v 5>Oh, you know that they really didn't. They really didn't react much. And she.</v>

98
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.310
<v 1>And the guy goes, you said Kansas. We're in Oklahoma.</v>

99
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.540
<v 3>And uh, we laugh about that. We always joke about.</v>

100
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.760
<v 1>I love jam, but like, yeah, for weeks it was what state are we in?</v>

101
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.510
We just met forever. But it was just an in-house piece.

102
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:17.670
It didn't go out on TV or anything. It's hilarious. Lucky.

103
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.860
<v 3>We've all done. We've all messed up.</v>

104
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.073
People were talking.

105
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.220
<v 0>I've called over a thousand fights. I've up a bunch of, oh man,</v>

106
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.450
the Brittany's human brain just doesn't work. Perfect. You make mistakes.

107
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.350
Sometimes.

108
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:38.580
Which drives me crazy is I have a very good recall for flights and for

109
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:42.090
scenarios and positions that people have been in and ways guys won.

110
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.780
But occasionally there'll be a guy and I can't remember his name.

111
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.280
And it's like weird it's but it's a guy that I've seen fight a lot.

112
00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:50.850
Like Jorge Mazda dollar, someone like that.

113
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.460
But I seen him fight a hundred times. Like, how the do I,

114
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.770
why isn't that one coming out? It's like,

115
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:59.660
the brain is just not a perfect vehicle.

116
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.050
It just doesn't always work. Right. It's like a range Rover.

117
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.350
They look beautiful. The range rovers work most of the time,

118
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.240
you know what I'm saying? Like,

119
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.850
I have a friend who has a range Rover and I asked him, I said, Hey,

120
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.820
do you like that car? I was like, yeah, this is my second one.

121
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:17.830
My last one was a lemon. I knew it. And he's like, it's a great car.

122
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.630
It's amazing. When it drives [inaudible] it's like how a brain is.

123
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.980
It's not always good. You saying congratulations, Chuck,

124
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.180
and then leave. And you're like,

125
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.320
I do that all watch flights.

126
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.330
<v 1>Not necessarily yours, of course.</v>

127
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.050
But I'll watch somebody calling a fight and I'll know when they spaced on the

128
00:06:38.051 --> 00:06:39.460
name. They'll they'll start going.

129
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.440
<v 3>You know that? Cause on your you're watching you go. He spaced on his name,</v>

130
00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:47.230
dude. It's almost to be basketball, football, whatever. But I'll go.

131
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.500
<v 1>I'll know. As a broadcaster. I'm like, he spaced,</v>

132
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.460
he looked at his notes and he got the name back, but he's based on the name.

133
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.030
And it happens a hundred percent for happens all the time.

134
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.550
<v 0>Big fear is that I'm going to be interviewing a fighter after a</v>

135
00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:07.270
fight. And then I can't remember their name when I congratulate them.

136
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.850
<v 1>The biggest fear, bro.</v>

137
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.050
<v 0>I, no, that's not just you dude. That's mine too. Before I go out there,</v>

138
00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:16.510
I will write it. Like if it's a dude I've never seen quite before,

139
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.030
like maybe one by first round knockout, I've never seen a fight before.

140
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:21.760
I'm like, oh, who is this guy? He might've come from, you know,

141
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.900
CFA or something like that. I'll write his name down. I'll read it.

142
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:27.580
I'll say it back. I'll repeat you.

143
00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:30.250
You might see me walking to the stage to the cage.

144
00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:33.000
And I got my earpiece in and I'm saying, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

145
00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:35.170
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm saying his name. I don't want to.

146
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.510
<v 1>Up. You are not alone though. Do that. Fear is.</v>

147
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.320
<v 3>Huge because you're thinking of a question to cause you to think about what to</v>

148
00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:42.154
ask them.

149
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.290
<v 1>And we on air when we're saying this,</v>

150
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.540
we talking about interviewing fighters is literally the.

151
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.320
<v 3>Hardest part of the job because they're your heart because you don't have.</v>

152
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.790
<v 2>Time to prepare for it. And then you have time to ask him one,</v>

153
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.950
maybe two questions that said, no,

154
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.280
everyone has their own question in their own head that they want to ask.

155
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.180
And if you don't come up with something entertaining or creative,

156
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.440
um, you know, people talk on you.

157
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.230
<v 0>It's also very important.</v>

158
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:14.320
This is what I tell people that are just trying it out for the first time.

159
00:08:14.321 --> 00:08:15.131
And then anybody,

160
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:18.220
any young people that are thinking about getting into MMA commentary,

161
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.180
you're the, you're not the show like you are,

162
00:08:22.181 --> 00:08:25.570
you are just trying to extract information out of this person.

163
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.330
Like your question should be just to lead them.

164
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.510
I try to have as little personality and those things as possible.

165
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.920
I'm just trying to just give you the platform. Yeah.

166
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.260
I'm just trying to give you maybe a path to take your answer.

167
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.930
I saw some beautiful things happen in the fight. I want to,

168
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.970
I want you to express what happened in your mind or maybe there's some adversity

169
00:08:45.971 --> 00:08:48.340
that you had to go through. I want to know how bad it was,

170
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.650
but I don't want to be there. I'm just,

171
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.200
I'm just the guy that has to say those words.

172
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.580
<v 2>They hated. Post-fight I've never enjoyed that flip.</v>

173
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.760
<v 1>Side of that though, that I've run into personally. Um, you know,</v>

174
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.800
an overdoing it too is if your question, isn't a, you know, Hey,

175
00:09:06.801 --> 00:09:10.880
great performance tonight, man. If it's too open and a lot of times they go,

176
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.310
yeah, you know what I mean? If you,

177
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.490
if you don't ask them something a little specific, they'll just kind of go.

178
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.090
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, if you don't say, oh great.

179
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.890
<v 3>You know the tire they're out of breath.</v>

180
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.560
So it's that you want them to go wherever they want to.

181
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.670
<v 1>Go. But also if you don't ask something specific enough, sometimes they'll go.</v>

182
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.090
Yeah.

183
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.890
<v 3>It was how your pants with some of the dozens. Oh,</v>

184
00:09:33.891 --> 00:09:36.800
those are rough back and forth. But honestly.

185
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.240
<v 0>Sometimes it gives you more time.</v>

186
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.990
I always try to talk slow and give them some,

187
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.950
I try to simplify what I'm saying, but even then I still,

188
00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:50.600
sometimes I that up. You know? It's just, it's one of the weirder jobs. Yeah.

189
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.200
I never.

190
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.100
<v 2>Liked it. I never liked that at all. I never really liked commentating. Yeah.</v>

191
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.880
<v 0>I tried to get DC when DC was doing it because DC was doing a few of them.</v>

192
00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:02.450
Like we were doing it and I go, oh, that's your job now, bro. He's like, that.

193
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.200
You're doing that. Joe Rogan. Get in. There I go. No, no, no man.

194
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.170
I'm are you doing a good job? I like sitting here. I'm just going to sit back.

195
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.040
He was like, that. Cause he was doing like the fight pass prelims.

196
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.950
<v 2>Unless you're in the industry,</v>

197
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.320
you'd be surprised at how many people don't realize that there's a play by

198
00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:25.760
play guy and a color. They just seem to dudes talking. Yeah. That'll no,

199
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.350
I didn't. I was a grown man.

200
00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:29.570
When I first got offered the job at king of the cage.

201
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.930
I didn't know the difference. I just thought, yeah, there's two dudes,

202
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.320
two old dudes talking.

203
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.040
They're just chit-chatting I didn't see the system in the,

204
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.080
and there's a problem.

205
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:44.030
<v 0>Though. The problem in MMA is that the color guy is the martial arts expert</v>

206
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.310
and the, but the play by play guy is this, the news guy is just the guy,

207
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.110
but the play by play guy in sports is kind of calling what's happening as well.

208
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.770
He's saying, you know, they're moving the ball, they're doing this,

209
00:10:57.771 --> 00:11:01.670
they're going this, this formation. But when you're calling a fight,

210
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.750
especially when the fight goes to the ground that played by play guys not really

211
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:07.340
saying anything, right? Yeah.

212
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.090
<v 2>He could say he's in the Mount, in the mountain taking big shots in the Mount.</v>

213
00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:12.540
You don't have to be an expert to tonight a little.

214
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.300
<v 0>Bit, but he's basically, he's like,</v>

215
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.830
like when gold Goldie and I had a great rhythm because Goldie like kind of laid

216
00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:20.600
off when it, especially when it would go to the ground,

217
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.130
he would lay off and he would just sort of like, you know, he would set me up,

218
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.130
like, he'd say in any, moves into the Mount position or he would say, you know,

219
00:11:28.131 --> 00:11:31.340
something like that. And then he would just lay it up for me.

220
00:11:31.341 --> 00:11:35.600
And then I would elaborate on the progression of techniques and where they were

221
00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:36.680
at. Yeah. Yeah.

222
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.470
<v 2>That's what he's supposed to do. Um,</v>

223
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.160
that's the hardest job ever. I didn't know.

224
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.380
So I get this job, bud.

225
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.580
Brotzmann he takes over the production part of king of the cage.

226
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.290
And he wants to use me as a commentator.

227
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.120
Cause we went to the producer and went to John jock Machado academy.

228
00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:00.100
He knew me as the NNA fanatic guide. And he asked me if I wanted to commentate.

229
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.380
And I said, yeah. I'll try it. I didn't know. Those first king of the cages.

230
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.860
He didn't know that that was a difference between a play by planet color guy.

231
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:13.810
The producer didn't know the difference because once I started really listening

232
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:15.190
to the broadcast and the UFC,

233
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:18.430
I started listening to the opening and how they open. I go, oh,

234
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:23.290
there's two jobs here. This guy is, this guy is just a news Telecaster.

235
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.260
And this other guy's the expert didn't even really realize it.

236
00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:29.140
I thought they were both experts. I thought, I thought there were two.

237
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.770
<v 3>Bit for jobs, man. Yes, exactly. Once I.</v>

238
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:37.300
<v 2>Realized that I talked about, I said, Hey, listen, there's two jobs going on. I.</v>

239
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.990
<v 3>Don't want to be the play-by-play guy. I want to be the color guy. He said,</v>

240
00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:44.860
do both. You're going to do both. I go all sports.

241
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.580
<v 2>Don't have guys that do both. You have a color guy and you have a plate. Like.</v>

242
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.640
<v 3>You explain that to the producers. Just the, to the producer,</v>

243
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:55.720
the producer to the firm. That's never done. He'd never done sports before.

244
00:12:55.721 --> 00:12:56.740
So he didn't understand.

245
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.250
<v 2>He just said, dude, you're going to do both. Both of you, me and Don,</v>

246
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:01.540
the dragon Wilson. We were.

247
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.570
<v 3>Just in there winging it. It was so bad.</v>

248
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.970
What's terrible. And up to these days.

249
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.170
<v 2>I have no idea. I have no idea. But those,</v>

250
00:13:15.171 --> 00:13:18.700
those are some of the worst shows ever for commentary.

251
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.910
<v 3>First. Yeah. I own it so hard on it.</v>

252
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.010
And then you did some for pride too.

253
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.413
<v 0>People forget about that.</v>

254
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.540
<v 2>10, probably 10 with the Hanzo.</v>

255
00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:37.680
And Sakuraba when handle that Mexico got headbutted by Vandelay Silva.

256
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.280
<v 0>You were saying that Enzo, that soccer,</v>

257
00:13:41.281 --> 00:13:43.350
I would never go to submit Hensville yes. That was.

258
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.050
<v 3>One of the biggest blunders ever soccer.</v>

259
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.950
Robin has the Camorra grip in and they're standing. And I said,

260
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.180
I'm in the commentary. I said, that may.

261
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.320
<v 2>Work at his gym, but that turns out Gracie. It's never gonna work on him.</v>

262
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.580
<v 3>And then boom, he breaks his arm on cue.</v>

263
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.110
I call a fight, maybe working at the gym. Do you work here?

264
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:15.000
<v 1>There was a guy ed west ed wild west was fighting and he had never knocked</v>

265
00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:17.850
anybody out. Really good striker, but like, you know, put her pack in a striker.

266
00:14:17.851 --> 00:14:22.320
And I literally said, man, Ed's Lennon, crepe, but not a knockout guy.

267
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.480
And he instantly knocks him out. First.

268
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.700
<v 3>One of his career right there, right in front of him. I'm like.</v>

269
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.400
<v 1>He did that just to make me look stupid.</v>

270
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.600
<v 3>Thanks. That's what it happens. The job, man. Never.</v>

271
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.300
<v 0>It's almost like the universe is punishing you for hubris.</v>

272
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.580
Like you're pretending, you know, more than you do.

273
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.730
<v 3>Shut the up. Say it looks good. It's deep. Yeah.</v>

274
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:49.710
Seriously. That habit of going, who knows? Probably will. But it was,

275
00:14:49.711 --> 00:14:50.970
you know, no, there was.

276
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.100
<v 2>One fight. Fernando Vasconcellos fought this one guy and he schooled him. Yeah.</v>

277
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:55.970
Oh dude. I.

278
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.830
<v 3>Forgot about [inaudible].</v>

279
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.830
<v 0>One of the great guys that you just never really did.</v>

280
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:07.390
<v 1>It. Freezing and communicates. Remember that. He was good. Carl him up.</v>

281
00:15:07.391 --> 00:15:08.224
Didn't he?

282
00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.790
<v 3>Yeah. And.</v>

283
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.660
<v 2>And he in a fight that he won because he won, I think two straight. He was,</v>

284
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.980
he w he had good hands and, uh, he wrestled and, um,

285
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.810
uh, he had a guy, he passed a guy's guard and had him in north south.

286
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.920
And I said, this position is called. Some people call it north, south.

287
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.850
But if you look in an old judo books, it's actually called the teabag.

288
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.480
And then I just kept going. And Don the dragon, I never stopped.

289
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:36.700
And.

290
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.130
<v 3>I would just throw those. That's all we're talking about.</v>

291
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.450
Just having fun just to do it. We didn't take it seriously. Oh, I was.

292
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:48.130
And bud loved it. The Terry Terry triple,

293
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.850
the owner hated it. He hated it, but loved it.

294
00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:53.740
The producer loved it every.

295
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.990
<v 2>Now and then I would say some crazy wild,</v>

296
00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:00.640
but Terry hated and the director. No, no, no. Terry loved it. What am I saying?

297
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:05.770
The director, Steve, he hated it. He was begging me to stop.

298
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.480
The directors.

299
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.520
<v 3>Tend to be that wasn't being professional, but nobody,</v>

300
00:16:10.521 --> 00:16:13.480
but the owner didn't care. He loved it. So.

301
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.880
<v 2>Um, anyways, I sucked regardless, but</v>

302
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.010
I'm a retard. We're all in.

303
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.010
<v 3>The right spot where we want to be. I'm not born.</v>

304
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.940
<v 2>To commentate. That's not my thing. I look like now when people offer me jobs,</v>

305
00:16:27.941 --> 00:16:30.850
like I'm like, I don't want to commentate. I want to just enjoy the fun.

306
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.650
Just literally.

307
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.140
<v 0>When I said to Dana, when he forced me into doing it,</v>

308
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.290
don't you remember when you and I used to get free tickets? I don't.

309
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.470
<v 3>Want to start doing, I want to watch it. I started lacks doing.</v>

310
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.700
<v 0>Commentary because I would get free tickets from the UFC. And this was like,</v>

311
00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:50.200
when the UFC first started going to Vegas and Eddie and I were like to the

312
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:50.800
UFC's.

313
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.050
<v 5>In Vegas, this is crazy. We got to go.</v>

314
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.950
<v 0>And Dana white somehow, or another found out that I was a fan.</v>

315
00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.500
So he started sending me. He's like, Hey, we'll fly you out.

316
00:16:59.501 --> 00:17:00.580
We'll give you free tickets, my.

317
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.260
And so we started going and hanging out with him and I started doing commentary

318
00:17:05.261 --> 00:17:08.290
because when we'd hang out, I'd be like, have you ever seen saccharine?

319
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.630
You do watch pride. What do you watch overseas? Like,

320
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.420
if you've seen any of the shooto fights, I'm like, you gotta see this guy.

321
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.820
And I started telling him about this guy and that guy. And he.

322
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.640
<v 1>Knows my favorite man. Yeah. All soccer. I.</v>

323
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.280
<v 0>Love amazing, amazing fights.</v>

324
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.370
So I started talking to him about all these crazy fights and he had never heard

325
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:28.030
of, and he's like, do you want to do commentary on the next thing?

326
00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.850
And I was like, oh, I don't want it to, I don't want to work.

327
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.320
<v 1>And then boom, I did 18 shows for free.</v>

328
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.410
<v 2>I was sitting alone for a type of shows.</v>

329
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.440
<v 3>All by myself, VIP front row.</v>

330
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.340
I didn't come here to be by myself.

331
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.640
We saw some classic.

332
00:17:59.740 --> 00:17:59.740
<v 6>[Inaudible].</v>
