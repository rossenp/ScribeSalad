00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.860
Or the aliens land I've been thinking of new Orleans are coming. Yeah. You know.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.480
<v 1>I was talking to a buddy of mine the other day, another billionaire.</v>

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.040
I've got a few billionaire buddies and I really,

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.110
I think I'm sucking up dump for a reason.

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.420
<v 0>They'll tell you in advance, what's about to happen.</v>

7
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.680
<v 1>Well, uh, and, uh, w w well, this one,</v>

8
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.660
this guy, particular guy is, uh, uh, really, really, really smart.

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.550
And, uh, he has no doubt in his mind whatsoever that,

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.860
uh, aliens are, uh, dancing among us. And.

11
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.430
<v 0>Uh, pass me the little baby cigars, Ron white. I love those things.</v>

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.660
<v 1>They're the dark one other different colors. Well, there's this one. Oh,</v>

13
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:51.260
that's not a cigar. I know what the that is. That's us CDB.

14
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.930
We were talking about earlier.

15
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.940
<v 0>Well, that light. Hmm. Thank you, sir. Yeah, I'm convinced.</v>

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.430
Okay. I'm a hundred percent convinced.

17
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.340
I used to be a 60% and you were up to a hundred. Yeah.

18
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.560
I talked to commander Fravor, David.

19
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.780
<v 1>Yeah. At one time in my lab, I could do a 75 pushups and I'm down to three.</v>

20
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.970
<v 0>All right. Get back up to 75.</v>

21
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.930
<v 1>I'll show you how all right. You got nothing else to do.</v>

22
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.230
<v 0>I've talked to people that have seen them.</v>

23
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.140
I talked to this one guy who was a pilot in the,

24
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.060
is he the air force and Navy Navy pilot. I believe commander favors in the Navy.

25
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.520
And, um, he encountered this thing that they call the tic TAC UFO. This is a,

26
00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:48.200
an object that they tracked on radar that went from 60,000 feet to one

27
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:52.610
foot above sea level in less than a second. They don't know how fast it did it.

28
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.320
Cause it was literally a blip in the radar.

29
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:58.490
It went from 60,000 feet down to one feet. They have no idea how fast it moved.

30
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.940
They have no idea how it did it. It shows no signs of propulsion.

31
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.870
There's no heat, no exhaust signature. There's nothing that,

32
00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:10.640
that has an, any indication that it's acting in any way,

33
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.700
like in any propulsion system that we've ever observed before, right?

34
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.820
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. John was telling me to watch it, uh,</v>

35
00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:20.080
a show called closing.

36
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.200
<v 0>Jamie just nailed it. Whatever it was. You just found it. You just did it. Oh,</v>

37
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.790
it's backing. Yeah. There's a little, uh, folks, if you hear there's a little,

38
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.920
um, there's a little strange audio hum. That Jamie's trying to track down,

39
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.580
gets aliens. We'll get this worked out. Yeah. We'll get it worked out.

40
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.540
I don't think anybody's going to care. They might. I don't think so.

41
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.220
So you eat how many ways if I had to give you a percentage of whether or not

42
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:50.690
aliens are real, what's the percentage for you? Um.

43
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.150
<v 1>81.3.</v>

44
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.060
<v 0>Hmm. That's a good number. 81.3. That's likely.</v>

45
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.510
<v 1>Yeah. Likely. I mean, how could it not be, you know, how could it not be?</v>

46
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.430
Uh, uh, uh, I, you know, I really don't even,

47
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.830
it was kind of odd that he and I were talking about it,

48
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:12.910
but he has a really nice plane and he lives in Malibu in Austin.

49
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.450
And so every time he moves from one city to the other,

50
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.130
it happens to fit my schedule. Exactly. Right. So I'm like, that's weird.

51
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.960
I was going to Beverly Hills today. How about I hop on a plane, Ron,

52
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.190
I'm on it by myself. Come on. Let's go. And uh, nice. So, uh,

53
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.090
when he pops back down to Austin, he would just, just for a couple of days,

54
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.390
you know, I hop on and I, I really enjoy this guy's mind.

55
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.720
And I consider him a mentor in business and life,

56
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.760
John Paul DeJoria. And, uh, but he just started talking.

57
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.670
<v 0>About it, but good things about that guy. God, he's the best I hear.</v>

58
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:49.770
He's a fascinating dude.

59
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.950
<v 1>Yeah. You know, if he would do your podcast.</v>

60
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.590
<v 0>And I'm sure he'd do it. I think he would, I would love to have him on.</v>

61
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.990
<v 1>You know, he's a guy that started selling shampoo out of the trunk of his</v>

62
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:03.400
car, you know, and, uh,

63
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.530
and sold patroned I think last year for

64
00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:11.610
$5.1 billion and still owns

65
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.350
66, 60 other companies, including Paul Mitchell. Would you started here.

66
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.100
<v 0>At what point do you stop working when you, that governor.</v>

67
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.540
<v 1>Never, he never wants to stop. He never considered stopping.</v>

68
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.030
I was so shocked when he sold patrolman, uh,

69
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.370
because I just didn't think he ever would, you know,

70
00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:32.490
because he doesn't need to sell it. And uh,

71
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.760
but for whatever reason he did. And uh,

72
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.190
and in fact I said something that made him laugh really hard.

73
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.430
Cause he told me about it. He called me and told me he saw,

74
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.340
I sold it to Bacardi for 5.1 billion. And I said, well,

75
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:45.570
that sounds like a lot of money,

76
00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:49.320
but it sounds like more money when you realize the 0.1 is a hundred million

77
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:54.300
dollars. That's like the biggest 0.1 there is right.

78
00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:58.890
There is no 0.1 trillion during that doesn't even exist. It's a point,

79
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:02.190
1 billion is a hundred billion. But he said that, uh,

80
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.230
to watch him watch a show, which I never watched because I,

81
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.440
I think he got an advanced copy of it,

82
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:11.700
which was quite close encounters of the fifth kind is what it's called. And uh,

83
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.520
I looked it up and it was, and it was coming on something,

84
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.220
but it hadn't been on yet. So I think he just got an advanced copy of it.

85
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.670
And he said that it'll, it'll take every single doubt out of your mind.

86
00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:21.960
That's ever been there. Wait.

87
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.330
<v 0>A minute. Isn't that? The Steven Greer movie.</v>

88
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.810
<v 1>Now that's close encounters of the third kind. No, no, no.</v>

89
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:29.850
That's Steven Spielberg. Oh yeah. Okay. Steve was, yeah.

90
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.670
<v 0>Steven Greer was the guy we had on the podcast before. Oh,</v>

91
00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:34.710
that wrote the he's a, you know,

92
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.330
he's a UFO apologist air quotes. Okay.

93
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.360
Sideways face, right? Skeptical hippo face. Right.

94
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.453
<v 1>Blank Monaco. Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.180
<v 0>Um, there's a lot of fuckery in that UFO world.</v>

96
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.390
There's a lot of people that are making documentaries and a lot of people that

97
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:53.310
are, there's a real good one though,

98
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.920
about Bob Lasar called the Bob Lasar UFO's and area

99
00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:01.220
51. I think that's exactly the title of it, but it's by my friend,

100
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:03.380
Jeremy Corbell and uh,

101
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.530
it's about this guy was a physicist who worked at, uh,

102
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.390
area S four in the Nevada desert, um, back engineering,

103
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.940
this craft that the government had recovered.

104
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.910
And immediately upon working there, I realized like,

105
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.860
what in the is this like right away knew that this was no technology

106
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:24.560
that we had currently available. I mean, this guy was a fizzle.

107
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.260
He was a physicist, a nuclear physicist at Los Alamos labs,

108
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.700
worked on weapons systems. Right. And would know, and got there and was like,

109
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.730
what are you guys doing? Like, what is this?

110
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.200
And they were basically explaining like these are recovered UFO's.

111
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.240
And one of them, apparently, according to him,

112
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:45.260
was very old and that it was from some sort of an archeological dig that they

113
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:46.040
found.

114
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.900
And the propulsion system that these things used was that they use

115
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:55.040
this element called element one 15 that wasn't even

116
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.880
proven to actually exist until I think it was

117
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:03.830
2013. They, uh, proved that it exists in a particle Collider.

118
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.410
But this guy was talking about in 1989.

119
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:09.410
And he said that they had a stable supply.

120
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.850
<v 2>He keeps doing that. Oh, I'm sorry. It's all right. It's weird.</v>

121
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.380
Maybe that's the whole problem.

122
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.900
<v 0>That's UFO's the, um,</v>

123
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.520
but this documentary is fascinating because the propulsion system that he's

124
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:26.140
describing is exactly the same that commander Fravor

125
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.600
had described in the tick-tock UFO that they found off of. You just got it,

126
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.340
shut it. So it doesn't make noise. I just turned it off. The everybody needs.

127
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.080
They do. I need I'm irrelevant, dude. I'm not irrelevant. No, no, no, no,

128
00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:45.040
no stop saying that. Anyway, they, um,

129
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.360
the propulsion system that he described in 1989 is exactly the same propulsion

130
00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:53.560
system that they witnessed this Tik TOK UFO using in

131
00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:57.760
2007 or whatever it was that David Fravor had seen this thing off the coast of

132
00:07:57.761 --> 00:07:58.594
San Diego.

133
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.910
So what those people that saw these crafts

134
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.910
that were monitoring them in the military, they were saying, they see these,

135
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:10.300
like every few months they see these things and they don't know what the they

136
00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:12.730
are. They don't know what to do. They scrambled jets to go watch them.

137
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.090
They actively block their tracking systems.

138
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.930
And then they disappear faster than you can look at it. Just to just take off.

139
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.120
They have no idea what they are. They don't know where they're from.

140
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.983
They don't know what they're doing.

141
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.090
And then the Pentagon recently has come forth and release these statements.

142
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.440
And one of them being that they've recovered, crafts that are not of this world.

143
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.450
<v 1>6.6, I'm up to 86.6. I that letter.</v>

144
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.600
<v 0>My little cigarillo went out. Oh no,</v>

145
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:44.560
it dropped some dirty tobacco juice in this

146
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.580
thing. I'm going to scoop that bad boy out of there. I'm going to keep drinking.

147
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.440
Um, but I'm in dude, I'm on my like 95%. You're.

148
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.030
<v 1>Down from a hundred and I'm up to six. Yeah. That's I.</v>

149
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.800
<v 0>Listen to him. I on and I got good stop. Stop. You're about,</v>

150
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.830
I'm going to drink this with the ashes. I don't give a. Right.

151
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.060
<v 1>I gotta turn my phone back on because I got to show you.</v>

152
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:10.850
We gotta show me the pig. No, the pig, the pig, Whitney Cummings,

153
00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:14.120
pig, Whitney Cummings, bang. I mean, I'm not a,

154
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.740
there's no way you could possibly, there it is.

155
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.960
<v 2>Right there. Kapow.</v>

156
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.980
<v 1>There it is. Yeah. That's it. That's Whitney Cummings. Pigs.</v>

157
00:09:20.981 --> 00:09:21.890
So she was the first.

158
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.900
<v 0>Person who explained to me that those miniature pigs.</v>

159
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.010
<v 1>No, right? Yeah. That's proof right there. Right? How little is that?</v>

160
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.980
<v 0>Well, they think they're miniature pigs. Cause they starved them.</v>

161
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.050
So people buy this little tiny pig. They go, oh,

162
00:09:33.051 --> 00:09:35.450
this is a miniature as a teacup pig. And like, oh great.

163
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.460
<v 1>We wouldn't want that. You know, feed it. Right. And it grows to be Alex.</v>

164
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.890
Ramondo bought three of them and they, they, he did.

165
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:49.010
And he lived up in Palmdale and he eventually, they just got out.

166
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.780
And then every once in a while he'd see them.

167
00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:54.710
Now they have tusks and they weigh 450 pounds and you know, they're running.

168
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:59.930
So this place let's finish the story we

169
00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:00.080
were.

170
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.630
<v 0>On which story? Yeah.</v>

171
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.340
<v 1>Go back into them. The Bibles are documentaries and must-see, you should,</v>

172
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.670
you should.

173
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.270
<v 0>See it with no direct away. I love you. Do whatever you want. Um,</v>

174
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.580
but the Bible is our documentaries and must-see, if you're,

175
00:10:13.581 --> 00:10:16.670
if you're curious and on the fence about UFO's and I had that guy in here,

176
00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:17.300
I talked to him,

177
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.320
he gave one of the first interviews that he's given in a long time.

178
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.210
And I picked his brain for hours. I'll go back and listen to it. He,

179
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.510
he didn't seem like a artist to me. He there's, there's some weird parts of it,

180
00:10:29.511 --> 00:10:31.120
but there's always going to be weird parts.

181
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.890
When you talking about literally back engineering,

182
00:10:33.891 --> 00:10:38.600
something that someone from another planet invented and using some

183
00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:40.130
technology that we don't understand.

184
00:10:40.131 --> 00:10:43.580
And one of the analogies that he had was imagine if you brought a nuclear

185
00:10:43.581 --> 00:10:46.430
reactor to the 14 hundreds and introduced it to them,

186
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.040
which 14 hundreds is nothing 600 years ago, right?

187
00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:52.040
In terms of the age of the universe, it's a, not even a blink of an eye.

188
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.140
I think we can just go back to 18 hundreds.

189
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.630
<v 3>18 Hundreds, showman prized.</v>

190
00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:01.550
<v 1>About a nuclear envelope. Let's go to 1936, a nuclear reactor.</v>

191
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.410
<v 0>That was his, um, his, I get it. This technology is,</v>

192
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.640
it is technology.

193
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.110
It's clear that they figured out how to manipulate this element and use it to,

194
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.350
to bend gravity. And that that's the propulsion system.

195
00:11:15.351 --> 00:11:19.670
Instead of using something that pushes like a fire that pushes against,

196
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.091
you know,

197
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:24.020
the wind and pushes you in a certain direction or propeller that pulls you into

198
00:11:24.021 --> 00:11:25.940
a certain direction. Instead of that,

199
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.840
it bends gravity the way he described it as like, if you put a,

200
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.730
in a massively heavy bowling ball in the center of a bed, right.

201
00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:36.890
And it just sunk everything into the bed.

202
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.540
That's basically like a very crude description of what this

203
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:46.520
element does. And with their, this reactor that they have on these spaceships,

204
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.950
that it literally bends gravity around.

205
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.490
It allows you to just instantaneously jettison that,

206
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.400
that ship into a, another position. They say, stop Joe.

207
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.570
<v 1>I'm getting a bloodletting.</v>

208
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.850
They're draining my blood into a ball to cure something that I've think I've

209
00:12:02.851 --> 00:12:05.640
got. What'd you say again?

210
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.660
<v 0>Um, I think they've been here forever.</v>

211
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.410
I think they've been coming down here and observing us and waiting.

212
00:12:13.411 --> 00:12:15.540
And it also coincides with, uh,

213
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:20.160
there's a giant jump in sightings right after the Manhattan project. Right.

214
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.990
So right after we started blowing up bombs.

215
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.680
<v 3>They they're like, Hey, these folks, monkeys.</v>

216
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:27.960
Let's go visit them again. Then.

217
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.890
<v 0>They probably got, uh, you know, probably got a Newswire.</v>

218
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:37.350
They probably got a Google news alert on their phones, like, oh,

219
00:12:37.351 --> 00:12:40.890
Christ, look at these things. Look at these crazy monkeys. What have they.

220
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:44.730
<v 1>Done? What have they done? What have they done? Okay. 91. I'm up to 91.</v>

221
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.520
What are you down to 50%. We're we're uh.

222
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.590
<v 0>I'm, I'm worried about trying to pull you out of it.</v>

223
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.170
I'm always worried about things that I want to believe. If I want to believe it,

224
00:12:55.171 --> 00:12:56.730
I'm always skeptical. Right? We do.

225
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.220
Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.

226
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.370
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

227
00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:07.800
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

228
00:13:07.801 --> 00:13:11.490
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

229
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.510
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

230
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.480
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify.
