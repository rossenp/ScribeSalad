00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.050
<v 0>Let me ask you a question. Cause now this is I'm wondering,</v>

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.490
cause you're talking about sort of evolving to a place where your body and like

3
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:16.440
when you had James on and he was talking about by base,

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.570
do you have moral qualms about meat or do you not? Like you say, well, you know,

5
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:23.760
we're we're hunters and that like,

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.520
is that ever an issue for you or is it purely a health issue or is it both.

7
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.450
<v 1>Things? Um, there's a health issue. There is a moral qualm with factory farming.</v>

8
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:36.500
There's not a moral quorum qualm with help with hunting because I know the

9
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:40.430
reality of the life of a deer. If you don't kill that deer,

10
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.140
it's going to die a horrible death from a Wolf or a coyote or a mountain lion or

11
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:48.740
whatever the gets ahold of it. It's going to freeze to death. It's going,

12
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.560
you can either die quickly by the hand of a person.

13
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.150
You will respect that life in a room,

14
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:55.370
nurture your body and the bodies of your family.

15
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.790
Our problem is disconnection more than anything. And let me tell you something,

16
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:00.260
when the COVID lockdown happened,

17
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.160
I got more requests from friends and more requests for information about hunting

18
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.300
and gun ownership.

19
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
How do I protect myself and how do I feed myself and how do I grow food?

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.390
Those were three really big questions that I kept getting from people.

21
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.850
<v 0>It's funny. I have such a different perspective on it in terms of just the,</v>

22
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.420
um, the relationship between myself and I didn't. I was a big meat eater.

23
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.070
It's big like deli guy, the Stromae and corn beef and all that. My wife, uh,

24
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.350
got into rescue and these types of things.

25
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.300
And we ended up with a farm with pigs and goats and sheep and things like that.

26
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.980
And it became untenable for me

27
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.780
to make that decision. You know, that, that sort of, that decision of,

28
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.220
uh, I think you'll be better off if I kill you.

29
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.810
And it became,

30
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.570
it was something I could no longer manage once I knew the

31
00:01:56.571 --> 00:01:59.600
process of it and that it was a hard,

32
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.760
it's been a very hard process for me. It's only been about four or five years.

33
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.170
How was your health? Um, I mean, I'm an old Jew,

34
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.490
so baseline pretty much, uh,

35
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.050
we don't age well to begin with.

36
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.930
<v 1>How old are you now, John? We age.</v>

37
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.310
<v 0>A bit like avocados when you leave them out. Um, I'm 57.</v>

38
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.850
<v 1>I'm 52. So we're in similar boat.</v>

39
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.830
<v 0>Similar boat. Yeah, but I mean, it's, it's hard to know.</v>

40
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.230
I feel good. You know,

41
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:36.490
if you look at markers like cholesterol or blood pressure,

42
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.330
those things it's better. But like you said, I don't,

43
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.280
I don't know enough about how the body processes

44
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.690
to know if I'm, I feel better. The numbers say I'm better,

45
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.850
but you know, genetics, I'm sure it plays a part in it as well.

46
00:02:55.851 --> 00:03:00.250
But the funny thing is like, I don't think about it anymore.

47
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.540
Like it just don't even think about it anymore. Well, once you.

48
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.190
<v 1>Get into a, a custom and once your gut biome changes, you know,</v>

49
00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:11.520
you really get accustomed to whatever you're eating good or bad, unfortunately.

50
00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:13.440
And that's one of the reasons why people have such a hard time,

51
00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:16.320
quitting sugar and bread and pasta and things along those lines.

52
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.540
So your body just craves it. That's what it wants.

53
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.760
When you start eating healthier food, your body does crave.

54
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.440
<v 0>That can go off of meat and still be incredibly unhealthy. Like, you know,</v>

55
00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:29.100
you can be vegan and just exist on lays potato chips, right?

56
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.990
So it is, you know, and it,

57
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:35.700
and it's a tougher road and the world is certainly not, uh,

58
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.590
it's not built for that. And it's, it certainly feels a little bit,

59
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.270
uh, of a narrower lane that you have to do.

60
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:48.150
And I also think it's an incredibly emotional topic,

61
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.340
like very little that's as emotional and personal as what

62
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:55.710
people put in their bodies and how they eat and what they do.

63
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.430
And I'm always very respectful because I also, I got no leg to stand on, man.

64
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.110
I like, this is what I'm doing. It feels better for me, but I,

65
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.660
I always say like,

66
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.470
but it's such a personal,

67
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.370
an individual choice than you everybody's got to do for themselves.

68
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.960
The only thing I would say is like,

69
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.490
I do think it's important for people to get educated on it, to read up on,

70
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.050
like you say, factory farming or what might be the, you know,

71
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.100
nutritional costs of it, or what are some of the things that are in it?

72
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.330
Or what maybe is it going to do to our immunity? When, you know,

73
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.980
we use so many antibiotics in the meat production. I,

74
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.810
the that's the only thing I say is like,

75
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.520
try and educate yourself how your meal gets to your table.

76
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.290
That's why I'm a huge advocate for like local farming and agriculture,

77
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:52.020
because those are the people they're just growing their food and they're

78
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:55.470
bringing it to your table. I find that incredible. But,

79
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.360
but I also don't,

80
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.130
I try not to take a position of judgment on people because I feel like that's

81
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:03.510
unfair. I think.

82
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.800
<v 1>That's very wise of you.</v>

83
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.220
And I think that there's a lot of people that share your position on animal

84
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:08.970
death.

85
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.120
And I think that's one of the more promising aspects of laboratory created meat.

86
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:15.390
As long as it can be done in a way that's actually going to be healthy for us.

87
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.290
It seems like there's some real science behind that. And they're very,

88
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:21.660
very close to releasing that on large scale.

89
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:24.300
So it would be actual meat that doesn't come with death,

90
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.410
which is really fascinating.

91
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.790
<v 0>Oh yeah. Yeah. You're talking about like the, the, the, the one that they had,</v>

92
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:34.440
I saw like it's a tank and he pulls out it's like $20,000 for a chicken breast,

93
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.250
right? Oh, they did.

94
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.980
<v 1>That. Yeah. It was really expensive at one point in time,</v>

95
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:40.290
but they've gotten it down to a burger now.

96
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.620
Like they can actually make a burger out of this stuff. And, um,

97
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.010
they feel like as this, this technology improves,

98
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.970
they essentially flesh when it's not.

99
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.210
<v 0>Would you, if you could, if you could still have the, the,</v>

100
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.830
the part of me that you liked, but it came without death.

101
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.030
Do you think you would make that switch or is that something that well,

102
00:06:01.031 --> 00:06:01.450
I certainly.

103
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.220
<v 1>Would with domestic animals, the difference between that and hunting, there's a,</v>

104
00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:10.990
there's a conservation aspect of it. Um, one thing that leads to, uh,

105
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.770
protection of wildlife habitat is actually the money that comes from hunting

106
00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:18.160
tags and hunting equipment. Um, there's that,

107
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.750
there's also the,

108
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.990
the type of relationship you have with your food when you actually

109
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.060
work very hard and hunt it and kill it is very different than

110
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.740
buying food from a store.

111
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.280
And I would say similar in a similar way.

112
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.750
<v 0>Oh, food. When you go to whole foods, sometimes you really got to stop that,</v>

113
00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:43.990
you know, there's, there's a lot that goes into that, the trip to whole foods.

114
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.750
Yeah. It's hard to find a good parking spot.

115
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.300
<v 1>Yeah. I get it. Um,</v>

116
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.630
growing your own food in your backyard is very satisfying too.

117
00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:56.770
And I say to people like that's a micro cause I'm like,

118
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.820
it's a very micro form of what it feels like to hunt an animal and then eat it

119
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:03.240
and feed your family for, you know, if I shoot an elk, I,

120
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.960
I eat it literally for a year.

121
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.640
So one animal death equals like a year of my meals.

122
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.410
And, um, you know, there's also the moral high ground position.

123
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.130
You know,

124
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.840
I think a lot of people love to look at the moral high ground

125
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.790
of eating vegetables and only eating vegetables as being a superior way to

126
00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:27.160
live their life. And that's, that's a good decision.

127
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.540
I understand where you're coming from.

128
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.370
I understand that there's people that look at life very differently than me.

129
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.520
They maybe don't have this sort of fatalistic perspective,

130
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.870
even though it's respectful.

131
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.310
I have a very fatalistic perspective when it comes to just all organic

132
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.870
organisms competing for resources and for, for life,

133
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.690
these animals, I mean, I've run into them when they've killed each other.

134
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.690
I've seen animals that have been taken out by other animals.

135
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:57.280
I've come across their bodies, torn apart by wolves in the woods. It's a wild,

136
00:07:57.281 --> 00:07:58.720
wild thing out there, man.

137
00:07:58.721 --> 00:08:02.920
And I think we're so insulated by it in our culture of today,

138
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.070
that it's one of the reasons why veganism and all these things are becoming so

139
00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:08.890
attractive. I would hope that along with that,

140
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.380
we're going to be nicer to each other, that we're going to be,

141
00:08:11.381 --> 00:08:14.860
we're going to grow to be a kinder human race. I really, I really.

142
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.970
<v 0>Hope that. Yeah, because I think it's, it's about consideration, you know,</v>

143
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:19.990
for me, I think it was,

144
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.060
there was a certain part of consciousness that I never ascribed to

145
00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:27.640
animals to some extent. And it's funny because I always thought of myself as,

146
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.900
oh, I, you know, I love animals. I always had dogs and cats and you know,

147
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:34.090
you find a bird with a broken way and you stick them in a box.

148
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:36.280
And two weeks later he flies away and you're a hero,

149
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.510
but I never really ascribed like individuality to them.

150
00:08:40.511 --> 00:08:42.550
And I think that was the change for me,

151
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.650
was interacting in an

152
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.670
individual way with different on the font. You know,

153
00:08:51.671 --> 00:08:55.860
I always did tell him about her once, once we named them, that's fine. Yeah.

154
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.510
You watch them like they're playing though. They'll play. Are they? And it,

155
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.460
it just changed my relationship to what

156
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:09.060
I wanted it to be with animals. And it, it,

157
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.930
it just made it untenable in that moment for me.

158
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.060
But I truly understand like that, that is in, uh,

159
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:24.060
a really individualized, personalized experience that,

160
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.820
that, that I made. And like I said,

161
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.670
I would love it for people to make that connection,

162
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.350
because I think it's profound. There is,

163
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.980
there is something about that connection for people that when they do see it,

164
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:39.870
you know, it's funny, I'll talk about the pigs and I'll be like, what will,

165
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.350
you know, the, whatever they just eat everything. You're like, no,

166
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:47.970
they're really playful. They're smart. Don't do belly rubs. Yeah.

167
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.230
It's it's but that was shocking to me. I didn't know that I just thought, oh,

168
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:56.270
it's like a blob, but they're beings talking.

169
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.810
<v 1>About nature, John, and there's nothing natural about a farm.</v>

170
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.520
That's part of the problem. I mean, it's all,

171
00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:04.700
it's an animal prison and they're domesticated because we give them food and we

172
00:10:04.701 --> 00:10:09.530
kind of remove the, the natural fear that they would have of any, you know,

173
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.950
eyeball facing forward predator, which is what we are.

174
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.150
<v 0>Um, to precinct by to their health. Like what,</v>

175
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.300
having our farm with sheep and goats and pigs,

176
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.230
and they're all rescues is like having a nursing home.

177
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.540
Like you can't believe the fragility of factory farmed animals.

178
00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:34.460
Like they are to be sick, like pneumonia,

179
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:35.810
uh,

180
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.460
like genetically designed to gain too much weight for their legs.

181
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.690
It really is, you know, the island of misfit toys,

182
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.490
like they they've genetically modified or done whatever they've done. And,

183
00:10:48.491 --> 00:10:53.450
and the health of these animals that are in our food supply,

184
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.710
mainstay of our food supply is really suspect.

185
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.500
That's why the nursing home. Yeah.

186
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.340
<v 1>That's why I prefer hunting that when, if you're eating an animal,</v>

187
00:11:04.341 --> 00:11:07.780
that's a wild animal. You're eating an athlete. I mean, they're,

188
00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:11.960
they're sinewy and thick and they're strong and they've

189
00:11:11.961 --> 00:11:15.800
survived. And there's so much more nutrient dense when you're,

190
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:18.740
when you're talking about factory farmed animals, you're talking about, I mean,

191
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.270
w factory farmed animals,

192
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.620
just a worst version of what human beings are capable of that we're capable of

193
00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:27.410
ignoring, suffering to the point where we lock them on warehouses.

194
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.770
Their goes down in a tunnel and fills a small lake up.

195
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.070
And they flown over these places with drones. It's horrific, right?

196
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.350
The pig farms in particular, they're horrific.

197
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.610
But when you're talking about what you're doing on your farm, like,

198
00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:44.150
of course you can't eat those things, they're your pets. That would be, I mean,

199
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.850
you're naming them and feeding them and touching them.

200
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.070
<v 0>I extrapolate that now. So I, I think what happened was I went, oh,</v>

201
00:11:52.071 --> 00:11:55.090
right. That's in same way that like, I love my dog,

202
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.490
but if you have a dog,

203
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:03.160
I wouldn't kill your dog and eat because I look at dogs now in a different way.

204
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:08.110
So I think I extrapolate to the animal kingdom in

205
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:12.070
a way, a different, I haven't, I feel like because of my wife and she's been,

206
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.360
she's a much kinder, smarter version of me. So,

207
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.183
uh,

208
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.110
because of her kind of showing me that relationship and experiencing myself,

209
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:26.070
like, it's just changed the way that I view.
