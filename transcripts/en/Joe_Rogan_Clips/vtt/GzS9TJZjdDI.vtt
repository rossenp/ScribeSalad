1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.840
<v 0>And I, I, I, I get really,</v>

2
00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:06.280
really depressed and like in a dangerous way where I'm like, I gotta watch it.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.801
Like,

4
00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:10.720
I gotta be vigilant about meditating every day to keep my depression at bay,

5
00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:11.350
because, so.

6
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.040
<v 1>What do you think that is? Do you think that's a genetic thing?</v>

7
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.160
Do you think it runs in your family? I.

8
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.360
<v 0>Think it must run in my family.</v>

9
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.230
I think we have stuff that I haven't even like got and found out.

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.510
Like there's some SP suspicious deaths in my family that I'm like,

11
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.950
was that suicide?

12
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.973
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.470
<v 0>You know where I'm like, I think it's.</v>

14
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.550
<v 1>Describe how it feels. Like, what does your depression feel like?</v>

15
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.910
<v 0>It feels like I, it, honestly, I,</v>

16
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.110
I get suicidal thoughts,

17
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.780
not like I sh I should come myself. It's like kill yourself.

18
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.940
It would be fun to kill yourself. They come, it be fun, literally soothing.

19
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.740
It soothes me to think about killing myself when I'm in my worst, uh,

20
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.260
depressive stages. And it is,

21
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.700
I compare it to like sniffles when you're getting a cold, like, I have a little,

22
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.860
a little thought, I'll go, oh, shoot yourself in that. Whoa.

23
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.330
Like it literally comes into my head like a sniffle where you're like, oh God,

24
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.570
I'm getting sick again. Okay. I gotta meditate now. And then it'll,

25
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:12.930
and then I'll be fine. Like, literally it's like that. And what, what.

26
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.490
<v 1>Is what's before the shoot yourself? Nothing. Nothing.</v>

27
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.760
<v 0>And that's the that's the problem is like, it just is, you know, it can be,</v>

28
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.600
it can be, um, it, maybe it's circumstantial a little bit,

29
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.440
like maybe I'm feeling lonely that day or a, a,

30
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.000
I didn't get a thing that I wanted or I,

31
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.800
but I really do think it's like the weather like it.

32
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.240
I just can't even describe it.

33
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.240
I remember Sarah Silverman talking about her depression. Like,

34
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:42.440
it's like just a cloud comes over you and you're just like, oh, well,

35
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.550
up here it comes. And that's kind of how it feels.

36
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.270
And I totally have it under control when I'm meditating every day. It doesn't,

37
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.390
I don't get a single one of those thoughts really. But like, if I skip a day,

38
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.590
if I don't do TM one day, those thoughts keep they come in. And then if I,

39
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.910
and then you, if you get into a real bad spot, those thoughts start,

40
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.300
and I've never even so much has made an attempt or even planned to make an

41
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:10.140
attempt. Like it's never gotten to that, even close to that for me.

42
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.500
But I realize that these are the same kind of thoughts that people that end up

43
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:19.060
doing this start with, like, there's some kind of like, I,

44
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.261
I I'm,

45
00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:24.250
I'm people who love me and care about me get so upset with I talk about this.

46
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.410
But I think that more people struggle with these thoughts than talk about.

47
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.730
So I I'm eager to share it because I don't think I'm ever gonna kill myself.

48
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:32.930
And I don't think that that's,

49
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.970
but I think that like a lot of people I'm at risk and I don't think that people

50
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.690
talk about that enough, cuz I do have these thoughts and I go,

51
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.800
it's not even like, I go, what can I do to make myself feel better? Oh,

52
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:47.520
I could kill myself. It literally is like, kill yourself.

53
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.480
It's like a little voice or something.

54
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.520
And I've struggled with mental illness before. I mean,

55
00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:54.560
I had anorexia where it was like, don't eat and you're like, where's that?

56
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.400
Who's that. But it's, it's a voice. Did.

57
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.680
<v 1>You have don't eat because you thought you were overweight or don't eat because</v>

58
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.040
you thought you'd be more attractive if you looked like a group of a rail.

59
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.240
I mean, or is it it, was it vague? Was it direction vague or was it just like a,

60
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:11.074
an obsession?

61
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.240
<v 0>It, it was, it started out like, you know, um, high school. I should be skinny.</v>

62
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.990
Everyone should be skinny. I admire, I like wanted to be a famous someday.

63
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.390
And I looked at, I admire, like I idolized everyone in the magazines,

64
00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:27.430
the whole classic thing of like looking literally in magazines and being like,

65
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.510
I wanna look like that. I hate myself pinching my sides being like, uh,

66
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.310
if I'm not like that, then I'm worthless.

67
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.230
Having a mom who constantly hated her body was skinnier than me.

68
00:03:36.231 --> 00:03:39.540
And constantly said she was fat and things like that. Like where you just,

69
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.980
you have things modeled for you.

70
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.220
So I grew up thinking skinny equals more lovable.

71
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.060
And then I lost weight just B because, um,

72
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.380
my senior year I lost weight because a boy liked me that I liked who I liked

73
00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:53.420
back. And I was like, very nervous about it. Like, you know,

74
00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:55.700
when you just get nervous, right? So you, you can't, you don't eat that day.

75
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.620
And I had a date with this guy. It was my first date ever. And I just,

76
00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:00.770
that day I didn eat cuz I was just nervous.

77
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.370
And then the next day it showed up on me, cuz someone goes, you look great.

78
00:04:04.371 --> 00:04:07.610
What's going on? And I was like, oh, I just didn't eat yesterday.

79
00:04:07.611 --> 00:04:08.930
Like I can do that.

80
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.010
<v 1>Again. So it's basically the same thing as saying, you're really funny.</v>

81
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:15.170
You're you got a talent for that. &lt;laugh&gt; you're open to suggestion.

82
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.610
I'm really good. You join.

83
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.920
<v 0>A cult dude. I know &lt;laugh&gt; I I'm scared of it.</v>

84
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.960
I've the thing is I, I am open to suggestion, but the thing is I am good at,

85
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.000
at losing weight. I, I can,

86
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.680
I can stick to a diet and I can black and white things. I can say,

87
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.280
I'm not drinking for seven. I can, I can quit things. Right. I can quit eating.

88
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.400
Mm. And I have good will. It's like willpower. And I learned that like,

89
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.310
oh, for the first time, like I could do this. And so I just stopped eating.

90
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.310
And then the, for a while you get like super hot,

91
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.510
like I was very popular for a couple weeks. And then for a hot second,

92
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.390
I was hot for a second. And then I got so scary,

93
00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:57.430
skinny and then I couldn't stop. Oh wow. You, you were just like, I go, I, well,

94
00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:59.670
I don't, everyone's like, Hey, you looked great. Like a week ago.

95
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:02.380
Like right now it's like kind of, of concern. And I'm like, well,

96
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:05.380
I don't know what to do because if I eat, I'll just get fat again.

97
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.620
And so I just, I, this is all I know now. And then it becomes,

98
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.060
if you eat you're weak and then it becomes obsessive compulsive.

99
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.260
And then it's not even about being thin anymore because you look in the mirror

100
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:16.820
and I would look in the mirror and go like, you're disgusting.

101
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.810
Like I looked like, I, I look like Holocaust pictures. Like that's how bad I, I.

102
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.690
<v 1>Looked. Do you have photos of yourself from back then? Yeah.</v>

103
00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:26.170
Do you keep to make sure that you don't ever get back to that spot again?

104
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.930
<v 0>I won't ever get back to that spot again because I'm too vain to do that now.</v>

105
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.890
&lt;laugh&gt; and I know like when I see it coming, it's the same way of like pot.

106
00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:36.130
When I see it starting to interfere with my life, I go, okay,

107
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.970
you need to stop drinking. Right. Smoking pot.

108
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.010
And when I see myself get too skinny, now I'm like, okay, you need to.

109
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.880
<v 1>Stop working out. So you're like chaos, but you kind of have a handle on.</v>

110
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.760
<v 0>It. Oh, I totally have a handle on it. I,</v>

111
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.840
I won't ever be anorexic or die of depression.

112
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:51.840
Like all these things yourself to death or no, I won't like,

113
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.000
I'll go a different way.

114
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.160
But like those things aren't gonna get me cuz they almost got me before. I mean,

115
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.640
anorexia. I, I, I should have died. I was gonna die from it.

116
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.600
And I planned on dying from it. You planned on.

117
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600
<v 1>Dying from it? Yeah.</v>

118
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.440
<v 0>Because Joe, I was starving. It sucks to, to be starving.</v>

119
00:06:08.441 --> 00:06:10.520
But you planned on doing that? Yeah, because I wanted to die.

120
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.440
I was like some how old it was a slow suicide, uh, 18 Jesus,

121
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.710
18 90, 20, 21. How did you get? I was like, I,

122
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.910
I stopped weighing myself cuz it was so dangerous to get attached to a number.

123
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.150
But the last time I remember weighing myself, I was 98 pounds.

124
00:06:28.151 --> 00:06:31.550
That was when I was like admitted to a psych ward when I was 18. And,

125
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.350
and how tall are.

126
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.750
<v 1>You? I'm five. Nine. And what do you weigh now?</v>

127
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.100
<v 0>I'm 1 35 now. And I'm skinny now.</v>

128
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.500
<v 1>So yeah, you're not, you're not happy by any stretch of imagination.</v>

129
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.660
So you were 35 pounds lighter than this plus. Yeah.

130
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.980
<v 0>More that that's crazy. I was so thin.</v>

131
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.540
I was so like that's crazy everywhere. I went,

132
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:56.620
people would point and whisper and talk.

133
00:06:56.621 --> 00:06:58.290
It was one of those things where it was like, you know,

134
00:06:58.291 --> 00:07:00.130
you've seen girls out and about like that, there's a lady that.

135
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.730
<v 1>That used to go to my yoga class. That was terrifying. Yeah. She was so scary.</v>

136
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.130
She looked like, I mean, she was a small person too. She was only like five,

137
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:12.970
one or five, two. And she looked like she probably weighed 80 pounds. Yeah.

138
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.983
It was awful.

139
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.330
<v 0>It's and that's the way people. And I see girls like that now. And I,</v>

140
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.360
I do do the same thing that people used to say to me, which is like,

141
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:23.320
just eat a sandwich. Like what are you doing? Like you can't,

142
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.680
I know you can't say that,

143
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:28.800
but I don't even relate to the person I was when I wasn't eating because right.

144
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.920
I, the only way I can say is like, I could not eat. I could not do.

145
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:36.240
It was almost like if you were to like, if protein shake,

146
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.470
it was like drinking poison, like I'm gonna do I, if I drink this,

147
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:44.310
it was that hard to, to eat. How'd you get out of it? I, um, first of all,

148
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.950
I was admitted to a hospital because I was going away to school. Um,

149
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.750
I lost all this weight in like a couple months.

150
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.510
Like it went away quickly for me and it got scary fast.

151
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.230
The school called my parents. My parents were in denial.

152
00:07:56.231 --> 00:07:58.910
Cause they didn't wanna believe that their daughter was like dying. Oh great.

153
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.940
So they were, they were concerned and, but like I was lying to them about,

154
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.220
oh, I'm going out to eat. I'm not gonna be here for dinner tonight. Just lying,

155
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:08.054
lying, lying.

156
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.620
I went to the doctor to get a physical cuz I was going way to school in this

157
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.300
fall. This was July. I went to go get a physical and my pulse.

158
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.820
I have like a low pulse anyway. Like I, what is it? Brady.

159
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.770
Cardi it's I think it's 37 to 42 resting.

160
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.570
<v 1>What is you have an issue? What is it called? Brady. And.</v>

161
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.330
<v 0>It's called Brady cardio. It's just like a low resting pulse rate. I don't know.</v>

162
00:08:28.331 --> 00:08:32.370
You don't exercise? No, I exercise a lot, but even when I don't exercise a lot,

163
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.290
I still just have a.

164
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.730
<v 1>Low, do you do a lot of cardio?</v>

165
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.330
<v 0>I do a lot of cardio now. Yeah. But I that's.</v>

166
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.890
<v 1>A really like, this is like elite athlete, resting heart.</v>

167
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.840
<v 0>It's like Lance Armstrong. I'm really proud of it,</v>

168
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.760
but I do nothing to support it. Like I, I run every day,

169
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.560
but not like enough to boast that,

170
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.520
but it saved my life because I didn't know I had a low pulse rate,

171
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.000
but when I went in for this thing, the, this physical, you know,

172
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.760
the doctor clearly could see I was anorexic because they looked at me and

173
00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:00.520
weighed me, but they didn't have a,

174
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.880
any kind of like S data to keep me mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

175
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.400
But until they took my pulse and they were like, if you leave,

176
00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:10.920
you're gonna die and you're gonna be a liability to us. Cause we know,

177
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.000
so you can't leave.

178
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.630
You're gonna you a 51 50 or whatever where you're committed to a psych ward.

179
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.630
Oh wow. So I went in for a checkup, was taken on a golf court to the,

180
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.530
a golf cart,

181
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.070
to the other side of the hospital where I was checked into a psych ward.

182
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.710
Whoa. And my mom's like, no, she's not. And they're like, yes she is.

183
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.510
And so I was admitted there and I, I had to stay there for a,

184
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.300
a couple weeks think,

185
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.620
and then I lied to get out of it cuz I ate just enough to get out.

186
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.660
And then I went to school, I convinced my parents. I,

187
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.060
I was okay to go away to school, which I wasn't nearly died.

188
00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:48.580
There just starving myself and exercising too much. And that, but that, that,

189
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.300
that is how I got out of it was that.

190
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.460
So I wanted to die because I was hungry all the time.

191
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:56.930
Being hungry sucks and couldn't eat. I didn't know how to eat.

192
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.370
I didn't even know how to begin to eat.

193
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.610
So I was like every night I would just pray that I wouldn't wake up because I

194
00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:05.050
would go to bed freezing cold because you have no fat. So you're cold.

195
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.170
You have to wake up. I was going to school in Colorado.

196
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.090
I was ill prepared for the weather. And also I had no fat on my buddy. It was,

197
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:15.050
it was an awful existence. And then I did stand up comedy for the first time.

198
00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:19.200
Because as the anorexic. Yeah, because when I went to school my freshman year,

199
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.080
I was so crazy looking like &lt;laugh&gt; I was, I was like a,

200
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.520
I was like the nightmare before Christmas. Jack's jackskeleton said this. Yeah.

201
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:31.320
That is what it looks like. I was, I look at pictures. I'm like,

202
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:32.160
how did you have friends?

203
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.710
But I did because I became really funny because I wanted

204
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:40.630
people to go look over here. Don't look at me. So I just, right.

205
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.190
I was a shy kid in high school when I was not anorexic.

206
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:46.670
But then when I needed to make friends, cause I was went to school alone,

207
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.590
I was like, oh, I'll just develop this really over the top personality.

208
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.990
So people don't notice that I'm so thin. So that's when I became funny,

209
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.070
really funny, you know, I was always like, dormantly funny.

210
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.700
But that's when it became like outwardly funny people started telling me, oh,

211
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.660
it should be a comedian. My freshman year I tried it. I did it one time.

212
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.620
And then I was like, oh, I have a reason to live now. Like I have a purpose.

213
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.740
And I, that sounds so stupid. Like cliche to say like, oh, gave me comedy,

214
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:11.620
gave me a reason to live,

215
00:11:11.621 --> 00:11:14.420
but it really did because I didn't know what that I was like, if I'm gonna,

216
00:11:14.421 --> 00:11:17.140
what am I gonna become a teacher? I don't care. I'm not passionate about that.

217
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.450
But then I was like, okay. So then I was like, I got, I,

218
00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.330
I have to gain some weight if I'm gonna now have a career. So then I started,

219
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.810
I found a therapist. I was like, I gotta beat this. I started reading books.

220
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.610
I found a therapist and I found this one therapist who told me the thing that

221
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:35.730
really broke through, which was like, when you have anorexia,

222
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.010
everyone's like just eat something. Why aren't you eat something? And you,

223
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.640
you feel very in control of it.

224
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.000
And you feel like you're the one to blame for it because you're the one that's

225
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.120
choosing not to eat. And you're the one that's choosing to exercise. And,

226
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.520
and um, and so I felt all this shame about like,

227
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.000
why can't I cure myself? Why am I giving myself this thing?

228
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.600
That's ruining my life. And then this therapist was like,

229
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:58.240
think of it as like cancer. Like you got, you got sick,

230
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.680
like something invaded your life.

231
00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.240
And there is a demon inside you telling you don't eat and it's not you,

232
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.560
it's not you. So don't listen to that voice.

233
00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.960
And then as soon as I was able to like disassociate my illness

234
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.110
from like, it's my choice, it's my doing. I'm not eating.

235
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.310
And I was like able to see it as like the Exorcist,

236
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.550
like that little girl has like a demon insider. That's like, don't eat.

237
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.470
Don't eat. If you eat your week. As soon as I was able to go shut up voice,

238
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.030
then I was able to eat again.

239
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.790
It was like one nugget of one way of perceiving

240
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.060
my illness. The at was able for me to like crack it.

241
00:12:35.061 --> 00:12:39.020
And then it took many years to like, and I'm, I still struggle with, you know,

242
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.900
control issues over food, but I'll never be Inex again.
