00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.360
This mushroom has figuring to be very prominently important for

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.040
saving, uh, bees.

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.680
And that's where our research has been astonishingly, um,

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.280
interesting lately. And where is that thing that you had brought in?

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.550
What is that? This is on there. This is, is, um, I, so,

7
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.670
so to get some context to this, you know,

8
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.670
I think shainistically mushrooms, plants,

9
00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:32.310
animals become important because of a plurality of multiplicity of benefits.

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.430
This is one example, not only revolutionized warfare,

11
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.590
not only allow for the portability of fire for us to save ourselves in the

12
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.260
coldness. And, you know, we migrated into Europe from Africa. Um,

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.580
not only do beekeepers use it for smoking,

14
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.420
but fly fisherman use it also our drying flies,

15
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.860
but we have found that this mushroom is extremely powerful for reducing viruses,

16
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.700
that harm bees. And, and we are,

17
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.940
it's been described today in CNN, a be, uh, a insect apocalypse,

18
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.490
40% of, of be of insects or under threat. Um,

19
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.090
this just came out and this is a really an all hands on deck moment.

20
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.330
Um, but I'm optimistic cuz I think we can find solutions in nature. So, um,

21
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.810
with my colleagues and when I was here before I talked to my work with the bio

22
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.970
shield bioen program and these wood cons are very strong and antiviral

23
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.760
properties against, uh, flu viruses and herpes, et cetera.

24
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.520
I used these ideas and actually I had a waking dream &lt;laugh&gt;

25
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.280
and I realized that the bees were being infected by mites, uh,

26
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.640
with viruses and the deformed wing virus in particular as the worst virus.

27
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.030
And so I contacted Washington state university.

28
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.270
We started doing some research and I'm really,

29
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:49.790
really happy because I love skeptics who become my supporters.

30
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.270
We published in nature, only 7% of the articles submitted the nature,

31
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.010
get published.

32
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.030
The nature publication ecosystem to this day are articles in the top.

33
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.020
1% of all articles ever published and then nature your publication ecosystem.

34
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.500
Now that's phenomenal because that's the most credible scientific, uh,

35
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:08.334
journal in the world.

36
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.300
There it is right that extracts of polypo mushroom mycelia reduced viruses and

37
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.020
honeybees and the, this mushroom,

38
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.340
the Amadou reduces the deformed wing virus 800 times to one with one

39
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:27.130
treatment and sh and then the rayhi mushroom myceium

40
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.450
reduces the lake Sinai virus more than 45,000 to one.

41
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.850
Now these are wood cons that grow in trees and we all grew up with a WITY theoo,

42
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.210
but no one made the connection before me,

43
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.450
apparently that bees are attracted to rotted wood because of immunological

44
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:48.320
benefit. So Amadou and Rahi mushrooms we found,

45
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.760
and we published in this article that high significance.

46
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.120
And I think the reason why this article is not top 1% of all nature articles,

47
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.040
is that I've been able to present the theory with proof.

48
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.080
Now that a natural product can have a broader bio shield of benefits than a pure

49
00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:08.120
pharmaceutical up to this time,

50
00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.920
there's been no agents to reduce viruses and bees.

51
00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:15.640
Now the defformed wing virus is being vectored by the viralmite came in

52
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.110
1984 and it injects viruses in the bees.

53
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.750
And so it's like a dirty syringe and these viruses debilitate the bees and

54
00:03:23.751 --> 00:03:27.190
shorten their, their ability to fly. Now, look at that poor Bumble bee. Oh wow.

55
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:28.950
That's crazy. I mean that I have,

56
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.630
that is so sad because that mummble bee can't fly.

57
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.150
Now bees can pollinate up to a thousand flowers a day and the average

58
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:40.140
flight time of like honey bees with used to be nine days,

59
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.980
a thousand flowers a day, every Allmond you eat was visited by a B.

60
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.420
So one B can pollinate a thousand flowers a day,

61
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.940
nine days was our pollinationination flight time.

62
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.620
Now it's been re shortened to four days. So we lost by 50%.

63
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.140
And the CNN article that we just showed, uh,

64
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.930
in China now they're hand pollinating flowers. Yeah. Know, with paint, brushes,

65
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.610
a paint of apples. Yeah. So apples, cherries, almond strawberries, because of,

66
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.050
of the lack of bees because the absence of bees. So it's really, it's,

67
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.770
it's all hands on deck. Um, this is, you know,

68
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.890
I'm really optimistic about the future because we have solutions in nature that

69
00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:22.600
we can now amplify and be able to deploy.

70
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.560
And so one of my inventions and I'm giving these away the 10,000 of

71
00:04:27.561 --> 00:04:28.394
these for free,

72
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.960
I've come up with a citizen scientist beef feeder that puts these extracts

73
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.800
into sugar water, and we have a, it sign up, uh, sheet up.

74
00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:43.990
It's all it's for free fungi.com/bees. Um,

75
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.830
and we're gonna give away the first 10,000 of these, um,

76
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.630
and this basically allows, uh, citizen scientists to help wild bees,

77
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.150
um, because wild BES are giving about 80% of the benefits.

78
00:04:56.151 --> 00:04:59.350
And if you scroll down, there's a really, we just got the CGI done.

79
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.980
If you go all the way down and then click on the click on that video.

80
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.460
And we just, um, so here's the bee feeder, and this is.

81
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.740
<v 1>Available on YouTube folks. It says be mushroomed, feeder, be mushroomed,</v>

82
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.300
all one word, uh, and then feeder.

83
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.380
<v 0>Yeah. And I'll watch, that's the bees visiting and they're taking the,</v>

84
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.900
the sugar, sugar water look how much they're sucking out of.

85
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.220
<v 1>It. The little greedy bastards.</v>

86
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.050
<v 0>Yeah. And I that's crazy how it goes away so quickly.</v>

87
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.290
And this is at maze and bees are better at navigating mazes.

88
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.290
And so you can see the bees going in and out.

89
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.450
My grandson who was afraid of bees was really fascinated by this. So I,

90
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.850
I got 'em to do this.

91
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.250
And so these are something that we are gonna make these available all over.

92
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.400
And then I I'm gonna create vertical gardens in, in apartment bill. Oh.

93
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.280
So could BES, when fly up 200 feet, you create ladders then ecological ladders.

94
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.320
And then this is why the citizen scientists all over the world can take action

95
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.200
to be able to help bees from collapsing. And then you station these, um,

96
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.160
in neighborhoods for Bumble bees for other types of bees.

97
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.400
And then we have it with a wifi enabled device with solar panels.

98
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.640
And then we upload into the cloud, all this data about be pollllination visits.

99
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.160
Wow. So we can create a metric on the baseline of be pollination services.

100
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:17.790
So if you see a bees that are declining in sudden below a baseline

101
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.990
in Oklahoma, two years ago,

102
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.270
84% of the beehives died.

103
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.430
Now think if you're a cattle rancher and you lost 84% of your cattle.

104
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.670
So the idea is to help bees immune system and the,

105
00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:36.670
if we create baselines with beef feeders upload the data,

106
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.460
and this becomes a new form of internet because they have wififiability.

107
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.300
So it's a distributed network as well, but they, where is the wifi on that?

108
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.500
Well, we don't have, this is in development right now.

109
00:06:46.501 --> 00:06:48.740
We're working with a very, very large computer company.

110
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.860
Who's making all the instrumentation and they're into big data.

111
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.180
So we have a solar panel going in here. We have, uh, blue, uh,

112
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.410
L E D lights that bees are at attracted to blue light.

113
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.050
And they'll count the number of bees going in and out instead of bees are only

114
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:06.770
flying that daytime. We don't need a battery. And so the solar, uh,

115
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.690
power will then upload the data into the cloud. They'll create mega data sets.

116
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.770
And then we can look at Africa, Indonesia,

117
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.360
how is it gonna upload into the cloud? Was it using, is it used the LT LTE? Oh,

118
00:07:18.361 --> 00:07:21.880
so it's using like a cellular system, a cellular system or low frequency,

119
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:26.440
long range, um, communication systems. Can we, can we help? Can we contribute?

120
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.440
Is there's a way that this podcast can help a lot. It, this,

121
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.200
I want to enable people with solutions that they can teach their children the

122
00:07:34.201 --> 00:07:36.360
importance of natural systems and they can take action.

123
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.750
This seems like a great one. I mean, I love this. I idea I it's awesome.

124
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.150
I can afford to give away 10,000. Um,

125
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.310
I talked to this computer company that everybody knows,

126
00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:48.190
but they asked me not to use their name and they asked, how many do we need?

127
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.790
I said about 10 billion, billion, billion,

128
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.990
and because this, but I will do up to my capacity.

129
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.820
And then I'm hoping that, you know, we're gonna give these away for free.

130
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.740
And then eventually we'll create networks of hubs where I have now

131
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:11.220
40 patents on this. Um, and helping bees survive from these extracts,

132
00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:15.220
but not in Indonesia, not in India, not in Africa, not in China, not in Japan.

133
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:18.740
I've open source of, for most of the world. Mm I'm basically commercial.

134
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.770
I'm gonna commercial. Is it so the haveves can help the have nots? Mm and I,

135
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.250
I think a lot of people want to help. And if you,

136
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.090
and we're thinking about different ways of doing this, I'm open to all ideas.

137
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.930
But the idea is to get maybe one person to sponsor 10 other people.

138
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.090
They have a distributed network, their own social media community,

139
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.360
where they end up, we getting, um, so schools,

140
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.080
we will open source the code for 3d printers. Uh,

141
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.400
so that's really important for schools. So the code's gonna be open sourced. Um,

142
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.080
but it, then if somebody wanna make millions of these and sell them, of course,

143
00:08:52.081 --> 00:08:54.160
you know, I wouldn't be happy with that. They have to work with me,

144
00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:58.600
but individually we can empower individuals with and schools to have the open

145
00:08:58.601 --> 00:09:00.240
source, the 3d printing codes.

146
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.440
<v 1>We just have to make it trendy to have one of these in your house. Like, look,</v>

147
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.840
I'm helping. I'm, I'm helping the bees. Hey, if we just did that,

148
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.280
it would really make a big difference. I know that's a,

149
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.000
a gross way to look at it, but, but.

150
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.030
<v 0>My grand that works. My grandson, Kai is a example.</v>

151
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.710
He Wass shuttering in fear being coming near to this. And I just, my friend,

152
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.190
Dr. Steve shepherd, entomologist taught me something about bees. I didn't know,

153
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.790
bees are moving so fast and we look like we're moving slow,

154
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:33.110
but if we move really slow, the bees think you're a statue. Uh,

155
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.740
and so the idea, and so my grandson, and, um, Akay said,

156
00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:38.140
look at this and you could see underneath,

157
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.420
you can see the bees going in and out. I said to move really slow.

158
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.300
And then he got fascinated watching the bees. So he overcame his fear of bees.

159
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.540
He was excited that he's helping bees survive.

160
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.740
Now we've created something intergenerationally and saving.

161
00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:53.060
The bees is the number one,

162
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.890
one bridge concept between conservatives and liberals.

163
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.290
Everyone wants to save the bees. That's number one,

164
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.890
it's a number one bridge issue. Wow. Between amendding the fence.

165
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.050
So to speak across the political and social divide,

166
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.010
everybody wants to save the bees mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So this is something,

167
00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:13.050
this is an actionable solution. And the, the, you know,

168
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.890
the scientific data out there is pretty disturbing, you know,

169
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.080
75% of flying insects in the past 27 years.

170
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.480
And a report from Germany that just came out, have disappeared. Now, many,

171
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.800
many of your listeners are out in the country. You know,

172
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.880
I grew up in the country.

173
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.480
I remember all the bug splatter used to have against your windshield.

174
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:33.200
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you don't see that anymore because the,

175
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.990
the insects are dying because the exposure to pesticides

176
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.790
monoculture, and when you have monoculture,

177
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.270
you have what's called pollination deserts. When you have lots of biodiversity,

178
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.110
lots of plants and, and diversity,

179
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.550
the plants are pollinating at different times of the season.

180
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.910
When you do to a monoculture, all the plants like almonds, yeah.

181
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:58.700
Are all produce flowers all at once. And then it there's no pollen available.

182
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.900
So the immune system of the bees due to factory farming,

183
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.420
loss of habitat, deforestation, glyhosphase, you know,

184
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.580
heavy metals pollution, all those things are co-factors.

185
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.620
But the nail in the coffin is by far these viruses.

186
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.690
And so even logically empowering and supporting the immune system ease then

187
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.130
gives the bees the opportunity or the ability to be able to survive longer,

188
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.650
do more pollination. Is there a specific source.

189
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.370
<v 1>Of these viruses that they can isolate? Or is it, are these a.</v>

190
00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.690
<v 0>New thing? Well, actually there's a, um,</v>

191
00:11:29.691 --> 00:11:33.650
there's a slide that just shows the pandemic spread of these viruses, uh,

192
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:38.010
throughout the world that came from Asia. Uh, and it's now a global pandemic.

193
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.840
Uh, all bees in the world are,

194
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:43.200
are infected with these viruses because when they infected honeybee,

195
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:44.480
for instance, visits the flower,

196
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.760
it leaves viral particles in the flower and the flower,

197
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.440
and then a wild bumblebee becomes it, visits it, it becomes infected. Mm.

198
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:57.000
So there is a UN unfortunate. I don't wanna use the word perfect storm.

199
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.880
It's a terrible storm of co-factors. And because, you know,

200
00:12:01.881 --> 00:12:06.000
80% of the benefit that farmers receive is from wild bees. Right.

201
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.680
But we can't count them. And, you know, I have, I have, uh, beehives and,

202
00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.670
and what happens to, to collapse. You go out on Monday, the bees are happy.

203
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.550
You go out on Thursday, they're all gone. I mean, it's, it's really,

204
00:12:17.551 --> 00:12:18.750
it's that quick, that quick.

205
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.670
And it's not like there's hundreds of dead bees around your beehive.

206
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:25.910
They're just gone. And there can be hundreds of pounds of honey and the bees,

207
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.310
you know, they they're gone. So.

208
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.270
<v 1>They go off somewhere to the.</v>

209
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.020
<v 0>Die.</v>

210
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.940
What happens is because the newly hatch be are called nurse bees and the

211
00:12:34.941 --> 00:12:38.900
nurse bees take care of the baby be, but when the colony senses,

212
00:12:38.901 --> 00:12:42.780
there's not enough pollen in food to support the BR and the colony,

213
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.220
the nurse bees are prematurely recruited to go out and find pollen.

214
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.980
So they abandon the babies and then the veroamites are UN,

215
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.730
they justs UN uncontrolled, and they start injecting viruses.

216
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.490
And so there are, are there,

217
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.570
co-factors just like when you get an infection from a viral infection,

218
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.170
you can get bacterial infections. And so there's a,

219
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.370
there's a cascade of opportunistic infections as they immun immunology

220
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.250
decreased because these viruses, so wasn't there.

221
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.280
<v 1>Um, a C contributing factor that had to do with cell phones as well.</v>

222
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.560
<v 0>I actually, I'm really glad you brought that up. Um,</v>

223
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.280
this is a contributing factor.

224
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.520
I have not seen convincing evidence as a hypothesis.

225
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.200
That's not fully flushed out. Um,

226
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.080
there are some people quite adamant in their belief in this, but I'm,

227
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.910
I'm driven by science and data. I can, uh, the,

228
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.110
the rhythms, the frequency of the high, uh,

229
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.830
of cell phones is an argument that's made.

230
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.990
It is not in the same co-sign wave of the wavelengths that we

231
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:49.990
experience in nature. And so this is disruptive.

232
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.230
I understand that I'm still on the fence.

233
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.060
I like to see really strong data and scientific evidence of that. Um,

234
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.740
but it's a hypothesis that needs to be tested. That's why we're looking also at,

235
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.580
at a low frequency, long range communication systems. Mm.

236
00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:11.860
<v 1>Um, I, you know, I think I told you this story, if I didn't, I apologize. Uh,</v>

237
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.140
when we were on fear factor, we had a beast done.

238
00:14:14.141 --> 00:14:16.850
We had to cover these people in bees and, uh,

239
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.730
a local bee colony flew in to check out what was going on.

240
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.490
And those bees and the bees that were brought there,

241
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.290
met in the sky and worked it out. And the beekeeper told us, okay,

242
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:31.650
we have to shut down and everybody's gotta back outta here.

243
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.170
So we had to shut down everything and back out for like about an hour,

244
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.520
at least a half hour, why these bees communicated with each other.

245
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.640
So they're flying a giant swarm of them flying in the eye, in the, in the air,

246
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.200
trying to figure out why, Hey, what are you guys here for? What are you doing?

247
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.480
Why are you in our neighborhood? Like, oh, we're not moving in.

248
00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:52.120
We're just filming a TV show. Like they had to work it out. That is so unusual.

249
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.600
<v 0>It was really weird. That's extraordinary, you know? Yeah. So when a new queen,</v>

250
00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.240
uh, splits from a hive, you know, uh, colony,

251
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:01.120
they then take a big group of them with 'em.

252
00:15:01.121 --> 00:15:03.120
So it's all about protecting the queen.

253
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.360
<v 1>I just don't understand how they worked it out. There was no fight to the death.</v>

254
00:15:06.361 --> 00:15:08.560
There was no nothing. They just sort of worked it out.

255
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.950
And the other bees took off and the, that were there, came back to their high,

256
00:15:11.951 --> 00:15:13.950
their little colony.

257
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.070
<v 0>Yeah. That's, there's a lot of this. This is also well that's,</v>

258
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.110
I'm glad you mentioned that because there's also speaks to what's called be

259
00:15:20.111 --> 00:15:24.030
drift. And so when we publish our article in nature, scientific reports,

260
00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:28.310
actually I think the data is understated because 10 to,

261
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:32.220
up to 20% of bees will drift from one colony to another.

262
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.180
So we had treatment colonies and we had treated colonies. Well,

263
00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.900
because 10 to 20% of the bees in the treated colonies went to the control

264
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:42.853
colonies.

265
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.780
We actually had diluted the differential because we had crossed, um,

266
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.290
you know, movement of control bees and beehive versus treated bees.

267
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.210
And so when we actually, I think another,

268
00:15:55.211 --> 00:15:57.970
some of my other co-authors thinks we actually have understated the data,

269
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.050
but when you look at the P values of significance, um, you know,

270
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.610
the extraordinary P is less than 0.0, zero nine.

271
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.290
And that for scientists is an extraordinarily significant data set that is

272
00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:14.480
clearly showing the evidence that these extracts help the immunity of bees and

273
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:19.160
help them be able to survive and, and do a better job. That's awesome.

274
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.760
<v 1>And it's crazy that it's just a, a natural mushroom, but it,</v>

275
00:16:21.761 --> 00:16:25.000
it makes sense what you're saying that they built their beehives in these

276
00:16:25.001 --> 00:16:29.680
rotting trees, knowing that these fun guy were there. I,

277
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.400
I somehow, or another being attracted to it.

278
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.453
<v 0>You know, the,</v>

279
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.750
I like to say the first five seconds that I got the first patent award,

280
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.430
my ego did swell. And then 10 seconds later, I said, are you,

281
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.150
freakinggging kidding. We're in Neanderthals of nuclear weapons.

282
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.590
How could I be the first one to have discovered that bees benefit from mycillium

283
00:16:46.591 --> 00:16:50.190
immunologically, but there's no what's called prior art. There's no evidence.

284
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.030
And I mean, think of that.

285
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.900
We have the intelligence of nature underneath our feet,

286
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.100
and this is something we need to tap into.

287
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.220
And the fact that we can show a natural product, you know,

288
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:03.820
if you had HPV HIV,

289
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.420
and you went into a doctor 12 days after having one treatment of these extracts

290
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.260
and your virus has dropped 45,000 to one, any physician would say,

291
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.570
wow, you're doing really well. And this is what we'll be able to see. Now, the,

292
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.690
now we've been trying to find what's called the mode of action.

293
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.330
How are these viruses actually being reduced?

294
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.610
Puntively our strongest hypothesis now is as providing essential

295
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:32.610
nutrients that are important for the immune system to activate gene sequences,

296
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:37.760
then are that a to active viruses and give a more hostfensive immunity

297
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.720
of protection of a further infection. Now, does.

298
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.760
<v 1>This, uh, work with humans as well?</v>

299
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.720
Like chaga is supposed to be good for your immune system, right? Well.

300
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.720
<v 0>This is, this is a great convergence.</v>

301
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.360
So traditional Chinese medicine and European medicine and medicine from

302
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:54.240
indigenous peoples all over the world haveve been using these mushrooms is that

303
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.240
now we're finding scientific evidence that folklorically the reputation of chaga

304
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.200
of raychi of these mushrooms, helping the immunity of humans.

305
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.760
This is translational medicine. So,

306
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.790
but bees is an animal clinicals study.

307
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.990
Bees have been stated as being besides Sophila, uh,

308
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.390
the second most well studidied animal in the world.

309
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:20.710
This is a animal clinical study past digestion past

310
00:18:20.711 --> 00:18:22.310
what's called the cytone P four 50 pathway,

311
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.830
which is your detoxification pathway. Mostly in our liver.

312
00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:29.260
All animals use the cytquine P four 50 pathway to break down toxins and is the

313
00:18:29.261 --> 00:18:34.060
microbiome the blood. So this is actually, this is an animal clinical study,

314
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.060
and I think it's a gateway for us to take this as credible evidence,

315
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:44.380
that natural products could be more useful and offer a broader bios shield of

316
00:18:44.381 --> 00:18:48.740
benefits than pure pharmaceuticals that go after one molecule with one target,

317
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.050
one set of S sectors.

318
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.290
They are immunological fields have developed in the complexity of nature.

319
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.850
This is what our foods are.

320
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.290
This is we we're inconstant biomolecularcation with the ecosystem.

321
00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.610
We we've evolved in this complex, uh, uh, molecular environment.

322
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.850
And so our immune systems are upregulated through multiple stimuli.

323
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.970
And that's why I think these extracts of their complexity, the,

324
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.280
they build upon the complexity of natural systems that help our immune system.

325
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.320
So you have hope.

326
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.440
<v 1>That this is something that we could eventually see being like a,</v>

327
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.120
a peer reviewed, proven thing for human beings.

328
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.400
<v 0>As well. Absolutely. I do believe that's on the near event horizon. Uh,</v>

329
00:19:25.401 --> 00:19:28.080
there's a lot of researchers now, close thing closer to you a little bit.

330
00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:32.470
There is, I, I believe it's on the near horizon is something that we're gonna,

331
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.110
uh, see more and more. There's lots of clinical studies. I,

332
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.390
I pop for physicians. It's not no branding, no sounding of anything.

333
00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:43.510
It's I populate a website called mushroom references.com. I,

334
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:46.070
I populate specifically for physic physicians.

335
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.350
I just spoke at singularity universities,

336
00:19:48.351 --> 00:19:50.470
stand for medical school in front of a thousand physicians.

337
00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:55.420
I try to make the bridge of the credibility of the science for physicians who

338
00:19:55.421 --> 00:19:59.060
are just not educated yet, cuz they don't have the resources all the time.

339
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.500
So mushroom references.com. You can go to that website,

340
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:07.660
it's got hundreds of references, um, that then you can put in any,

341
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.140
you know, symptom or species, et cetera.

342
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.210
And you'd be able to find the peer where your in references.

343
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:15.730
There's about 30 references for instance, on soulsibin right now,

344
00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.690
which is an area of, of research that I'm particularly focused on.
