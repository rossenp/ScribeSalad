00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.593
<v 1>Experience.</v>

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.680
You pull up the UFC card for this weekend so I can see who's on the card.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.680
So that's right. That's right. There's the, okay.

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.040
<v 2>So what everybody's gonna be trying to bet Cerone</v>

6
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.520
whatever, what's the line that Cerone right now.

7
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.030
So you could I get what this is? Plus two 60 for.

8
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.230
<v 0>Plus two 60 over, under one and a half rounds. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.150
<v 2>But if I go over one and a half, what do I make? I make a little more money.</v>

10
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.510
Don't.

11
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.110
<v 0>I, uh, the over the under would be the little bit plus the plus 1 0 5 for under,</v>

12
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.070
so I guess the money is on the over right now. It's minus 1 35.

13
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.140
<v 2>How can the money being over where people it's.</v>

14
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.020
<v 0>Slight. It's very slight though. Okay. Look.</v>

15
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.900
<v 1>So this Diego faara is, uh, the favorite over Anthony.</v>

16
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.620
Pettu that's an interesting fight right.

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.740
<v 2>There. So right there they know something we don't know. Mm that's.</v>

18
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.340
<v 1>Interesting. Diego's very good. It's a very good fighter, but Holly.</v>

19
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.220
<v 2>Home, Rachel Pennington. Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.053
<v 1>That' fight.</v>

21
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.730
<v 2>That's Holly. Holmess given, right? Excuse me. She's a favorite, Holly. Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.330
<v 1>Uh, yeah. Yeah. Rachel petington is tough, man. She's very tough.</v>

23
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:16.690
Penington is one of those chicks that like she's had some last second wins like

24
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.290
against, um, Ashley, Evan Smith,

25
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.680
one of the like wildest end dings in a, in a female fight.

26
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.200
She gets her in a bulldog,

27
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:29.240
choke and chokes her unconscious with blood spraying out of her forehead.

28
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.400
It was a wild finish, man. See if you could find that finish Ashley,

29
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.760
Evan Smith. Uh Raque. Pennnington finishes Ashley, Evan Smith. So.

30
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.240
<v 2>Right now, what does that look like?</v>

31
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:44.510
Donald Cerone against Conna what the money look like? I don't understand money.

32
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.390
<v 1>Lines. I don't know. I would, I would be just talking outta my. If.</v>

33
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.870
<v 0>You bet a hundred bucks on, uh, Cal to win and he wins the fight,</v>

34
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.070
you'd get two 60. So you'd collect 360.

35
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.910
<v 2>And if you bet a hundred on con you'd.</v>

36
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.870
<v 0>You'd have to bet 320 bucks to, to win a hundred on con all right.</v>

37
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.820
Minus three.

38
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.740
<v 2>20. The only way you can win this weekend is with con</v>

39
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.740
and you see con going in there, knocking him out in the first round in ne under.

40
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.913
But if con,

41
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.260
if fuckle wrestles him and it goes five rounds,

42
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.290
I don't see a lot of people bettinging con in the over Conna looks so good that

43
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.570
people are expecting Conna to go in there. This is, and knock him.

44
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.410
<v 1>Right out. This is Raque pennnington's fight. So just go to like,</v>

45
00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:37.150
towards where the end of it. It was a wild fight, man. And Ashley,

46
00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:41.590
Evan Smith is the woman who beat Fallon Fox, the transgender fighter.

47
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.420
She stopped her in her fight right before she, uh,

48
00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:49.860
came to the UFC besides it was just a wild fight, man.

49
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:53.980
These girls were going to war. And so at the very last,

50
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.820
I mean, I think it was like the last second of the fight.

51
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.680
She's locking her up in this bulldog choke.

52
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.640
And this is why look at blood is spraying out of her head. Oh,

53
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.320
they don't show the finish. That UFC is sneaky like that.

54
00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:09.600
They don't want you to see the tap or the knockout. Like I don't get it, guys.

55
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.640
I work for you. I love you. Show everybody the choke.

56
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.560
Why you hiding the choke anyway, maybe it's just a time constraint,

57
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:22.350
but she got her in this bulldog choke Bloodish squirting out of her head.

58
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.950
And then at the end of the, the buzzer, she lets go and the girl's out cold.

59
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.270
And it was just like, whoa. It was like one of those fight, those whoa,

60
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.310
like when it's happening, like holy, you know,

61
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:35.190
you see something that's just primal.

62
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.340
There's moments in fights that are just primal. You, you know?

63
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:40.780
And sometimes those moments are like,

64
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:45.180
they're almost CRE like when Francis and Ghana knocked down Astair Orine boom.

65
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.860
You're like Joe, just primal. Just what?

66
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.660
<v 2>Who cut his lip? Who up?</v>

67
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.740
<v 1>Oh, Rosens strike. Oh my gosh.</v>

68
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.980
Rosensrike's now gonna fight Francis jarino Rosens strike and Francis and Ghana.

69
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.890
Where Columbus, Ohio, Columbus, Ohio. God.

70
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.730
That's a crazy fight. Ugh.

71
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.290
I almost wish more people knew how tough rosetrike is. You,

72
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.450
you see the fight with Alstair over him and you go, well,

73
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.850
Alster was kind of out pointing him. And then he,

74
00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:20.600
he caught Alstair slipping really with like 10 seconds left to go in the fight

75
00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:23.400
and hit him with a bomb and broke his lip open. That's true.

76
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.600
But he still absorbed everything that Astair threw at him did never looked

77
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.560
like he got shook at all.

78
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.120
And we're talking about a guy and Astair whos knocked out junior.

79
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.240
Delanttos knocked out. You know, it was the K one. Grandpychampion.

80
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.080
<v 2>No tremendous.</v>

81
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.200
<v 1>Re Wade knocked out Todd Duffy and pride.</v>

82
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.270
<v 2>Knocked out our boy wasrising he need? Or your boy there.</v>

83
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.550
the great white hope. Uh, you know, what's his name? Mark Hunt.

84
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.390
No love. He's not the great white hope. He's a, a Australian.

85
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.510
<v 1>Killer. Oh, brocklesner rock. Rockleser. That's a perfect example of him.</v>

86
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.460
But me and my Rosen strike just walked through all of that.

87
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.340
And I'm not suggesting that the,

88
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.580
the aister of today he's had a long career that he's as,

89
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.340
as durable and as big as he was when he fought. Brockleser,

90
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:14.740
he's really two different guys at this point, but still rosensrike is a beast.

91
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.180
He's so strong, man. And he's got legit kickboxing skills. What is see,

92
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.020
he can fight this.

93
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.853
<v 2>Weekend G money.</v>

94
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.970
<v 1>This is what it seems to me.</v>

95
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.690
It seems to me that Conna McGregor has an

96
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:32.570
advantage in being able to close the distance and,

97
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.290
and maybe a speed advantage.

98
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.330
This is a perceived thing based on seeing them fight different people.

99
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.160
Cowboy when he is at his best is remarkably

100
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:47.560
well-rounded. And I think he's more well-rounded than Connor.

101
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.240
I think cowboy has a lot of tools that people forget about.

102
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:56.840
Particularly his take downs are excellent. Cowboy can submit the out of you.

103
00:05:56.841 --> 00:06:01.000
He submits a lot of people he's nasty off his back. He's got wicked triangles.

104
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.120
I could see if this went to the ground.

105
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.680
Connor getting submitted by cowboy in a triangle.

106
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.320
What I couldn't see is cowboy getting submitted by Connor in a triangle.

107
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.680
I could see, I could see cowboy submitting Connor. I would,

108
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.150
I don't think it's impossible for con to submit cowboy,

109
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.230
but I don't see it. I think Connor can win by knockout. Yes.

110
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.830
He's very fast. Yes.

111
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.630
His left hand is a piston and he's sneaky and he's got nasty

112
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.590
upper cuts. And he's got a killer instinct when he has you hurt.

113
00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:39.020
He bombs on you. And he, Eddie Alvares fight is the best example of that.

114
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.020
Eddie Alvarez was a world class fighter and con McGregor took it to him like no

115
00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:46.340
one has ever done in his career. Tuned him up,

116
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.100
made him look like he had no business in the, in the cage with him.

117
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.420
Now for Eddie, he said like, he just fought a bad fight. And I believe him,

118
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.300
Eddie's a world class fighter. But the point is in, in go time,

119
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.930
Connor McGregor handles pressure as better as,

120
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.970
as much or better as good as well or better than anyone who's ever lived.

121
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.330
He handles pressure so well,

122
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.770
catches Floyd Mayweather with an upper cut in a fight where he' is so

123
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.693
outclassed.

124
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.490
He has zero boxing matches and he's fighting the greatest boxer of all time in

125
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:20.080
one of the biggest Paperview card. It ever it's nuts, right?

126
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.440
So he can handle pressure.

127
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.680
He lost that fight because Floyd's a way better boxer,

128
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.760
but he handled the pressure. The pressure against Aldo talks so much for a year,

129
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.760
going on tour together, tearing pictures of him, stealing his belt,

130
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.960
gets in front of him, flat lines him in 13 seconds. Perfect punch,

131
00:07:36.961 --> 00:07:40.950
perfect execution. Like it measures him with one left hand.

132
00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:45.790
Before that steps back, he dives in with the left. Bang catches him coming in.

133
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.710
It's perfect. Under pressure. He's

134
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.150
not the kind of grappler that normma gametteoff is

135
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.380
he's not in that category. Does he have pressure on this fight? Oh,

136
00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:01.340
he's got so much pressure. He fought,

137
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.780
he fought the guy who everyone's terrified of.

138
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.660
And at least he made it into the fourth round. Right? Wasn't it?

139
00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:07.660
Fourth round submission. Yeah.

140
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.900
And he probably wasn't really prepared for that fight.

141
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.980
You think about how much time he'd been off of MMA?

142
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.820
How much time he'd working on, you know,

143
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:16.460
just boxing and then spending all that money.

144
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:17.580
Cause he made like a hundred million.

145
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.570
The question for me is who is Conna right now is

146
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:25.810
isconnorna. Mcgregue the same guy that knocked out. Dustin,

147
00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:27.650
Dustin Poer when he was a Savage,

148
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.450
is he the same guy that knocked out Diego Brando? Is he, is,

149
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:37.290
is he the same guy that knocked out joondo is he the same guy who knocked out

150
00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:39.450
Eddie res? Or is he just some new thing?

151
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.560
Cause all this money and all this fame and all this attention,

152
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.920
he likes to party and all, what does he now,

153
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.200
if he's the same guy and physically, there should be no reason why he isn't.

154
00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:53.240
He hasn't taken any terrible beatings. Even the never men. I fight.

155
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.160
He stopped him with a choke.

156
00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.560
If he is the same guy physically and he decides he wants to let the world know

157
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:04.960
that he can still do it. And who gives a how much money he has in the bank.

158
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.880
He wants to let the world know he's here to people up.

159
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.680
And he's here to reclaim his crown.

160
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.400
If he goes into the fight with that attitude, I mean,

161
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.150
we could certainly see a resurgence.

162
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.830
The question has always been whether or not a rich man has the motivation to

163
00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:25.270
work like a poor man. And uh, he's a very rich man.

164
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.750
We don't know everybody's different Mayweather fought hard to the day he died or

165
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.190
excuse me to the day he retired and Mayweather when he was during his career was

166
00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:38.780
rich. Like from like a couple years in, he was rich. He was rich.

167
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.180
So he was always rich and still fought like the best in the world

168
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.540
and still trained. Like you have to train to be the best in the world. What.

169
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.100
<v 2>Type of gaps was he taking in between fights guys?</v>

170
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.540
This has been a long gap before. No longer. It's not fair. Yeah.

171
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.610
Before no mug mega Wolf, it was a long gap. You know, the game it's true game.

172
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:03.330
The game has evolved a lot. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, you know,

173
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.690
in a real world, like again,

174
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.890
what you heard me telling Jamie was basically this and the real world,

175
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.890
uh, you know, Cerrone, uh, what what's he done?

176
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.600
The last five fights Cerrone. He's.

177
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.880
<v 1>Had the gage. He's had some ups and downs, ups and downs lost to Gaji lost to,</v>

178
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.880
uh, MAs Vidal, uh,

179
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.000
lost real bad that dare tell the dare tail one was a bad one.

180
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.880
<v 2>So outta the last five fights he's two and three is what.</v>

181
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.040
<v 1>You're telling me, lost to Tony Ferguson, uh,</v>

182
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.990
beat iquinted though and looked real, good doing it. So he's lost two,

183
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.840
the gaci fight. And um,

184
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.560
he beat Mike Perry, which was a really good fight for him. Cause Mike,

185
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.680
Perry's a big, scary guy throws bombs. So he beat him,

186
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.680
lost to Leon Edwards. I think he was sick coming into that fight, but you know,

187
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.590
lost either way and uh, beat yasy madeeros.

188
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.150
<v 2>In a wild fight. So I'm just saying that in, in the real world,</v>

189
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.310
he should take him out. People looking at him.

190
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.310
I don't think this's gonna be that easy of a fight. I like it. I like the over.

191
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.750
I love the over. I don't, I can't pick a, a side yet. Yeah.

192
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.790
But I love the over.

193
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.900
I could see everybody betting McGregor to in round one

194
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.540
and something crazy happened. I mean, in the perfect world, you know,

195
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.460
uh, maybe his Chin's been a little suspect lately, Donald, I don't.

196
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.660
<v 1>Know. How has he been about that? I don't think so.</v>

197
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.220
I think he's just been fighting WW wolves. He's been fighting the,

198
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.660
the toughest guys in the world. Look, everybody's chin suspect.

199
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.450
If Darren till is smashing nose open with an elbow that dude's an animal

200
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.050
and he's big as when Darren tillought cowboy he's so much bigger than him.

201
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:50.010
There was the difference between a really big weterweight and a guy who came up

202
00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:52.290
from lightweight. Darren, Till's a giant dude.

203
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.880
I mean his nickname's the gorilla. So here we go. Yeah. He beat, I Quinta.

204
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.760
He beat Alexander Hernandez. That was a fantastic fight.

205
00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:03.520
That was a fantastic fight. You can't write this kid out. Hernandez is a young,

206
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:04.840
tough guy who was talking mad,

207
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.880
but there's a giant difference between a no disrespect too. A Hernandez.

208
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.630
And aconnor McGregor yesconnor. McGregor's used to those bright lights, man.

209
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.350
He shines, he shines into those bright lights. To me,

210
00:12:16.351 --> 00:12:21.110
the question is really just whether or not he has the motivation to train

211
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.630
and fight like a mad man. Again, like he did when he was younger,

212
00:12:24.631 --> 00:12:27.270
when he was smashing people and for cowboy it's,

213
00:12:27.271 --> 00:12:29.190
whether or not he can survive the early storm.

214
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.190
I think getting his leg kicks working, we would be very big.

215
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.380
Cuz con actually take that long stance.

216
00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.100
Connor takes that long stance and he fights right leg forward.

217
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.980
He fights south paw. And if Donald can up that right leg,

218
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.620
he can figure out a way to attack that right. Leg knees, the body coming in.

219
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.620
He's gotta avoid the punches though. Yeah.

220
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.740
<v 2>If he's up there with, uh,</v>

221
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.250
who do I say he's with he's with sergjo pet go coach up there.

222
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.330
He's.

223
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.010
<v 1>Training. Yeah. You said do Rufus rufusport if he's.</v>

224
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.770
<v 2>In Milwaukee sport for this camp, they're probably working on a lot of Kickbox,</v>

225
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.250
but I guarantee Woodie's Woodie and him are doing some wrestling take down

226
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.770
cuz he knows that's where the mud's gonna Woodie.

227
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.930
<v 1>Has a big fight coming up. Woodie's gonna fight Leon Edwards.</v>

228
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.280
And Leon Edwards is a dangerous man. It's like, that's a, that's a big fight.

229
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.720
And Leon Edwards for whatever reason is not known as much as he is

230
00:13:23.721 --> 00:13:26.560
skillful. You know, he beat cowboy, like we said,

231
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.560
and he's the guy that got in that crazy brawl with masvadal backstage.

232
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.560
Mosvadal hit him with the twopiece in the soda. &lt;laugh&gt; but that's that,

233
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.510
guy's a tough, tough, tough guy,

234
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.870
super highly skilled guy and Leon Edwards and Tyron Woodley.

235
00:13:39.871 --> 00:13:42.830
That's a very high stakes fight that a lot of people aren't talking about,

236
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.310
like that's the fight for the number one contender,

237
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.910
because if Tyron emerges or if Leon emerges and

238
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.630
it's, and it's a big fight and the fight goes well,

239
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:59.980
that person is almost certainly at least considered other than

240
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.540
MAs Vidal. Who's the fan favorite. And then the rematch, those are the,

241
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:07.740
those are the two possibilities, the re the rematch with Colby. And Usman,

242
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.740
other than that, you wanna see,

243
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.500
you wanna see the winner of Tyron Woodley and Leon Edwards. It just makes sense.

244
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.290
It makes sense that that would be the next one or mosvadal those, those,

245
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.450
that's how I would look at it. I would look at it that way.

246
00:14:20.451 --> 00:14:23.890
I would look at it like there's, there's a lot of options.

247
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.850
There's a lot of options for that division.

248
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.970
And now Connor's talking about fighting Usman that would be bonkers.

249
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.610
So if Connor beats cowboy and decides

250
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.440
he feels great at this eight, he feels confident now and dedicated.

251
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.680
He wants to make a run at the champ.

252
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:46.400
There's a big size difference between Usman and Connor Usman

253
00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.520
is a big person. He's got a thick fry.

254
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.080
<v 2>I lot those one 70 guys are big, big they're.</v>

255
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.240
<v 1>Big. Kobeby's a big, fellare big. Colby's a big fell. Philman's big.</v>

256
00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.000
<v 2>So is Mado big, big one 70. Yep.</v>

257
00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:04.000
There's somebody else at one 70. That's deceiving as too.

258
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.680
<v 1>I think Mado's in the sweet spot.</v>

259
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.960
He's not too big where he has to kill himself to make the weight, but he's,

260
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.390
he can obviously knock out weweights easily.

261
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.470
I he's knocked out a lot of we weights. I mean the,

262
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.310
the Ben Astron won is preposterous, but of course,

263
00:15:17.311 --> 00:15:22.270
just even the beating that he is putting on Nate Diaz masvadal can people up at

264
00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:23.870
one 70. I,

265
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.350
I think him versus Connor would be insane.

266
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.140
<v 3>I.</v>
