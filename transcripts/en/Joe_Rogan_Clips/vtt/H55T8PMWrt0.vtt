00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.340
<v 0>Rules to the game are better for everyone.</v>

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.440
They're better for the people that when they're better for the people that are

3
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.180
coming up, they're better for every, yes,

4
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.760
you'd have to have real structure and real rules.

5
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.210
And that you're better off being a guy like Wayne Gretzky. Yes.

6
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.780
Better off being a guy who's respected and plays the game correctly and just

7
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.600
does his best and really, truly becomes a champion and loved by all.

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.720
<v 1>You're better off in every way. Right. And that's the most state.</v>

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.420
The other thing that's so cool about that. So imagine this,

10
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.860
this is the antidote to moral relativism. Okay. So the first thing is,

11
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:32.370
is that there are real problems and,

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.930
and hierarchical organizations can offer real solutions socially and personally.

13
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.050
So you can confront the problems courageously and you can solve.

14
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.920
So that's real it ameliorates suffering and limits malevolence.

15
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:45.930
And so there's nothing morally relative about that.

16
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.170
The second is that sense of meaning that we discussed.

17
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.550
That's not some philosophical second order consequences of thinking.

18
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.990
It's way deeper than that.

19
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.040
That sense of meaning tells you when you're the God ski.

20
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:02.430
There's a Russian psychologist called that the zone of proximal development,

21
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.920
which I believe is where the phrase the zone came from.

22
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.290
And so in the zone of proximal development,

23
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.090
this is what adults do with children,

24
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.960
little kids that are learning to talk adults automatically talk to little

25
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:17.220
children who are learning to talk at a level that slightly exceeds their current

26
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:19.770
vocabulary. They do that without even knowing it.

27
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.980
And that puts those kids in the zone, right? Cause if you just talk baby,

28
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.050
talk to kids, then all they learn is baby talk.

29
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990
And if you just talk like an adult,

30
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.680
then they don't understand a word you're saying.

31
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.450
So you'll find this happy medium in between where the kid mostly understands

32
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.910
what you're talking about and that you're pulling them forward.

33
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.210
So that puts them in the zone. That's a meaningful zone.

34
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.080
And so you can feel the operation of that zone in your own life.

35
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.740
That's what the Taoists are on about because they say, well, you Dow is the way,

36
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:49.920
right? And that's the pathway between chaos and order that's meaning.

37
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.640
And you can feel that in your life when you're deeply engaged in something like

38
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.520
we have deeply engaging conversations. Okay.

39
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:58.380
Which is part of the reason that we keep having them.

40
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.710
And I think why they're popular and we're not paying attention to how the clock

41
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:03.240
is ticking or how time is flowing,

42
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:05.400
or even to the fact that we're doing what we're doing.

43
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:08.910
We're just having a conversation and it's meaningful. It's engaged.

44
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:11.880
It keeps our eyes focused and our senses, um,

45
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.130
concentrated on what's happening.

46
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.240
And the reason for that is that there's enough information flowing between us so

47
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:22.140
that we're being slightly transformed as a consequence of the discussion, right?

48
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:25.020
So we're both comfortable. We trust each other.

49
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.040
We trust that the conversation is aimed at something that's of mutual benefit.

50
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.340
We trust each other to tell the truth to the,

51
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:34.530
to the degree that we're capable of doing that.

52
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.760
And then when you engage in this exchange of information and to the degree that

53
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:42.990
it's breaking you down a little bit and building you up in a different way,

54
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.970
that's a little death and rebirth,

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.330
there's constant little deaths and rebirths in a meaningful conversation,

56
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.660
then that keeps you alive and functioning. And that,

57
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.210
that focuses like that,

58
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.410
that speaks to you so deeply that that focus happens without any consciousness

59
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.650
and meaning. And that's that line between chaos and order. And that's real.

60
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.010
That has nothing it's it's uh it's and I would say,

61
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.520
here's another thing that's cool. So that line between chaos and order,

62
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.240
that's the same thing that's happening when you're playing a game property,

63
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.770
right? Because you're in the game and you're, you're exercising your skill,

64
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.633
but you're pushing it,

65
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.150
but you're pushing it in a way that's also a benefit to your teammates and to

66
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:25.990
the progression of the game as such, and to being a better general player,

67
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:30.760
you're doing all that at the same time and you're evolved with enough

68
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.170
natural intelligence.

69
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.640
So that the sum total output of your nervous system says to you,

70
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.880
you're in the right place at the right time doing the right thing.

71
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.670
And that's what makes your life meaningful. And that's real.

72
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.800
I think it's more real than anything else.

73
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.540
I think it's more real than suffering.

74
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.020
I think it's more real than malevolence because it's the antidote to both of

75
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.440
those. And so the whole moral route,

76
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:56.320
moral relativism issue for me as a non-starter, it's just wrong.

77
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.660
There's lots of ways of interpreting the world,

78
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:02.080
but there aren't very many ways of interpreting it optimally,

79
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.960
and you can feel when you're doing that, it makes you stronger.

80
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.990
And then the people that come to me after my talks and say, well, you know,

81
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.540
I've been putting my life together. I've developed a vision.

82
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.430
I've been trying to be more responsible.

83
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.100
I've been trying to be more honest and put my relationships together.

84
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.180
They're all sparkly eyes because of this or crying sometimes because it's really

85
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:22.600
had an impact out the month on the Metta deep level, they think, oh, wow,

86
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:26.590
this actually works. It's like, yeah, it actually works. It's real. It's real.

87
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.270
And I would just say as well,

88
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:32.230
that that's associated with the idea of the deep Western idea of the logos,

89
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.800
which is meaning inaction and speech. So, you know,

90
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:38.080
if we have a conversation that's meaningful,

91
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.980
then that's a manifestation of the spirit of the logos.

92
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.220
And that's the thing that destroys and, and,

93
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.320
and recreates at the same time, because you learn something, it destroys,

94
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:53.860
something destroys a little presupposition that you had that was erroneous and

95
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:55.480
replaces it with something that's healthier.

96
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.660
And every time you have a meaningful conversation that happens,

97
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.940
it's like a little tweak. Now, it wasn't quite right here,

98
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.700
click that moves and something new takes its place.

99
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.800
So when that's a little death and rebirth,

100
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:09.610
instead of the catastrophic death and rebirth that you might have to have,

101
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:13.270
if you weren't paying attention. So that's all tied together,

102
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.310
it's all tied together with that phenomenon, meaning,

103
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:18.880
and that's the same as the adoption of responsibility that all ties together.

104
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:20.050
So, so nicely.

105
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.490
<v 0>Yeah. The concept of meaning, like what is important that it's,</v>

106
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:28.660
so it's so huge to people, but so fleeting, it's so difficult to like,

107
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.120
what is meaning? Well, you know, there's the simple ones, right?

108
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:35.230
Like family and loved ones and companionship and community,

109
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:38.800
and finding something that you enjoy doing that, you know,

110
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:41.770
you can do that seems bigger than you or bigger than yourself, but,

111
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.460
but meaning like the meaning of life, what is meaning?

112
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.470
And it's one of the things that gives people so much existential anchors and I

113
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.060
think is the cause of a lot of despair because there's.

114
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.930
<v 1>Well, you can question it. But the thing is,</v>

115
00:05:55.931 --> 00:06:00.170
is that that's one of the dangers of rationality is that see the

116
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:04.040
Egyptians associated, the Catholics did this to some degree too.

117
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.140
They associated rash rationality with a proclivity to malevolence,

118
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.920
partly because rationality tends to fall in love with its own productions.

119
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:17.240
Intelligence has this like in-built arrogance and the Egyptians in particular

120
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:19.370
were really insightful.

121
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.780
They tried to replace the idea of intelligence as the highest virtue with the

122
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:27.470
idea of attention as the highest virtue is something eldest Huxley knew.

123
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.880
He wrote a book called island island was an island that was populated by had a

124
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:34.460
lot of birds on it. And the birds could talk. And all they did was say,

125
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:37.820
pay attention to remind everybody on the island to pay attention all the time.

126
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.680
But you, you can undermine your sense of meaning and you can question it.

127
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.520
But the best thing to do is to actually pay attention to when it manifests

128
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:49.700
itself, because it's a, it's a phenomenon like,

129
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.830
like color or like, or like love or like beauty. It, it exists. It,

130
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:55.970
isn't something you create.

131
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:58.670
It's something that you discover and you can discover it.

132
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.600
You just have to watch like you're ignorant about yourself. You think, okay,

133
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:04.430
well, I'm gonna, I I've taught,

134
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.180
told my clinical clients to do this with my students.

135
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.230
Students watch yourself for two weeks. Just watch. Like,

136
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:10.130
you don't know who you are.

137
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.510
And notice when you're doing something that you're engaged in. It's like,

138
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:15.081
you'll see it.

139
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:17.810
Maybe it's only 10 minutes because your life is pretty out of balance.

140
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:20.990
But you'll see that, oh man, I was engaged in something there for 10 minutes.

141
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.890
It's like, why, what was, what did you do that was right. That engaged you,

142
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.150
you were in the right place at the right time doing the right thing for a few

143
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:31.820
minutes. What was it? What were the preconditions?

144
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.080
There's this line in the new Testament? Christ says,

145
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:39.140
the kingdom of God is spread across the earth, but men do not see it.

146
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.630
And that's what it refers to is that you, you, you wander into paradise now.

147
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:47.720
And then when you're engaged, when you're deeply engaged in something,

148
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.560
but you don't notice it, you don't think, oh, look, I'm in the right place.

149
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:54.950
And everything's working out right now. It means I've got it right somehow.

150
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.880
And then I need to practice being there more and more and more, which is,

151
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:00.471
well,

152
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:04.550
that's the appropriate thing to try to practice and that's to make that's to

153
00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:08.480
come to some negotiated, what would you call it?

154
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.710
It's to it's to come to a negotiation with that intrinsic sense of meaning and

155
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:16.730
to realize it as a fact, rather than, than just as an opinion or,

156
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.590
or something that's secondary, because it's.

157
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.080
<v 0>Concept for people though,</v>

158
00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:22.850
to be so aware of who they are and what they're doing,

159
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.350
that they could recreate that.

160
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.160
So when they do feel that feeling of meaning that they could figure out a way to

161
00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:32.210
get back into that state and what were all the extenuating circumstances and

162
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.000
where where's my head at, what caused me to have this,

163
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.010
this feeling like things were right. Yeah.

164
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.140
<v 1>Well, it's like someone gives you a gift and you think, well,</v>

165
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:40.670
I'd like that gift again. It's like, yeah,

166
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:44.300
well you have to figure out what it was that you did to deserve it. So to speak.

167
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.160
And yeah, I know it requires a fair bit of re it requires a fair bit of careful

168
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:52.580
reflection, but it also requires that ignorance is you have to think, well,

169
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:56.610
I don't know who I am. I'm going to find some things meaningful. What are they?

170
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.980
They might not even be things you want to find meaningful.

171
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:01.860
They might be things that you might even be ashamed of. You know?

172
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.090
Cause sometimes people are interested in things that they don't think that they

173
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:09.750
should be interested in. Like maybe you'll you'll have a guy who was, who was,

174
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.990
is kind of a cliche, but who was, um, you know,

175
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.580
socialized to be a real tough guy.

176
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.360
And he finds out that he's kind of interested in art or aesthetics. It's like,

177
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.500
well, he's ashamed of that because maybe it's too feminine or whatever. Well,

178
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:22.810
it's,

179
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.100
doesn't matter because that's actually speaking that that's actually something

180
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:29.460
that's speaking to him from the core of his genuine being,

181
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.370
he's going to have to pursue that. Or you might find, you know,

182
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:36.120
that someone who's really agreeable and kind of a pushover

183
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.940
stands up to someone just once at work, says what they really think.

184
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.240
And then they realize afterwards, wow, you know, that was exactly right.

185
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.570
Then they think, oh my God, you know, I've decided when I was a little kid,

186
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:50.880
maybe they had a harsh father and they decided when they were four,

187
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.650
I'm never going to be angry. My whole life.

188
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.650
There's something wrong with aggression. So they've gone out of their way,

189
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.080
their whole life to be free of conflict.

190
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.960
And then they find out that one day they stand up for themselves. That,

191
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.160
that whole domain,

192
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:06.000
that they'd parsed off as inappropriate is actually contains exactly what they

193
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:07.260
need to put themselves together.

194
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.230
Or do you find what you need where you least want to look?

195
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.190
That's the old El chemical dictum in [inaudible].
