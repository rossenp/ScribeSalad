00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.210
<v 1>Yeah, I think, but I think it's because when I go on the road,</v>

2
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:08.010
like I just went to Bakersfield recently, which is,

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.250
can we just say it's like the best people ever came out there.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.230
<v 2>Feels amazing. Right?</v>

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.440
<v 1>I felt like, I, I felt like Hawk, Hogan, bro. People came out,</v>

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.370
people were crying. Someone's sacrifice their cousins.

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.240
I've got came out of the closet. Like all,

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.240
they wanted it all to happen at the show. You know,

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.580
people were giving me recipes. People were donating.

10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.810
<v 2>You know what the thing, man, it ain't that far hour and 40 minutes.</v>

11
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:32.210
How long does it take from LA two hours? Two hours.

12
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.170
<v 1>Pretty diverse. I mean, yeah, it was cool, man. I really liked.</v>

13
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.760
<v 2>Although I did turn my sink on its brown was flying out of the sink. I was like,</v>

14
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:45.050
what the is this? I've made an Instagram video of it.

15
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.760
I was like, Bakersfield, what the is going on with your water man to St.

16
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:53.450
Good look at that. Does my water coming out of my sick.

17
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.540
<v 1>And the worst is you already brushed your teeth. That's the crazy part too.</v>

18
00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:59.210
I hate it. When that happens. Cause you don't know at first. Ooh.

19
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.000
<v 2>It's a.</v>

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.030
<v 1>Funky. Definitely seems like a malt.</v>

21
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.850
<v 2>But I think that I was staying at our super old hotel. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.490
But it's just, they, they got some old pipes clean those pipes on.

23
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.110
Something's going wrong in there. I was staying there. So what a?

24
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.590
What have I shook? A mouthful that drank it. He died.

25
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.520
What if I was just all over myself for the rest of the day and I had to cancel

26
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:24.230
my shows. Do, do you.

27
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.120
<v 1>Think you'll die one day or not? I'm not trying.</v>

28
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.530
<v 2>To make you think about, um, I'm pretty sure that's how the road goes. Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.820
you're born. And then you die. What, what do you think? I don't know, man.

30
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.520
Crusher doesn't think you die. I think, I think he's just.

31
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.880
<v 1>Yeah, that could be it too. He didn't have a shirt on, dude.</v>

32
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:42.740
You got to put a shirt on. Decide if you're going to die or no.

33
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.820
<v 2>[Inaudible] oh boy.</v>

34
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.560
We have to base this on what we know about people. Now.

35
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:54.290
I know that people used to be alive and now they're not.

36
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:57.200
So what happened to them? Are they faking it?

37
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.680
<v 1>Will you be sad if you die? You think? I think I'll.</v>

38
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.610
<v 2>Be dead, bro.</v>

39
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.500
<v 1>Yeah. What about you? I'd be sad if you died. Well.</v>

40
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.360
<v 2>Thank you. I'd be sad if you died too. Thanks.</v>

41
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.350
<v 1>Man. Prove it.</v>
