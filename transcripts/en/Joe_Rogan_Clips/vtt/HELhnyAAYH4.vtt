<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 3>Well, that was what I wanted to talk to you about.</v>

3
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:09.090
One of the things like did anything shift once people started buying guns when

4
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:12.630
there was this, this, this moment where, what was the,

5
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:15.360
the number of gun sales went up, something crazy.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.230
It was crazy like 40 something percent higher than that. Really? Yeah. Okay.

7
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:22.680
Let's let's find it. Let's guess I'm thinking it's like 40%. Jamie,

8
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.590
what do you think? What's your guess? What's the percentage.

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.290
<v 1>Yeah, that sounds right. I bet I have a different question, but</v>

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.990
I'm looking that up. Cause I see the statistic of 500,000 to 3 million,

11
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.030
but it's why would the center for disease control be doing that.

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.070
<v 2>Really? Because, because they, they,</v>

13
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:45.240
they want to make it a healthcare issue because if it's so that you hear them

14
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.880
say it all the time, they say this is a public health issue.

15
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.420
It's easier to sell gun control when you deem it a public,

16
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.480
no different than one think getting COVID and the vaccine. Why wouldn't it.

17
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.440
<v 0>Be the ATF though?</v>

18
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.320
<v 2>Because it's easier to sell it as a public.</v>

19
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.930
<v 0>I know, but firearms is literally in their title.</v>

20
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860
And if you say it the way Biden says it, you switch pharmacy.

21
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.960
<v 2>But, but you got Mitsubishi. Yeah. They're very good.</v>

22
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.660
The one thing I will say about them and when I say them,

23
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:15.510
I mean the gun control lobby, which generally speaking,

24
00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:18.000
and I got a lot of people who follow me who are more liberal.

25
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.610
They hate when I bring up the Democrats,

26
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.380
they hate it because they think I'm just trying to push this one-sided narrative

27
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:30.090
with respect to the Republicans. Know it, it is what it is.

28
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.460
If you look at all the gun control legislation,

29
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:34.470
you look at anybody who's pushing gun control.

30
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.390
The vast majority of them I'm talking 99% of the time

31
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.580
they are Democrats. Why do you think that is?

32
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.920
Because Democrats are the democratic ideology is based around bigger

33
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:48.870
government, right?

34
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.980
And so you can't necessarily exact your control over a group of people.

35
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.650
If they have something as self-reliant as a firearm,

36
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.620
do you really think that's what it is? I do think that to a degree, that is it.

37
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.750
<v 0>I think it's that the ideology behind being the left wing person is you</v>

38
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:05.160
want less violence.

39
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.570
And I think maybe you're more reluctant to actually take into account

40
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:14.520
real human nature and real the real potential breakdown of society that

41
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:18.270
would cause you to need a gun. I think they're more idealistic,

42
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.700
more utopian and perhaps more.

43
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.330
<v 2>I think the people who vote Democrat believe that.</v>

44
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.470
I think the people in power have a different agenda. I think,

45
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.550
I think from there, and honestly they are, they are the proverbial hammer.

46
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.900
So when you, when you're at, when you, when your fundamental ideology is,

47
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.430
are based around bigger government,

48
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.650
you think the solution for everything is more and more government. So if it's,

49
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.120
if a shooting happens right, and come on,

50
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.380
do we really think government is the most efficient entity at solving problems

51
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:56.130
in our country? No people complain about the government all the time,

52
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.670
but when you are the government and get something like a shooting and people are

53
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:02.830
like, Hey, they're do something about it. Or okay,

54
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:06.040
more government let's throw these laws out here, like restrict that, take that.

55
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:10.990
So they take on a more apparent role as opposed to an entity

56
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:15.550
designed to find true solutions to fix a problem. So they say, okay, well,

57
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.940
if, if this small number of people are killing people with guns,

58
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:23.500
take the guns away. It's just an oversimplified approach to, uh,

59
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.850
to any problem that comes up because they're not really about getting to the

60
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:29.560
true issue of the problem.

61
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.230
They just want to either look like they're doing something about it.

62
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.390
And so they'll just take the easiest approach or they'll try to scapegoated on

63
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.190
something because at the end of the day,

64
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.840
they realize that their ineptitude with respect to leadership is going to be put

65
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:48.430
on full blast, more specifically our inner cities. Right? Right.

66
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.520
So if the fast majority, I mean,

67
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:55.720
close to 80% of gun homicides in this country are coming from our inner cities

68
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.610
and we have 400 million guns in this country. It's really any percent near. Yes.

69
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.380
It's high, it's high. I'm talking gun homicides, right? Not,

70
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:08.050
not like gun deaths, um, because,

71
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.640
and it's driven by gang and drug violence. That's with gun deaths,

72
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:16.510
then you start including suicide. Exactly. Yeah. And so if you understand that,

73
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:18.880
that means that we're having a high concentration, love,

74
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.290
concentrated level of violence in very specific areas in this country. Right.

75
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.930
And as a result of that, you look at that and you say, okay,

76
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.390
well we have high country.

77
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.610
We have an era of concentrated violence in specific areas,

78
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:34.270
but yet we have guns all across the country that don't have this violence.

79
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.900
So clearly there's something else going on here other than the fact that there

80
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:38.734
are guns.

81
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.170
And then predominantly these inner cities are led by

82
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:46.780
Democrats. It just is what it is.

83
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:49.810
It's not politics control exact crazier.

84
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.790
So it stands to reason you're not doing something in these places that you

85
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:59.730
should be doing in order to deal with this violence. And then, you know, in,

86
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.980
in, in my research and in my study, when I was reading these books called,

87
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.650
I think it's like, uh, don't shoot or something like that.

88
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:06.820
I can remember exact title of it.

89
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.880
So I was reading this book and it was talking about this program called

90
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.660
ceasefire. Um, there is a program currently, now that's called cease fire,

91
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:16.720
but I don't think it's the same program. Um, or it's a former shell of itself.

92
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.270
But you know, the sky is criminologists.

93
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.190
He set out and I think it was done in Boston and they

94
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:27.190
were dealing with a lot of violence in their inner cities.

95
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.030
And so what they did is they put together a program was a very holistic approach

96
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:31.751
to the violence.

97
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:35.440
And essentially cops came together along with the community leaders and so forth

98
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:39.370
and so on. And they, they knew who the perpetrators were of this violence.

99
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.480
You gotta think about it.

100
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.990
Do we really honestly believe that the vast majority of these kids in the inner

101
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:46.420
city are killers? No,

102
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.030
it takes a very specific type of person to be a killer.

103
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.870
So a lot of the killings that are taking place in these places are done by very

104
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.780
hyper-focused group of kids in these areas.

105
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.840
And the vast majority of the time, the police know who these kids are,

106
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.450
police know who the perpetrators of this violence are.

107
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.910
And so what they did is they came together. They said, all right,

108
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:08.780
here's what we're going to do. And they, they brought,

109
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:10.880
they brought the leaders of the gangs and the kids,

110
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.000
the kids who were out on the streets so forth and so on came together. And Hey,

111
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.920
look, we're not going to say,

112
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:18.860
we're not going to arrest you for the drug dealing because I mean,

113
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:22.160
whatever happens, happens with respect to that. But if the, if the,

114
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.630
the bodies continue,

115
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.340
we're going to make life incredibly hard for you on these streets really hard.

116
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.440
And as time went on, the violence stopped.

117
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.970
The number went down because at the end of the day, you got to think about it.

118
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:38.990
A lot of these kids are carrying guns.

119
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:40.430
Not because they want to go and kill someone.

120
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.640
They're carrying guns because they're scared they grow.

121
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.880
They've grown up in an environment that is forced them to engage in the

122
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:48.380
lifestyle that they're in, generally speaking.

123
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.380
So if I'm a kid and even if I don't want to partake in this,

124
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.380
in this particular lifestyle, if that's the only thing that's around me,

125
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.870
and I know that any given point, my life could be threatened,

126
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.020
I'm going to carry a gun too. Or even if I'm a kid, that's like, look,

127
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:02.510
I just want to, I want to make some extra money. I'm not,

128
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:05.180
I'm not justifying drug dealer. I'm not justifying the selling of drugs.

129
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:07.190
But if I'm a kid who just says, you know what I want to make,

130
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:09.440
I want to sell money because I grew up the only,

131
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.200
the only form of success that I've seen, where the drug dealers in my area.

132
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.750
So I'm going to sell drugs. Of course, he's going to carry a firearm.

133
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:15.530
He's selling drugs.

134
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.840
There are going to be other people who are going to try to take his product so

135
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:21.440
forth. And so on doesn't necessarily mean he's a killer, right?

136
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.270
So when you focus entirely on the firearm and only on the firearm,

137
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.200
it doesn't do anything to actually deal with the issue. That's good.

138
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:32.420
The underlying issue that's happening in these places.

139
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.460
It's a socioeconomic issue. When you grow up in poverty, I'm sorry.

140
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:40.130
There's going to be a predisposition with respect to your area.

141
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.950
You're gonna have more violence there because what is the natural economy there?

142
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.173
Drugs.

143
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.410
<v 0>That's one of the weirder aspects of gun violence is the reluctance to address</v>

144
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:52.940
the violence in inner cities while focusing on the violence of the rare mass

145
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:56.210
shooter, because the inner city, like you look at the south side of Chicago,

146
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.660
it's a regular basis. Yeah. It's almost every weekend.

147
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.310
There's a bunch of homicides.

148
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.360
<v 2>And I think the reason why is because like you, you actually touched on it.</v>

149
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.170
How do you avoid inner city violence? You're.

150
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.130
<v 0>Going to have to fix the.</v>

151
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.600
<v 2>Crown. I mean, just you, how do you avoid being inner city? Exactly. However,</v>

152
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:18.620
when people feel like some random yo-yo can walk into a store and just start

153
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:21.950
shooting people, terrifies them, which is understandable.

154
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.510
It's totally understandable.

155
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.310
But none of these laws that they're proposing to anything to stop this,

156
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.390
they won't know. So it begs the question is the goal,

157
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:36.890
really to try to save lives or are they leveraging these shootings

158
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.890
to get this specific agenda that they have has.
