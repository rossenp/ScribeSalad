00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.600
<v 1>Have you guys been paying attention to OJ on Twitter? No.</v>

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.500
<v 0>No man.</v>

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.750
<v 1>What's he doing? It's one of the strangest things ever.</v>

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.880
He's just talking on Twitter. Just talk about like football politics and the,

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.290
the comments are just the most ridiculous. Everything that you would expect.

7
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:20.460
I'm sure he can read them.

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.330
The comments are just filled with just murder jokes.

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.520
<v 0>And really, no, not his.</v>

10
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.910
<v 1>Comments. His comments, like under his, like his, his thing.</v>

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.440
He says the thing then under his business,

12
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:34.650
all the people that comment on his post, it's all just murder Joe,

13
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.400
as long as he's.

14
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.181
<v 0>I'm making murder jokes,</v>

15
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:40.650
I guess my friend has the largest OJ Simpson t-shirt

16
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:45.180
collection of like the free OJ juices loose in the, in the world.

17
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.680
And he had an exhibit here in LA a couple a year ago at a museum.

18
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.730
It's like 150 shirts. Pretty, pretty amazing. But you know who?

19
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:56.490
I like to follow on Twitter, which I, we were talking about earlier.

20
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:57.930
I don't really look at Twitter that much,

21
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.280
but I do like Jose Conseco a lot until you. Yeah. What does he talk about?

22
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.210
It's just like crazy. It's this extra crazy. And he was offering like a,

23
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.260
for $2,000. You can go like spend the night in a tent with him and like,

24
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.123
look for big fights.

25
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.280
<v 1>Oh my God.</v>

26
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.440
<v 0>Yeah. It started with him when he shot his finger off and then it fell off.</v>

27
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.290
You know, he's tweeted about that. That that's what peaked my interest.

28
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.410
<v 1>When I was 19 years old, I worked at a place called the Boston athletic club.</v>

29
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:28.050
And Jose can say on some other baseball players walked in.

30
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.600
It's amazing how big he was. He was huge. A huge person.

31
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.900
Huge. Just gigantic, man. Now it's so handsome.

32
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.900
Look like a professional wrestler. It looked like a fake person.

33
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.440
Really didn't even look like a real person. Just a giant handsome,

34
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:48.150
super athlete came in to lift weights. I'm like, how weird, you know, like.

35
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.250
<v 0>He's wonderful. He's one of only four people.</v>

36
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:54.210
I think that has 40 home runs and 40 steals GS in a season. I mean,

37
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:56.550
he was on steroids. I think.

38
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.500
<v 1>Good for Bigfoot. He really is. He said,</v>

39
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:03.330
I am a big foot expert and the most famous big foot picture or video ever

40
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.860
taken was a costume.

41
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:07.470
The individual wearing the costume was none other than Andre,

42
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:10.080
the giant check it out. I don't think that's true.

43
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.440
I think that's pre Andre the giant career. In fact,

44
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.670
that picture was from the sixties. That's the Patterson Gimlin footage will.

45
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:18.504
Andre.

46
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.850
<v 0>Was alive though. Are you saying that Jose Canseco doesn't know what.</v>

47
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.690
<v 1>He's talking about. So I'm going to go out on a limb. He's incorrect here.</v>

48
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.110
<v 0>Have you seen what Andre, the giant could drink in an average time?</v>

49
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.520
It's incredible.

50
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.770
<v 1>Well, yeah, we had Jake, the snake on Jake,</v>

51
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:35.730
the snake used to drive him and he had amazing stories about driving Andrea.

52
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.580
<v 0>Yeah, he would drink like 24, literally 24 beers and like a half hour.</v>

53
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.780
<v 1>Well, the way his hands were so enormous that the beer,</v>

54
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.100
they didn't even look real. They look like mini bar beers, you know, his hand,

55
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.220
his covers everything. He was so huge.

56
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.160
When I saw a guy like Jose Conseco, I'm like, well,

57
00:02:56.161 --> 00:03:00.760
there's no fairness in this world. There's no fairness. How am me?

58
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:05.290
And that kind of the same species. So fairness in this world. Well, good.

59
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.340
<v 2>You learned.</v>

60
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.090
<v 1>Early. Yeah. It's a good lesson to learn a good lesson.</v>

61
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.150
<v 2>The first time you really get dunked on the harm.</v>

62
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.930
<v 1>That can happen to you too bad.</v>

63
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.650
<v 0>I think it's important to kind of be reminded of like your position in society</v>

64
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:25.030
in the world. When I was, when I was at 10 or 11, I was listening to the,

65
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.690
I was getting driven home from a little league game by my dad who was one of the

66
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:32.290
sweetest guys ever. Right. And we're listening to the Indians game and uh,

67
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.950
this new, this new shortstop who at the time was terrible named Jay bell,

68
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.370
like drop the ball. And I was like, dad,

69
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:42.640
I bet you I'm a better shortstops than Jay bell. I might have to stop the car,

70
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.880
Patrick. I love you so much, but you're 11 and there's no possible way.

71
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.200
There's only like 50 professional shortstops. There's no way.

72
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.220
And then that's it. I just was like, oh my God. But I realized at that moment,

73
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.080
I'm like, man, my, my dad's never gonna me. That's kind of cool. That's very.

74
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.710
<v 1>Cool. Yeah. That's very cool. Yeah. You don't need to be. He.</v>

75
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.520
<v 0>That's a problem. As opposed, a lot of kids today they've been their whole life.</v>

76
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.413
They were like, oh yeah.

77
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.660
<v 1>Best. You're the best son. You are better than him.</v>

78
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.680
You just need to go and take that job. It's yours. Well,

79
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:20.740
there's a lot of wacky people too that are living through their kids. You know?

80
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.070
They're,

81
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.520
they're like all their expectations of success have now been turned on their

82
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:26.850
progeny. Oh yeah. You know, they have this thing.

83
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.660
They just want their kids to kick and go out there and kick. No,

84
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.393
slow down.

85
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.320
<v 2>Sorry. Fine line. Yeah.</v>

86
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.890
<v 1>How do we get? Oh, Jose can say goes Twitter. It's crazy. Huh?</v>

87
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.330
<v 0>It's crazy. It's a wild dude. Wild man. I mean,</v>

88
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:49.900
it's cool that a guy that hit me, his life story is incredible.

89
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:50.800
Have you hit you? Haven't had them on.

90
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:52.930
I'm guessing that you should have him on oh Mike.

91
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.260
<v 2>God, that would be great. Bash brothers. Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.380
Have him just tell them exclusively bash brothers stories.

93
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.890
<v 1>People are always going to be mad at him forever because of the steroids thing.</v>

94
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.410
Right? Cause he told them these other guys that.

95
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.210
<v 0>Well, his other brother was found out. Right. Mark McGuire.</v>

96
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.200
I don't know, man. I don't know much about the, I mean,

97
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:19.570
I know the difference between doping and steroids or whatever,

98
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.130
but I kind of feel like if you're, I don't know about steroids necessarily,

99
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:27.550
but if you're, if you're riding a bike across France and like,

100
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.810
I dunno, I feel like you should dope a little bit.

101
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.780
I'm not doing it. Someone needs to do it.

102
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.580
<v 1>The doctors have actually said,</v>

103
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:39.940
it's probably physically safer to take the steroids.

104
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.680
If you're going to do something like tour de France,

105
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.460
because it's so insanely grueling on your body that you want to be able to

106
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:48.700
recover. But we have this weird thing. It's like,

107
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:50.530
there's a thing that makes your body work better,

108
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.260
but you're not supposed to take it. If you take it, we get mad at you,

109
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.660
but we want you to do good. We want you to do your best,

110
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.550
but we don't want you to take this thing. You could drink yourself to death.

111
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.970
We're never going to stop that, but we don't want you to taking steroids.

112
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.070
Cause then you'd be too big and you hit too many balls. Like what, what,

113
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.340
how come he can't.

114
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.350
<v 2>Do it either? you everybody. Or nobody. Yeah.</v>

115
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.190
<v 1>It's the cheating thing. The thing is that it affects kids.</v>

116
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.880
That's where it gets dangerous is because you, if you find out, oh my God,

117
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.570
these guys just openly do steroids. And they tell you what they do. And then.

118
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.640
<v 2>Middle-schoolers will be doing it. Yes.</v>

119
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.490
<v 1>Some real that's the real fear, the real fear.</v>

120
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.943
<v 2>And because that's, that,</v>

121
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.170
that would happen because there's middle schoolers that are professionally like

122
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:32.420
competitive all over this country.

123
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.040
<v 1>Kids in high school do steroids.</v>

124
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.590
<v 0>I mean like, I mean also you do, you do a bunch.</v>

125
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:41.120
I know somebody did a bunch of steroids and he was describing to me the process

126
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:45.530
of that, he literally was doing anyone a bit, get big, you know? And uh,

127
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.480
I was like, so what do you do? What do you do when you're big? He's like,

128
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.851
you got, well,

129
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:54.290
you got to start taking these estrogen blockers and all this stuff. I was like,

130
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.060
what the? You think? Yeah, if you don't,

131
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.960
if you don't take your body stops making testosterone. And I was like, what the?

132
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.120
I was like, well, that's, I mean like,

133
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.840
this is probably a controversial statement, but I like what Bruce Jenner said.

134
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.850
He like, um, like did steroids for breakfast. I mean,

135
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:13.610
did that, you think that like depleted his testosterone.

136
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.490
<v 1>Uh, production date? Don't I don't,</v>

137
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.050
I don't think they believe that there's a connection between

138
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.050
gender identity and testosterone levels.

139
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:27.560
I think they think it's a wiring issue for lack of a better term.

140
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.500
But there is always a thing that happens to people.

141
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:35.300
If you take steroids that your body has this inability to make its

142
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:37.100
natural hormones. And so you get depressed,

143
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.880
it's like a depression time and it could be really funky for a lot of athletes.

144
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.500
<v 0>Jose can say, goes out there looking for Bigfoot. Isn't it?</v>

145
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.700
Cause he just needs to clear his head.

146
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.920
<v 1>He also had some MMA fights. He might've got his brains knocked loose. Like he,</v>

147
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.610
uh, he had one MMA fight against this big giant dude.

148
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.810
What was his name? Early. Early MMA. No, it was,

149
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.590
it was after his whole career thing had gone. He, he got it.

150
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:07.790
He had a fight with the, was it hung man Choi. It was hung man.

151
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.650
Choi Homeland Choi is huge. So him just accept his fight is crazy.

152
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.720
Let me tell you about a guy that's like yeah.

153
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.350
Hung mentor is like literally seven feet tall. Jose,

154
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.220
Jose Conseco is an enormous guy. I've recognized him from movies.

155
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.270
He's not enormous compared to hung man choy and hung land choice was a

156
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:31.010
professional MMA fighter. He fought some really, really tough guys in Japan.

157
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.740
So it was a total complete mismatch, but he needed, he needed the cheddar.

158
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:38.930
So he stepped in, you know what? That looks like size of choice.

159
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.560
<v 0>That looks like when you have like a real GI Joe Guy and then like the generic</v>

160
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.090
GI Joe Guy that looks like he.

161
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.793
<v 2>Found Bigfoot.</v>

162
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.090
<v 1>And even though like Conseco is still a go Rilla. I mean,</v>

163
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:54.020
he's a stout man. Super powerful, gigantic, man.

164
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.350
But that just shows you how big hung man choice. Does he get, he got pummeled.

165
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.980
Yeah. I think he blew his knee out. If I, if I remember correctly,

166
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:06.300
I think he threw a kick and he blew his knee out and then hung Mantua pounding

167
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:07.170
them into a bowl on a.

168
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.633
<v 0>Too.</v>

169
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.070
<v 1>Yeah, it was just, oh no daddy. Really?</v>

170
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.740
I just saw a picture of them standing again on the ring. God,

171
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.030
he's so much bigger than Danny.

172
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:19.890
Bonaduce he's he's a really huge guy right there. Is that there?

173
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.910
Yeah. Oh my God. He did to anybody, dude. She's crazy. Treasonous.

174
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.330
<v 0>His head looks like it's been photo-shopped on.</v>

175
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.570
<v 1>But wait a minute. Wasn't that cancer? It goes brother. Wasn't that?</v>

176
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:34.110
His brother posing his hand super tatted up. Oh my God. He's not though.

177
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.450
This guy is no, he's not even. What's one of those. That's one of those, uh,

178
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.780
sharks that you put on. It's like a rash card,

179
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.830
but it's got tattoos on it and it looks like you're tattooed out.

180
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.640
I wish our brothers.

181
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.540
<v 0>Would start posing as.</v>

182
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.150
<v 1>Us. I don't think that that was Kant. Seiko.</v>

183
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:54.630
I think it was can't take his brother. I think it was like found out later.

184
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.170
Is it like how.

185
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.220
<v 0>Gallagher has gone?</v>

186
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.870
<v 1>We were talking about that. Gallagher to look at that guy. That's not,</v>

187
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:01.704
can't say go.

188
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.550
<v 0>His name isn't mentioned in there. Danny IO.</v>

189
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.390
<v 1>I mean, he's still a big giant dude too.</v>

190
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.830
<v 0>I mean the only way to story,</v>

191
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.980
the only way the story could get published is with that resolution of photo

192
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.540
eight, eight.
