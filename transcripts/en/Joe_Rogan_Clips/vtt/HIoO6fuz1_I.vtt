00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. This one.</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.310
<v 1>Is a weird one, right? Whereas a lot of people get it in their asymptomatic.</v>

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.550
Um, I've,

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.100
I've had several friends that got it and literally experienced no,

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.150
no symptoms. They were around people that had it, they got it. Um,

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.980
they tested positive and got as little as a

7
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.210
mild headache or a slight cough for a day. Um,

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.620
Jamie had it and he thought he had a sinus infection.

9
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:32.940
He thought he has allergies.

10
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:34.650
And he thought it was just his allergies kicking in.

11
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.280
It turns out he was positive, but he was very fortunate. It was,

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.330
it was a very mild case. Do we know why with some people get it?

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.780
When some people get it, it's devastating. Including young people.

14
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.970
I have a young friend he's 28. He got it.

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.540
And he was really ill for two weeks.

16
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.100
Whereas some people get it and it's nothing. Yes.

17
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.270
<v 2>So we, we have some sense of some of the reasons it varies,</v>

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.710
but I'm not a huge understanding yet of the interpersonal

19
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.620
variation. But I would like to

20
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.310
go on a tangent based on that,

21
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.720
that highlights the ways in which these kinds of protean manifestations of this

22
00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:17.180
disease. The fact that with this condition,

23
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:21.830
you can go from everything from having no symptoms to mild symptoms like

24
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.693
Jamie,

25
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.860
to more serious symptoms like your 28 year old friend to really severe symptoms

26
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:30.740
to being hospitalized to dying, right?

27
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:35.720
There's this incredible range of diseases that this particular virus can

28
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.130
cause. And in a way,

29
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.810
this is very unfortunate for us because it makes it so much harder as a

30
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:45.980
society to take the virus seriously. And to combat it. Let me,

31
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.210
let me give you an analogy.

32
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.160
So I want listeners to imagine that there are two worlds.

33
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.550
I'm about to describe two different worlds in world.

34
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.960
A there are a thousand people and a virus infects,

35
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.150
10 people in this world makes them seriously ill and one person

36
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:07.940
dies. So we would say that in this world,

37
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:11.000
10% of the people that got sick died of the virus, that's world,

38
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.170
a in world B there a thousand people,

39
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.540
the virus infects a hundred people. 90 of them get mild illness.

40
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.810
10 of them, once again gets serious illness like in world.

41
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:28.610
A and one of them dies again, like in world day. So in this world,

42
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.310
in world B a hundred people got sick and one died.

43
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.910
So we might say 1% of them died in world.

44
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:39.710
A 10% of the people that got sick died in world B 1% of the people that got

45
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:43.550
sick died. Now, many people hearing about this might,

46
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.990
might think that it's better to be in world B because you know,

47
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.600
it seems like the virus is less deadly,

48
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.530
but that's a delusion because if you stop and you think about it a little bit

49
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:57.650
more clearly, world B is the same as world.

50
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.170
A plus an extra 90 people got mild illness.

51
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.750
In other words, nobody, right?

52
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.640
No right thinking person should prefer to be in world B than to be in world a

53
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.560
in world, a 10 out of a thousand people got seriously ill and one died.

54
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.600
And in world B that happened. Plus another 90 people got mildly sick.

55
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.930
So it's clearly worse. The overall situation is worse than world B.

56
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.250
And that is in fact, the situation that we are facing, we are in a,

57
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:30.340
like a world B situation with this virus.

58
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.720
And the reason it's hard is that it all these extra people,

59
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.980
those 90 people who got mild illness, make people take the disease more,

60
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.490
you know, casually. Whereas in world, a people might say, well,

61
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.970
not many people are getting sick, but when they get sick, 10% of them die. Wow.

62
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:48.610
We should take this disease seriously. Do you see what I mean?

63
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.550
<v 1>Yeah, I do see what you're saying. So this,</v>

64
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.040
this virus is very sneaky in that way. Yes.

65
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.770
It's really like if you wanted to engineer a virus,

66
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:59.130
that's going to spread the most. That's kind of how you would do it.

67
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.100
Have it affect so many people where they're like, it was nothing.

68
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.880
And then some people were, you know, they're dead within a few days.

69
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.240
<v 2>Yes. And also, as you pointed out earlier,</v>

70
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.930
it also has this property of being transmitted transmissible when it's

71
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:15.930
asymptomatic. So just to, just to remind people,

72
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.440
HIV is like that you can have HIV for years and not know it,

73
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.510
you're spreading it to your sexual partners.

74
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.440
And then it kills you much later versus smallpox,

75
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.490
which you can't really spread smallpox before you have symptoms, you,

76
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.420
the pedestals erupt on your body and that's when you become infectious.

77
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.610
So there's a, there's a, there's a, uh, there's no asymptomatic transmission,

78
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.870
uh, in smallpox.

79
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.730
And there is an HIV and SARS one from 2003 was more like

80
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:45.960
smallpox. In other words,

81
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.800
people didn't begin to transmit the virus until they actually had symptoms from

82
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:53.010
it, which is one of the reasons it was easier to control because when people got

83
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:56.760
symptoms, we could isolate them. Whereas with the SARS that we're facing now,

84
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.970
the SARS cov two COVID 19, uh,

85
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.570
people can transmit it when they're, when they're not symptomatic. And in fact,

86
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:06.720
there's a lot of analyses that have been done that show about seventy-five

87
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:11.130
percent of the infections have been acquired from people who are asymptomatic.

88
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.811
<v 1>There's.</v>

89
00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:16.410
So there's another issue as well that we can compare to smallpox in that you can

90
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:21.240
develop a vaccine for smallpox that actually works for your whole

91
00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:25.980
life. You can't really do that with COVID correct.

92
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.450
<v 2>Don't no, for sure. We don't know that for sure. We, I don't know that for sure.</v>

93
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:34.770
I'm hopeful that we'll be able to have a vaccine that has long-term confers

94
00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:37.830
long-term immunity, but I don't think we know that either way. For sure.

95
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.650
<v 1>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

96
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.800
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

97
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:49.200
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

98
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:52.920
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

99
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.910
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

100
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.710
That's all we're asking. Go download Spotify. Buh-bye.
