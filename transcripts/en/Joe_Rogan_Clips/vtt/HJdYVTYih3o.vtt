00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. In.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.760
<v 1>Theory, because that map is so regular across cultures.</v>

3
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:09.210
He's looked now in China, in Chinese speaking people in English,

4
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:11.850
speaking people and people who have a second language,

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.630
he's even had some interesting data about people who have up speak that really.

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.820
<v 2>Annoying. Oh, I hate that. Yeah. That's a lot near where you live.</v>

7
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.990
That's a San Francisco tech thing, is it? Yeah. It's like,

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.790
what they're doing is letting you know that they're one of the tribe. Okay. And,

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.880
uh, we're all in this together. And I think like you do,

10
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.700
and you can trust me because I'm an original.

11
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.280
<v 1>Well, it might reflect a subtle brain damage.</v>

12
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.350
I think the data show that it's a distortion of the, of the regular map.

13
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.110
<v 2>I think it's the same thing as a Southern accent.</v>

14
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.540
I think you're just fitting in with your environment.

15
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.750
Cause I know people that have adopted that once they've gotten into the tech

16
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:54.620
world and like, Hey, face, you didn't use to talk like that. Or the.

17
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.830
<v 1>People that go to England and start speaking with a brochure.</v>

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.640
<v 2>And Madonna. Oh, did she do that? I don't know. Pop culture carefully.</v>

19
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.860
Yes she did. Yeah. I'm moving to Texas.

20
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:06.590
I'm going to start saying y'all two weeks in. I'm giving myself two weeks.

21
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.020
So I'm gonna try out y'all.

22
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.990
<v 1>Some of this stuff is learned. Are you moving? Oh, you are.</v>

23
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.360
I've heard rumors of that, but I guess, okay. I'm sorry to hear.

24
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.390
Sorry for California. Um, congratulations, Texas. Um, they're, you know,

25
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:23.780
these maps have some regularities across people because when we're born into the

26
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:26.990
world, you know, we are not a completely clean slate.

27
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.220
There's a kind of a map that expects the world,

28
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.080
including language to be a certain way.

29
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.650
And we can't expect that we're going to be born in China or born in France or

30
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:39.410
born in California or Northern California for that matter.

31
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.640
So the map is what we call semi malleable.

32
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.810
It's not a rigid concrete hardwired map. So what makes.

33
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.030
<v 2>You think that this ups speak is like damage?</v>

34
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.870
<v 1>Well, so I asked Eddie about this, um, Eddie Chang, my friend,</v>

35
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:56.750
this neurosurgeon who has, you know, kind of premiere world, not kind of,

36
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:59.810
he is the world expert on speech and language and the neural transformations and

37
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:02.780
how it controls the pharynx, all that stuff. And I said,

38
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.370
what's with the up speak thing. He said, yeah, you know, we see that sometimes.

39
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:10.700
And I'm concerned about that. And when a neurosurgeon tells you their concern,

40
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:12.200
you kind of go, okay, what are you concerned about? He goes,

41
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.310
there's something wrong with the map and this is kind to get this, you know,

42
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.270
so maybe that's, uh, you know, it could be because of upbringing and people, uh,

43
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.710
you know, the brain is plastic as adults too, and I'm not in the same way,

44
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.560
it's plastic in childhood. But you know,

45
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:29.420
if you are forced to learn another language, your blood,

46
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.510
your brain will fundamentally shift. Neuroplasticity is a real thing.

47
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.540
And I think, uh, it's interesting,

48
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:39.860
you raise this kind of cultural component because actually it was Eddie's, uh,

49
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.540
advisor, a guy named Mike Merzenich was really the one who discovered adult

50
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.951
neuroplasticity, you know,

51
00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:50.150
in the seventies and eighties and my actual scientific great grandparents,

52
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.210
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel won the Nobel prize for showing their critical

53
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:56.750
periods, these periods of development, after which the brain can not change.

54
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.990
And they had important implications for amblyopia and I stuff MERS.

55
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.150
And it came along and said, you know what? I don't buy that.

56
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.410
And he started doing experiments with his students and post-docs where they

57
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:11.950
would create an S an essential need or contingency.

58
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.180
Like if the animal doesn't eat, unless it learns something,

59
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.760
then the brain can change.

60
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.990
If you break down learning events into is kind of smaller, more focused events.

61
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.930
The brain can change as an adult at essentially any age.

62
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.300
And so the strongest drive for adult neuroplasticity

63
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.040
is focus. It's the ability to say, this is really important.

64
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.140
It's making a soda straw view of the world.

65
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:42.700
It's almost like being in a state of stress and the best way to do that

66
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.430
for a young person in adolescence,

67
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:49.090
or maybe even older is the social pressures. If they're strong,

68
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.340
they will shape and rewire the brain. I mean,

69
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:52.960
I look at what's happening in the world right now.

70
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.310
And I think we are in a state of immense neuroplasticity.

71
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.460
Everybody is having to rewire their understanding what's going on.

72
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.540
So just to sort of, um, put up, you know,

73
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:07.180
kind of a bowl of some sort on the speech and language thing,

74
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.780
I don't think brain machine interface is going to be all about dry stick and

75
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:11.130
chips.

76
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.030
<v 2>But still let's get back to the up speak thing. Why does he think it's damaged?</v>

77
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.190
Like, what is, what is it about ups speak?

78
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.910
<v 1>Well, he, he just thinks that the map would shows up kind of normally in,</v>

79
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:23.910
in most, this is probably the first time in human history.

80
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:26.550
People have used this up speak. It's also the first time in human history,

81
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.110
people have typed with their thumbs.

82
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.990
<v 2>I was listening to two guys at the airport back when you can go to the airport.</v>

83
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.380
And these two guys at the airport, we're talking in ups, beak. And I,

84
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:37.620
it was like, as clear as day to me, like they were letting each other,

85
00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:40.230
know that they're in the tribe. And, uh, you know,

86
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:44.040
I remember Jamie had a tech problem once and he was on the phone with this lady

87
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.470
who was doing up speak when she was talking to him.

88
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.590
And we both looked at each other like, oh, yuck.

89
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.880
<v 1>Kind of create a kind of visceral, like, like nauseous.</v>

90
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.260
<v 2>I can't trust those people.</v>

91
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.280
I can't trust someone who talks like that because I know you're on original.

92
00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:01.020
Like you not, not what not.

93
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.390
Most of us are clearly at least mostly influenced by the people around

94
00:05:06.391 --> 00:05:08.730
us. But it's not just that. It's like,

95
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:13.290
you've changed how you talk to fit in with this.

96
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.970
There's a tech world. There's tech language, that's tech speak,

97
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:22.080
it's English, but it's tech speak English. It's letting you know.

98
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.520
And there does seem to be a body, wants to spinal extensors. Trust them.

99
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.580
I don't trust them. I think they're sneaky.

100
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.300
<v 1>Well,</v>

101
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.200
I'll try and get the data from I'll try and get the data from I'm being halfway.

102
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.080
<v 2>Joking here. If you're like a ups speed person, like, Hey man,</v>

103
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.110
I've always loved your show, but then you said you don't trust people to talk,

104
00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:43.680
like meet joking, but also stop doing that.

105
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.990
Stop doing that. I know what you're doing.

106
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.363
<v 1>I think, um,</v>

107
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.170
I think Eddie would say that there's some distortion in the way they're using

108
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:53.004
this map, but.

109
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.730
<v 2>It start, I think it started with one really smart person.</v>

110
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.850
Who's a little autistic who talked like that because they were trying to keep it

111
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:05.240
together. And then everyone else was like, I want to be as smart as John.

112
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.780
And then they started talking like that. And then it became a thing,

113
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.960
sort of like accents. Like th I grew up in Boston, right.

114
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.210
They talk in a weird way. And I,

115
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.150
I picked it up and then one time I heard myself on television.

116
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.420
I heard myself talk like that when I was 19, I was like, oh my God,

117
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:23.570
I sound like a idiot. What is wrong with me? Like,

118
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.390
cause I had only lived there at that time for like six years,

119
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:31.010
but I adopted it whole hog. And I was like, what? What's wrong with me? Like,

120
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:33.170
why am I, I wanted to fit in. That's what it was.

121
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.780
I I'd moved there when I was 13 and I tried to fit in.

122
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.200
And so I had adopted the speech pattern. I didn't realize it until I heard it.

123
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.660
Like, you, you listen to a tape of yourself,

124
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.710
you actually find out what you really sound like, you know, like, yeah,
