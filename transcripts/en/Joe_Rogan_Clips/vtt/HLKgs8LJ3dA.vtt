00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Depending upon your actions,</v>

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.040
you reacted things differently depending upon your physical state.

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.160
And that's one of the things that yoga really helps when one of the ways that

4
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:16.560
yoga helps your karma is yoga relaxes you to

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.670
consequences and to things that happen. Like I remember, uh, I was, uh,

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.190
driving on the highway and there was this kid behind me. Um,

7
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.030
he's illegal alien and he was on his phone and he hit the brakes

8
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:36.510
too late and he slammed into my Porsche. I have a rare Porsche.

9
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.990
It's a very nice car.

10
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.100
And he up my car and I got out a and he didn't have a license

11
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.580
or insurance. Uh, he had insurance actually. I didn't think he did,

12
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.860
but took down his information. I, I took, uh, a photo of his, uh,

13
00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:54.020
insurance card and I told him, listen, I said, you should get outta here, man.

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.340
Like, you're gonna get arrested. Like you, you slammed into me.

15
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:00.260
You don't have a license. You're not even supposed to be driving.

16
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:03.490
You' gonna take your car. His car was up. My car actually drove.

17
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.450
I drove it to the comedy store, but I remember the way I reacted to him.

18
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.890
Cuz I had done yoga three days in a row. Cool. Was cool and.

19
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.723
<v 1>Calm. Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.690
<v 0>I was a, I was happy. I was okay. Cuz he slammed into me man. BA like that.</v>

21
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.250
<v 1>Fight story I told I wasn't angry. Yeah. It, it,</v>

22
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:20.050
it changes how you re first of all,

23
00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:24.240
it changes how you react in the Mo when you're doing the in the class. Yeah.

24
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.960
It has a secondary effect, like you just said.

25
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.320
And the third way it affects you is at the time of death,

26
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.000
the idea I I've actually had almost in your death experience

27
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.640
with this too, where, um, you are focused

28
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.550
in the same way. You're not angry. You're not freaking out.

29
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.510
You become incredibly focused as if I'm about, about to leave my body

30
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.630
and you can say it, uh, once I was attacked. Um,

31
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.990
and I had it probably the most spiritual experience in my life. Um,

32
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.020
and it was how are you attacked? It's such a story,

33
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.100
but it's it's. I was at a show. I was when I,

34
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:11.180
we were the time of my life. When I was monks,

35
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.260
we were all monks and we were traveling and we played in sort of

36
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.060
a ghetto part of Buffalo at a big show,

37
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.620
materially speaking. It was great.

38
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.210
We were big people loved those who sold merchandise and which band was this?

39
00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:28.810
This was shelter. It's my next band. Um,

40
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.730
and after the show,

41
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.730
it was about two in the morning and everybody's getting out of the club and I'm

42
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:41.730
in the alley getting interviewed for some man magazine and our

43
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.600
van is parked. You could drive the car in the van,

44
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.240
in the club and all the doors and windows were open and our guys were unloading

45
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.980
all the gear.

46
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.880
And basically only a few people left in the club breaking down the club and I

47
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.040
was outside getting interviewed.

48
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.000
And all of a sudden this car pulls up with these massive

49
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.200
dudes who weren't from the punk scene.

50
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:06.880
They looked like just sort of ghetto dudes and they were ripped and they were

51
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.000
big and they just grabbed one of the younger kids. I mean,

52
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.560
our show is everyone was 17, 19, you know, 20,

53
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.120
they grabbed one kid and just beat the living crap out of them. And I was like,

54
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.430
uh, and I'm getting interviewed.

55
00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:23.310
So it's sort of awkward and it's happening about 50 yards away from him.

56
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:26.510
Just randomly random. Activeviolence didn't talk to him first.

57
00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:28.870
Didn't talk to him, picked him up, threw him' down, beat him,

58
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.830
and then went to another kid and did that.

59
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.310
By the time they got to the third kid,

60
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.460
everybody just started running for their life. Here's like a get, you know,

61
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:43.820
you don't think of these things in, in times of great like fear and anxiety.

62
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.260
Why don't you, why don't you do this? Why don't you do that? Why?

63
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.180
All I did was I ran back in the club to get my band. I said,

64
00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:53.620
you guys gotta get outta here. There's a bunch of crazy guys outside.

65
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.180
And all my roadies, we're all monks by the way.

66
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.370
But all the guys who were my roadies said, well, we can't go anywhere.

67
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:03.730
Like the equipment's half in the car, the t-shirts aren't loaded.

68
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.970
And all of a sudden, the bad guys,

69
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.450
their car drives into the club and parks like,

70
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.290
like a T blocking our vans. So we couldn't get outta the club any longer

71
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.570
and they get out of the car. And there's not that many people,

72
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:21.320
there's a couple bands and sound stuff like around the club.

73
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.120
And the biggest guy gets out and he grabs a gun

74
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.400
and he just goes in a really serious and unemotional way.

75
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.440
I've got a gun and I'm gonna kill everyone tonight.

76
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.320
And it was one of these like

77
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.110
eerie sort of like eerie organ music he could hear.

78
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.870
And I was like, it, it just felt like, oh, this is the day. You know,

79
00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:51.070
the day you always talk about that death day where you don't expect it and you

80
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:55.030
expect it. And then you get the, the, a ACE of spades. That's your day now.

81
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.950
And I was like, oh. And I was the older,

82
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.700
you know, dev devotei Christianna dev devotei these,

83
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.340
we are Christianna dev devotete monks or BTI, yoga monks.

84
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.060
And so all the other guys in the band came up to me, what are we gonna do?

85
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:11.580
What are we gonna do now? They weren't,

86
00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:13.860
they weren't right near us at the time they were like go,

87
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:18.860
they were literally going around and beating people up and all the other monks

88
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:20.860
came up to me, you know, RA, what are we gonna do?

89
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.370
And I had already sort of given up UNES escaping or anything.

90
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.330
I just looked, I don't know where I got this from,

91
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.490
because I'm definitely not an elevated soul. Um,

92
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.650
but I said, we're gonna die tonight. And so we're gonna chant.

93
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.010
And I went into the, the, the, uh, Jesus Christ. I,

94
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.600
I know why wouldn't you just run? I, you know what, in retrospect, I don't know,

95
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:48.400
but let, let me, let me, let me, uh, circle back with this.

96
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.000
I grabbed the drum out.

97
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.720
I play this Indian drum and we all started chanting these mantras to,

98
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.040
to nainga Dave.

99
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.120
Who's an avatar of Nu you usually chant for type of protection,

100
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.120
but we all started really focusing and chanting this mantra.

101
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.600
It's unbelievable story, but it's, it's all true.

102
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.080
And as they were beating up people,

103
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.600
they finally came to us and all my guys ran for their life.

104
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.350
Some guys were on under the van in the, and above the van.

105
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.910
And I'm surrounded by this gang.

106
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.990
And the biggest guy just grabs the gun and he goes to me,

107
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.170
do you want some? And I was like, freaking trick question.

108
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:34.610
What am I supposed to say here? And so I didn' just, you know, by the way,

109
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.170
I didn't look like a monk. I had jeans on or I DIDNT.

110
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.960
It's not like let's beat up monk day. It was just a random act of violence.

111
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.520
And so I said, I just put my hands, like in anamous day and said,

112
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.640
Harry, krisshna, I'm a Devo of Lord Krishna.

113
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.240
And I have no idea why you are angry.

114
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.470
And then, or the first time in my life,

115
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.670
I felt completely helpless.

116
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.270
I was just like repeatedly beaten and just punched.

117
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.190
And it's just one of those things. It's not like you can even fight back.

118
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.910
You are just getting pounded.

119
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.750
But what happened was every time I got punched,

120
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.180
I chanted a mantra.

121
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.780
So it was sort of like this new noion Chitani Krishna govinnda goal.

122
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.380
Every time I chanted to the point where I was like, oh, this is amazing.

123
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.140
I'm actually chanting. I was actually stepping outside of myself,

124
00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:38.100
saying I'm actually in meditation, on sacred names.

125
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.130
And then all of a sudden my head was down and I looked behind me and there was

126
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:46.530
these three girls coming to protect me and they had baseball bats.

127
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.770
And then I realized, no, they're not. They're the girlfriends of these guys.

128
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.010
And then I started getting hit by a baseball bat,

129
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.850
UN unbelievable, three times in the head.

130
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.880
We one on the shoulder and two in the legs.

131
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.240
And every time I, and this is a random thing, there's no reason.

132
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.360
As far as I know it was, as far as I know, it was random. I didn't know them.

133
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.160
They didn't know me. They weren't from that scene. Our show was in a ghetto,

134
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.960
you know, there's always a cause of something,

135
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.870
but I have no idea what the cause was. And so every time, but,

136
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.430
but MI miraculously and you read these stories in the Maha bar and the rammyon,

137
00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:27.710
all these epics of India, the great Sage leaves his body.

138
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.550
He calls Lord Christianist chariot in front of him.

139
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.710
Then he chant these mantras and I'm thinking, oh my God,

140
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.470
I'm chanting these mantras at the time of death.

141
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.900
I'm cha I'm chanting at the time of death. This is the perfection in my life.

142
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.260
That was what was going through my head. I kid you not.

143
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.420
And I was like outside of my body and I wasn't fearful.

144
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.620
And then all of a sudden to wrap up the story, everything stopped.

145
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.860
And I didn't really know what happened, but what,

146
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:57.760
what was happening was all the guys in the band, jumped in our car,

147
00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.400
our van and plowed through their car and took off.

148
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.840
And I can't remember how,

149
00:09:04.841 --> 00:09:09.280
but I ended up in the street in some ghetto street carrying this Indian clay

150
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.223
drum.

151
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.790
I looked like ever that movie carry the girl just covered in bull blood.

152
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.630
I was covered in blood for my head all the way down, all over the drum.

153
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:21.470
And I'm walking in the streets, trying to flag down a car.

154
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.190
The cars would slow down, see me and then speed away.

155
00:09:25.191 --> 00:09:28.910
Cuz I looked like a zombie or something. And then I realized,

156
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.710
oh man something. And you know, you're running sort of high on adrenaline.

157
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.220
I remember being very lucid &lt;affirmative&gt; and I went over to, uh,

158
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:38.700
some light.

159
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.820
I saw it looked like a garage where they fixed cars or house buses or something.

160
00:09:42.821 --> 00:09:46.300
And it was open and there was a man in a booth. And I said, sir,

161
00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:50.820
you have to call the police. Cuz I thought my friends now were getting beat up,

162
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.020
were killed or whatever. And I said, uh, you have to call the police.

163
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.490
My friends are in trouble. The guy literally looked at me and just said,

164
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.090
I'm busy. And I said, listen,

165
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.730
you gotta call the police right now. And if you don't mind,

166
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.490
I'm just gonna hide in this booth.

167
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.410
Cuz I think these guys might come back and kill me.

168
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.840
And so I'm kneeling down in this dirty garage

169
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.480
at two in the morning.

170
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.280
And the first thing in my mind is no one knows where I am.

171
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.120
My mother doesn't know where I am. Friends don't know where I am.

172
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.280
My band members don't know where I am.

173
00:10:27.281 --> 00:10:31.120
They could be getting killed and everything was so good today.

174
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.160
Like I had a great day and now it's over like a dream.

175
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.790
And I even had have these lyrics that were like, this world's like a dream.

176
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.550
It's not what it seems. We think it's solid, but it fades. I was like, I even,

177
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.390
and I sort of, my selftalk became a prayer and I started saying,

178
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.710
I really wasn't expecting to die tonight.

179
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:57.420
But that's what the dream is. It seems real. And now it's over her.

180
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.380
And I started to think like, oh my God,

181
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.460
I was in per I was sort of like in the state of like Soma,

182
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.660
when I was getting beat up, I was focused.

183
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.820
I was connected and I was chanting at that time. I said,

184
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:16.820
but now maybe my, if I got, I'm just trying to think my, my, you know,

185
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.650
boy scout first aid is like, I might have a concussion. My brain's gonna swell.

186
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.290
I'm gonna fall asleep. And then I won't be in meditation. And I started saying,

187
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.850
I said, I said, I started praying, sincerely Krishna.

188
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.570
I wasn't expecting to die tonight.

189
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:41.720
But you were so kind considering I'm not evolved to enter my

190
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.560
lips so I could just chant.

191
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.840
So please don't let me die with concussion. If you want to take me,

192
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:51.760
please take me right now. And with all sincerity,

193
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.720
I started chanting these prayers that I had memorized these very beautiful

194
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:59.040
prayers from a ancient book, but there were prayersgl you,

195
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.200
I focused a picture of C Krisna in my mind. And I started chanting these prayers

196
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.760
and then UN unfortunately I lived unfortunately,

197
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.120
cause I was in such a perfect ridiculous thing.

198
00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:14.670
Meaning I was at a that's how I would wanna die. Mm.

199
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.470
So there was no book. There's no teacher, there's no pilgrimage.

200
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.510
There was no that taught me more about my,

201
00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:28.750
my spiritual path and that, than that beat down day. Cause I felt like however,

202
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.670
close to dying as you can get as so close to dying,

203
00:12:31.671 --> 00:12:33.580
but I felt like you had accepted that. And,

204
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:37.780
and I had been taken care of like in that time of great tragedy, I've been,

205
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.740
I felt connected more than I've ever been connected and I wouldn't wish it

206
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:45.940
again. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but I'm, I'm so happy it happened.

207
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:55.890
<v 2>I.</v>
