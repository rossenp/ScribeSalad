00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.480
<v 2>Well, you're not just the UFC champion. You're one of the best champions.</v>

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.600
It's very, it's very unique to watch you fight because you are,

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.600
you're one of those people like Anderson SIL as prime,

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.880
where you've kind of cleaned out your division, you know,

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.390
and there's no disrespect to your opponents, but some of your P opponents,

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.470
when I'm watching you fight them, I'm not thinking, are they gonna beat you?

8
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.870
I'm thinking, what are you going to do to them? That's,

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.870
it's a strange position to be in where you're almost like

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.870
competing, you're competing against these women,

11
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.260
but your level is so much higher than everyone else else

12
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.620
in this 125 pound division,

13
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.020
that there's just not much there for you in terms of like,

14
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.380
Valentina has to fight this woman. There there's no fight like that for you.

15
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.460
<v 0>I think that, um, definitely this is one of my goals in my,</v>

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.850
uh, performance in my training. And, um, &lt;affirmative&gt; definitely,

17
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.850
this is like what I, um,

18
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.050
the idea of my fight style to be able to,

19
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.810
um, win the fight, made the fight, uh,

20
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.530
very beautiful from the technical side, very intensive, very like, uh,

21
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.920
just high level, all martial arts, but in the same time without do it, like,

22
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:30.560
dirtified like street fight just like different level when you can finish

23
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.560
your opponent without, uh, them touch you. Mm.

24
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.600
So this is kind of like, like ideally ideal &lt;laugh&gt; ideal.

25
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.390
<v 1>Well, you can see how you sometimes impose the opponent style</v>

26
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.670
on them. It's almost like you're challenging yourself.

27
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:50.990
Like the Jessica and garage fight, like in coming into that fight,

28
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.790
most people thought the only way she would have any sort of advantage at all

29
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:57.670
would possibly be grappling.

30
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.630
And so what did you do you out grappled her &lt;laugh&gt; like,

31
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:01.464
did you do that on purpose?

32
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.740
<v 0>No, no, no, no. Uh, I don't know.</v>

33
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.940
This is what I think it it's no &lt;laugh&gt; because, uh, maybe,

34
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.933
uh,

35
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.580
people just like was speaking about that so much so frequently before the fight.

36
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.180
Maybe it's just in my like mind and was there, but, you know,

37
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.460
I never felt that this is a,

38
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.810
a position dangerous for me since the beginning, since the like, I,

39
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.730
I know exactly, uh, uh, what is my strength?

40
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.970
I know exactly what is my power. Um,

41
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.770
that's why it's never was a doubt. Would I be good there? No.

42
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.850
Um, I know what I can. I know exactly, um,

43
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.120
what I have to be worry about what I have to worry about, um,

44
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.293
in the fight.

45
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.160
I ha I know that I have to be careful like to see everything because it,

46
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.040
some my everything can happen. You cannot just go there and say, okay,

47
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.920
I'm a champion. Everyone has to fall down, right? No, you cannot. You can,

48
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.240
you have to, um, be wild.

49
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.040
You have to be like a wild animal ready for anything. And, uh,

50
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.520
but in the same time, you just,

51
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.200
you cannot overestimate your opponent because you are overestimate them.

52
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.470
Uh, it's gonna be like not interesting fight. You're gonna be like, uh,

53
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.070
just candid, afraid of throwing anything. Mm. And that's why it's,

54
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.030
you have to find the balance. And the balance is everything where you are. Um,

55
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.510
like you can do whatever without any fear, but in the same time, very careful.

56
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.740
And, uh, um, I, I never,

57
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:44.380
before the fight put some like challenges, uh, for me,

58
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.580
would I be good there? Would I be good? Like, would I do,

59
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.420
like for my next fight,

60
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.820
I train myself for the different situation.

61
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.500
And this is what we are working like, and it's not just my work.

62
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.330
It's like teamwork, but a Valenti and Nina,

63
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.970
we all watching our opponents and we share what we think about them,

64
00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:07.970
what we have to be worry, what we have to work on.

65
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.650
And through our training camp, through trainings,

66
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.690
we just work on every possible situation. And even for example,

67
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.530
I saw some situation in the fight was happening,

68
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:21.880
like not with my opponent or different, completely different fight.

69
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.520
And we try this situation. We, uh, we try what, how I will,

70
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:31.480
what I will do, how I will escape or how I will finish from this situation.

71
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.560
So we just, um, getting ready for anything.

72
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.400
And this is what I think help me to, um,

73
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.870
take right decision during the fight,

74
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.990
because I don't have time to think about what I will do next,

75
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.310
what my technique will be next in the fight is everything happened like

76
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.493
instantly.

77
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.590
And I have to be sure that my brain and my body ready to

78
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.483
act.

79
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.940
<v 1>Well. It's very clear that you have a very well rounded skillset,</v>

80
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.220
but it's also clear that when you're faced with particular challenges,

81
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.460
your preparation for those particular challenges almost puts you in a situation

82
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:16.260
where you want to try, like the Juliana Penya fights a good example of that,

83
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:18.580
right? Like you shock the world when you arm bared her.

84
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.170
Every cuz everybody felt like if she had a chance to beat you,

85
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:24.770
it would be grappling. And you as a Mo Thai champion,

86
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.090
if you had a chance to beat her, it would be your striking.

87
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.730
But then when you submitted her, everybody was like, holy.

88
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.330
Like that was a wake up call for a lot of people that you are not just well

89
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.273
rounded,

90
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.690
but you are capable of finishing everywhere that you are lethal

91
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.653
everywhere.

92
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.560
<v 0>Yeah. This is what, uh, every time was in my training,</v>

93
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.120
my goals for the competition, uh, not just go there and compete,

94
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.080
but um, go there and win.

95
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.360
Doesn't matter what I have to do to win the fight.

96
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.960
I have to find the solution. I have to find the way to win the fight.

97
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.160
And every time it was like my mindset I'm I don't like, like, um,

98
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.200
this idea, just go and have fun in the fight. I don't like idea. Just,

99
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.360
uh, be there and like, um, just to experience the feeling,

100
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.750
I think for someone it's good.

101
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.350
But if you have like higher goals for yourself,

102
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.310
you have to put higher goals, like higher, like, uh, things,

103
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:27.270
what you're singing for this isn't my head.

104
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.150
This is what I had since the beginning that, uh, no, no matter what happening,

105
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.380
I have to find solution to turn the fight to my site and win fight.

106
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.420
And, um, definitely I was like,

107
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.900
I understood fighting in Mar mixed martial arts. I have to have more arms.

108
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.060
I have to have more advantages, like, um,

109
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.980
if we are comparing with, um, uh, other fighter, because, uh,

110
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.930
more advantage you have it's of like, um, in the war, right? Yeah.

111
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.170
Uh, you have a handgun, you have like certain, like percentage to win.

112
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.530
You have like, um, more like arms in your like position.

113
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.530
You have more percentages. So I want to have like 100 percentage, uh,

114
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.610
percentage to bean the fights. That's why I was training, like everything and,

115
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.400
uh, like training,

116
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.640
not just pretend to do technique,

117
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.560
but know how to make people tap after this technique.

118
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.040
<v 1>Yeah. So when you say more arms, you mean more weapons, right? You mean exactly.</v>

119
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.040
Yeah. Yeah. Just for people to watch the entire episode for free,
