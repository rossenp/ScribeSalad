WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 0>Well, I had a thing, you know,</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.000
we're trying to do this thing for veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Uh,

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.240
who've gotten sick from burn pits. Are you familiar at all with, with burn pits?

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.760
No. What is it? So in the Iraq war in Afghanistan,

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.850
I mean for this'll go back generations, but in Iraq and Afghanistan,

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.810
a lot of the, uh,

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.010
hire contractors to dispose of the detritus of war,

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.150
they would build these sometimes 10 acre, 20 acre pits.

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.790
Everything would go into them from a mess waste to hazardous

10
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:39.090
materials, to computers, to everything.

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.450
They light it with jet fuel. And they,

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.560
so now you've got guys that are downrange that are also down. I mean,

13
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:50.290
they're living, they're basically camping out onsite waste dump, right

14
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.883
incinerator.

15
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.960
So they come home and you're starting to see pulmonary issues,

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.280
cancer issues.

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.130
These guys they're dying and they're not being, it's not being,

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.970
they have to advocate against the government.

19
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.800
So we're trying to put together working with this, uh, teen coalition,

20
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.570
wounded warrior groups and people of BSOs and groups like that

21
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.630
to address this legislatively,

22
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:22.050
similar to what was done for the nine 11 community. Right?

23
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.910
So I thought, cause it's always about money. You know,

24
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.440
we always have money for war,

25
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.120
but we almost never have money to pay for what are the absolutely

26
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.670
could have seen coming a mile away consequences of what our veterans face when

27
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:42.420
they come back. Right? You don't take care of when they're, when they're out,

28
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.800
when they're out of sight, out of mind.

29
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.930
And so my idea was you have all these profiteers,

30
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.910
Raytheon, Haliburton, all these groups make them kick in 10%,

31
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.730
a contingency in war so that when these guys go home and the government

32
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.290
backs away,

33
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.150
there is money there to take care of what is the natural,

34
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.093
uh,

35
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.710
damage that's done to these people in the name

36
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:18.420
of fighting for our country so that they don't end their families. I mean,

37
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:19.920
these people have to become their own lawyers.

38
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.460
They have to go in front of medical boards and they have no support.

39
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:26.070
Their families have oftentimes caring for them,

40
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:30.390
whether they have health issues or traumatic brain injury or, uh,

41
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.370
you know, other kinds of invisible wounds. And they're kind of hung out to dry.

42
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.550
<v 1>Yes, not kinda very much. So, um, you know,</v>

43
00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:43.600
the UFC had a program back in the day where we were, uh,

44
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.540
working with the Intrepid center for excellence,

45
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.340
to work with a traumatic brain injury patients and to raise money for

46
00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:55.240
them. And we were doing this a UFC fight for the troops to raise money for it.

47
00:02:55.241 --> 00:03:00.130
And what got me sick was how, how is it that we have do this?

48
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.581
Like,

49
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:04.390
how was it that this isn't something that's taken care of in the budget clearly

50
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.380
in advance, you're blowing people up and you're, you're,

51
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.460
you're not preparing for people to come back injured. You're sending young,

52
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.750
brave women and men to die for their country or, or risk severe brain damage.

53
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:20.050
And you don't have enough money set aside to treat them when they returned.

54
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:21.180
I'm like, that's insane. I mean.

55
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.000
<v 0>Everybody thinks that soldiers come back and they've got healthcare for life and</v>

56
00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:29.400
they don't. No, they don't. You've got a five-year window,

57
00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:33.480
but if you get something that they deem was not service-related,

58
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.340
so you could have been sleeping next to an open air burn pit. Uh,

59
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.230
there's a guy in Texas where we work with his wife, Rosie and Libra Torres.

60
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.670
Who's literally like his case. Wouldn't be, they,

61
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.330
they denied his case in front of the Texas Supreme court.

62
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.510
<v 1>Yeah. It's evil people,</v>

63
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.440
absolute intention to deny healthcare.

64
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.550
And it goes all the way back to desert storm. You remember,

65
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.400
you remember the whole Vietnam.

66
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.440
<v 0>Still fighting the government over agent orange. Right.</v>

67
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.610
And still being denied, but yeah, hunkers.

68
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.901
<v 1>It's crazy.</v>

69
00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:20.800
And the depleted radiation sickness that people were getting from the Iraq.

70
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.380
<v 0>Right. And the guys that went, you know, that, that K2 two base.</v>

71
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.990
And I think it was, it was Becca Stan, and it was a toxic weight.

72
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.430
Like these soldiers literally had like irradiated taller on their boots,

73
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.560
sick as. And they can't get, you know, there's blue water horizon. There's,

74
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.820
I'm telling you like every inevitably.

75
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.300
And they're always told the same thing, Hey, we don't have a science yet.

76
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.540
You know, it's going to take us 20 to 25 years on the science,

77
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.780
but you do have the signs because you got the science from Vietnam,

78
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.410
like a jet fuel burn at the trade center.

79
00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:03.210
So like the science is in use that science like stop with these

80
00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:04.680
people and help them.

81
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.401
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:08.610
The jet fuel burn of the trade center is another excellent example of first

83
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:12.570
responders, right. That were terribly sick. And, and uh, many,

84
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:15.090
many of them died because of the fumes and, and,

85
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.080
and people in the surrounding areas. In fact, um,

86
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.150
Chris summers died of lung cancer and she lived near there. Yeah.

87
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.260
I don't doubt that it's related. It could be related, but it's many people did.

88
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.400
<v 0>Jim. Jimmy's a driver. He was a cop and he got really sick. I mean,</v>

89
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.350
those guys develop the, the pile cough like a day into the search and rescue,

90
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:42.300
but a job he gets sick and they kept trying to tell

91
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:46.500
him that a first it was in his head. And then it was,

92
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:51.180
it had nothing to do with where you were and working on the pile and nine 11.

93
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.680
And then they tried to say like, it's from snorting drugs, they

94
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.500
ruin this man's reputation. As he's dying, he dies.

95
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.810
They do an autopsy in his lungs.

96
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.210
Everything you could possibly imagine from a pulverized building,

97
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.750
as best as limestone Sinai, like, oh,

98
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.000
like it was an utter disaster

99
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.670
and they just keep fighting people.

100
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.200
And they're doing the same thing to these veterans now with, with the burn pits.

101
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.690
And it's, you know, the whole thing has just got to stop there.

102
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.730
There's gotta be a presumption, uh,

103
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.580
for these illnesses so that these guys don't have to fight so hard to get your

104
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.770
discipline disappear, your healthcare.

105
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.800
<v 1>I think along the same lines,</v>

106
00:06:38.801 --> 00:06:40.870
we're talking about reform of the police department.

107
00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:44.140
There has to be some reform of the healthcare system that deals with veterans,

108
00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:48.490
because it seems to be just this long history of doing it a certain way to save

109
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:53.050
the most money possible. And the idea that these guys are sacrificial anyway,

110
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.070
you know, they're sending them off to potentially die. If they come back alive,

111
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.870
we, you know, we do our,

112
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.220
they do their very best to not treat them and to not spend any more money on

113
00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:06.190
them. And it's, it's amazing.

114
00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:10.000
We have so many guys that are still patriotic that still want to go and do this

115
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.850
considering the fact that they're treated so poorly when they return.

116
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.370
<v 0>Yeah. And they lose, you know,</v>

117
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.340
listen being in the military is isolating in the first place.

118
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.090
It's just not that, you know, it's only less than 1%.

119
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:26.320
I think of the population put on top of that. When you get out, you know,

120
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.960
you're used to being with a unit you're used to that camaraderie.

121
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:32.620
You're used to, uh, all pulling for the same, you know, working as a team. Well,

122
00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:35.260
now you're removed from your unit and if you're hurt,

123
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.130
that's even further isolating, you know? Uh, and,

124
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.510
and in that moment to have to, then you're worried about your future,

125
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.980
your family's future. And in that moment, when you, when that's,

126
00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:50.560
when the government should step in and go, amen,

127
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.660
where you fulfilled your service to us, you sort of filled that covenant.

128
00:07:55.661 --> 00:08:00.010
We will fulfill that covenant to you. You know, we will send that, that,

129
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.630
you know, we'll do the right thing. Right. And they, and they do the opposite.

130
00:08:04.631 --> 00:08:05.470
They do the opposite.

131
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.820
It's some of the is so simple and fair and obvious.

132
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.980
And you do wonder, like,

133
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.340
how has the system become so corrupt and corroded that we

134
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:20.200
can't anymore,

135
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:23.530
as a people do the right thing,

136
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.910
just do the right thing. How did that, how did we get here.
