00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now, once you say it, stand up in podcasting.</v>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.900
<v 1>Really? Yeah. Well, podcasting is right now,</v>

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.850
it's emerging as a different beast. See, before people would joke about it,

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.120
they would go, what are you doing? Like Howard Stern's to make fun of it. Like,

5
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:21.420
why not just yell out your window? W w what are you doing? And, you know,

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.530
but he was coming from,

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.150
you got to think he's a pioneer and radio and traditional radio.

8
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:30.450
And he made his bones radio, and he carved this path and radio.

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.820
And then all of a sudden this thing comes along where anybody can do it.

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.683
That's a threat.

11
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.280
<v 0>It's a little bit of a threat. It's a little.</v>

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.791
<v 1>Bit of that,</v>

13
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:40.440
but it's also see in a way I understand his perspective because in

14
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:42.180
his day when he made it,

15
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.380
he had to compete against all these other killers. Right.

16
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:49.020
So you've got all these other morning guys, all over the country.

17
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.180
And then when he goes in syndicates,

18
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:55.470
so he'll invade Chicago and he's invading Los Angeles trying to take over,

19
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.720
take it over. But there was only a few slots, right? So you couldn't,

20
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.170
you couldn't listen to his show later. You had to listen to it then. Yep.

21
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.810
So everyone's competing during these slots.

22
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.430
So you have this slot that is 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM. That's drive time, baby.

23
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.530
<v 0>Even now he doesn't know podcasts. And I'm like,</v>

24
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.590
I remember I used to listen to Howard for a long time.

25
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.640
Probably like maybe a year ago they brought up something.

26
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.820
Cause he was on podcasting is to podcasts. There's even make money.

27
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.910
And one of the guys got on there, you know, I forget his crew's name. He goes,

28
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.720
I think Joe Rogan does. He goes and about what? Not, not tons of money.

29
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.220
Like he's not, he's not set.

30
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.020
I want to him like a long time listener first time caller. Well.

31
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.813
<v 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

32
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.890
<v 0>What, man. I just started. It was weird. Like, dude, you still,</v>

33
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:43.440
you still don't give it respect. Like you me.

34
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.240
<v 1>Who do you think he's hanging around with though? You know like his wife? Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.410
It's probably hanging around his wife,

36
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.010
maybe a few other really rich friends that are probably famous. I mean,

37
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:54.030
I don't know how much, but you've got to.

38
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.640
<v 0>Have your ear to the ground, being a guy in radio all the time.</v>

39
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.450
<v 1>When people get so famous, it's almost impossible.</v>

40
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.550
It's almost impossible to keep it to.

41
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.790
<v 0>You know what bummed me out. And again, I'm a huge Howard stern fan.</v>

42
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:08.220
I think you, and I think maybe I forget who sent it to me,

43
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.780
but I sent it to you when Howard stern, it released that to his employees.

44
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:17.380
He has like a, a yearly like meeting with his employees and someone recorded it.

45
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.690
It makes you feel so sick. Like, dude,

46
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.360
such a bomber. You realize how Hollywood is. You're all off. dude.

47
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.520
<v 1>I think people get seduced by it, man. I think they do.</v>

48
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:35.910
They get seduced by the idea of, you know, well, first of all,

49
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.600
you need friends. You need really good friends that are like you,

50
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.980
that are in your world. And I think one of the things that separates us,

51
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.270
all of us as comics from a rest of Hollywood is like, God,

52
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.640
we're glued to each other. We're glued.

53
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:57.060
And we on each other and we laugh and we compliment each other and we love each

54
00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:59.500
other and we call each other and we tell each other, we love each yeah.

55
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.500
A hundred percent full support. It's different, man. It's different.

56
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.600
We're a different thing. And no one.

57
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.490
<v 0>But also it's not a doggy dog.</v>

58
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.460
<v 1>Just trying to help dude. When someone murders it,</v>

59
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:12.160
everybody's running out of that room, telling everybody that heard it.

60
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.460
And when you see bill Burr, go on stage in the main room, we crush it.

61
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:18.900
You're coming out and saying it and I'm coming out and saying it and counts

62
00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:22.570
saying it. And we're all excited. Like, God, that was awesome. What a set? Holy.

63
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.020
And we'll talent people. You see beer crush it. Oh my God. He crushed it.

64
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.520
You know, there's a, there's a,

65
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.440
a love for the art and a love for each other.

66
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.750
And the, the, the comradery,

67
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.380
like the wanting people to be good.

68
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.640
You realize like it doesn't have to just be about you. And they, they didn't,

69
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.520
I don't think they, I think that's, you know,

70
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.950
we were talking about competition earlier.

71
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.780
We're talking about Jordan and Tyson and the crazy,

72
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.520
like that's Howard stern when it comes to radio, man. Yeah, you're right.

73
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.190
You gotta realize that that's the that he, he them all.

74
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.250
You heard them up.

75
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.340
<v 0>And you heard him apologize for it the way he treated some people. Yes.</v>

76
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.480
I think one guy commits suicide and he's like, I felt bad for that. You know,

77
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.550
you could see you'd go in. And he was like, at that time,

78
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:10.660
that's what I had to do.

79
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.590
<v 1>Well, that's what he did. Right? Whether he had to do it or not.</v>

80
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:18.640
That's what he did. No doubt. Yeah. It did work. And he felt like you had to do.

81
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.320
And look, he's also, we, we have to, everything you have to look into,

82
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:27.580
you got to look at it with perspective. And in my head,

83
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.590
what Howard Stern's always going to represent is the guy who paved the way,

84
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.120
like without him,

85
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.100
you got to realize there was nothing like Howard stern before Howard stern w it

86
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:42.700
didn't exist. You had Don IMS, who's kind of risque.

87
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.150
And then here comes this really tall,

88
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:49.000
long haired rock and roll type, dude. He doesn't give a.

89
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.880
And he just wants to have porn stars on.

90
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:56.770
And girls are riding vibrators and people are fart and songs in the microphones.

91
00:04:56.771 --> 00:05:01.220
It's madness. And he's getting sued by the government man. So the,

92
00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:01.990
the government,

93
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.740
th th they're coming down with these huge judgements against the company that

94
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:10.510
owns it. And he keeps going and he keeps go and podcasts.

95
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.110
All our, you know, Patrice used to say, like, Patricia,

96
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:18.700
say about other comics that like David tell David tells, got a lot of babies.

97
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.020
And what he meant is that there's a lot of other comics that would imitate David

98
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.721
tell they,

99
00:05:23.721 --> 00:05:28.510
they would do it just out of the fact that they were fans and they were

100
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:31.810
insecure and they're doing, they're not, they're not plagiarists.

101
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.440
They just were not that good yet. When I was young, man, I sounded,

102
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.460
I used to sound exactly like Richard, Jenny really heard myself on stage.

103
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.780
When I had been doing an open,

104
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.460
I caught myself doing like a bad Richard

105
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.510
Jeni impression with my material when I was like 21 or something like that, 22,

106
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.550
I was like, oh my God, I'm terrible.

107
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.700
Because I was such a Richard Jeni fan at the time that I was like,

108
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:58.910
mimicking him on stage and all the way purpose. A lot of comics do it, man.

109
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.440
We find ourselves doing it with different acts. Um,

110
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.010
I'll find my myself. And it's not that I'm copying.

111
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.580
I've a lot of mannerisms like Brian or Deleah because we're around them all the

112
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:14.210
time. Those are my I'm molded by that. That's my normal.

113
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.260
But then eventually like you,

114
00:06:17.261 --> 00:06:20.180
you break out of it and you become your own thing. Yeah.

115
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.130
We got to all realize that what Howard stern

116
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:29.090
did before anybody was,

117
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.320
he created this radio chaos.

118
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.220
He created this chaos. We had these, these people,

119
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.690
these whack Packers were out of their minds. And he would interview them and,

120
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.900
and, and talk to all these people.

121
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.430
That was the first one. And then remember yet celebrities on.

122
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.370
But he wasn't like, oh, how's your movie. He'd be like, who are you? Yeah.

123
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.010
And then they wouldn't answer it.

124
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:57.770
But then he would circle back and somehow get it out of it, dude.

125
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.760
It was a different world.

126
00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:03.710
Back then the world was different and he made it possible for people to talk

127
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:04.544
the way we talk.

128
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.200
And then Opie and Anthony were the next important phase because when Opie and

129
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:13.520
Anthony were, were a hang, whereas Howard is the man behind the switchboard.

130
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:15.030
And Howard is in control of his,

131
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.370
in his universe with Opie and Anthony people would just show up,

132
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.350
like, I'd be on the air. And it would be like four or five other comics there.

133
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.910
And we would, we would love it. And chip Jim notices all the time at the time,

134
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:33.470
Jim was a regular he's, he's one of the more unique comics ever.

135
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.940
He's a very interesting guy.

136
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.380
I love his love of transsexuals and how he just sees the way he

137
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.070
talks. He's just so honest and raw,

138
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.540
but what Opie and Anthony, where were the first loose hang? You know,

139
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:47.841
it was like,

140
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:50.660
Anthony would kind of be orchestrating it a little bit where he like keeping

141
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:53.120
everybody, making sure, you know, keeping an eye on everything,

142
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:58.070
making sure it didn't get out of hand. And then Anthony, is this a very,

143
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.860
he's a guy who grew up doing construction and that's literally

144
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:07.370
how he got into radio, but is also very intelligent, very inquisitive.

145
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:12.170
So he's got like a regular guy sensibility, but he's also very smart. Yeah.

146
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.500
And then he would have, you would have all these comics and then Norton,

147
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.720
who is a great comic himself would be there.

148
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:22.400
And he'd be Collin Quinn and bill Burr and me and Shaffir and

149
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.720
all those madness, man. It was nothing like that. Really? No non radio,

150
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.490
not radio, but that's what made podcasts become what they are.

151
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:34.490
Because like those guys, let comics just hang out and talk.

152
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.563
No one had ever been,

153
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.530
let comics just hang out and run the show before Opie and Anthony.

154
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.430
So the big steps to podcasting where Howard stern is the most important.

155
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:46.490
And then after Howard stern, these are Howard Stern's babies.

156
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.310
Howard Stern's babies are like Opie and Anthony were Howard Stern's babies,

157
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.320
but they became their own thing.

158
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.260
Just like a comic would imitate David Towl when he's a young guy.

159
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.320
And then as he gets older, he finds his own speed.

160
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:01.770
And there's a lot of comics right now that are like top level guys that are

161
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.870
better. If you watch them 10, 15 years ago,

162
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.000
they would sound a lot like someone else.

163
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.200
And then Opie and Anthony opened up the door to podcasting.

164
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.420
Cause they made comics where they could just hang.

165
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.710
And then everyone's got their own style. Like Ron Funches has his own style.

166
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.940
Eric Griffin has his own style. You and Brian have your own style.

167
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:25.830
Theo's got his completely union style. All of us have these different things.

168
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.150
Cigar has got his style,

169
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.340
Christina Palicki and him together have their style Sigora and Chrysler Chrysler

170
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.620
has got to stop. Are you going to style Burton Burr? Yes.

171
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.620
You have a great podcast too, but it's just like,

172
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.240
the world is more bountiful than it was back then.

173
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:47.190
It's not like Burt and Burr are competing against Bert.

174
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.050
Bert show was one was run by one production company,

175
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:53.880
but Burton Burr were run by a different,

176
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.180
and they're both going to be at noon and you have to listen to one or the other

177
00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:01.350
and Burton Burr in this argument. You've trader you know, you were, you were,

178
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.110
we, it was us together. you. And who, you know,

179
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.470
now they're going to take us out of noon. You know, that's that's,

180
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.620
that was what they had to deal with. It was a totally different dynamic.

181
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.270
Now it's a totally, it's like we were trapped in these tunnels,

182
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.010
fighting for air and pop and we got to the top of the tunnel and there's all the

183
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:24.630
air you want is free air free air. You can just put up a podcast,

184
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.730
put up a video, put up, put up, make a video, make a sketch sketch.

185
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:32.790
You can do whatever you want. And then it might get seen by a million people.
