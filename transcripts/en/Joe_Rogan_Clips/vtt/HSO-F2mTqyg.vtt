<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 1>Experience. Competition doesn't mean being mean.</v>

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.750
It doesn't mean people they're associating it and equating it with either

4
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:13.230
violence or aggression or, uh,

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.300
toxic masculinity.

6
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:18.990
There's all these words that kept throwing around for people feeling bad because

7
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:19.824
they lost.

8
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.030
But that feeling of feeling bad because you lost something is extremely valuable

9
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:27.060
in your life. And I don't want to say it hardened you because it doesn't hard.

10
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:30.960
You emotionally, you still are the same amount of emotional availability,

11
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.740
but you get, if you're accustomed to it. And I always tell people,

12
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:38.910
young men get involved in martial arts, especially jujitsu,

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.980
because you can do it and you're not going to get brain damage.

14
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.450
You get strangled a bunch,

15
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:45.570
you get your kicked all the time and it teaches you humiliating.

16
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.380
It teaches you humility. And then you learn after that, that you can get better.

17
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:53.280
And then eventually you become the hammer instead of being the nail. And that's,

18
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:56.610
that's something you can actually apply to your real life.

19
00:00:56.611 --> 00:01:00.960
You can understand that these lessons of failure and humility and

20
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.520
humiliation and just getting pummeled, like all that stuff pays off.

21
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.200
Ultimately, if you just keep showing up and that's analogous to life in life,

22
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:12.960
if you can just keep showing up and keep working hard,

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.670
you're going to have setbacks. You can,

24
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.210
but don't let them define you and you can move forward. But if you don't,

25
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.390
if you just like the world is toxic and we need to Nerf everything and,

26
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.600
you know, everyone needs a safe space while we're,

27
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:26.430
we're just going to make a whole island full of.

28
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.190
And we're in danger of doing that.

29
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.860
<v 0>We're definitely in danger of doing it.</v>

30
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:33.900
If it hasn't already happened in many ways. And like,

31
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:38.340
what you're saying is intuitively true, that hardship creates a stronger mind,

32
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.140
right? It's not just intuitively true. This is, this is in data. This is in,

33
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.090
this is in science as well. Um, and in, in a lot of psychological research,

34
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.330
you know, this is, uh, and, and we know it to be true. What it,

35
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:52.070
the reason I like,

36
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.980
I love the subject of psychology because it kind of tells us things that we

37
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:59.950
already Intuit to be true. And, uh, and it just makes sense. And,

38
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.960
and this is certainly one of those,

39
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:04.770
and there's a lot of studies that show people who have suffered deep trauma, um,

40
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.230
uh, ended up better for it,

41
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:09.840
as long as they're telling themselves the right stories. And so this,

42
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.250
I go into this a lot in my book, too.

43
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.580
You have to tell yourself the right story about that trauma. Uh,

44
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:17.130
you have to tell yourself that you are resilient and that you,

45
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.120
and that you are empowered to overcome it. That's,

46
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.320
that's a very important narrative that you have to tell yourself.

47
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:24.330
If you tell yourself it just happened to you and it's not fair,

48
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.380
and everybody's out to get you.

49
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.760
I wouldn't wish that psychological state on my worst enemies. I agree. Well,

50
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:32.880
maybe my worst enemy, but, but that's the point, right?

51
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:36.390
Like you would never wish that upon somebody you like, uh, and that's,

52
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:38.130
and that's, that's, that's an important truth.

53
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.060
I think we have to tell ourselves.

54
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.500
<v 1>When you were in the military,</v>

55
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:44.610
is this something that they taught you or is it something that you learn through

56
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:45.444
example?

57
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.710
<v 0>Uh, yeah, I think learn through experience. So, you know,</v>

58
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.380
the w the reason buds,

59
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.680
so buds is basic underwater demolition slash seal training. It is,

60
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:59.010
it is our six month trial by fire, um,

61
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.110
selection process that we go to become a sales, the very first thing you do.

62
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.540
And it's where you see all the infamous footage of GI Jane and hell week and all

63
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.150
that stuff. That's all, it's all first phase in buds.

64
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.730
And so I like how you brought up Gina Jane. Yeah, well, yeah, it is.

65
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.040
Yeah. It's probably the wrong example in hindsight, all the Navy seal,

66
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.180
because I can't think of any other movies that show buds, um,

67
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.960
now that you bring it up, actually lone survivor, the very first intro,

68
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:31.810
I think has some, but anyway, find it on YouTube. Uh,

69
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.660
most people know what I'm talking about, but, uh,

70
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.250
is DOJ is not a realistic movie.

71
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.920
It's one of the least realistic movies in every single aspect, uh,

72
00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:44.260
about the seal teams. But the point is, is, is that there is a,

73
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.410
there's not just a hardening of the mind that occurs from hell week.

74
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.790
It's like a, it's a, it's an,

75
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.880
it's an increase in confidence in a pretty excessive way.

76
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.320
Like if I can push my limits this far, imagine what else I can do. And, uh,

77
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.990
in that, and then you, and you continue to push those limits. I mean,

78
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:03.400
just even after hell week, you do it, uh, when you're kind of what we would,

79
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.860
what I would describe as controlled, drowning, and, uh,

80
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.240
in second phase where we,

81
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.990
where we learn to be super calm under water under the worst conditions,

82
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:14.110
meaning you can't breathe and you're about to pass out. Uh,

83
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.350
and you're still going to go through procedures in a very specific way.

84
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.620
You have to learn that, that, that calming. And then,

85
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.140
and you've pushed another limit and you've pushed another limit.

86
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.770
So bet that by the time we do get to combat, uh,

87
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:31.450
we've already suffered so badly in training that the combat doesn't feel all

88
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:33.070
that bad. And,

89
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:38.050
and we're ready to get your eye blown out of your head. Like I did, uh,

90
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:42.370
you're ready for that. Do you understand it? And it's, it's not surprising.

91
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.720
You don't react as, you know, in an emotional way when it does happen, uh,

92
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.670
because you've allowed yourself to be hard. And,

93
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:50.740
and you've told yourself the right story about that.

94
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.510
What is a traumatic experience hell week can be really is I broke my leg the

95
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:59.140
first time through I had to do it again. So, uh,

96
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.090
just a stress fracture that turned into a fracture,

97
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.560
and it just snapped at us while we were running with the boats on our heads.

98
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.400
So we run with these two or 300 pound boats on our heads.

99
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:10.690
They're basically the kind of boats you use in, um, river rafting. And,

100
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.430
but we run everywhere with them. Um,

101
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.050
I'm estimates and maybe up to 200 miles and just how weak alone. So, uh,

102
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.200
it's, it's one of the reasons older, older guys, you know,

103
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.100
maybe 25 and older have a lot of heart, a hard time getting a hold of those 25

104
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.060
because your, your body just breaks. You know,

105
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.790
our early twenties are probably the prime time.

106
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:33.190
Your muscles are developed about that time. Uh,

107
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:36.910
your bone structure can still handle the immense amount of punishment that it's

108
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:40.180
taking. And, uh, you know, except for mine, we call it, we know,

109
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.590
and then we'd make fun of each other and say, oh,

110
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:46.360
nice week genes you have there. That's why you broke your leg broke in.

111
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.790
How much time did you need before you went back to do it again? Uh,

112
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.650
six months I was rolled three classes, which, uh, which bone left tibia.

113
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.700
Okay. Yeah. That's a big one. Yeah. Yeah. It, um, you know,

114
00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.690
it was a daily.

115
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.150
<v 1>I just wanted to break to. There's not a lot of blood flow there. Yeah.</v>

116
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:04.250
It's amazing that you got back in there six months later.

117
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.580
A lot of times I know guy who broke his leg and he was,

118
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.130
he was up for a good solid couple of years.

119
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.510
<v 0>Yeah. And, um, and it was a risk because we weren't sure, I, I,</v>

120
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.960
the, frankly the command was getting impatient. They're like,

121
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:22.100
we're not going to let you heal anymore six months. Is it? So go for it. Um,

122
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.010
and, uh, you know, it, it, it, you know,

123
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:28.310
it's not like a compound fracture either. This is a crack in the bone.

124
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:32.360
So maybe in any case, it worked out just fine. But, uh,

125
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.120
it's a risky thing because I knew it broke. Right. I, I mean,

126
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:37.820
I felt that I rounded a corner and my adrenaline kind of took me through the

127
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:42.360
rest of that run. Then we sit down for lunch and I couldn't get back up from,

128
00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:45.080
from that seat. Like it was, it was the adrenaline worn off.

129
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:48.140
There was something bad, badly wrong there. And, uh,

130
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.870
there's always this question that the instructors will ask, are you hurt?

131
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:54.920
Or are you injured? Because there's a difference. And if you're just hurt,

132
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:58.070
because everybody is hurt, if you're just hurt, then you're just quitting.

133
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.040
Right. If you're injured, okay. We might give you another chance. Is that.

134
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.680
<v 1>Interesting? That's for the average person,</v>

135
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.480
that's such an alien thought alien question, are you hurt? Or are you in there?

136
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.750
<v 0>It is. But there's a difference. And there is a difference. Yeah.</v>

137
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.310
<v 1>Now, um,</v>

138
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.440
do they have any courses where they explain to you how your mind

139
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:22.940
works and how to overcome questions and doubts that, that creep into your head,

140
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.970
or they just they're teaching you through fire.

141
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.530
<v 0>Right. And we wouldn't want those courses, frankly. Um.</v>

142
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.600
<v 1>And you see all those, like online people,</v>

143
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:36.800
which you got to do is you got to face your fears and understand who you are and

144
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:40.160
it say, it's going to be okay to that. Does that drive you crazy?

145
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.400
<v 0>And it didn't drive me crazy. I don't mind that somebody is trying to do that.</v>

146
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:46.460
I say that we wouldn't do it because, uh,

147
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.360
the point is the point is that you're already, that person,

148
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.260
you're a seal before you got there. Okay. We're just,

149
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.220
we're just making you prove it, but you are already that guy. Okay.

150
00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:01.070
Because you never had a choice and a is another chapter of my book.

151
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:04.400
I call it no plan B. You go through this with no plan B.

152
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.120
If you ever thought for a second that maybe I can make it through buds.

153
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.040
Like maybe I'll make it through hell week. I hope I do.

154
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.270
You're not gonna make it right there. There's a choice there. You're, you're,

155
00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:14.960
you're, you're telling yourself that you actually have.

156
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.970
<v 1>A choice. I think that's with everything. Yeah.</v>

157
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.270
<v 0>It is with everything because I get it. This is plan. It's an extreme example,</v>

158
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:23.390
but it's certainly applies to everything. If you,

159
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.710
it replied to my run for Congress. Like if I,

160
00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:30.920
I didn't plan anything after the primary on March 6th, they just didn't.

161
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.800
Now you could argue that that was probably not a great idea.

162
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.250
Maybe we should have had some kind of backup plan. Well, it worked, but, but,

163
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.740
but mentally it was more of a mental state than it was like,

164
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:40.820
I don't have a backup plan.

165
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:44.420
I'm not saying don't have contingencies in your life. I'm just saying. And only,

166
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:46.790
you know, when you've actually decided to quit. Right.

167
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.953
Cause it's one thing to be like,

168
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.590
I have tried to be an artist for so long and I'm just not good at it.

169
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.010
And then you quit. Well, is it really quitting or is it just facing reality?

170
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.230
You're just not good at being an artist. You know that. So it's, it's different.

171
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:01.410
You have to distinguish between those two things. But you know, you know,

172
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:04.500
if you quit because you actually quit, you gave up on yourself and that's,

173
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.340
and um, nobody, nobody can really judge that for you. And I just,

174
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.190
I think that's an important lesson and that's how you make it through buds.

175
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.120
Cause you never had a choice.
