00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How'd you become that guy?</v>

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.360
<v 1>You know what? I grew up, not that guy. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:12.320
So a lot of people put a title on me. They want to, uh,

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.270
they see me now. They see me now as the guy that with his shirt off,

5
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.940
who can do 4,030 pull-ups in 17 hours,

6
00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:24.050
you can run tours and five miles in 39 hours who can do all this crazy.

7
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.580
But what they don't understand is they don't understand the journey that it took

8
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:29.750
me to get to this point.

9
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.910
And what got me to this point was I was just the opposite of what I am today.

10
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.460
I was that guy who ran away from absolutely everything I got in front

11
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:44.450
of me, but not many people knew that I had two people at the,

12
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.950
like the real me was like this very scared, insecure,

13
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:52.250
stuttering got beat up by his dad and all this kind of stuff.

14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.200
And I built this fake person that walked around, like my didn't stink,

15
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.100
you know, you know? Yeah. So that was, that's kind of how I did it.

16
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.830
And I do process of time.

17
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:06.530
I realized that I was lying to myself and lying to people.

18
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.390
<v 2>It's a fascinating journey though, because you are that guy now, right? I mean,</v>

19
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:15.350
you genuinely are legit. Bad-ass right. At one point in time,

20
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:18.530
you were a legit terrified person. Yes.

21
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.650
So what was the process like? How did, how did you step.

22
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.550
<v 1>Forth? Well, it's, uh, it's, it's a long process, right?</v>

23
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.510
Um, I, my dad beat the on me when I was growing up.

24
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.880
I was the first black baby born in this hospital called Miller Fillmore in

25
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:38.510
Buffalo, New York, my dad owned skating rinks. He owned bars.

26
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:43.190
He ran prostitutes from Canada to Buffalo, New York. My dad was a big time pimp,

27
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.050
big time, anything bad about a person, big time hustler. He was American.

28
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.430
You know, that movie with them, Danza, Washington, he was at, but not that bad.

29
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.910
You know, he wasn't that big, but that's what it reminds me of.

30
00:01:55.911 --> 00:02:00.260
He was that kinda guy and, um, beat the out of me, you know,

31
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.103
out of my mom,

32
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.400
there was an incident one time when my mom got knocked out on top of the stairs

33
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:08.390
and they drug her down the stairs by her hair and at six years old, um,

34
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:10.850
I'll never forget this in my mind.

35
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.620
I was always afraid my whole life. I was afraid, but I had this voice, this,

36
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.190
this conscience that would always be battling me saying, Hey,

37
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:22.730
you got to get up and do something. I didn't want to do. You know,

38
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.110
like I was just afraid, but I would, that, that voice would force me to get up.

39
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.220
And my dad, you know,

40
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:30.650
I tried to beat him up whatever at six and I get my kicked.

41
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.340
So this went on for several years and I have a big time learning disability

42
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.240
because my dad didn't believe in us going to school. So my dad,

43
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.180
it was about the business, the skating rink and the bar.

44
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.930
So the skating rink opened by seven o'clock at night. And this is when Tom,

45
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:48.830
I was able to walk. So about fi you know, four or five, six years old, eight,

46
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:52.910
nine. And I go to the skating rink at seven o'clock at night.

47
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.640
And I worked the skating rink until 10 at night.

48
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.970
And then we would scrape the gum off the floors and we cleaned the whole skating

49
00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.830
up.

50
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.790
And then my dad had an office and my brother and myself asleep in the office.

51
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.420
My mom would go upstairs and work the bar until three o'clock in the morning.

52
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.920
And then they cleaned the bar up.

53
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.090
So after all that was done with going to school, rarely happened.

54
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.230
So when I went to school, I was all kind of, you know, my,

55
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:20.230
my learning disability, I had social anxiety.

56
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.580
I was just a jacked up kid from living in this tortured home from the outside,

57
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:27.130
looking in, we lived in an all white neighborhood.

58
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.010
And then we would travel to the ghetto of Buffalo,

59
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.830
New York with a skating rink was at, so we, you know,

60
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.670
we worked around mostly blacks and I lived around mostly whites,

61
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.630
but no one knew what was going on in that house. That on 2 0 1 paradise road,

62
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.460
I mean, it's crazy. But, um, my mom got courage to finally leave him.

63
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.240
When I was about eight years old, we moved to a small town in Brazil, Indiana,

64
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.800
and that's when the real war started for me. And Brazilian is a small town,

65
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.690
great people, a lot of great people.

66
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.130
And I say that because a lot people get offended and I'm going to get to the

67
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:01.030
point where they get defended.

68
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.740
There was about maybe 10 black families at about 10,000 people in the town.

69
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.300
And in 1995, the KKK marched in the 4th of July parade.

70
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.680
So this was, uh, not everybody was racist. There was a lot of good people.

71
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.170
Some the best people I knew was there, but there's also a lot of racism there.

72
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.110
So me being one of the few black kids, net, you know, in the area, you know, it,

73
00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:24.760
it kind of haunts you. I had stuff in my notebook, you know,

74
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.810
we're going to kill you on my Spanish notebook. They had that on my car,

75
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.930
we're going to kill this is early nineties. And, um,

76
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.220
so even though I showed it didn't hurt me, it was jacking me up.

77
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:39.160
So all the insecurities I have when I was a kid with my father,

78
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.990
I moved into this area here and it just got worse and worse and worse.

79
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.730
And it haunted me.

80
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.470
And that voice that talked about it kept talking louder and louder and louder.

81
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.970
I would do nothing about it.

82
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.250
And I decided to make moves and I cheated all through school.

83
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.150
And it's, it's kind of humbling to talk with my stories sometimes. And this, um,

84
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.180
it's also embarrassing, but, um,

85
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.020
it's real is who the I am is what I am is what created me

86
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.790
and copy from the fourth grade to the two, to my junior year in high school,

87
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.930
on every assignment.

88
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.970
And I want to get in the military when I joined the air force and the guy gave

89
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:21.310
me an VAP test. It's like a watered down sat,

90
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.630
and I couldn't copy on it because it, Gabby Sammy had a test, a test B,

91
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.340
they got him a rainhead Tessie.

92
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.710
So I looked at copy on this test and I couldn't copy on it.

93
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.200
So I got like a 20 and I wanted to be an air force.

94
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.250
Pararescueman it's guys that jump out of airplanes and save down pilots. It's a,

95
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.020
it's a special operator in the air force.

96
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.930
And my score was so horribly low that as we take it again and he said, Hey,

97
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.970
I got an 18, the second time, even worse, I need to get a 50 out of a 99.

98
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.820
And so my mom and I, for a while,

99
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:54.940
we lived in the government subsidized apartments, $7 a month,

100
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.960
and also food stamps. And we slowly moved up to two or $3 a month place.

101
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.560
But at the time, you know, w you know, pretty poor, but, um,

102
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.260
my mom afforded enough money for me to go to see a tutor one, one hour a week.

103
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.710
So for four hours a month, it had six months to study for our last test.

104
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.490
I'm going to take the assets, you know, the aspect test three times. And I

105
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.370
studied my off and passed it.

106
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.130
And I got in the air force and realized there was more things in front of me.

107
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.330
I was afraid of water, terrify the water. And, um,

108
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.980
I learned how to swim,

109
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.150
but when it gets everybody in this training in all special ops training is the

110
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:35.570
water confidence where they tried to pretty much drown your. You know,

111
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:39.140
all of our lives we've been breathing and they take that from you.

112
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.330
And they want to see how comfortable you are in the water.

113
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.020
And there's only 1% African-Americans in special operations.

114
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.240
And I didn't know anything about African net.

115
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.710
Like a lot of them are negative buoyant,

116
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.490
which I am because of the bone density I struggled,

117
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.200
but I'm six weeks into the program. There was about 25 guys left.

118
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.900
I have about 150. I was there and I was never,

119
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.760
I didn't go to sleep for six weeks of the program.

120
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.020
And I wanted to quit so badly, but I quit everything in my life.

121
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.750
I copied through school. I wanted to prove people wrong.

122
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.660
And so here I am in this air force program,

123
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.900
starting to get a little more confidence, but this water was kicking my.

124
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.620
And six weeks into the program that doctor gave me a blood test.

125
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.550
And was that sickle cell, sickle cell trait, not the anemia,

126
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.390
but I still killed people. But so they pulled me out training for a week.

127
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.650
And when you go from being very uncomfortable in that water situation,

128
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.980
and then now you're comfortable and I'm sitting back watching the guys drown.

129
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.620
I'm not, you know, I'm not part of the activities anymore for this week.

130
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.380
I want to get back in that water again.

131
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.330
So the fear overcoming all my insecurities from my dad, from this small town,

132
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:48.440
from everything started coming back. And even though no one knew how up I was,

133
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:52.460
kind of created this other person who was tough. I live with this all the time.

134
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.660
So me not wanting to go back in that water. The doctor called me back up.

135
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.540
I thought I'd get like a, like a medical kick out the military.

136
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.810
So no quitting for me, they'll kick me out so I can have some pride.

137
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.000
The doctor said, no, man, we can, you know,

138
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:09.830
we could put you back into the training. And I was like, but after a week,

139
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.101
I'm like,

140
00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:14.090
you know what I missed one week there's only three weeks left is a good chance.

141
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:16.010
You know, I could tough this out and go on.

142
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.390
But I went back to the CEO and the commanding officer of the program.

143
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.740
And the Sergeant said, Hey, you gotta start from day one because you missed,

144
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.300
you know, that, that we could train him. And I broke. I broke. I, I,

145
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:31.580
I couldn't imagine going back through that again.

146
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.560
So I made up a lie and I said, man, the sickle cell things really scare me.

147
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:41.240
It was the water. It wasn't sickle cell. And I pretty much quit,

148
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.890
even though they gave me a medical, I quit. So, um,

149
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.250
from the age of 19, the age of 22,

150
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.420
I went into the job called PTAC P where you control fast movers behind enemy

151
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:56.700
lines. Cool job. But there's no, I was afraid of the water.

152
00:08:56.701 --> 00:09:01.350
So I avoided it and I gained 125 pounds in that timeframe.

153
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.220
I went from 1 75 to almost 300 to 2 97 was my heaviest.

154
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.650
And I started finding things that was comfortable.

155
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.440
And the more things I found comfortable,

156
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.150
the more uncomfortable my mind was because that voice I was telling you about it

157
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.890
always was there. I was just trying to avoid that conscience. I,

158
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.590
I wanted to be left alone from that conscience and it wouldn't leave me alone.

159
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.420
So I got out of the air force and I started working for a job called Ecolab re

160
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:29.910
spray for cockroaches at 24.

161
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.320
And I'm spraying at different steak and shakes, red lobster,

162
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:36.360
whatever from 11 o'clock at night, seven o'clock in the morning.

163
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.920
And what changed?

164
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.210
I came home and watched this discovery channel show class 2 24.

165
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.900
I came home from steak and shake. I sprayed it down last, get a big old,

166
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:50.730
large 42 ounce shake while cross the street and get a box of mini donuts from

167
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:54.450
seven 11. And now I drive home for 45 minutes.

168
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.620
This big old fat guy who, yeah, I worked out, but I was fat.

169
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:04.020
I didn't run didn't PT. I just hit the gym. So I'm driving home,

170
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.750
turn the TV on and what comes on discovery channel. So,

171
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:11.580
and that's where everything changed for me. I was taking a shower. I walked out,

172
00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:16.320
heard these guys and I watched a show and it made me reflect big time

173
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:20.490
on the piece of that I am in. I'm exactly what people said I was going to be.

174
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:21.830
So.

175
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.710
<v 2>So what was on this show that really struck home? It was.</v>

176
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.700
<v 1>Um, I saw these guys going into water, so I was terrified of it. I mean,</v>

177
00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:29.570
I can't even express,

178
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.040
have you had a big fear and a lot of fighters have fears and stuff like that,

179
00:10:34.041 --> 00:10:34.910
but they get over them.

180
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.370
But a lot of us have these fears that you just don't want to face. And, um,

181
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.240
I have a lot of them had a lot of them and that's what created the person who's

182
00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:48.650
in front of you today. And we'll get into that, but I'm just a scared.

183
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.880
It was what I was. And, but I was watching these guys going through hell week,

184
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.510
class 2 24, and these guys ringing the bell, quitting,

185
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.930
dropping their helmet down, rolling out a lot of guys just leaving.

186
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.320
And it made me reflect on my fears.

187
00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:06.890
My insecurities and I saw real men were,

188
00:11:06.891 --> 00:11:10.970
I thought were real men who were staying, who were overcoming adversity,

189
00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:14.300
who were overcoming all these different things that I had blamed.

190
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.980
So many people in my life. My dad, my mom for not being there.

191
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.420
When I was 14 years old, my mom was gonna get remarried to this great guy.

192
00:11:23.421 --> 00:11:27.380
He got murdered. And then I moved back to a small town in Brazil and,

193
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.780
and everybody was applying my learning disability, my, my skin color,

194
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.350
you know, me being everything. And so, um,

195
00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:39.920
I sat there for a while and I was like, man, I gotta, I, I got it.

196
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.670
No one's going to come to help me. No, one's going to come to help me.

197
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.610
This is me against me, period. And um, so I had to man up and I said,

198
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.160
of course it got started doing his face in every fear I have. And man,

199
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.630
what the it is. And these things would keep me up.

200
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.760
And I know one P people who are hearing this,

201
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.560
they will never really understand and grasp when you face these things.

202
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.620
And so many things, how they keep you up and haunt you at night.

203
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.960
I think there's a lot of people out there that know what you're talking about.

204
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.360
I mean, and um, so that's what it did. And I,

205
00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.630
I had two options to either be that 300 pound guy who sprayed

206
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:21.220
for cockroaches and made a thousand dollars a month. And at 24 years old,

207
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:23.410
knowing we're not 50 years old,

208
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:26.380
I can reflect on this and think about what guy I never became,

209
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.570
or I can totally just sack it up and fail and fail and

210
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:35.260
fail entire succeed. So I started calling recruiters up. I said,

211
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:39.610
I want to go be a Navy seal and every cruder. So there's a weight and height,

212
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.790
weight and height limit to get in the military.

213
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.680
And I was six foot one and 2 97. And I had a prior service,

214
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:50.980
which was a big deal. So I called all these recruiters up and all of them said,

215
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:52.450
Hey, how tall are you? Blah, blah, blah, blah.

216
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.940
They got into conversation and see if I was even qualified.

217
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.900
And by the time I got to my weight, uh, phone would hang up pretty much like,

218
00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:02.050
Hey, you know what, call somebody else. And they'll try to get in the reserves.

219
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.560
So I tried to get in the reserves and I call this guy named Steven Sal,

220
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.740
Joe recruiter up. And he said, Hey, come on in. He saw me,

221
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.630
put me through the weight standard, all this other stuff.

222
00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:12.400
And to get into the class,

223
00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:15.670
I had to get into how to lose 106 pounds in less than three months.

224
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.210
So I was like, that I can't do that.

225
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.820
I grabbed my chocolate milkshake and went back to Ecolab.

226
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.530
I'm going back to work, man. This is my life. So in this job,

227
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.480
you look, you know, you're looking for cockroaches,

228
00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:31.480
looking for rodents and stuff like that. And this next morning,

229
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.620
or this next night, I went to work and I hit the outlet.

230
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:36.963
Cockroach is too much.

231
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.740
I hit the mother load of cockroaches and this restaurant got full of

232
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:45.370
cockroaches and rodents and everything else. And I sat there and said,

233
00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:47.890
this is my life. I said, this is my life.

234
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:52.240
You are exactly who the this is it. And I said,

235
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.920
this ain't going to be it for me. So in that restaurant, I quit.

236
00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:59.320
My job left my canister in that restaurant.

237
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.910
My spray canister got back in my Ecolab truck and I went home

238
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.300
and I started working out like somebody. I was,

239
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.860
I became the most obsessed person on the planet earth. And I was basically,

240
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.900
I had to invent a guy that didn't exist,

241
00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:21.310
had to invent a guy that can take any pain, any suffering, any kind of judgment,

242
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.320
be called, be called,

243
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.560
whatever the in the world and be able to stay in the room and say, go yourself.

244
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:27.640
I had it built.

245
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.910
I had to build this callous mind and I built it through suffering.

246
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.690
I built it through downright, just crushing myself.

247
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.540
If it was raining outside three o'clock in the morning, if it was snowing,

248
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.130
the first instinct is don't go out there and do. My ethic was,

249
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.020
we gotta go out there.

250
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:49.210
Anything that was horrible in my life that I would normally say, no,

251
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.940
that was inhumane. And most people, I had to go do it.

252
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.870
And I started callous in my mind at this point in my life.

253
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.700
And I lost the weight. I lost the weight and I went back to recruiter.

254
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:05.960
I got into that class and I went through three Navy seal,

255
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:09.860
hell weeks in one year only guy to ever be in three hell weeks in one year.

256
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.280
To my knowledge, the first one, I didn't make it through the next two I did.

257
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.060
And um, that I just didn't,

258
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.740
I didn't stop anymore from there. And I started realizing through this,

259
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:26.660
to this process that the mind is what you created.

260
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.230
And I started opening different doors that I didn't think were even there.

261
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.260
They didn't think even existed in the more doors open up.

262
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:36.770
The more I started realizing that my potential is near endless,

263
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.220
and it changed my whole mindset.

264
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.890
So I went from David Goggins and I created Goggins.

265
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:48.620
And that journey is a priceless journey that is hard for meeting and explain to

266
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:51.650
people because it sounds so quick and easy that guys lost this weight.

267
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.210
And I went through three hell weeks.

268
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.940
I went to ranger school and went to Delta force, Lexington, whatever it is,

269
00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.650
it was brutal. It's a brutal journey every day. And it, well,

270
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.030
are you happy if anybody knows my life story and I'll try to give you a, uh,

271
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.420
just a snippet of it, where I'm at today is in front of Joe Rogan,

272
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:13.340
telling you my life to get through where I became to get through where I'm at

273
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:16.790
now. There's nothing but pride I have for myself that I can't really,

274
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.810
I can't really show people because I had this face and a space that they see,

275
00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:25.520
like, are you happy? What's wrong with you. I'm driven. I'm obsessed.

276
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.800
And that's what you see. That's it.

277
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.940
<v 2>People need to hear this story. This is a,</v>

278
00:16:30.941 --> 00:16:33.970
this is an exciting story for people because there's a lot of people out there

279
00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:37.390
that feel trapped and they feel stuck and they feel like they can't do anything.

280
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.260
And this is who they are. You're a guy who felt that exact same way,

281
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:46.150
but figured out how to not be that person and be a person that you would admire.

282
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.400
How did you, what were the first steps? Like you had some slips before, right?

283
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.530
Because you, you quit because of the water thing,

284
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.290
but then when you went back the second time and you decided you're gonna lose

285
00:16:56.291 --> 00:16:59.440
all that weight and you quit that job, did, did you,

286
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.130
was it just straight forward from there or were there's some days where you just

287
00:17:03.131 --> 00:17:05.740
failed and then you picked it back up again?

288
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.030
<v 1>My first run, when I decided to lose the weight, I was like I said, 2 97.</v>

289
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.990
I was about 32% body fat. And I went,

290
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.380
my idea was to run four miles from our first run.

291
00:17:17.381 --> 00:17:21.070
I didn't know how bad it's going to hurt me. I used to run before I was fat.

292
00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:24.610
And I was like, it. I can do this. I ran a quarter mile and walked home.

293
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.110
I walked home.

294
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:29.980
I sat on my couch and cried and went to my mom's house who was about 40,

295
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.490
about maybe 20 minutes down the road and cried and getting her cow saying,

296
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.740
I can't do this job. I don't know what to do.

297
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:40.300
I just got somebody pregnant. My life was as.

298
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.030
I was making a thousand dollars a month. My rent was eight,

299
00:17:43.031 --> 00:17:47.920
10 a month and my mind just kept with me and kept. You're not good enough, man.

300
00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:51.360
This isn't for you, man. These are bass on the planet earth. You're not that.

301
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.490
And, um, what it was, and it's kind of funny.

302
00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.030
I was obsessed with Rocky Rocky,

303
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.110
one in particular. And when I was a kid,

304
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:08.490
I come home every day and I watched this show Rocky and I would fast forward

305
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.060
with the little VHS tapes to round 14,

306
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.880
round 14, me up like nobody's business. Why this song came on. Right?

307
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:20.700
So when I bought the pull-up record, I listened to the song for 17 hours.

308
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:22.140
It's two minutes and 13 seconds.

309
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.600
And I'm able to visualize and dream

310
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.060
like nobody's business.

311
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.160
And I know that I can create a vision that many people can't and I work

312
00:18:35.161 --> 00:18:39.720
for it. So the vision I had was when Apollo creed beat the out of Rocky,

313
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.490
beat the out of him. He kept fighting. He was a dumb fighter.

314
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.260
Couldn't read couldn't. That was me. Couldn't read. Couldn't write, just punchy.

315
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:53.910
Everything about them and Rocky beat or. I mean, he wasn't a coronary,

316
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.620
but I was saying, stay the down.

317
00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.670
And him getting up him getting up.

318
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.070
Apollo Cree raised his arms up in the air, turned around,

319
00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:05.700
thought he won the fight. He turns around and sees this guy getting up.

320
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.240
And it was the face of Apollo creed that changed my life.

321
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.040
The face of Apollo creed. It was like, just by that, getting up,

322
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.910
not winning just by him, getting the up.

323
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.890
Apollo Cree was Mo who's his champ. He's the best Rocky had taken his soul.

324
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.270
Had literally taken his soul. His, his head goes down. He looks at him like,

325
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.220
who, what the are you? I want it to be that. Not Rocky.

326
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.470
I want to be the guy that people looked at. I don't give you black mirror.

327
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.440
Or didn't like, oh, I don't care. But it said,

328
00:19:37.441 --> 00:19:42.280
this is going to keep coming after whatever the is in front of

329
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.210
him. I wanted that. I wanted that.

330
00:19:45.211 --> 00:19:50.190
I wanted that worse than anything in the world. So that is,

331
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:55.620
I kept picturing me falling down and getting up in every to

332
00:19:55.621 --> 00:19:59.640
call me. I was dumb. Even myself, even myself.

333
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.940
I wanted to feel something besides defeat.

334
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:08.550
I want it to just go to distance and that going to distance pushed me to a point

335
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.650
of where now I go way past the distance. So.

336
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.330
<v 2>You go the first day, you,</v>

337
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.720
you run a quarter mile and then you walk back home and you're, you're upset.

338
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:18.710
How do you, how do you move.

339
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:19.280
<v 1>Forward?</v>

340
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.870
So basically what I did was I came home and I had a chocolate milkshake.

341
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.890
I sat down, I gave up, I said, this ain't gonna happen, man.

342
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:30.950
I gotta lose 106 pounds. And I can't even go a quarter mile.

343
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:39.110
I started being able to take negative and be

344
00:20:39.111 --> 00:20:43.630
happy. And this whole, I say, what if a lot, it sounds corny.

345
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.470
And it sounds weak, but it's true.

346
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.990
One of the recruiters said there's not many black Navy sales. Matter of fact,

347
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:51.760
I was a 36 African-American seal.

348
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.560
And history is over several years because the water, you know,

349
00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.410
I mean, people get mad at me. It's true. Just get over it.

350
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.460
And so I was like, Matt,

351
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.630
what story would it be? If my fat dumb,

352
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:13.480
lying to be friends with people insecure can overcome this.

353
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.590
And that would, if mentality like that, that,

354
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:21.610
that dreamer mentality just would always fuel me. It was truly, man,

355
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:24.130
what if I can be? What if I can be a seal, man?

356
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.520
W what if I can go from we're in a quarter of mile now,

357
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:32.740
now I run tour in five miles. What if I can go? Just, what if I can go?

358
00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:33.973
And, and what if,

359
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.660
how would that feel if I'm graduating kind of get at that graduation thing?

360
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.730
I'll talk about 2 24. I like the video.

361
00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:43.270
I sat down and watched this command officer stood up and he said to the

362
00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:47.710
graduation, um, gastro graduate, graduating buds, like 18 of them. He said,

363
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:50.200
we live in a society where mediocrity is often rewarded.

364
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.920
And he went on to say something about these men, detest mediocrity.

365
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.230
And I wanted to be a man that the test mediocrity it all.

366
00:21:59.231 --> 00:22:03.310
It got me a lot of trouble in the seal teams and going forward in my life

367
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:06.880
because I just, I started looking down on people for not going hard as.

368
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.560
And I started to create different things, but that's for a different day,

369
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.080
but I just believed that, you know, my whole life.
