WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.850
<v 0>Fuel for life. For example, we humans right now,</v>

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.030
we're under the influence of another end of the world.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.240
Religion looking toward a different kind of paradise it's called

4
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:17.220
environmentalism. And it says that we humans are causing climate change,

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.400
but that's, this is a little silly. We,

6
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.560
humans may be contributing to climate change,

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.600
but climate change has been the norm on this planet for 4.5 billion years.

8
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.910
<v 1>One of those sacred science subjects, that's almost like a,</v>

9
00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:35.680
you're not allowed to talk about scientific Jesus. Like you cannot question the,

10
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.960
the ancient squirrel and it's an end times belief system.

11
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.280
<v 0>Because it says the world's about to end because of things we've done because</v>

12
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:44.114
we've sin.

13
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.970
And if we simply sacrifice to the goddess of nature to gay,

14
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.690
um, the universal we'll go back to being a stable climatically,

15
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:55.880
stable garden of Eden. While I got news for you, this,

16
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.590
this planet has never been climatically stable in the very beginning.

17
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.160
It wheeled around its axis once every six hours.

18
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.890
That means that we pick any point on the surface.

19
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.450
It was in this poisonous stuff called radiation

20
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.650
for three hours. Then it was yanked into darkness,

21
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:17.090
which is equally destructive.

22
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.770
And the temperature would go up a minimum of 86 degrees, every whoops,

23
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:26.090
up and down, 86 degrees, every three hours that's climate change.

24
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.110
Plus it was on a tilt and it was rotating around the sun.

25
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.210
And as it rotated, the climate went through hideous changes, right? But.

26
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.430
<v 1>This is way in the past. And what people are concerned with,</v>

27
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.130
what our role in what impact humans.

28
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.250
<v 0>Doesn't matter. What we need to be after is climate state.</v>

29
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:47.120
If we really want the climate to be the way it wasn't 1650 before the industrial

30
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:48.710
revolution, that's a human choice.

31
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.620
That's bio genic in origin, and we need to acknowledge that.

32
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:55.910
That's what we have decided.

33
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.600
And now we're going to develop climate stabilization questions.

34
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.400
<v 1>What, why is it such a sacred subject? If you, what you've just said,</v>

35
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.970
even just questioning for a moment and saying that environmental ism is a type

36
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:12.110
of religion, climate denialist boom. You could be labeled with that.

37
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.310
And then people would love to break it down in a very simple one sentence

38
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:21.050
statement and call you climate denialists right.

39
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.510
Climate change. Denialist that son of a.

40
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.600
And then next thing you know what people will repeat that it doesn't have to

41
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:27.434
have any.

42
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.500
<v 0>Sign you any more for a book confronting.</v>

43
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.850
<v 1>Any complexity or context in, in what you're trying to say.</v>

44
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:39.220
They don't want the subtle nuance of what you're trying to express. Well.

45
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.340
<v 0>There's a blunt nuance.</v>

46
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:43.760
We have to develop climate stabilization technologies of taking carbon out of

47
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:47.720
the atmosphere is a carpet stabilization technology then so be it.

48
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.240
But we have to develop others because this,

49
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.770
this globe goes through ice ages and global warming. Okay. Do you think.

50
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.740
<v 1>The answer is in technology? Yes.</v>

51
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.330
<v 0>That's what the answer has always been for humans. I mean, why were we born?</v>

52
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.680
Look, we have this chemical in our gut called the cystic Keenan,

53
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.480
and it only goes off when we eat meat.

54
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.000
So we're built to eat meat and it's a bonding hormone, oxytocin.

55
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.900
It brings people together. Um,

56
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.540
so if you're having a good meat meal with a bunch of people,

57
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.200
this is a chemical linearity that says these are good people stick with them.

58
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.880
Don't tell the vegans this. Yeah, well, so how, why,

59
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.450
if we were born to meat don't we have claws.

60
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.690
Why don't we have ripping things? Why don't we have,

61
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.940
because we figured out a way to cook it because we figured out a way.

62
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.580
<v 1>To make clothes right out, a way to use skins.</v>

63
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:42.150
We figured out a way to figure out a way to isolate ourselves from the

64
00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:46.590
environment in terms of housing and control of fire. Got.

65
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.410
<v 0>It. And that means that we were born naked.</v>

66
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.360
We were naked apes for a reason because we are homo Tula

67
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.740
kiss, whatever that word would be. We are the people of tools. Um,

68
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.470
and we developed the first stone tool to the best of our knowledge,

69
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:05.460
approximately 3.1 to 3.4 million years ago,

70
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.590
long before we became modern humans.

71
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.050
So we were born in this peculiar way at that is naked and without claws

72
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.970
and without ripping things, um, after we developed the tools,

73
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.960
it took like fire and cooking, which you just cited, um,

74
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.760
to allow us to have artificial claws, artificial, repping,

75
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.640
fangs, to cook our meals. Um,

76
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.150
the big conclusion of a book that I've just read on what makes us different from

77
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:34.200
a neuroscientist.

78
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:38.190
She's the neuroscientist who corrected the standard figure for the number of

79
00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:43.020
neurons in the brain from a hundred billion to 86 billion by actually counting

80
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:47.340
them. She says, what made us human was cooking? Just what you said.

81
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.980
Um, because when you cook,

82
00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:54.570
you have you liberate a whole mess of calories and nutritive

83
00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:59.010
sources that are not available to a gorilla

84
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.910
that's eating leaves. And how do we know that?

85
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:07.740
Because the gorilla is born with a Potbelly, the size of a Franklin stove, um,

86
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.270
because it needs this huge digestive apparatus in order to handle those leaves,

87
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.690
to break them down into food, right? Well, when you cook,

88
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.020
you don't need that huge gut. Now the bacteria or the,

89
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:21.180
the ape is not able to go very far.

90
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:24.930
The gorilla he's certainly can't migrate once. You know,

91
00:05:24.931 --> 00:05:28.920
you see Jane Goodall and she is pleading for us to save the habitat of the

92
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:29.754
chimpanzees.

93
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.870
Have you ever seen Jane Goodall pleading for us to save the habitat of baboons?

94
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.980
Never the baboons or the rats of Africa,

95
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.720
baboons are extraordinarily adaptive. They're extraordinarily curious.

96
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.410
They're always finding new environments and figuring out ways to turn them into

97
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:50.370
food. Chimpanzees don't have that quality.

98
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:53.790
The reason we need to save their environment is because they're so dumb as a

99
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:58.700
group because the collective intelligence of a group of chimpanzees is so

100
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:01.400
low that now that they're adapted to one environment,

101
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:03.560
that's the only environment they can adapt to.

102
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.030
Whereas baboons who have smaller individual brains have greater

103
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:09.580
collective [inaudible].

104
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.530
<v 1>Do you see now baboons have domesticated dogs? No. Yeah.</v>

105
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:15.010
Yeah.

106
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.150
They divest domesticated house dogs and figured out a way to keep the dogs near

107
00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:22.510
them so they could be alerted to when some tutors are in.

108
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.790
<v 0>Amazing, crazy.</v>

109
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.500
<v 1>Kidnap these dogs and hold them hostage and feed them. Right.</v>

110
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.480
And the dogs just kind of learn to hang.

111
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.890
<v 0>Around them. Well, they're ideal hunting companions. It's very bizarre. Yeah.</v>

112
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.880
It's what we did once upon a time. And you could say very easily,

113
00:06:39.881 --> 00:06:43.720
it wasn't us who tamed dogs. It was dogs who teamed us. Um,

114
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.920
look how well we treat them.

115
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.740
<v 1>Yeah, here it is right here. So they hold on to these dogs.</v>

116
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.970
That dogs try to get away.

117
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.230
<v 0>Oh, is that a puppy and a shoulder? It's a puppy on the ground. Oh, I see.</v>

118
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.740
<v 1>And they, they eventually stay with them in these camps,</v>

119
00:06:56.741 --> 00:07:01.060
but they hold them hostage, look amazed, dragging this dog rise. Not killing it,

120
00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:01.894
not eating it,

121
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.040
but they have somehow or another figured out that if they keep these dogs around

122
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:09.700
long enough, the dogs will bark when intruders and predators are near.

123
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.320
<v 0>Crazy. Absolutely amazing really crazy stuff. But remember that was,</v>

124
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.130
we were just looking at baboons and baboons have a brain smaller than the brain

125
00:07:18.131 --> 00:07:21.610
of a chimpanzee. If you've ever seen a chimpanzee do that. No, no.

126
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.530
Chimpanzees are not highly adaptive.

127
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:26.590
What's the measure of intelligence ability to adapt. Yeah. Okay.

128
00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:30.010
So let's see how we measure the intelligence of bacteria.

129
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.730
Knowing that bacteria work in a group of 7 trillion and have a collective

130
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:35.200
intelligence within that group.

131
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.790
And they have a collective multi colony intelligence because they,

132
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.100
once they develop certain genetic tricks,

133
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.870
they pass the tricks around and little tiny envelopes for all practical

134
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:51.370
purposes. Um, so they're constantly sharing new bacterial tricks.

135
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.770
So we are told by the environmentalist, the new end times movement,

136
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.350
um, that we have used up all the resources on this planet.

137
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.060
We have vastly overburdened. This planet. We are eating it out of existence,

138
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.970
but bacteria are 12 miles beneath our feet right now.

139
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.070
And they are turning raw rock granite into bio stuff.

140
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.900
Now, if the task of life is to kidnap seduce and recruit as many dead Adams as

141
00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:25.360
possible into the grand project of life,

142
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:31.000
who's doing the best job right now who recognizes that for every ounce of

143
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:32.500
living stuff on the planet,

144
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.030
there are a hundred million ounces of dead stuff waiting to be kidnapped and

145
00:08:37.031 --> 00:08:41.530
seduced and recruited into the grand project of life bacteria.

146
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.790
Yet it, our bacteria nature, you bet your.

147
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.540
So what is nature telling us through these bacteria?

148
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.640
You have a hundred trillion, more ounces, yes. A hundred trillion,

149
00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:55.470
more ounces,

150
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.670
or a hundred million more ounces of dead stuff for every living ounce you've

151
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:04.470
got. And your obligation on behalf of life is to do what the bacteria are doing.

152
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.040
Kidnap seduce and recruit as many dead animals as possible and bring them into

153
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:08.940
the project of life.

154
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.580
<v 1>Use technology to stabilize the environment if that's what we choose. Yes.</v>

155
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.660
<v 0>And that is what we've chosen. And, but people are not regarding it as a choice.</v>

156
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:22.650
They're regarding it as something imposed on them by a higher force, right? No,

157
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:27.000
I'm sorry. Gay mother nature is not a higher force. Mother nature is a.

158
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.830
Mother nature throws every conceivable obstacle or path and she can't help it.

159
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.120
Why? Because our planet, in addition to the fact that we are on a tilted axis,

160
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.270
so we go through a climate change called summer, fall,

161
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:43.410
winter and spring every single year. And it's a pretty violent climate change.

162
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:48.600
And we have a planet that's been ice ballers snowballs twice and its history.

163
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.520
The fact is the planet is on a trajectory on a path,

164
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.361
on a voyage,

165
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:59.190
on a mission that is scarier than the mission of Frodo. The Hobbit.

166
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.240
It is circling the core of the galaxy,

167
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.140
approximately every 235 million years and Izzy,

168
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.070
as it goes through that long voyage around the center of the galaxy,

169
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.720
it goes through spiral,

170
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:16.530
arms of galaxies that change our climate dramatically.

171
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.510
It gathers something like a hundred trillion, tons of cosmic dust,

172
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.420
um, per year. And at certain points,

173
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.430
it goes through clouds of cosmic fluff that triple the amount of that

174
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:36.960
dust that we gathered, which changes the climate considerably.

175
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.830
And we go through a Milankovitch cycle. It changes the climate every 22,000,

176
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.710
40,110,000 years. Uh, not precisely,

177
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.990
but in that range. So yes, if we want to stabilize the climate,

178
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:56.250
take responsibility for your decision already admit that this is a

179
00:10:56.251 --> 00:11:00.720
biogenic decision and then go after climate stabilization

180
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:05.460
technologies. Yes. Try removing carbon from the atmosphere, see if it works.

181
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.800
But in the long haul,

182
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.460
we are on a 12,000 year passage.

183
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.520
And when school climate has been relatively stable, that's not normal.

184
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.040
The norm is rapid climate change, much more rapidly than we've seen.

185
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:25.170
And I sages and they alter. So we better well learn these things. Now,

186
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:29.130
when I was in Japan a few years ago, um,

187
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.670
in a conference about harvesting solar power in space and transplanting it down

188
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:33.504
to earth,

189
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.700
which is carbon neutral and a source of such tremendous amounts of power,

190
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:43.170
that defies description, there was a loan from the European space agency.

191
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:44.010
And she said, well,

192
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:48.060
if you guys are going to build these giant solar harvesting farms,

193
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.900
these five mile by five mile arrays of photovoltaic panels,

194
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.690
when you see a hurricane heading for Jamaica,

195
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.270
send down a laser beam,

196
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.920
lays the outer edges of the hurricane.

197
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:08.200
So that you've change the heat at a certain point on that hurricane and

198
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:12.550
redirect it. So it doesn't hit your Medica. So it goes harmlessly out to sea.

199
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.660
Well, that's the beginning of harnessing these things,

200
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:20.740
harnessing disasters as energy opportunities. Now,

201
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.410
have we ever done that? Well, what about fire?

202
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.710
If you'd been the first one to start playing with fire,

203
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:28.600
your mama would have told you, look,

204
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.870
you see all those dead animals in there that have been roasted and barbecued by

205
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:34.420
this forest fire. You want to become one of them,

206
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.460
put that back where it belongs and fire saved us, um,

207
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.690
at the heart of a jet at the heart of a piston and the person of a car.

208
00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:47.500
What do we have? Explosions, explosions.

209
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.090
That's one of the most devastating catastrophes. We can imagine an explosion.

210
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.590
It.

211
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.630
<v 1>Causes this very rigid.</v>

212
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.190
It's I don't want to say scientific dogma, but dogma,

213
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.840
in terms of the way you're allowed to talk about climate change.

214
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:04.770
Well.

215
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.790
<v 0>There are certain aspects of science that are religion because we,</v>

216
00:13:08.791 --> 00:13:12.900
science people are built with the same super normal responses in us that the

217
00:13:12.901 --> 00:13:14.940
flying saucer people have in them.

218
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.370
And that the Christians who still believe in the coming of the kingdom of,

219
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.370
oh God, you can't.

220
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.530
<v 1>Debate this. This is not something like, even I've said so far, is, is outside.</v>

221
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.910
Yeah. A little bit absolute Harris. Like people would get angry at.

222
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.890
<v 0>You. One person did, there was a, uh, an astronomer, um,</v>

223
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.670
who would go on up to Canada for God knows what reason he wrote a book on the

224
00:13:35.671 --> 00:13:39.780
evolution of the cosmos. I thought it was brilliant. My friend Eshelman Jacob,

225
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:40.800
my colleague,

226
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.220
who was the head of the physics department at the university of Tel Aviv and the

227
00:13:44.221 --> 00:13:46.830
head of the physical association, you know,

228
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.070
the association of all physicists in Israel,

229
00:13:50.071 --> 00:13:54.840
where they have some pretty good physicists said, oh, Lee will talk to you. Um,

230
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:59.040
he's very open guy. And when I got hold of Lee, I forget his last name,

231
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.340
but you would recognize it. Lee sent me a note saying, well,

232
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:03.450
it's a pleasure to meet you.

233
00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:06.600
But that article that you wrote in the wall street journal about climate was

234
00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:11.130
unfortunate. Uh, it was something a little harsher than that. Um,

235
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.440
meaning you have sinned and,

236
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.690
and I watched this movement develop from the beginning and it developed by using

237
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.890
conformity enforcers. Well then Al gore movie tipped it over the top.

238
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:24.900
It helped a lot and unfortunate.

239
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.590
<v 1>Truth that, that just people had. They realized they had, I mean,</v>

240
00:14:28.591 --> 00:14:30.590
if you want a virtue signal, you got to get on board.

241
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.980
<v 0>Well, um,</v>

242
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.180
what really put the environmental movement on the map was earth day.

243
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.680
And the guy who pulled that off really pulled off an amazing PR stunt.

244
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.500
That was just an astonishing PR stunt. And.

245
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.680
<v 2>That's what started off. Yes. Yes. Because.</v>

246
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.120
<v 0>In the 1950s, when I was the head of the program, Kemeny at my high school.</v>

247
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.190
I programmed in a guy who talked to us about what was being done to whales.

248
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.330
And the pictures were horrifying. The sky was a giant.

249
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:04.100
He was about six foot two. And, and in those days that was really, really tall.

250
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.760
And he was the most severe person I'd ever met.

251
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.370
He walked in without acknowledging me. I had booked him at all.

252
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.670
He had a frown on his face. That was unbelievable.

253
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.680
He walked out with that same serious frown uncompromising,

254
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.170
without saying goodbye, without saying,

255
00:15:23.171 --> 00:15:25.840
thank you without any of the normal social graces.

256
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.660
And he didn't have a name for what he was doing.

257
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.320
Conservation was the name of what he was doing back then.

258
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.340
And it was earth day that put another word on the map, environmental ism,

259
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.560
and that got environmental ism into first grades and second grades and fourth

260
00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:44.890
grades when kids are at an imprinting age when their brains are liberal

261
00:15:44.891 --> 00:15:49.750
relieving fashioned around some of the key things that they absorb at that age.

262
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.190
When we talk about impressionable,

263
00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:55.150
we're talking about a certain element of the morphology of the brain that wraps

264
00:15:55.151 --> 00:15:57.670
itself around certain things, and then never lets them go.

265
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.500
And environmental ism was built to get into the brains of young people and never

266
00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:03.334
leave.

267
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:08.470
And eventually environmental ism developed its own end of the

268
00:16:08.471 --> 00:16:10.210
earth scenario.

269
00:16:10.211 --> 00:16:13.990
It tried to develop one in 1968 when Paul Erlick,

270
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:17.500
who was a butterfly specialist, um,

271
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.450
said that by 1980, which remember in 1968 was 12 years away.

272
00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:27.370
So that's like my talking about something that will happen in 2030.

273
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.530
It seemed a long ways away. And he said by 2000,

274
00:16:32.531 --> 00:16:33.520
by 1980,

275
00:16:33.521 --> 00:16:36.370
we would get to the point where there were so many people on the planet that

276
00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:39.670
we'd have to stand on each other's shoulders. There would be no room for us.

277
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.140
We would vastly outstrip the carrying capacity of the environment.

278
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.840
Meaning the food supply would run out.

279
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.600
It would not be able to keep up with our population growth.

280
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.210
And as a consequence in the early 1980s,

281
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.420
people would die by the hundreds of millions in India and China,

282
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.920
and even the United States. Now, rumor back to those days, Joel,

283
00:16:59.921 --> 00:17:03.670
I don't know if you know the history of it. You were probably born after it,

284
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:09.010
but did remember all the hundreds of millions of people dying in India and China

285
00:17:09.011 --> 00:17:10.120
and the United States.

286
00:17:10.121 --> 00:17:13.240
Remember how your parents had to stand on each other's shoulders in order to

287
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:17.530
find room to live. I don't recall that you don't, I just what's wrong with you.

288
00:17:17.531 --> 00:17:18.520
I don't understand.

289
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.830
<v 1>So much like the apocalyptic cults, they moved the goalposts.</v>

290
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.990
<v 0>Yeah, exactly.</v>

291
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.620
And so now it's climate change and originally it was global warming.

292
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.250
And then they smartened up to the fact that they better cover their just in case

293
00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:34.090
we had an ice age instead of warming and glass.

294
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:38.860
Wat is the planet of global warming and climate change.

295
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:43.300
This one. Yeah. Big time. So they are right and they are wrong.

296
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.160
Right? We need to do these climate stabilization technologies.

297
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.960
We must, I mean, we've been doing them. You said it best.

298
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.380
We've been doing ever since we invented the fur coat,

299
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:00.180
which allowed us to get out of Africa and go to the forest ends of Asia.

300
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:03.540
When we were still far from being humans, modern humans,

301
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.040
that the technology of the cave and beyond that,

302
00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:09.480
the technology of the hot,

303
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.260
all these are climate stabilization technologies on a small scale.

304
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.700
Now we need to do climate stabilization technology on a big soul scale. No,

305
00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:21.630
that does not mean that we have to put software droplets into the atmosphere to

306
00:18:21.631 --> 00:18:24.480
keep the sun from warming the surface of the earth that we so stupid.

307
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:26.760
It's ridiculous. It's not a reversible move,

308
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.530
but if you have a laser for harnessing space,

309
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:34.590
solar power and you use it to redirect hurricanes,

310
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.460
you can see what worked the first time and try something different the second

311
00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:40.320
time. And the third time until you perfect it,

312
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.450
you can't do that with sulfur docks, the droplets in the atmosphere.

313
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.460
It's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard in my life,

314
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.450
but that's the first solution technological solution.

315
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.270
I'm out of all of the climate people's mouths,

316
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.760
but we need to do what they're talking about.

317
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.170
We just have to take ownership of it.
