WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I know you wanted to talk about Huawei,</v>

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.880
Huawei wa huawe, which I think is a really fascinating subject to me. Um,

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.840
and a lot of people that are tech inclined because they are at the

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.240
tip of the spear when it comes to technological innovation in the cell phone

5
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:19.800
space. Yeah. And I know that they're doing that with in,

6
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.590
in regards to modems and a bunch of other things as well,

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.990
but it appears at least,

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.430
and a lot of companies are exclusively using their 5g modems as 5g rolls out.

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.150
Oh yeah. Yeah. But it appears they,

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.510
they are involved in some serious shenanigans and they have deep roots with the

11
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:34.344
Chinese government.

12
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.150
<v 1>They do, they claim they don't, they claim look we're independent.</v>

13
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:39.230
We would never do whatever the Chinese authorities say.

14
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.230
Think about that sentence.

15
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.100
Think of about a company with the global reach of huaua

16
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.700
of that importance to the Chinese state. And think about them saying,

17
00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:52.540
trying to say with a straight face, we wouldn't, we wouldn't do, you know,

18
00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:55.140
things that the Chinese government might ask us to do.

19
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.260
<v 0>What a lot of,</v>

20
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.700
if you were a real Chinese company and you said that and you meant it,

21
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:00.300
they would shut you. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

22
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.770
<v 1>They'd be like, you won't you. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:05.250
You would not be in business for that long or there would be a change in the

24
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.170
senior management of the business. Right. Um, so anda always's been caught out,

25
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:14.010
they've been caught out in Europe, um, uh, to the,

26
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:17.970
to the degree where at a certain point you think Germany, uh,

27
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.450
and others that are, uh,

28
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.320
deeply involved with Huawei now in terms of the 5g infrastructure,

29
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.400
where they've just made this decision, look,

30
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:30.280
it's financially better for us to work with Huawei and we can set aside the

31
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.640
security risks. They're literally made that decision.

32
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.760
<v 0>That is, yeah, that was,</v>

33
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.320
I was reading an article about that very recently that they've just decided to

34
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:42.280
have some sort of a risk, uh, to reward conversation.

35
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.390
The, the risk is worth the reward.

36
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.430
<v 1>Right, right. And so, you know, that's,</v>

37
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:51.030
that's their calculation from a us perspective because we are, you know, look,

38
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:54.870
there's, there's two, essentially two superpowers now. Right. I mean, China's,

39
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.830
you know, um, advancing and, and, uh,

40
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.870
we're not the loan superpower on the stage anymore.

41
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.380
And so we are the number one target it. Um, and you know,

42
00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:08.580
our calculation has to be different. So we've been going at it.

43
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:11.060
And I know everybody, I, I think it's been, it's been pretty well covered.

44
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.540
It didn't used to be covered very well,

45
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.820
but it's been pretty well covered over the past couple of months.

46
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.300
And now what's happening is we've been in these trade negotiations with China.

47
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.140
And I think, unfortunately I think the current administration,

48
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.730
the Trump administration is going to, uh, blink.

49
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.530
And I think they're because hu Hui is such a huge issue for the Chinese and the

50
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:33.050
idea that we would prevent, um,

51
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.410
our companies from selling into or purchasing from or dealing with,

52
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.330
and that we would have, uh, sanctions on other countries that, that do. Um,

53
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.080
they view that as a threat to their own, uh, interests and their own future,

54
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.600
um, that Huawei is front and center with any trade deal. So they're looking,

55
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:56.360
they're not doing any trade deal unless we make concessions on Huawei.

56
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:58.560
And I have a feeling that Trump administration is going to make those

57
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:01.720
concessions because from a political perspective, they want a trade.

58
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.401
<v 0>Deal, right.</v>

59
00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:06.800
And so far they've actually said to Google that Google's gonna stop using the

60
00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:10.320
Android operating system for, for the Chinese phones, for waawe's phones.

61
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.960
At least they're gonna not let them license out.

62
00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:17.920
The so waawe' has actually been at least rumor to be in

63
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:19.750
production of the own operating system,

64
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.070
which would mean they would have to have their own, not just operating system,

65
00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:24.750
but they'd, they'd have to have their own ecosystem.

66
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.470
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so they'd have to have an app store.

67
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.070
They'd have to have all the, all the jazz that we have today. When you,

68
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.270
if you sign up for you, buy an Android phone,

69
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.790
you have access to the Google play market,

70
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:37.110
which is this huge resource of mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; applications.

71
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.510
And as soon as you take that away,

72
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.820
you you've gotta kind of rebuild that whole thing from scratch. Right. Right.

73
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:43.654
Well.

74
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.420
<v 1>Huawei doesn't lack anything in resources, you know, they'll be fine, you know,</v>

75
00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:48.120
because it's,

76
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.100
the state will provide and ensure that they have the resources they need.

77
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.660
They also, you know, we're the outlier here, right? I mean,

78
00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:57.260
we've been working with New Zealand and the Canada and, and you know,

79
00:03:57.261 --> 00:03:59.300
the UK to some degree, but the UK has been, you know,

80
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.490
kind of pushing back a little bit on this idea that we're gonna isolate Huawei.

81
00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:04.130
I, I don't think that's gonna happen in, so.

82
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.290
<v 0>They're using Huawei devices.</v>

83
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.170
<v 1>Um, they, they, to some degree, yes. Uh, they've been slower to adopt and, and,</v>

84
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.730
and kind of mesh their infrastructure with huawe's for people gear.

85
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.850
<v 0>For people don't know what we're talking about.</v>

86
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.370
Could you please just lay out what's the concern?

87
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.480
What do they think that huawe he is doing?

88
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.800
<v 1>Um, Huawei is essentially, um,</v>

89
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.160
what's it dude, the way to put this would be, uh,

90
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:34.440
imagine a communications network that spans the globe and,

91
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.200
um, Huawei builds, uh, and provides, uh,

92
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.950
year and certainly going into 5g. Um, they're a leading provider and cert and,

93
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:49.150
and then financially they, they can offer countries, uh, much better, uh,

94
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.230
deals than, than other providers, but they are a,

95
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.750
an intricate part of that communications web.

96
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.990
So if you imagine that Walway is a stateoned

97
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.300
entity and will respond to Chinese, uh,

98
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:07.180
authorities requests for information or intelligence,

99
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.060
that's passing through this communications web around the globe, our,

100
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.300
uh, our business communications, our military communications, um,

101
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.140
intelligence communications that, that all kind of go through at some point,

102
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.770
this interconnected system. &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,

103
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.290
that's the problem because they're essentially building back doors into that

104
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.650
system that allow them to suck, uh,

105
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:33.810
communications out of that network and use it for their own purposes.

106
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.290
It's a great intelligence tool, right. So if you think about it in a way,

107
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:41.770
basically, that's, it's a, uh, it it's a,

108
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.400
an advancement on the idea that you are wire tapping somebody, or, you know,

109
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:49.600
you've, you've created ability to intercept some communications, right.

110
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.240
They link themselves with the EU. Well, what happens?

111
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.560
We've got military communications, right. With the EU,

112
00:05:54.561 --> 00:05:57.360
our military talks to the EU military, and, and,

113
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.560
and we've got NATO concerns and everything. So if,

114
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.280
if there's an element in that infrastructure that touches in and has a door that

115
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.720
opens to some huaway gear, right. Then the danger here is, and theyve,

116
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:12.160
they've had back doors discovered in the past and then Huwe puts their hands up

117
00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:14.240
and go, oh, well, we didn't know that was there. Well, correct it.

118
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:17.270
And then it turns out they don't correct it. And then, you know, oh,

119
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:20.230
sorry about that. You know, they don't, they, they honestly don't give a. They,

120
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.470
I, when I say how aggressive they are in terms of sucking up information, I,

121
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.710
I can't, uh, overstate it. Right. And so this is,

122
00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:33.510
that's why it's a problem for us is because, you know, if we, if we convince,

123
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.900
uh, Australia and, and, you know, the five eye as nations, New Zealand does and,

124
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.220
and, and others not to work with huwei and then say, Canada, you know,

125
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:45.460
which is willing to do a deal. Well,

126
00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:47.740
we've got seamless communications infrastructure with Canada.

127
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.980
So all of a sudden the fact that they're doing business with Huwe,

128
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:55.020
but we're not, we're still at risk. We're still in jeopardy,

129
00:06:55.021 --> 00:06:58.370
cuz that information is still flowing to some degree where it's accessible to,

130
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.410
to hu Huawei and their ability to, to, to get at. So I, you know, again,

131
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:04.530
I don't, and I know people listen to that and they go, uh,

132
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.770
why is that of any concern? Well,

133
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:10.770
it's a concern because it used to be in the old days, it was a, you know, um,

134
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.410
it was us in the Russians Soviet union.

135
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.160
Uh Russias you know, they got the GDP of a EU nation.

136
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.000
China is, is on March. They, they, they view themselves in a certain fashion.

137
00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:26.880
That's why they're pushing out in the south China sea.

138
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:29.480
They've been building up their military. They've been doing deals all over the,

139
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:34.000
the world, uh, for rare earth minerals to, you know, to labor dose,

140
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.120
uh, access to Naval ports. It doesn't matter what it is.

141
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.190
They've been busy doing that because as they view themselves at the top of the

142
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:44.190
food chain, now, I guess we could say, well, okay, fine.

143
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.950
Maybe it's their turn or something, but I, that's not how I view the world.

144
00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:51.430
Right. I mean, we can either be on top or we can, you know, be sucking, wind.

145
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.030
And, and so it goes back to that.

146
00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:56.390
One of those early questions you asked is how much do we spend on defense?

147
00:07:56.391 --> 00:07:59.420
How much do we spend on, on Intel? How much do we spend? And, uh,

148
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:00.540
and whatever it may be. And,

149
00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:02.820
and I think the answer is that's where intelligence comes in.

150
00:08:02.821 --> 00:08:05.500
You have to know what the op what the hostile nation is doing.

151
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.380
You have to know what the competitor is doing. It's like in business.

152
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.300
And then you have to spend enough to stay ahead of that, right.

153
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:14.260
Even if it's a small amount, you gotta stay ahead. You gotta, and, and it's,

154
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:18.860
and it behooves us not to fall behind. Um, that's never a good thing.

155
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.130
I know we don't always do things right. But as a nation, um,

156
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.130
the world is much better off with us, um,

157
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.210
sort of at,

158
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.930
and this is gonna sound wrong to a lot of people they're gonna think, oh my God,

159
00:08:31.931 --> 00:08:36.690
that's terrible. But with us at the top, we're, we're more altruistic.

160
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.130
Uh, maybe that is, I don't know if that's the word or not,

161
00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:43.680
but I think it's a good word. Yeah. So anyway, so I that's, that's my view.

162
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.240
A lot of people say, but, you know, Hey, everyone's got different experiences,

163
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:48.320
you know? Well.

164
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.320
<v 0>Is there a way to detect, like when they release,</v>

165
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.280
say if they release a Wawe phone mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and which is a really,

166
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.920
it's really interesting that just a few years ago,

167
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.880
waawe was not even a major player by any strategy imagination.

168
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:07.040
Now it's the number two cell phone provider in the world, uh, past apple,

169
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.040
which is incredible when you consider the fact that they barely have a foothold

170
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:14.080
in the American market. They very few people buy their phones.

171
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.710
And if they do buy their phones, they buy unlocked phones from overseas. Yeah.

172
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.830
It's really kind of crazy. Um,

173
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.190
but is there a way where they could detect whether or not there is a back door

174
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.350
in these phones? I mean,

175
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.470
or is it something where they could develop it to the point where you really

176
00:09:29.471 --> 00:09:30.310
would have no idea?

177
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.470
<v 1>Um, no, we can, we, we stay pretty well. Mm.</v>

178
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.580
You know that you're you? Yeah. It's a good, it, it's a good question, but I, I,

179
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:45.500
I would say that, uh, as long as we continue what we're doing in terms of,

180
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.420
uh, counterintelligence and, and, uh, tech advances and efforts in,

181
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.100
in cyberspace and elsewhere, and certainly in communications hardware to stay,

182
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.210
uh, ahead of potential hostile activity, I think we're, we're okay. We, we, we,

183
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.690
we're good at detecting problems. We're good at identifying weaknesses in,

184
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.290
in these systems. Um, the problem is, again,

185
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.810
it's a global community. We can't isolate ourselves in terms of communications,

186
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.330
infrastructure just doesn't work. So if you know,

187
00:10:14.331 --> 00:10:18.600
it's like a chain and a weak link &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. See,

188
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.000
I gave you that analogy. Yeah. That's pretty good. Yeah. Thank you. I,

189
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.040
I made that up. You are the weakest link.

190
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.080
<v 0>You are exactly goodbye.</v>

191
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.840
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; so, yeah. It's I mean, anyway, but that's huawe and I,</v>

192
00:10:28.841 --> 00:10:31.320
and I do think that it, the interesting part will be, um,

193
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.360
what does the administration do in their desire to get a trade deal?

194
00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.350
Are they willing to blink on this? Because they, they put their foot down.

195
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.191
Right. Right. And now,

196
00:10:39.191 --> 00:10:42.310
because we're so dysfunctional here in the states from a political perspective,

197
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.510
now you've got people like Chuck Schumer going, well, you know,

198
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:47.390
Trump better not blink on this. This is important.

199
00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:50.350
So suddenly Chuck Schumer is a Hawk on yeah. He's a hard, you know,

200
00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:53.230
protecting us from, from, you know, Chinese espage right. And,

201
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.630
but simply because, you know, he sees as a political opening here, you know, if,

202
00:10:56.631 --> 00:11:00.180
if Trump backtracks on huawe now, Hey, good. From the Democrat perspective,

203
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:03.140
they can use that to bang on him, you know? And so, right, right. It's all,

204
00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:05.380
it all comes down to, to politics. But.

205
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.260
<v 0>But this is something that people didn't even understand was an issue like</v>

206
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.490
nationally,

207
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.100
this is something that no one was even aware of until a few months ago.

208
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.860
And when I started reading about it,

209
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.420
one of the first things that I was reading about was, you know,

210
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.850
kind of a technology nerd.

211
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.250
And so I was fascinated by some of their newest phones,

212
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:27.290
which were really far advanced to what you're getting offered in the United

213
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.920
States.

214
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.090
<v 1>Yeah. And, um, a lot of that, uh, ability to,</v>

215
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.130
to create in record time, um,

216
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.480
comes from theft theft department, intellectual property. Yeah.

217
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.720
And that's how they, over the years, again, that was a,

218
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.240
that was a collective decision by the authorities there that this is how we're

219
00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:45.840
going to advance. Right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; we,

220
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.400
they looked and they make a calculation that says we can't afford to wait

221
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.520
decades while we do our own research and development, you know? Well, let's,

222
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:54.560
let's just take it.

223
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.320
<v 0>And Huawei is not the only Chinese phone manufacturer. No, Mm-m,</v>

224
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:01.120
there's quite a few different ones over there,

225
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:02.960
but they're the only one that seems to be banned.

226
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.480
What's that other one Zomi well, there's, there's quite a few. There.

227
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.720
<v 1>Are, but Huawei has been because of their size, their,</v>

228
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.160
and their connection to the government, um,

229
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.630
because of the resources that the government's been willing to, um,

230
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.510
to provide to them, the advantage that they have, um,

231
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.230
and the speed with which they were able to kind of embed themselves into other

232
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.790
nations, uh, telecommunications infrastructure. That's why they're so important.

233
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.230
Right. But the general yeah. The, uh, you know, are there other companies we,

234
00:12:31.231 --> 00:12:32.310
well, of course, yeah. I mean,

235
00:12:32.311 --> 00:12:34.980
there's a variety of companies we should be worried about from that perspective.

236
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.580
And it's not, look, they'd be fair. I, I,

237
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.420
I spent some time on China because it's just, you know,

238
00:12:39.421 --> 00:12:40.820
they're the number one state, you know,

239
00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:43.780
sponsored perpetrator of th theft of intellectual property, but, you know,

240
00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:45.540
there's, there's other countries involved in it. So.

241
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.340
<v 0>They can't be entire cities, which is really insane.</v>

242
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.380
You seen that they have a fake Paris over there.

243
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.890
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I know. Well, you know, they've got you go some of these places and,</v>

244
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.850
and look, and Chinese history culture is, is fantastic. Right.

245
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:01.570
And I've been over there in times and I've just like marveled at how, how,

246
00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:04.410
you know, how interesting the people are, how friendly they are, how, I mean,

247
00:13:04.411 --> 00:13:06.850
they look, there's, there's a lot of wonderful things about China,

248
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:11.490
but I'm just saying the authorities, right? The government policy of, um,

249
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.530
no rule of law, of, of,

250
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.480
of the no protection when it comes to intellectual property,

251
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.880
all these things and their aggressiveness and stealing information,

252
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.520
that's the problem. Um, but China as a country is, is a fascinating place.
