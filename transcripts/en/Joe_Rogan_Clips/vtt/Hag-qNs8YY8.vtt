<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.600
<v 1>Experience. Against circumcision. You don't agree with that? Uh, no.</v>

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.200
<v 0>Really? Yeah, no, I'm cutting baby. I'm not like passionate about that. Are you?</v>

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.600
<v 1>Yeah. People lose their. A lot of kids every year.</v>

5
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.640
Do you know children die from that? Children lose their. Yes. All the time.

6
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.990
It's very common. Really? Yes.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.670
Like multiple children per year lose their penis from an

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.230
unnecessary antiquated operation where you cut off their to make it look

9
00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:31.870
different. Okay.

10
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:35.710
You're cutting skin off of their Dick and they wind up getting infected and they

11
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:38.310
lose their. It's I mean, it doesn't happen all the time.

12
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.350
Uh-huh &lt;affirmative&gt; but it happens enough time where you go, well,

13
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:44.260
this should never happen. This is a completely unnecessary operation.

14
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.140
Robert Baker has to BE2 hundred twenty29 deaths per year from circumcision in

15
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:49.850
the United States.

16
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.660
Bollinger estimates that apparently approximately 119 infant boys die

17
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:58.220
from circumcision related each year in the us

18
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.770
1.3% of all male neonatal from all causes.

19
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.890
There are several case reports of death in the medical literature.

20
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.890
Yeah. This it's not simple. You're cutting skin. Skin is an organ.

21
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.090
You're you, you have an unnecess and I'm circumcised.

22
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.210
You have an unnecessary operation that you're doing to an infant and it's

23
00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:22.400
decorative mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And I, I had a joke about it. Well, you don't.

24
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.240
<v 0>Buy any of the studies about how it prevents STDs and da.</v>

25
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.680
<v 1>No, no, I don't wash your Dick. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

26
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.240
<v 0>I cannot believe.</v>

27
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.840
<v 1>We're talking about this. We should be talking about it. Well, well, why not?</v>

28
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.743
Kids are dying.

29
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.800
Like it's like how many of them have to die before we say this is a

30
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.920
ancient, ridiculous ritual doesn't make any sense.

31
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.493
Okay.

32
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.950
I I've seen the arguments for and against like that. It prevents STDs,

33
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:52.550
like, look, you know, pre prevents STDs, condoms and abstinence.

34
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.070
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. That's what prevents STDs. And, and in some cases,

35
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.990
vaccinations, this is what prevents STDs.

36
00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:02.710
This circumcision is ridiculous. Doesn't even make any sense. Okay. Cannot.

37
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.100
<v 0>Believe I stumbled into this. Cuz I was talking about Andrew Yang. We up,</v>

38
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.620
I guess I did. I didn't know. This was like a strongly,

39
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.380
he you're antativactivist is that what.

40
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.900
<v 1>Their called? Yes. Whateveractivactivist that's a good way of put it.</v>

41
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.860
&lt;affirmative&gt; I've never heard that expression, but that's exactly what I am.

42
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.260
Yeah. Don't cut baby. It's real simple. When you say it that way people go.

43
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.260
Yeah, that sounds gross. When you say oh, circumcision like, oh,

44
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.620
what a wonderful ritual.

45
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.490
And it's symbolic of your journey until the outta here. You're cutting baby.

46
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.330
It's it doesn't make any sense. I mean, it's not as disgusting as, uh,

47
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.050
what they do to women's Clies in, in, in certain. Well,

48
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:38.690
that makes it impossible to like yes.

49
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.690
To have an orgas it's a different reason for doing it,

50
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.320
but it's you you're mutilating a kid. Does, is there in that community?

51
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.520
Is there acceptance? Is there open? Is it just about like,

52
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.760
they don't give a just as long as you're a real child. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, no.

53
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:58.120
It's um, yeah, when I came out it was super cool. Uh, nobody really gave me any.

54
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.880
Um, that's the best part about strong man. You know,

55
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.720
I know you had Rob overt in here. Yeah. Uh, not too long ago and even mentioned.

56
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.840
Yeah know, he's something, but &lt;laugh&gt; I love him. Um, you know,

57
00:03:08.841 --> 00:03:11.240
he mentioned just like the community of, of strong mans,

58
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.920
so is awesome because like,

59
00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:15.160
we all realize what we have to do to get to this level of sport.

60
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.760
And we all have to be a little bit of, you know,

61
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:20.150
sick and twisted in the head to look at a truck and get excited to pull it

62
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.070
&lt;laugh&gt; um, so yeah, when I came out, like nobody really gave a.

63
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.150
They were just like, all right. As long as you can still lift weights,

64
00:03:26.151 --> 00:03:30.110
we don't care. Yeah. That's uh, it mirrors the comedy community in that way.

65
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.150
For sure. Like stand up comedy community. Nobody gives a. No,

66
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.270
as long as you're funny and you're doing your job,

67
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.830
like that's all they really matters.

68
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.580
And we know some that are in the closet and we're like, come on, man.

69
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.460
Just no one cares come out. No, no one gives a. It'll probably be funnier.

70
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.660
Right. It's the more subject matter for sure. Yeah. You know,

71
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.340
not holding onto as much. It's easier to talk. Like, you know, when I came out,

72
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:57.500
just like, you know, the, you know, weight off my shoulders was, uh,

73
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.410
was unbelievable. What, how long was this? Uh, that was 2014.

74
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.970
So I was 22 years old. Oh, okay. Yeah. So I,

75
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.730
I was a late bloomer in the gay world.

76
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.650
Was it like when you were in high school and like when, first of all, when,

77
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:15.650
when do you know? You know, I don't know that I have, like,

78
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.010
I don't remember, like I never had like an aha moment per se. Um,

79
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.760
for me it was go going through high school.

80
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.720
Like I was involved in a bunch of stuff, you know,

81
00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:27.480
I was a cheerleader actually also played football, um,

82
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.800
was doing the weightlifting thing, like was class president.

83
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.640
So had my hands in a bunch of different pots, college,

84
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.000
super into everything as well. Um,

85
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:40.040
and really just focused on school and actually dated a girl for like a year and

86
00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:44.790
a half in college. In college. Yeah. Um, did you ever date a boy? No.

87
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.230
So, but did you like, oh. I wish she was a boy. I she's cool,

88
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.910
but &lt;laugh&gt; it was, yeah, pretty much, you know, it was, uh, it was,

89
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.990
it was more like a friendship than a relationship, I guess is the way to put it.

90
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.790
Oh, you know, like we were cool in everything and everything was going,

91
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.860
but like nothing else was really going on when you came out, was she like,

92
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.700
aha. Uh, that, that was the reason I broke up with her. Oh,

93
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.540
you came out because, you know, meanwhile, you know, I'm dating this girl,

94
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:15.780
but I'm watching gay porn when she's not around. I'm like this isn't right.

95
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.340
There's something else going on here. So did you like, was it gay porn,

96
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:25.290
like finding gay and we're like, that's what I like pretty much really. Yeah.

97
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.403
&lt;laugh&gt;, &lt;laugh&gt;.

98
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.810
<v 2>One of my best friends Mo he, um,</v>

99
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.450
for whatever reason,

100
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.410
this one night we were up on the roof drinking and smoking weed and

101
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.490
he, we got to talk in just about life and he was actually born with, um,

102
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.480
a heart defect. I can't remember the exact name of, uh, the disease that he had,

103
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:47.160
but he was in, uh, hospitals this whole life.

104
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.400
He was eventually gonna need to get a heart transplant. And uh he's like,

105
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:53.040
what do you wanna do with your life? You know,

106
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:54.840
I looked at him like he was asking me what, uh,

107
00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:57.000
what I want to do when I got to the moon. I'm like, what do you mean?

108
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.480
What do I wanna do with my life? And he is like, I was like, well,

109
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.560
I always wanted to fight and expecting him to laugh at me about this.

110
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.000
He was like, well, why don't you, like, why don't you do it? And, you know,

111
00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:10.920
I told him, well, well, I feel old already.

112
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.840
I was 18 at the time I already felt ancient then, you know,

113
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.230
and I told him all my reasons and all my fears and doubts and,

114
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:20.630
and all these things. He's like, you know what, man? He's like,

115
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:25.070
if anybody can do it, you can. He's like, I think you should. And, uh,

116
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.190
that really, that always stuck with me. I was like, um, maybe I can. And,

117
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.870
and in that moment, you know, I felt very motivated and, and wanted to do it,

118
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:36.870
but by, you know, continuing to drink and all these other things, I just put,

119
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.980
suppressed it into the back of my mind. And then about a year later, um,

120
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.540
he was in the hospital and, um, he needed to get a heart transplant.

121
00:06:45.541 --> 00:06:47.900
They basically, it was basically at that point was like,

122
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.420
you're gonna be here until you get one or you're gonna die. And, you know,

123
00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:57.340
I don't think any of us realized how serious it was or maybe we just didn't

124
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.210
who he ended up passing away, um, while he was waiting for the transplant.

125
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.250
And that just obviously devastated me to, to, to, to,

126
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.650
to no end.

127
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.490
And through that night through my drunken

128
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:17.050
coping, I was like, I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna go after this dream. You know,

129
00:07:17.051 --> 00:07:19.800
my friend, he didn't even get a chance to fail at a dream.

130
00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:23.920
And I'm too scared to even try for no reason,

131
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.360
just out of fear that that's literally my only reason not to do this other than,

132
00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:31.560
you know, financial and all those other, um, surface things.

133
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.880
But it really just boiled down to fear. And I was like,

134
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:38.160
you know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go after this for him. You know,

135
00:07:38.161 --> 00:07:40.790
he didn't get a, a chance to live. I'm gonna, I'm gonna live for the both of us.

136
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.150
But you know, unfortunately his,

137
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.670
his death sent me even harder down that downward spiral of alcohol and

138
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.550
depression. And three years later, I, um,

139
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.190
I just had a realization one day. I was like, if he was still alive,

140
00:07:57.191 --> 00:07:59.900
he'd beat the outta me for ING my life.

141
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.020
I've been wasting my life for 21 years because I'm

142
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.500
afraid, you know, I'm afraid and I'm, I'm too afraid to fail.

143
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.500
I'm too afraid of all these stupid reasons that,

144
00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:16.140
that all of us give ourselves in order to make ourselves feel better about

145
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.460
not going after things. But really they're just that they,

146
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.090
that they're just excuses. They're just things that make you feel better.

147
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:28.450
And they're. They're all. Almost every excuse we have is total.

148
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.330
Cuz there's people with those excuses and with all those reasons and more,

149
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.850
and they're able, then they do it. Like, what is your excuse?

150
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.530
<v 1>But was it right away? Like just, you,</v>

151
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.880
you walked into this L lions den of people doing Dr. Who was the who's patient

152
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.840
zero. &lt;laugh&gt; like who? Cause it was wasn't that many of you. Right? Well.

153
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.000
<v 3>I think that, I think that it, uh,</v>

154
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.960
it came to a culmination at the dinghol because we basically

155
00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.680
ran and owned the place and we'd stay there until I can't remember walking out

156
00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:03.720
there many times going, oh, beautiful. It's not even light out yet. &lt;laugh&gt;,

157
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.880
it'd be six 30 in the morning. Right. But we were serving drinks and,

158
00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:11.920
and half the people they'd be 10, 12 comedians sitting around and,

159
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.440
and four or five other guys and the other guys would call,

160
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.310
they were in there drinking with us too. Wow.

161
00:09:16.311 --> 00:09:19.390
So we weren't gonna get bused throughanything I mean, Kenny rod first got there.

162
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.390
He walked in the door there. He got there. I don't know how,

163
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.710
but he got there around two in the morning and there's six or seven of us.

164
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.830
You know, they either smoking joints, doing,

165
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.110
doing some wine drinking and more out on the stage, playing cards, you know,

166
00:09:32.111 --> 00:09:34.350
for money. And he go, he goes, what is this place?

167
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.693
<v 1>Paradise.</v>

168
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.900
<v 3>He had no idea. He goes, someone said, well, we didn want for a drink. He goes,</v>

169
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.420
well, who are the healer drinkers? And everybody goes, nobody you us though.

170
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.260
So then he'd get into other stuff. So, and he, he made up for lost time too.

171
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.620
<v 1>That was what we had always, we'd always heard about the ding hall.</v>

172
00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:55.970
Like it was like some legendary place, you know, when we start out it,

173
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:58.250
it closed in like 84 or something. Uh.

174
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.330
<v 3>I don't, I don't know about the, uh, maybe yeah, right around that.</v>

175
00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:01.970
Maybe a little bit.

176
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.650
<v 1>Later, someone I started in 88 and we had heard about the ding ho it was like,</v>

177
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.930
it was spoken in hush tones. Yeah. It was like, you know,

178
00:10:08.931 --> 00:10:09.770
that's where it started.

179
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.610
<v 3>Well, it closed in a hack Beate because the, the yo lost,</v>

180
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.480
lost the club and playing Chinese dominoes. No,

181
00:10:16.481 --> 00:10:19.920
he lost $240,000 in one night. And it was my night.

182
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:24.360
Then I had my show there on Fridays. I'd come in and I never saw, uh,

183
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.240
chains of padlocks bigger than that in the front and back door.

184
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.960
Never to be reopened as a comedy club. It became a, uh, Indian restaurant,

185
00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:32.794
something.

186
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.040
<v 1>This sport demands a different perspective.</v>

187
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.030
It's it's not the same thing as a ball going into hoop. No,

188
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.950
it's not the same thing as crossing a line with a football. No, it's different.

189
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.710
It's very intense and very personal. And it's also very dangerous.

190
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.230
And to, to play it off, like it's just a game. I, I just, I don't agree with it.

191
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:55.630
And I just think that we have plenty of people out there that understand the

192
00:10:55.631 --> 00:11:00.140
sport. There's plenty of '. Yep. But the thing about him is he's really popular.

193
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:00.970
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and Jamie,

194
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.340
when you saying he just got a giant deal or something like that big. Yeah. He's.

195
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.540
<v 4>The top paid con. I had his contract up.</v>

196
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:09.140
He's got like an extension to get like 8 million a year now or.

197
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.140
<v 1>Something like that. Yeah. And that's because he's,</v>

198
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.700
so his personality is so fun. It's,

199
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.540
he's a fun guy to watch and people love talking.

200
00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:19.050
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they love two people arguing about.

201
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.050
One person's better at arguing. And, and Steven,

202
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.650
a Smith is really good at that stuff, but it's not the place for MMA.

203
00:11:26.651 --> 00:11:29.290
It's just not the place. It's not, it's not the same thing. It's.

204
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:34.130
<v 5>It's not because, um, because the guys themselves can fight. Yeah. You know,</v>

205
00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:37.170
when you see what happened last night, what Kansas and Kansas state or whatever.

206
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.640
And they started throwing punches and it was like,

207
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.920
it looked like a bunch of girls throwing windmills.

208
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.440
&lt;laugh&gt; you know what I mean? Yes. Like that's really,

209
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.280
the reality of is like now if he wants to go out there and talk about it,

210
00:11:45.281 --> 00:11:47.160
go ahead and talk about it. He can say all the things he wants.

211
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:50.080
Cuz these are college kids that can't fight. Obviously we just saw. Right.

212
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.640
You know, but we're talking about professional athletes. They they've,

213
00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:54.200
their life has been around this craft.

214
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.280
<v 1>Yes. And now you're gonna say things like that. It's very disrespectful.</v>

215
00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:02.640
It's just so common with sports to talk about a guy who can't show up on game

216
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.880
day to talk about a guy who keeps dropping the ball.

217
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.040
Talk about a guy and you on those guys.

218
00:12:07.041 --> 00:12:09.520
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but it's just a different thing with fighting.

219
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.910
And it's also with fighting. Like you, you,

220
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.270
you have to know it or no one's gonna respect you.

221
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:19.070
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; if you don't know what you're talking about and you're

222
00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:21.350
talking about it in front of millions of people, like, man,

223
00:12:21.351 --> 00:12:24.750
that's a bad look for everybody. Yep. It's a bad look for ESPN.

224
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.950
It's a bad look for him. It's a bad look for the sport. It's like,

225
00:12:27.951 --> 00:12:29.910
there's other people that can do this. Yeah.

226
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:39.380
<v 6>The.</v>
