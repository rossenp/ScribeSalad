00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Hello, Hannibal.</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.660
<v 1>What's happening, man. Good to see you, my friend to see you too.</v>

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.250
It's been a while. Last time I saw you was in Thailand, it was in Tyler.

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.800
I was two years, two years. 2018. Yeah. Yeah. That was random.

5
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.960
That was very relevant. That's.

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.100
<v 2>So crazy to me. We had dinner hung out in Thailand. I was like, this is wild.</v>

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.940
Yeah.

8
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.770
<v 3>Yeah. At the, uh, it.</v>

9
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.520
<v 1>Was in Chiang Mai. Yeah. Yeah. I was doing more tired. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.151
<v 2>That's crazy.</v>

11
00:00:29.151 --> 00:00:33.710
So you just decided just up and decided I'm going to go there by myself

12
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.470
for several months. I just a month. Oh,

13
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.170
you went for a month and train more Thai. Yeah.

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.330
<v 3>I needed to, uh,</v>

15
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.540
I needed a reset after doing tag.

16
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.520
I wanted to kind of just reset my brain after doing so much press because

17
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.320
it was a lot of press and a lot of just, you know, repetition.

18
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.130
And so I was like,

19
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.950
I need to go do something extreme to get into a

20
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.780
totally different zone. What was that?

21
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.270
Have you ever trained more time before then? No.

22
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.600
What was it glasses the first day.

23
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:13.040
So I went and in Bangkok first I went to

24
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.410
class. I just went to one and then my camp was in Polecat. Ah,

25
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.240
and so the is all of the, all the gyms are outside.

26
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.340
So the warmup, I was drenched in sweat at night, 10 minutes warm up. I was like,

27
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.170
oh, this is, this is good. But it was, it was dope, man. It was just, it was,

28
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.860
it was nice to, I stayed on the camp for a little bit. So it was,

29
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.690
it was nice to just have that focus and live there and

30
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:46.250
be there and just, uh, work out and lean into it.

31
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:47.480
It was cool. How.

32
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.480
<v 2>Into it? Did you get, did you ever, were you ever like hit in the pads going?</v>

33
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.950
I think I should take a fight.

34
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.560
<v 3>Nah, no, I don't take a fight. I, uh, but it was, it was some times where,</v>

35
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.510
uh, my, my kicks I'm bowlegged at, so my kicks are weird.

36
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.150
So like doing a roundhouse, I wouldn't be able to,

37
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:08.960
so my elbows were decent in my knees.

38
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.890
And so some of the trainers, they call it, they started, uh,

39
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.140
that was my nickname. It was elbow.

40
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.930
<v 4>Elbow, elbow, but my kicks.</v>

41
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.510
<v 3>Will be so weak. They will be so weak.</v>

42
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.050
It just like hit the pad and they have a pitiful sound. It's.

43
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.440
<v 2>Not a thing that comes easily, especially, you know,</v>

44
00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:31.940
when you're in your thirties and you're just starting to train, like my tie is,

45
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.530
there's like th to move your legs like that. And that kind of dexterity,

46
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.320
it takes a while. It's a slow gradual build.

47
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.700
<v 3>Yes. The,</v>

48
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:45.110
the hips have to be looser and it was just,

49
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.940
but I'm also, bowlegged so certain yoga things that I can't do,

50
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:52.430
or even sitting Indian style, but you.

51
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.620
<v 2>Seem normal when you're walking around. How are you both?</v>

52
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.920
Because I know some dudes that are really bowlegged, my walk is a little.

53
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.930
<v 3>Bit, it has a little bit to it. And when I run,</v>

54
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.490
it gets really crazy.

55
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.930
I don't look how I think I look in my head while I'm walking.

56
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.200
I think the music in my head is dune.

57
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.240
<v 1>To do to them. But my walk is kind of broken. My walk is way weird.</v>

58
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.160
I look at on camera. Who is that guy? And what causes.

59
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.300
<v 2>Boldness? Is it a anatomy thing?</v>

60
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.340
<v 1>Mattamy thing. Yeah. It's going to stand up. So yeah,</v>

61
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.000
sorta my knees don't touch. So it's, uh, it seemed normal.

62
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.250
I'm not saying we're not crazy, but.

63
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.540
<v 3>It's just, it, it, it affects my roundhouse game, you know?</v>

64
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.650
Mm.

65
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.820
<v 2>I could help you with that. I guarantee you, I bet some stretches and uh,</v>

66
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.710
some learning how to do it slowly.

67
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.180
The thing about a roundhouse kicks and any kicks in general is, uh,

68
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.370
people try to do them like fast and you really want to learn them slow.

69
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.940
You want to learn, like you got to resist the urge to try to hit things.

70
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.520
What you really want to do is just go through the motion,

71
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:03.780
just go through the motion, just slow and do that for a long period of time,

72
00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:07.230
like many, many, many weeks before guys try to like,

73
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.760
and then you wind up kicking up and you put all the strain on your ligaments and

74
00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:15.330
your supporting leg. Cause you're not pivoting. They themselves.

75
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.770
And then it's hard to unlearn that. See one, when you learn something,

76
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.550
if you learn it wrong, like when I used to teach the worst,

77
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.450
students were students that learn something wrong. You would think like, oh,

78
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.200
I already have five years of karate and this and that. And I'm like, oh great.

79
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.600
This should be good. It was never good. It was the opposite.

80
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.560
You're better off taking a young kid with no experience at all.

81
00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:40.380
They can get way better, way faster, because they don't have any bad habits.

82
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.230
Because as soon as you get nervous or as soon as you get tired,

83
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:45.570
you go right back to your bad habits. You go back to your,

84
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.460
so you have to relearn everything.

85
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.690
<v 3>Yeah. It was, uh, seeing the kids.</v>

86
00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:56.250
I went to some of the fights out there and it's wild. Seeing the kids in a,

87
00:04:56.251 --> 00:05:00.690
in the undercard, where are you seeing? Seven year olds. Crazy. Right. Fight it.

88
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.650
Hey, this is wrong. But I got to see the main event too.

89
00:05:04.651 --> 00:05:06.790
So I can't leave culture. It.

90
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.810
<v 2>Is, it is, it feels wrong, but it's their culture.</v>

91
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:12.240
And it's also how a lot of the families make money. I mean,

92
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:14.580
they literally send their kid off to the camp.

93
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.510
<v 3>But I was all, I was trying to figure it out. And so it's,</v>

94
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:23.130
it's part of the culture. It's national sport,

95
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.670
but it doesn't seem, uh, you know, you have people, uh, it's,

96
00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:31.260
it's some, some fighters that are legends there,

97
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.620
there's the equivalent to Mike Tyson or something.

98
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.550
And you could probably get a private with them for 400 bucks.

99
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.230
So what's going on with the model over there

100
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.360
where it's been a national sport for a while, but it,

101
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:50.940
it seems like the money isn't there as it's corruption or what happened.

102
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.600
<v 2>Well, first of all, it's very inexpensive to go to the fights. You know,</v>

103
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:57.500
that everything's inexpensive in Thailand and I mean,

104
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.820
everyone is wearing flip-flops right. It's an interesting place. Like, um,

105
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.210
my friend, John lean par went there when he was a boy. Uh,

106
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.930
he was a young teenager and lived there, lived as a monk. You know,

107
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:13.440
he's a Australian multiple time world, Moya Thai champion. And he,

108
00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:18.260
he spent like a good deal of his time growing up there and really embraced the

109
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:21.470
culture. And he's like, they're just, first of all, it's the land of smiles.

110
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:23.180
Like everyone's, everyone's friendly.

111
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.860
Like one of the things I noticed they're like,

112
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.390
people are genuinely very friendly. There's very little materialism there.

113
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.350
People are generally happy with like wearing a pair of shorts. It's never a hot,

114
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.170
cold out. So you could wear shorts and flip flops.

115
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:37.520
And that's how everybody's walking around.

116
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.530
And I don't think there's a lot of money in the business. You know,

117
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:46.280
I think there's enough tanks. The king thinks it king takes a lot. Wait,

118
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.030
remember we took a picture in front of the king. We did got a picture.

119
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.990
I was like, I don't know if we should post this,

120
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.860
like you and me put smiling in front of a picture of the king.

121
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.430
Like you might get in trouble for that. There's weird rules over there.

122
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.280
The king, the king. I.

123
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.780
<v 3>Actually had a bit about him. I cut it. Not because I was scared,</v>

124
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:09.670
but just because it didn't fit, but it's about how he,

125
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.400
you know, you have to stand up, uh,

126
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.540
during the national Anthem and they play it at certain times during the day and

127
00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:17.950
they play it before the movies.

128
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.420
So I went to the movies out there to see ad man too.

129
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.100
And after the previews,

130
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.560
the king of Thailand's hype video comes on and everybody has to

131
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.770
stand up in the movie in the movie theater,

132
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.800
but it was the worst produced.

133
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.190
It was a terrible video.

134
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.000
I seen Instagram fitness models with better videos.

135
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.490
And the king of star is like, you're the king?

136
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.200
Get some king like production value. And I know top-notch editors. I don't.

137
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.570
<v 2>Think Thailand is known for its like films.</v>

138
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.400
He needs to get on Fiverr or something.

139
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.950
<v 4>I don't work for fiber vitals. Maybe lost.</v>

140
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.510
<v 2>All the money quippy. What's it called? Is that it Quimby? Yeah.</v>

141
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.063
Maybe get on that.

142
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.350
<v 1>No, no, he needs it. Cause he was you.</v>

143
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.100
<v 4>The king and you putting your stuff in a Marvel movie.</v>

144
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.990
<v 2>She that with his mistress, he had an official mistress,</v>

145
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.220
but she up and she got demoted. And so she had a, like a,

146
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.330
like bow down in front of him in front of everybody. Like she was talking like,

147
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.460
uh, the, the mistress probably wanted to be the queen.

148
00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:30.370
Like look at her there she's like begging for forgiveness. Oh,

149
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.720
my kid makes mistress lie at his feet and make her his, what does it say.

150
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.120
<v 3>As he makes our heads?</v>

151
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.730
<v 2>What does it say? There it's from the sun, but it's official.</v>

152
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.260
That was when she was the official concubine, uh, attended by his wildly.

153
00:08:44.261 --> 00:08:48.280
They were wife in all capitals. But Denny demoted her. This is,

154
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.790
this is when she became the official concubine. And by the way,

155
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:55.210
I think that was the first time anybody had an official concubine,

156
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.190
like a hundred years.

157
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.610

180
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.890
The Monarch even threatened to Sue Facebook over the startling shots taken in

181
00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:33.950
2016 by a passer-by who recognized the king?

188
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:50.990
<v 3>People,</v>

189
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:55.970
I saw something about someone got put in jail for liking a post

190
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.870
making fun of the King's dog. Yeah. I saw that too. Just

191
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:04.603
if he's in.

192
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.920
<v 2>That's just how he likes to rock it.</v>

193
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.300
He likes a tank tops that show his belly button. That's cool.

194
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.040
Yeah. That's I'm the king. Yeah. Yeah. He's the king.

195
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.700
If I was the king of Thailand, I dress like that too. you gonna do?

196
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.670
Yeah. You can get a lot of trouble for making fun over there. Yeah.

197
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.130
<v 3>Yeah. I guess we not going back. Well,</v>

198
00:11:28.131 --> 00:11:30.770
we probably shouldn't for a couple of years. Cambodia. It is.

199
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.040
<v 2>Man. I want to go see, uh, have you ever seen, um, let way,</v>

200
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.730
do you know what that is? No. That's like, if you think Thai boxing is extreme,

201
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.410
they take it another level.

202
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.640
Let's way they use headbutts and they kick you when you're down.

203
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:50.240
They do all kinds of crazy. Yeah. Nah, yeah.

204
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.730
<v 3>Kick the kicked while down this. This is, it looks it's too intense.</v>

205
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.830
<v 2>So we had David LaDuc who's the, uh, the king of left way.</v>

206
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.820
He came on the podcast. He's a wild man. He's a wild man.

207
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.870
<v 3>Yeah. I think about, oh, they're bare knuckle too.</v>

208
00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.990
Yeah. I just want some cardio there's no, that's.

209
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.290
<v 2>Okay. This is how they fight the bare knuckles.</v>

210
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.350
They just it's basically like Moya tie,

211
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.980
but way where more hardcore, like see that you can Nia dude,

212
00:12:22.981 --> 00:12:27.210
on when he's on his way down, it's just, it's way more hardcore.

213
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:32.790
It's like one more level of hardcore and headbutts a lot of headbutts.

214
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.440
Yeah, but they basically use all the techniques of more tie,

215
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.040
but they just take it to a totally different level. This.

216
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.750
<v 3>The second time I went, when I went to, um, Cole Savoy,</v>

217
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.660
uh, in, uh, last year and uh, his girl, I was seeing,

218
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.531
she, we,

219
00:12:52.531 --> 00:12:57.420
we go to a couple of classes and I didn't know she had done more

220
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.493
Thai before,

221
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:03.450
so we w we had a private and she was lighting the

222
00:13:03.451 --> 00:13:08.340
bag up with the kids. Oh no. I was like,

223
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.040
oh, and then I didn't get out there. And my bow legged kicks.

224
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.630
<v 4>Then the train is like, come on, you wouldn't do bad. Oh, no,</v>

225
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.850
let's not do kicks.

226
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:34.650
[inaudible].
