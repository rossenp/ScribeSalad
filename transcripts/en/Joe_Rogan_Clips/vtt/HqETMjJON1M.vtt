00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.310
<v 0>How old was Freddy prince when he died?</v>

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.300
I don't even think it's Freddie Prinze Jr. Related.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.250
<v 1>At all? Yes. It's.</v>

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.030
<v 0>His son. How old is he? 22.</v>

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.300
He was 20 she's half 22. Holy.

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.530
<v 1>You know what? I still remember my. Want me to tell you why?</v>

7
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:26.580
I remember that night specifically, because I had one on the way home.

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.780
It was so cold that I had to cut through the cemetery.

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.530
And when I was walking through the cemetery, I had to take a. I don't know.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.840
And I went in front of a casket.

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.700
The guy had been buried in like 1920. So I go, it. He's got no family left.

12
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:45.090
Right? It was freezing. Joe Rogan freezing.

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.240
I pull my pants down to my knees. I squat. I take a and I started.

14
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.150
And all of a sudden I got to get up, but I pitched him my own pants.

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.290
My pants were frozen. I had to walk home like the tin man.

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.020
The best went right into the pants.

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.890
And I walked in and my mother was there and I walked in with pee on me.

18
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:08.550
And she's like, well, what are we doing here? Like,

19
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.200
not going to kill another chicken. I can't eat this no more.

20
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.430
<v 0>Frozen all over his pants. What are we doing here is the funny. Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.060
<v 1>And every time I came home on an idea, my mother turned the Santa's real. Like,</v>

22
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:24.540
that's it. I got to call you a godmother. I can't handle this no more.

23
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.100
When I started dressing up like Bruce Lee and I had incense in my room and a

24
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:31.020
bowl of rice, she was going,

25
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.410
[inaudible] the white shirt that you folded. I bowed.

26
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.310
I learned how you use chomp steaks. My mother would go, that's it.

27
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:43.410
You got to go to your godmother's house. You got a problem.

28
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.150
Something's wrong with you. You're not Chinese stupid. You're not Chinese.
