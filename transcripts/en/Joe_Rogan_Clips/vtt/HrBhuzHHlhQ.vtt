00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Like you might find this hard to believe,</v>

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.360
but I never talked growing up.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.010
I was the kid in the corner and like girls would form groups and talk about

4
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.860
which guy they want to. And I wouldn't even be there like Dave,

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.110
Dave sitting right there. And they're like, yeah, he's not even,

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.910
he's not even on the roster. And I'm like, so I, I, I go, wait,

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.190
is this racist? Yeah. But what has it, how can I turn this around?

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.350
What it did for me,

9
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.650
the Asian superpower is if you're not seen and you're not heard and we're

10
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:39.600
seen as non-threatening, I can go anywhere. I can go anywhere.

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.050
And people open up to me. I've been to the Congo.

12
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:47.880
I've been to third world countries. I've been to every state in, in America.

13
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.680
I might be the most American person.

14
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.540
Like I've been to every state I've hitchhiked from the time I was 15 to

15
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.740
every state, every country. And I've talked and,

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.310
and because would a black eye be able to do that?

17
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.930
What a white guy be able to do that when people see, oh, that guy's Chinese,

18
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:11.190
he's like Jackie Chan or he's whatever they think they don't think that I'm

19
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:14.070
going to do anything or say anything, or I'm going to PR you know,

20
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.990
pose any threat. So they just open up and they say the most, I don't know,

21
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:22.980
like when I started hitchhiking, people said, no, one's going to pick you up.

22
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.590
Right? Like sixties, seventies, everyone hits.

23
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.900
And then something weird happened in the eighties where like,

24
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:31.020
you're going to get raped, kidnapped, murdered, you know? But I go,

25
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:34.650
I don't think so. I think if I put my thumb out and ask for help,

26
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:36.420
someone's going to give it to me. And with that,

27
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:37.710
I got to see the world for free.

28
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.640
I got to go everywhere and much,

29
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:45.720
like what, what happened was I would sit shotgun and, um,

30
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.720
I'm getting these free rides. And two things would happen either.

31
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:51.360
The driver has a long drive and they want someone to talk to,

32
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.340
or they want me to talk to them and something would happen in like

33
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:59.820
I'm in the car right now with a complete stranger. Anything could happen.

34
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.170
And the first hour is always small to how long you've been on the road.

35
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.090
What would you do? You know, it's all that kind of stuff.

36
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.600
Something switches when they know the rides about like,

37
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:14.130
I'm about to get out or whatever. I'm never going to see this guy again.

38
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.440
I'm never going to see this guy again.

39
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.380
So now we've been talking about new sports and weather for an hour.

40
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.960
Last 10 minutes. I my sister when I was 12. Whoa. Everything comes out.

41
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.620
So I've heard. Think about how many rides I've hit.

42
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.430
<v 1>And was he, he was 12. How old was his sister? I.</v>

43
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.350
<v 0>Don't know if it's eight. I mean, everything, drugs, incest, you know,</v>

44
00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:40.850
I killed somebody like murder, a guy called tomorrow.

45
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.090
Confessions really? I've heard the most insane.

46
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.820
<v 1>One at a time. Murder, confession.</v>

47
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.570
<v 2>I don't know if I should retell it. You definitely shouldn't be.</v>

48
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.270
<v 0>A guy confessed to me that he was thinking of raping me.</v>

49
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.910
When I stayed at his house. Oh, Jesus.

50
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.990
<v 1>Stayed at his house. You didn't just hitchhike. You hitch housed.</v>

<v 0>So, and, and, and here's the thing.</v>

93
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.420
I don't want to discourage people from hitchhiking. This is one weird incident.

94
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:52.440
That's happened in like 15 years of hitchhiking. So he's like, Hey Brian,

95
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.100
why wants you? It's your turn? Why don't you take a shower? I'm okay. I'm sorry.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.090
You're filthy. Don't you get in there? Take a shower. He's like, nah,

97
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.720
I'm all right. I'm okay. And I go, oh.

99
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.320
he's old. We can take him. If he tries anything, we're tired. We were so tired.

100
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.580
We're like, he's, he looks like he's. He was like falling asleep on his,

101
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.000

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.720
he's going to go to sleep soon. Let's just stay the night.

103
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.640
It's air conditioned in here.

104
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.130
And then let's leave first thing in the morning before he wakes up, like, okay,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.580
So we S we take the couch and I go,

107
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:38.480
let's sleep in a formation and let's take turns. You see,

108
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.780

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.840
I took the knife and I put thing like this, and I slept like that.

113
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.580
And I stayed up for the first hour and I see his, him walking around his room.

114
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.170
The lights are on, and I'm like, this,

oh. And then I gripped the knife and I go, this is it. This is it.

127
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.450
It's going to happen right now. And he just leaves,

128
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.703
he goes out the door.

129
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.350
<v 2>And I go, oh. Yeah.</v>

130
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.810
<v 0>And then I wake up, Brian, I go, Brian, let's get the out of here. He's like,</v>

135
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.440
He's not going to be back for a while. Let me, I'll just jump in and jump out.

00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:23.740
but he was standing right there and he's like, I'll be, I'll be quick.

139
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.870
So he runs in, takes a fast shower. We get our clothes on.

140
00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:31.630

I just went to those market to get some eggs for breakfast and like, oh, dude.

143
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.560
So I'm like, I have the knife in my hand the whole time I go. Uh,

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.240
like it's that, that, uh, thing where I I'm a people pleaser, you know, like,

145
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.970
I'll even put my own life at risk.

146
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.000
Like this guy went to the store and got eggs for me, you know? Like, uh, yeah,

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.530

It's just two guys running this whole oil rig.

152
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.220
And the other guy just talks about how much he hates gay people the whole time.

153
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.970
Not knowing that this guy is wow. And, um,

154
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.980
and then he just like, like, uh, like all the other times I've been picked up,

155
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.590
it starts opening up about how he was married.

156
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:29.250
He has a bunch of children and then he figured out he was gay. And uh,

157
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.640
and then he was like, Hey, I could see it. He, he knows we're on our way out.

158
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:35.430
He's never going to see us. Let's just let it on you.

159
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.060
You boys look so cute on the side of the road there last night. And it was like,

160
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.920
I was so like, I I'm so lonely. I don't get to, you know,

161
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.900
you don't know what it's like to be a guy in the deep south. And, uh,

162
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.370
man, I, I, when I came out this morning and I saw you guys sleeping together,

163
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.180
you guys on the couch, he looks so beautiful and perfect. And I'm like,

164
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.650
oh my God, dude. And then he says,

165
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.760
I thought about just, you know, if you guys wouldn't mind,

166
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:10.460
if I just touched you a little bit and I'm like, what the? And you know,

167
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.960
once again, I froze. I'm like, oh yeah, yeah. Cool. Yeah. So, um, so I said,

168
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.310
yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna leave now. So we just booked it. And then, um,

169
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.560
all of his neighbors were black.

170
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.830
Like he would have like in a black neighborhood and like the houses are on

171
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:27.990
stilts because of the swamp land and whatever.

172
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.470
And I don't know if he's done this before, but as we ran out,

173
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.550
like I heard like the kids laughing and they're like, oh Tom,

174
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:37.560
they're trying to do it again. Or, and I'm like, oh.

175
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.480
Like this isn't the first time like, of course. And, um, look, man,

176
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.380
this is looking for hitchhikers. I've hitched, hike all over the world.

177
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.550
And that was the only time. Right. And so I.

178
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.070
<v 3>Highly recommend. But.</v>

179
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.181
<v 0>Um, yeah,</v>

180
00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:59.100
what I was saying about being invisible is a lot of times people will

181
00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:01.920
do this or say, Kate, come back, go back to where you come from.

182
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.160
Cause they're like, this is not going to do anything. And

183
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.300
that's just not the way the world works. You know,

184
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:12.960
like someone was explaining to me the other day that no one ever wins a war.

185
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.240
And I go, what are you talking about? When we come in, we blow up.

186
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.580
And then we take the it's like,

187
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.650
if you look at Germany and Japan, right?

188
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.570
It's two countries that are very small.

189
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.580
You look at a globe and you look at how small they are.

190
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.280
These are two countries that are very tiny,

191
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.900
that have tried to dominate every country around them. And Japan has started,

192
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:37.860
you know, the Germany starts every world war, right? And so you're like, oh,

193
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:42.780
but we won those wars, but we drive their cars. Now we drive Lexus. We drive,

194
00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.800
they won in the end. And then you think of the soldiers that come home,

195
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.660
the PTSD, the drug addiction, the homelessness, it's like, look at our country.

196
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:56.170
Now it's like, did, did win. Like you won, like on the charts,

197
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.130
you look at the numbers. We took this town, we did this, we did that. And

198
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.120
when you with people, when you hurt someone, it stays with them forever.

199
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.130
Like it stays with them for a long time,

200
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.630
unless you have tools and different things to like work through those things,

201
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:18.280
which I I've been working on a lot, but yeah. Beat being,

202
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.560
oh. That's sorta racist that no one really thinks of me as a threat.

203
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.610
How can I turn that into an advantage? I'm going to travel the entire world.
