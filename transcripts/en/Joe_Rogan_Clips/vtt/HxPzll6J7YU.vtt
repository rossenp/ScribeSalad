00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. No, I wonder if, if you, if you run a lot,</v>

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.400
the inside of your knees gets accustomed to it.

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.240
<v 1>Like it gets a callous in there. Yeah. Well.</v>

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.160
<v 0>No like it strengthens. No. Is that.</v>

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.520
<v 1>Possible? Cartilage is wears away at some point.</v>

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.840
It's just not made to do that that much. I don't know if that's true.

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.000
Look it up. Baby cartilage is gone. How do.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.950
<v 0>Those a hundred marathon people, those dudes who run those ultra marathons,</v>

9
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.670
how do they do it? Year after year after year?

10
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.670
<v 1>Cause they can't do it their whole life.</v>

11
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:28.670
You do it for a chunk of time until your knees, your sketch shot. But.

12
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.190
<v 0>Imagine if it's just like, if you, if you're just a,</v>

13
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.710
it gets to the point where your knees are shot. But if you keep going,

14
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.630
you push through your knees, wind up, fixing themselves, your legs. Just break,

15
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.790
know you, your legs callous over.

16
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.231
<v 1>Well.</v>

17
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:45.220
It's like there's the was a campaign for a great cyclist called shut up legs.

18
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.380
You look up, shut up legs. It's like a whole thing about.

19
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.340
<v 0>People. Worry about running ruins knees, but a new study finds the activity.</v>

20
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.740
Main fact benefit the joint,

21
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.060
changing the biomechanical environment inside the knee in ways that could help

22
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.060
keep that could keep it work smooth, working smoothly,

23
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.410
carrying less weight to reduce risk for knee arthritis.

24
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.610
Come on running may be good for your knees. That's the New York times you dummy.

25
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.530
You don't know Jack's. Okay.

26
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.650
<v 1>Click on that. The failing, the failing New York times. Shut your mouth.</v>

27
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.530
The failing New York times. What are you?

28
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.530
<v 0>Trump lion. Ted crazy hill wrote it. Oh,</v>

29
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.400
who's lion Hillary crazy Ted many worry about my knees. New studies.

30
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.000
My decades of running. Okay.

31
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.800
There's a little evidence to support the idea in a growing body of research

32
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:30.280
suggest reverse &lt;laugh&gt; oh, this is click bait.

33
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.240
New York times got us epi epidemiological studies of

34
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.760
long-term runners show that they may,

35
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.120
that they generally are less likely to develop osteoarthritis in the knees than

36
00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:43.190
people. The same age you not run.

37
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.070
Sometimes scientists are speculated that running running may protect knees

38
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.190
because it is often associated with relatively low body mass carrying less

39
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:53.030
weight is known to reduce the risk of Neo arthritis.

40
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.790
It makes little evidence to that, that it ruins.

41
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.630
<v 1>Knees. Oh yeah. It's saying little evidence that a ruins knees,</v>

42
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:01.390
but it also says some scientists have speculated running.

43
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.980
So these there's no evidence. There's no evidence in proof.

44
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:05.620
They're just saying this is also a possibility.

45
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.230
<v 0>See, go back up to where it was. Oh,</v>

46
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:12.510
the widespread argument generally follows the lines that running will slowly

47
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:15.350
wear away the cartilage that cushions the bones and the joints and cause

48
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:19.350
arthritis. But there's little evidence support the idea. That makes sense. Okay.

49
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.590
Okay. So what I was saying, I was incorrect. I was,

50
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.020
I just tried to jump paragraphs. I missed the car context of it. Well,

51
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:29.460
that makes sense. Look, these guys that I know, this is what I'm saying.

52
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.900
These guys that I know that run all the time,

53
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.380
they have good knees and you would think they didn't these volunteer stop. Stop,

54
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.310
go back.

55
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.020
These volunteers visited a clinic where they had blood drawn from an arm.

56
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:43.740
The researchers also siphoned off a small amount of synovial fluid,

57
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.610
a lubricating that reduces friction inside joints from the right knee,

58
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.770
healthy knees contain only, uh, what is that word?

59
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.970
Soupcon soup of the stuff. I don't even know what that word is.

60
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.890
An arthritic or otherwise unhealthy knees tend to contain much more.

61
00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.520
Interesting. All right.

62
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.560
<v 1>Well, my knees are gonna be good. Hmm. I just Don you know,</v>

63
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:05.080
this is all speculative too. There's not enough resource supporting it too.

64
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.480
So who.

65
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.920
<v 0>Knows? Yeah. Well, it makes sense though, that your muscles would be stronger.</v>

66
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.040
And then that would probably support your knee better than a person who doesn't

67
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.073
exercise.

68
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.040
<v 1>I don't know. But that cartilage wears out either way. Anybody, you know,</v>

69
00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:17.560
that's a great athlete. They always say that a knee,

70
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.750
the knee cartilage you wears from so much wear into,

71
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:21.510
especially like jumping a lot, like yeah.

72
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.150
<v 0>Basketball. That's different. Like that's explosive plyometric type movements.</v>

73
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.990
It's not running like running is.

74
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.230
<v 1>Justt you're running. Yeah. But it also depends on what you're running on too.</v>

75
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.510
But.

76
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.110
<v 0>There's a difference between running it's like going left going right.</v>

77
00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:35.870
And cutting and exploding to left, you know,

78
00:03:35.871 --> 00:03:38.070
like a move that you would do on the court. Right. You know?

79
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.020
And then you're running on a trail where it's got some dirt.

80
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.913
You get a little cushion.

81
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.500
<v 1>Yeah. There's so there's some absorption there. There's.</v>

82
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.540
<v 2>This is a, that was from 2017.</v>

83
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:50.900
This one is more updated off of a new myth toppling new study that says that

84
00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:54.540
middle aged runners do actually rebuild the health of their knees.

85
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.860
<v 0>See, what did I tell you? GTO? I had an idea. See,</v>

86
00:03:57.861 --> 00:04:01.810
we'll see a myth topping news study of novice middle aged runner suggests the

87
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:05.330
answer is a qualified. What is the question? Again? Scroll up.

88
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.210
Could it be that marathon training and racing are actually good for our knees?

89
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.173
Maybe.

90
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.170
<v 1>&lt;Affirmative&gt;.</v>

91
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.090
<v 0>Another one of these new study. You son of a,</v>

92
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.890
a of novice middle aged runner suggests the answer is a qualified. Yes.

93
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.840
The study finds taking up distance,

94
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:24.640
running rebuilt the health of certain essential components of middle aged knees.

95
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.120
Even if the joint starts off somewhat tattered and worn. What I tell you,

96
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.200
show me the studies. But the results also contain a caution marathon.

97
00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:38.040
Mileage could erode one vulnerable area within the knee. The study fines,

98
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.520
if runners are not careful, but we won't.

99
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.400
<v 1>Wanna talk about that because this sounds.</v>

100
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.350
<v 0>Is about, but what is that vulnerable part?</v>

101
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.430
<v 1>That's what I'm saying. That's what they do that they bury it.</v>

102
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.870
<v 0>Stop complaining like Chicago person scroll down. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

103
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.110
<v 2>I have the study. I was gonna check that.</v>

104
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.990
<v 0>But what does it say? There was a one area.</v>

105
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.950
<v 2>It said that's what I was gonna check in the study. If it, well.</v>

106
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.710
<v 0>Just scroll down. I'm sure. It'll tell us. Oh.</v>

107
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.630
<v 2>They're going on. Other studies done here. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; other one.</v>

108
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.550
Must I study another.

109
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.740
<v 0>Study? What is it saying? What part of the knee focus on running activity?</v>

110
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.500
Harms knees. Do you do scroll down? The question is Hmm.

111
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.340
Is that the end of it? No. No. It just keeps going. Why do they do that?

112
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.860
When they break.

113
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.860
<v 1>Things up with, I can't.</v>

114
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.380
<v 0>Stand that. You have one free article remaining. Right? Subscribe. Okay. What,</v>

115
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.500
what is the problem with the injury? I'll check. What is okay.

116
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.890
All find the one I would imagine cartilage is the big issue. Um,

117
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.250
and meniscus. When meniscus goes, if it gets blown out, then you're done. Yeah.

118
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.770
Like if you twist your knee and you cut your meniscus, have you run a.

119
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.330
<v 1>Marathon? No. See you're giving me about it. I wouldn't,</v>

120
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.810
you wouldn't do it either. I wouldn't do a half either. I'm not doing it.

121
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.810
I don't wanna run with all those people. Very.

122
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.531
<v 2>Specific spot.</v>

123
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:45.040
It says the improvement to the subchondral bone of the tibial ephemeral

124
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.960
condo eyes was perfect sense. Following the marathon in Novi runners.

125
00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:51.160
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so and patella cartilage. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

126
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.120
<v 0>That's the bad part. That's what it does.</v>

127
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120
<v 2>Bad worsening of.</v>

128
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.440
<v 0>The patella cartilage. Mm. That makes sense. It breaks it down. Yeah.</v>

129
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:58.360
But can't you fix that yet?

130
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.120
<v 1>I mean, they don't, they fix that. They'll give you, they'll give you those, uh,</v>

131
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.480
stem cells. Yeah. Stem.

132
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.320
<v 0>Cells or, well, I know they do micro fractures and.</v>

133
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.320
Like they do all kinds of different things to people to try to heal the, uh,

134
00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:09.600
cartilage in their knees. Right?

135
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.880
<v 1>Yeah. Run. I just realize how privileged running is. That was like,</v>

136
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.920
I just get to run sometimes during the day.

137
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.110
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. So you don't get so fat from eating all the food you want.</v>

138
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.990
&lt;laugh&gt; that's what's crazy. All the,

139
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.310
you eat our problem in America is eating too much food.

140
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.190
<v 1>Yeah. It's uh, we have way too much access we're it's we're spoiled with it.</v>

141
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.350
Yeah. Yeah. But I just realized that that the time of my day I get to go,

142
00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:34.830
I can run to the gym and then run home. And that's like a nice day.

143
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.980
I get to have nice lucky dude. Nice. No, I wouldn't run, you know,

144
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.340
I wouldn't run a marathon because, uh, I don't like the people that do.

145
00:06:42.341 --> 00:06:46.420
That's genuinely it. You see all the people that get it. The, the thing,

146
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.540
the culture. I don't wanna be a part of it. No, thanks. You don't have to.

147
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.380
<v 0>Be, man. You could be alone.</v>

148
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.620
<v 1>Wolf. Woo. Ringing the bells and shouldn't taking the,</v>

149
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.260
I don't wanna do any of that stuff. No, you could put.

150
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
<v 0>Like Tibetan monk, chant. Yeah. That's dope on your phone.</v>

151
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.890
And just listen to that. As you run degree,

152
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.130
do music would do that.

153
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.490
And then my heart, keep that, keep that thing going for four hours. I.

154
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.730
<v 1>Would time I would go run in the middle of nowhere before I'd ever run in an</v>

155
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:18.280
actual marathon plan thing.

156
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.320
<v 0>Oh, okay. So you would run the 26 miles. Like maybe you run a track.</v>

157
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.160
<v 1>No, it has. Can't be on a track. No track. I've done. I've tried track.</v>

158
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:28.040
When I first moved to LA, I tried running at UCLA. Cause my buddy got me a,

159
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.400
a pass to go work out at their gym and I did a track. Yeah. Board.

160
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.080
<v 0>Miserable. Let me ask you this. If you had a track,</v>

161
00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:38.480
like a standard university track, that's like how, how, how many,

162
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.750
many feet is that? Like what is that quarter mile what's most track.

163
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:42.390
Each lap is quarter.

164
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.390
<v 1>Mile, quarter mile. Yeah.</v>

165
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.350
<v 0>How many times do you think you go around? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I mean, I could,</v>

166
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.430
did you go around a hundred times?

167
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.070
<v 1>No. Are you paying me? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I could do it as many times.</v>

168
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:52.910
You wanna pay me? Well, if she.

169
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.750
<v 0>Had a bet, what if like you and Jamie? Okay. You have.</v>

170
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.470
<v 1>To bet. Jamie doesn't run.</v>

171
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.020
Maybe this three point shoot up before we get into this race. Yeah.

172
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.140
Let's do three point. Shoot. You do that too. &lt;laugh&gt; and then we,

173
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.100
and then we need to a, you can do that too. You don't run. Do you? Yeah.

174
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.820
<v 0>Do people do that though? It seems like that would be like a great bet.</v>

175
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.060
If these ultra marathon runners really went to put their money where their mouth

176
00:08:12.061 --> 00:08:15.540
is, they get together on a track. See how long theyll go.

177
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.700
Let's see who quits first.

178
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.730
<v 1>Oh, that's. &lt;laugh&gt; that sounds that's killer dude.</v>

179
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.530
They would never stop. They would never stop. You could.

180
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.450
<v 0>Stop to pee or. That's.</v>

181
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.170
<v 1>It? What's the math cuz I'm dumb. What's 26 times four.</v>

182
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.050
<v 0>104. If it's a quarter of a mile, that means four of 'em.</v>

183
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.970
Four of 'em are a mile. So be 104.

184
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.920
You'd be pretty close to a hundred.

185
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.440
<v 1>You'd have to run a hundred, four times to run a mile, um,</v>

186
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.440
to run a marathon on a track. 104 laps. Yeah. So when to answer your question,

187
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.440
could I run a hundred laps on a track. No.

188
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.560
<v 0>You you're closing in on a marathon around around a hundred times. Yeah.</v>

189
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.880
<v 1>Well hundred, four times is, is a marathon. No way. No one. Oh,</v>

190
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.680
imagine you, you get into like seven, seven,

191
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.960
you hit seven and you're like, all right. I think I did it.

192
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.480
I don't wanna loop around this thing. And what look at this. Look at this, uh,

193
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.510
football field again. No miserable. That's you miserable?

194
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.390
Doesn't mean I haven't even hit eight yet. Yeah. You're not even close.

195
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.910
It's gonna take another two and a half minutes for you to get to eight and then

196
00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:25.870
you get there eight. What you think?

197
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.470
&lt;laugh&gt; I got 92 to go.
