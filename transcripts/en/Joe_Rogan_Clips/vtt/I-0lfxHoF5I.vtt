00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. But what's,</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.290
I think one of the things that's alarming about our politics right now is like

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.120
things that were just regarded up until like five years ago as the kind of

4
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:16.710
lunatic fringe have made their way into mainstream politics, like steep,

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.610
Steve Bannon, proudly declared himself like,

6
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:23.580
and Breitbart as the platform of the alt-right.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.610
And then Steve Bannon was sitting down the hall from the president of the United

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.820
States.

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.190
<v 1>What was the alt-right in the beginning though?</v>

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.760
See the alt-right became something in the public eye. In the beginning,

11
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:37.140
I thought the alt-right was like young Republicans that were a little

12
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:40.980
different, you know, I don't know what it, no, no, no,

13
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:43.890
not now for sure. But I mean, in the beginning,

14
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.190
my perceptions of the alt-right and the beginning was like,

15
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:51.030
what I thought Milo Yiannopoulos was when he first burst onto the scene,

16
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.860
sort of like, um, you know, a,

17
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:56.490
a guy who's.

18
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.610
<v 0>But the whole thing that Milo has revealed, right, is like,</v>

19
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:04.080
it was an ironic posture that revealed, like, if you're joking about,

20
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
you know, and, you're still saying the thing.

21
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.470
<v 1>Gay and he's Jewish.</v>

22
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.780
And so the idea was that he could get away with these things.

23
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.580
Provocateur was the word I was looking for,

24
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.350
and this is essentially what he's doing.

25
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:20.730
And he's using that to build social

26
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:22.890
currency, right? That social currencies,

27
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.130
developing this large group of people that follow him and talk to him.

28
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:28.440
And he thinks that there's some merit to his idea.

29
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:33.270
So he finds some sort of a justification for

30
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:37.710
having these provocative conversations in this stance where he's saying these

31
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:38.430
things and,

32
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.520
and a big proponent of free speech and all these things are happening all at the

33
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:42.030
same time.

34
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.390
That's what I thought the alt-right was initially what I thought the alt-right

35
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:49.740
was initially was people that wanted a new, younger, more,

36
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.720
more current take on what a Republican is and then it

37
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:57.360
became racist. And then it became, you know,

38
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:00.450
all the things that we think of it now, in terms of like public perceptions,

39
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.630
when it came the chemicals themselves art right now, who,

40
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.270
who even says they're all right. I mean,

41
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:09.150
it's almost like such a pejorative,

42
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.670
like the label is become so toxic.

43
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.830
<v 0>But the law don't misunderstand the fading of the</v>

44
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:18.870
label for the power of the movement.

45
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.260
It's just become kind of more normal Republican.

46
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:26.910
Now alt-right ideas have been subsumed by the

47
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:31.200
Trumpist Republican party, to some extent. I mean,

48
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.123
look like

49
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.740
the idea that some Americans are less American than others.

50
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.170
That is certainly an alt-right idea that I think is extremely dangerous. I mean,

51
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:52.460
you saw when here's, here's a great example when Trump went after the squad.

52
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.803
Okay. As,

53
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.320
and remember when he said that they should go back to the totally broken crime

54
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:01.870
infested places that they came from. Aha. Those people were,

55
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.910
three of them were born in America. One is a naturalized us citizen. The,

56
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.610
the idea there, right? As I heard it, and maybe I'm hearing something,

57
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:12.880
you're not that some Americans,

58
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:17.650
because of their skin color or their ideas sort of have provisional belonging

59
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:21.010
here for me is a very, very, it's more than a dog whistle.

60
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.400
It's something that is deeply un-American and deeply bigoted.

61
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.870
<v 1>He had said that about one person who had come here from somewhere else,</v>

62
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.300
it was awful and was criticizing America.

63
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:34.750
Then that would have been a more valid statement. And that would be like alien.

64
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.090
Omar's not from America initially. Surely.

65
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.750
<v 0>Melanoma. No, but, and I can't stand her ideas,</v>

66
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:43.870
but she's a naturalized citizen who is sworn to uphold the values of the

67
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:47.320
constitution. She's just as American as me or Donald Trump. Are you.

68
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.430
<v 1>Great? And I also agree that this idea,</v>

69
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.590
like go back to where you were,

70
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:58.360
that sucks is the response to someone criticizing the way things are here is

71
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:01.390
pretty ridiculous. You don't have to go back to where it sucks.

72
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.670
You're here and you're in the United States citizen.

73
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.700
You just think that this place should be better. Yes.

74
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.740
<v 0>And you can disagree with their ideas, but that I, that concept, right.</v>

75
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.360
That you're not entirely of a place that is something that has been used against

76
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:17.590
Jews forever.

77
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.990
The idea that you're not fully Iraqi because you're Jewish or you're not fully

78
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.860
American because you're Jewish or you're not fully French because you're Jewish.

79
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.690
Like the idea of provisional belonging is something that is that I am extremely

80
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:32.524
sensitive to.

81
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.630
<v 1>So it's a toxic tribalism.</v>

82
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.900
That's attached to the concept that the alt-right ideas.

83
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.330
<v 0>But then the alt-right ideas like there's Trump. I mean,</v>

84
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.680
look at who Steve Bannon has made common cause with raid people like Nigel

85
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:50.620
Farrage people like Marine Le pen. I mean,

86
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:52.870
there was a really good documentary about Steve Bannon,

87
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:56.980
where he's meeting with people who really are not just like normal

88
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:59.890
conservatives, his Marine Le pen, Marine Le pen.

89
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.310
What is her party's name in France? She is, um,

90
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.170
a deeply xenophobic politician in France whose

91
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:12.550
father, uh, was profoundly antisemitic. She claims that he's,

92
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.910
that she's not. Um, but she's someone that, you know,

93
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:17.850
you say her name in any Jewish community and.

94
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.000
<v 1>Uh, president of the national front, just that name national front,</v>

95
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.610
it sounds like Stormfront. It's really.

96
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.923
<v 0>Not.</v>

97
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.750
<v 1>Marion and purine, a French politician,</v>

98
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:32.980
lawyer serving as president of national rally political party since 2011 with a

99
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:35.410
brief interruption, 2017, she has been the member of the national.

100
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.800
It doesn't say what she does it doesn't say. Okay.

101
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.880
Anyway. So back to her and or Jews or

102
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.710
Farrage.

103
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.450
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, just like, I don't know. I,</v>

104
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:56.770
I see ideas getting expressed. Like there,

105
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.010
there are people that Tucker Carlson has had on his show who are like a valid

106
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:05.000
white nationalists recently. Can you Google that? Jamie,

107
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:09.230
there was a guy that he had on the other day, um, or even,

108
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.760
even these whistles right. Of like there's a way to criticize. Um,

109
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.250
did you find it, sorry.

110
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.910
<v 1>There's a way to criticize when I lost.</v>

111
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.743
<v 0>My train of thought. Oh.</v>

112
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.860
<v 1>No worries. Um, there's,</v>

113
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.790
there's a S a certain here it goes list of Tucker Carlson's guests who have

114
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:33.410
links to white nationalism, but he's, he agreed with these people.

115
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:36.170
Has he argued against their ideas?

116
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.800
Roger Stone. Roger Stone's a white nationalist. No.

117
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.730
His links to white nationalism. Peter SCA.

118
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.380
<v 0>No, there was something more recently.</v>

119
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.220
<v 1>It wasn't the first white nationalist Tucker Carlson has hosted. Okay.</v>

120
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.100
That was 2018. Anyway. Um.

121
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:57.763
<v 0>I don't know. I mean,</v>

122
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.000
are you not alarmed by the turn that you see in the Republican party towards

123
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.450
sort of like, I don't know, the Trump Trumpist cult?

124
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.240
<v 1>Well, I think one thing that the Republican party has done that's wise,</v>

125
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.350
if you want to keep a solidified team,

126
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.040
is that they haven't come out against him and they've supported him.

127
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.610
And there's very little dissent and this is,

128
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.780
this is a good idea if you want your team to win. Right.

129
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.200
And there was a lot of people who were kind of never Trumpers who soften their

130
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:32.330
stance once they realized the power of his presidency,

131
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:36.680
that he's a really dominant sometimes Trumpers. Yeah. Yeah. I'm alarmed.

132
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.350
I'm alarmed by people.

133
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.040
I'm alarmed whenever there's not where this outward,

134
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.310
there's an outward lack of compassion. And when there's a,

135
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.560
an outward disdain for the other,

136
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.510
because essentially this country is all the other, the whole thing,

137
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.870
that's all we have is the other, I mean, that's, that's the whole thing.

138
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.730
<v 0>I think that, yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's just,</v>

139
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.880
Trump has just beyond the sort of, like he said, various things that are like,

140
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:11.240
he was speak speaking to a Jewish group and he talked about your prime minister.

141
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:15.830
I mean, he said so many things that are ridiculous, but the big,

142
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.570
big thing that he's guilty of is he is like dismantled the guard

143
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:25.100
rails of the keep society decent and civil and normal.

144
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.380
And like once you dismantle those things, like it's very easy to reverse,

145
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.900
not very easy, but you can reverse policies.

146
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.110
What's much harder to reverse is a culture.

147
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.460
And he has just been gleefully making war on.

148
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.210
What I think of is very, very important cultural norms.

149
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.363
<v 1>Like.</v>

150
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.120
<v 0>Like not attacking the weakest people in our culture,</v>

151
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.800
like not attacking gold star families. Like, I mean, he is,

152
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.160
he is denigrated like the most heroic and the weakest people at our culture at

153
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:00.450
every possible turn. Yes.

154
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.480
<v 1>The gold star family thing was very disturbing and weird how it just kind of</v>

155
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:04.314
went away.

156
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.080
<v 0>I mean, it didn't go. That was, I remember that moment.</v>

157
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:10.380
Remember when he people forget this, when he said about, um,

158
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.170
judge Alonzo curial who was born in this country,

159
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.430
that he couldn't give a fair hearing to Trump university because he was born in

160
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.700
Mexico. I mean this in America. Yes.

161
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.590
<v 1>This was when was this years ago? It was.</v>

162
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.200
<v 0>During the candidacy. Really? Wasn't yeah. We just.</v>

163
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.180
<v 1>Wow. Jesus Christ.</v>

164
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.110
And he say something about loyal Jews vote Democrat as well.

165
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:31.501
<v 0>Oh yeah.</v>

166
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:35.220
That the Jews Jews are disloyal because they don't vote Republican because look

167
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:37.830
at all the great things he's done for Israel. Yeah.

168
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.420
<v 1>That if you're a loyal Judah, Israel, you would vote Republican. Yeah.</v>

169
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.550
<v 0>The Jews who don't vote for him are disloyal. I mean, yeah, that was,</v>

170
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.380
yeah. That was a high point. But I mean, just the main, like I'm,

171
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.310
I feel like I haven't given you a satisfying answer about anti-Semitism itself.

172
00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:58.560
I think the way to think about it.

173
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.360
<v 1>Uh, do you remember this too jarring to read,</v>

174
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.300
um, Indiana born,

175
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.900
federal judge who president Donald Trump once said could not be impartial

176
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.940
because he was Mexican cleared,

177
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:15.450
a major obstacle standing in the way of Trump's long promised border wall with.

178
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.450
<v 0>Mexico. So I hear that. And I'm like, oh, that's.</v>

179
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.760
<v 1>Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy.</v>

180
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.090
<v 0>All feeding this idea that like,</v>

181
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:31.320
there are some people who are more American than others that are more belonging

182
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:33.450
than others. And I think that ideas.

183
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.630
<v 1>Right. It reinforces his tribe. Right.</v>

184
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.110
And that's one thing that Donald Trump has clearly done is calculate,

185
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.730
cultivate, rather a tribe. You know, he has a tribe. I mean, they have a,

186
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.520
they have a hat, right.

187
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.170
They have a slogan and it's a weird slogan because it seems so

188
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.490
positive. Make America great. Again, that seems positive,

189
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:01.080
but it's not like if you, if you look, people punch you,

190
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:03.390
if you have that hat on so crazy,

191
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.530
we've gotten to a point in society that something that's a positive statement,

192
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.990
like make America great. Again,

193
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.420
is so polarizing that people will be violent towards you and feel like they

194
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:18.720
need to, they feel like they need to laugh. Like you're the enemy.
