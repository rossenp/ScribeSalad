00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.820
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. So you're obsessed with UFO's, right?</v>

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.280
Uh, is that safe to say? I.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.100
<v 1>I, yeah, safe to say, but it's, it's not so much just the UFO itself. I mean,</v>

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.610
there, I don't call them that anymore. We call these advanced aerial threats.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.570
They're different, but gosh, you were honed in our word.

6
00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:22.900
We weren't supposed to really get into here in the first part of the,

7
00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:27.590
of the show. Did you have a plan? I have a very, I have a very long plan,

8
00:00:27.591 --> 00:00:29.900
detailed plan. We're going to start with my body. We're just going to.

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.120
<v 2>Talk about my body for a lot and okay.</v>

10
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:33.800
What do you want to talk about in terms of your body?

11
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.890
<v 1>Well, my body is interesting. It's unique.</v>

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.280
<v 2>It's it's.</v>

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.920
<v 1>It changes shape. And what I've noticed is it's just changing.</v>

14
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.460
<v 0>It's getting larger and larger getting wider depending upon what you put in it,</v>

15
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.760
but you're off. Can I cuss? Yeah. Yeah, for sure. We're on the internet.

16
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.570
You're so.

17
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.840
<v 1>Fit. You shook my hand. Are they going to break my hand? I'm sorry. Yeah,</v>

18
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.300
just don't be strong. I didn't mean to don't be so handsome.

19
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.400
<v 0>Hand. Just thought it.</v>

20
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.170
<v 1>Was a handshake. I know. Well,</v>

21
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:02.390
it's one of those power moves you ever see when Trump shakes people's.

22
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.790
<v 0>Hands. Yeah. It pulls him in and he's like, yeah, he does do weird.</v>

23
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.490
Weird like that. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't mean to do that.

24
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.230
It just meant to shake your hand like a man. Um, well.

25
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.110
<v 1>I, I took it as like, no, your place.</v>

26
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.870
<v 2>Oh, this is my show. I didn't think that. Interesting. Um,</v>

27
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.610
so how, when did you get.

28
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.100
<v 0>Obsessed with this aerial threat thing? And why do you,</v>

29
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.090
why do you call them threats?

30
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.350
<v 1>We'll get into that, I guess. Um, but, uh, uh,</v>

31
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.070
I got into when I was in junior high, um, for some weird reason,

32
00:01:31.071 --> 00:01:33.710
I had like some time off and, um,

33
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.980
and I went to the school library and like seventh grade and I was like,

34
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.650
I gotta to read some boring. What am I going to read?

35
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:43.610
And I saw this one book and it had a picture of the Lochness monster in like a

36
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.120
UFO mall that looks cool. And I read that and I was like, holy cow,

37
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:50.390
these are like real, it wasn't all science fiction. I mean,

38
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.060
the way the book was laid out was like, these are like real events. I'm all,

39
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.340
there's no, no way. Really. And then, uh,

40
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.220
when the band started doing its thing in the back of the van,

41
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:02.000
there were no smartphones. So as we were buying books and, um,

42
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.420
and I would just lay there, we'd have like 20 hour drives. And,

43
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:08.120
and so I started buying books on the UFO phenomenon and I was,

44
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.660
once you do that, it's a black hole. Yeah.

45
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.050
<v 0>It's definitely a rabbit hole. You get sucked into it. I, uh, at my house,</v>

46
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:19.370
I have a frame poster. That's the cover of the Roswell daily news. Yeah.

47
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.490
That shows the day after the Roswell crash,

48
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:26.930
where it says that the air force came and recovered the wreckage and you know,

49
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:30.270
the whole day I've been obsessed with this since I was a little kid. Yeah.

50
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.150
<v 1>I, I think, I think that's a, I think that's by design.</v>

51
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.150
I think that this generation is, uh,

52
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.230
was meant to have this stuff come out. Um, but you know,

53
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.790
I can't prove that that's just my feeling.

54
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.290
<v 0>What, what makes you feel that like.</v>

55
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.010
<v 1>Um, because of exactly what you said, there's a lot of people,</v>

56
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.090
I don't believe that some of the, um,

57
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.810
I don't believe that some of the events happened on accident. You know,

58
00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:00.160
I think that, uh, there's been a lot of events that are on purpose.

59
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.850
Some have been for show, some have been for, um, I mean,

60
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.260
there's a variety of variety of reasons,

61
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:08.830
but I think a lot of it is a control system.

62
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:12.130
That's really pushing humanity in a very specific direction.

63
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.830
<v 0>So like, they've got a timeframe where they've had these events take place.</v>

64
00:03:16.831 --> 00:03:17.664
Is that what you think?

65
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.230
<v 1>And they also time travel,</v>

66
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:22.290
which is different than what people think in like a movie where they sit in a

67
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.921
machine and you know,

68
00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:26.370
all of a sudden you're in the 1930s and you've got to go save humanity. Um,

69
00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:30.690
when you use the technology, you have a, there's a time, uh,

70
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.510
difference between where,

71
00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:37.230
what they're doing inside of an artificial artificially created bubble of

72
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:40.260
gravity of sorts, and then what's on the outside.

73
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:44.340
So if you're on the inside of one of those machines, everything would be skewed,

74
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.570
more black and white.

75
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.840
There'd be like a red shift and everybody would look frozen.

76
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.950
So you literally could fly around and grab a Coke out of someone's hand and put

77
00:03:52.951 --> 00:03:55.590
it in someone else's hand. It's really, where are you getting this from?

78
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.220
We'll take a wild guess. Look at the people I was surrounded by.

79
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.180
<v 0>You know, w so the people you're surrounded by are telling you this,</v>

80
00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:04.014
is that what it is?

81
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.030
<v 1>Uh, well, I, I don't want to get into that, but the people I'm surrounded with,</v>

82
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.110
um, and myself, uh, you know, are very close to this stuff, but the,

83
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:16.230
the physics, you know, the, the physicist,

84
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:19.020
that's a co-founder of my company to the star. He's a Nobel nominee.

85
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:22.590
He wrote the book on plasma physics. He, uh, what's his name, uh,

86
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.670
how put off Dr. Hall put off. And he, he created well viewing.

87
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:27.570
Do you know what remote viewing is?

88
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.900
He's the creator of this CIA psychic spy program,

89
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:35.190
but he also has done like really exotic advanced

90
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.770
forefront, propulsion work for the past, um, decades and decades actually.

91
00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:45.450
I mean, he's the, he's deep into the, like quantum this and that. So,

92
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.840
uh, he's the one that actually told me about the red shift. Yeah.

93
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.340
<v 0>And so they have experienced this physically,</v>

94
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:56.790
or is this just a theoretical or they know that it exists.

95
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.640
I like the technology. Yes. Uh.

96
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.200
<v 1>I th I believe, um, that the technology,</v>

97
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.090
uh, not only exists, we've figured out how to play with it,

98
00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:12.090
but I'm not going to really get into that here. I w what,

99
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.090
that is what we're doing at my company, though, that is the announcement.

100
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:19.080
So Steve justice was head of advanced programs at the skunkworks and the

101
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:21.420
skunkworks, or who built, you know,

102
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.420
the S the famous secret bases you hear about skunkworks.

103
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:28.120
Did you know the U2 spy plane, the Sr 71 Blackbird, Def, uh,

104
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.940
one 17 stealth fighter.

105
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.190
<v 0>And it's all groom lake out there, all that kind of.</v>

106
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.660
<v 1>Stuff. And, um, and he literally was in charge of all the advanced programs. So,</v>

107
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.520
you know, you got the boss and you got him. And, um, he came,

108
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.990
uh, he just finished his career over there within the past two months.

109
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:50.340
I think it is an, and he was on stage with me when we came out and said,

110
00:05:50.341 --> 00:05:51.690
we're going to be building one of these things.

111
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.830
<v 0>So when, when you say that this, all this technology exists,</v>

112
00:05:55.831 --> 00:06:00.620
have they explain this to you? Or have you seen it physically?

113
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.610
<v 1>Oh, I haven't seen anything physically like that. I'm not,</v>

114
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.450
I wouldn't be allowed to go anywhere if that does or doesn't exist. So they've.

115
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.480
<v 0>Just explained to you that this exists, um,</v>

116
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.180
and that this is in the hands of the U S government.

117
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.750
<v 1>I think. No, no, I see. I don't want to get into that kind of stuff, but, um,</v>

118
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.950
you don't mind, well.

119
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.320
<v 0>Why is it that you want to not get into certain things?</v>

120
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.090
<v 1>Well, I don't want to speak act, you know,</v>

121
00:06:22.091 --> 00:06:24.790
I represent more than myself these days. Right. So, uh,

122
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.860
I definitely have to watch what I say, well,

123
00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:29.140
who do you represent when you say you represent more than yourself,

124
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.430
the team that I'm with.

125
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:32.980
So when you look at the people that are a part of my company,

126
00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:37.150
it's under secretary of defenses and defense and senior intelligence service.

127
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.690
<v 0>Is there a list of these people like that we could see? Oh.</v>

128
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.980
<v 1>Yeah. I thought you guys would have had that. So what.</v>

129
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.830
<v 0>I mean, is there like a list where folks could see it online?</v>

130
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.170
<v 1>Yeah. They can go to, um, to the stars, academy.com and scroll down,</v>

131
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.260
and you'll be able to see who they all are. So, so.

132
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.540
<v 0>How did you get linked up with all these people? That.</v>

133
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.880
<v 1>Story might be a better way to start,</v>

134
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.040
because a lot of people don't know this part of the story,

135
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:03.970
and I think you're going to find it pretty odd as well, but, uh, okay.

136
00:07:03.971 --> 00:07:08.740
So we'll back up a couple of years. So, um, I ha I was obviously, uh, you know,

137
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.570
I, I started the band blink and blink went places. And, um, and then, uh,

138
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.360
but we always had a weird band relationship, like most bands,

139
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.510
and we also thought that we would never be big.

140
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.460
So we started companies on the side and, uh,

141
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:26.200
I had a company that incubated a lot of small startups,

142
00:07:26.201 --> 00:07:28.960
like software and apparel and hardcore skate,

143
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:31.060
surf companies and stuff like that. Well,

144
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.170
I learned a lot from that and I pulled out an entertainment startup called to

145
00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:36.004
the stars,

146
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.270
and I knew I was going to be doing kind of like science fiction,

147
00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:44.350
franchised stories, just like Disney, but science fiction for adults.

148
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.130
And what that means is, you know, I make a story, I title it, I brand it.

149
00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:51.250
And I put out the book and I put up the merchandise and I go make a movie,

150
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:56.110
you know? And it's, it's a, it's a vertically integrated kind of model. Well,

151
00:07:56.111 --> 00:07:59.320
one of the stories I knew I wanted to put out with secret machines,

152
00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:03.220
which was kind of a historical fiction. Um,

153
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.260
but based on real events about the UFO phenomenon,

154
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:09.910
but I also knew that I knew that most people don't know because I've studied it

155
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:10.744
for so long.

156
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.980
And I happened to put some pieces together that most people don't put together.

157
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.300
So w before I came out with that book, um,

158
00:08:18.301 --> 00:08:20.020
and before I came out with the plan to take that,

159
00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:23.530
make major motion pictures and all that kind of stuff, um, I,

160
00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:26.530
I knew I needed to ask permission. So I flew,

161
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.230
I flew around to places. Uh, it, uh, I can't say who they were, but,

162
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.450
and they, they listened to my pitch. And, um, and then I got a,

163
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.210
I got a email out of nowhere that says,

164
00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:44.230
meet us next to the Pentagon at this day in time. And I did that. Um, and.

165
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.110
<v 0>From, I got an email from just, I just tend to person.</v>

166
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.890
<v 1>I just can't tell you who it's from. And so then I go out, uh.</v>

167
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.950
<v 0>Yeah, you're next to the Pentagon. So you just go to the Pentagon.</v>

168
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.840
<v 1>I flew out to Pentagon city. Yeah. Yeah. And so the dude, this is freaking out.</v>

169
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.470
I'll tell you when I started freaking out, there's more that it gets way worse.

170
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:06.060
This is nothing. Um, so that started me out in, uh, out near DC,

171
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.120
taking some other high level meetings in there, somebody, um,

172
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:13.410
at a very high level that, that, uh, closed the door of many. I says, okay,

173
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:17.970
I'm going to introduce you to somebody. And, um, that person comes to San Diego,

174
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.120
puts me on the phone with a general.

175
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.930
And the general is listening to my little stump speech about what I want to do

176
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:27.750
with this franchise. Cause it was, I, I definitely didn't want to, you know, I,

177
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:31.860
wasn't looking to like force disclosure and I wasn't looking to be rogue and

178
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:34.770
break secrets. I was like, look, I know what's going on here.

179
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.330
And you guys are doing a kick-ass job and I would have done the exact same

180
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:39.840
thing.

181
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.720
Should I have been the guy at the top that had to make some really hardcore

182
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:45.870
decisions 70 years ago. So I'm, I want to support you.

183
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:47.790
I think people are cynical because there's a vacuum.

184
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:49.860
You guys can't say what you're doing.

185
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.480
So all these people are just coming up with a bunch of to say, oh, you know,

186
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.700
they don't want us to know, or we can't handle it.

187
00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:59.760
Or it's all about oil and money and all this weird, um.

188
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.300
<v 0>On, you would put these pieces together independently. I did.</v>

189
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.220
And so based on books that you.

190
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.530
<v 1>Read, yeah. People think, you know,</v>

191
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:10.950
people think that like places like the CIA and the DIA,

192
00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:14.160
all these intelligence organizations have, um, you know,

193
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.900
a monopoly on information, they don't,

194
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.770
they get their information from the real world too. You know,

195
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.860
they do have access to, to, you know, archives of information.

196
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:26.640
They do have access to some, uh, amazing, you know,

197
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.530
satellite data and stuff like that.

198
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:32.460
But if you're smart and you take your time and you know where to look and you

199
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:33.780
find patterns, um,

200
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:37.470
you can pretty much put together all the same they can kind of, you know,

201
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.060
and that's what I did. And so when I pitched what I wanted to do, he said,

202
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.800
um, come up and meet me tomorrow. And so I flew up to NASA,

203
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:50.430
actually on NASA Ames and had a two-hour meeting there.

204
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.780
And after two hours, that person says, um, he looks me in the eyes,

205
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:57.720
I'm going to introduce you to someone else. And he did.

206
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.890
And so I got on the phone with this person and this person, you know, go,

207
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:05.520
I'm a skeptic, I'm a skeptic. And then at the end of the conversation, he goes,

208
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.790
um, he goes, fly out and see me. And so I did,

209
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.850
and that's when things really started happening.

210
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:16.500
So I'm now I fly out to this airport and I sit at a

211
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:19.650
table in a restaurant at the airport. No one's in there.

212
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.100
And this gentleman sits down and the waiter comes up.

213
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:25.890
He waves off the waiter and he looks me in the eye and says it was the cold war.

214
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:29.100
And we found a life for him. And that's when I started my pants,

215
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:30.660
because I know a lot about this stuff, but I,

216
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.080
you always wait to talk to somebody. Um,

217
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.620
that is one of the inside people you always.

218
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:38.001
<v 0>Wanna hear. Well,</v>

219
00:11:38.001 --> 00:11:42.110
he sits down at a restaurant with you at the airport and tells you that they

220
00:11:42.111 --> 00:11:42.944
found a life.

221
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.800
<v 1>Form. Yes. And during the cold war,</v>

222
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.900
during the cold war and everything that they did,

223
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.680
and every decision they made at the time was because of the consciousness of the.

224
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.830
<v 0>Cold war. Why is this guy decided to meet with you.</v>

225
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.590
<v 1>At an airport? Because the only way you meet with these people,</v>

226
00:11:56.591 --> 00:12:00.160
the only way you ever would have anyone talk to you is if you can provide a

227
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:04.660
service that they need. And my service was pretty interesting to them,

228
00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:07.830
because I said, look, you guys, you know, you,

229
00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:10.990
you struggle with saying disclosure. You want to tell everybody everything,

230
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:13.570
which I don't think everyone should know everything. Um,

231
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.300
and then you say they can't handle it. So don't tell them anything, you know?

232
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:18.010
And I'm like, there's, there's a middle road there.

233
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.270
And here's the way I would do the middle road. And, uh, it resonated with them,

234
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:22.810
you know?

235
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:27.610
And so we had a pretty epic conversation for like two hours.

236
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:27.970
Why.

237
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.640
<v 0>You, like, why, what is it about what your message was, your idea was,</v>

238
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:33.420
um,

239
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.170
that made them sort of tell you some top secret that they've tried to keep away

240
00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:38.100
from the American people.

241
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.730
When you tell your guy who was like a big celebrities and a huge rock band,

242
00:12:41.731 --> 00:12:44.790
like you, and you just say, Hey, meet me in an airport.

243
00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:47.610
I'm going to tell you about a life form that we found during the cold war,

244
00:12:47.611 --> 00:12:51.120
because you're famous or because you know, things because.

245
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.750
<v 1>I have a service. So it's not a, it sounds easy when you play it like that,</v>

246
00:12:54.751 --> 00:12:58.910
but it's service a service. Like what can you do for them? Okay.

247
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.420
If they need help with communication, they don't have a way to make a movie,

248
00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:06.150
a book. They don't know how they're not gonna have a way to make documentaries.

249
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.800
They don't have a way to go on,

250
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:12.030
on a big show like this and communicate with young people. They don't do that.

251
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.000
And nor should they, they're they look at,

252
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.400
you got to look at what they're doing. Um,

253
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.630
so they look to you for a spokesperson role. I wouldn't say spokesperson role,

254
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:23.870
a communication role. It may.

255
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.960
<v 0>So they would give some information to you and you would get it out to people.</v>

256
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.670
And now why wouldn't they do it themselves?

257
00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:33.570
Because they wouldn't have the same platform. They don't have the same platform.

258
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.740
<v 1>And the other reason is, is people have tried to do movies and stuff like this.</v>

259
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.540
Uh, but none of, none of them know I was fortunate enough to,

260
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.190
to know the core story and.

261
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.250
<v 0>Most people don't. So explain that then, if you don't mind going back,</v>

262
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.410
like you said, that you were able to put things together,

263
00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:51.930
that other people weren't, what are those things? Um.

264
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.920
<v 1>Essentially it's the book secret machines where you have a lot of private</v>

265
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.690
finance, you have some world bankers and you have, um,

266
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:05.730
a lot of people internationally working together to figure out a plan

267
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.130
of how to, how to push back against something.

268
00:14:08.131 --> 00:14:11.880
That's been coming here for a very long time, but using off the books,

269
00:14:11.881 --> 00:14:15.870
finances and using, uh, mechanisms, um, that,

270
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.850
that we're not totally aware exist.

271
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.410
And what people have to realize is, you know, they,

272
00:14:22.411 --> 00:14:25.710
the UFO phenomenon, isn't a phenomenon. There's,

273
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.880
the universe is gigantic and there's life

274
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.030
everywhere, every where, and, and,

275
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.210
and there's a lot of life that's way more advanced than we are.

276
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.760
And just like we're Voyager left our solar system,

277
00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:43.100
a little dinky satellite from the seventies, um, there, and,

278
00:14:43.101 --> 00:14:47.220
and just like my company is going to be building, you know, this, this, uh,

279
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.040
electromagnetic craft that really can do the same thing.

280
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.780
The time that I've been telling you about other civilizations have that too,

281
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:56.270
which means you can traverse those distances of space.

282
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.250
And what you have to think about is what happened when we first discovered that

283
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.490
and what did we do about it? And there's no, you know,

284
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.340
you gotta look at 47 in a very peculiar way.

285
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.610
90 days after the Roswell event with CIA was created,

286
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.200
the air force was separated from the army.

287
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:13.850
The national security act was created.

288
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.570
And all those things are mechanisms to start learning more and to start getting

289
00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:18.830
private industry off the ground.

290
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.210
<v 0>So that had nothing to do with world war II. You think it had to do with aliens?</v>

291
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:22.870
Oh.

292
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.740
<v 1>I absolutely think it well, both because what, uh,</v>

293
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.270
what I believe crashed at Roswell was, um,

294
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.050
w I believe it was German from Argentina,

295
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.070
but it had hallmarks and technology based on alien technology.

296
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.670
So we put out a story saying it's alien.

297
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.740
And then we put out a story saying it's a weather balloon,

298
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.650
but the real thing it was, we didn't want anyone to guess.

299
00:15:47.651 --> 00:15:49.830
And that's why we put those two things out there. And that's,

300
00:15:49.831 --> 00:15:53.350
that's kind of how they do it. I think they did that with the moon. It's like,

301
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:57.550
you know, we went to the moon and then they put out this meme kind of thing.

302
00:15:57.551 --> 00:15:59.440
Like we can't, we, we didn't go to the moon,

303
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.980
but I didn't want people really going well, what's on the moon that, you know,

304
00:16:02.981 --> 00:16:06.160
so these things are managed until they can figure it out,

305
00:16:06.161 --> 00:16:08.770
because you've got a bunch of normal dudes in suits,

306
00:16:08.771 --> 00:16:10.570
sitting at a big table like this,

307
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.470
and it's their responsibility to figure this thing out.

308
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.510
And this is monumentally big. Um,

309
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.350
but back.

310
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.850
<v 0>Then, and how would they manage this then?</v>

311
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.630
How these regular dudes without access to communication like you have,

312
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.580
have they managed to disseminate this information and, and,

313
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.790
and sort of confuse everybody? I.

314
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.130
<v 1>Think, well, I can tell, I don't know how they did it.</v>

315
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.290
I do know that they infiltrated UFO groups.

316
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.150
That was the very first thing they did in the fifties.

317
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.880
<v 0>Sorta like how FBI agents and undercover cops infiltrated occupy wall street</v>

318
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.790
pretended to be radical hippies and started fights. Yep.

319
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.450
<v 1>They did that. They get access to what the civilians are, learning,</v>

320
00:16:49.451 --> 00:16:53.260
how information transfers from one group to another. Um,

321
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.250
and then they start deflecting all their knowledge and putting in leaks and this

322
00:16:57.251 --> 00:16:59.500
and that, and getting them off the main track,

323
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.760
not because of a disdain for citizens and not because, um,

324
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.200
of any other reason than picture ISIS,

325
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.460
we don't know what ISIS is.

326
00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:14.440
They got a nuclear bomb and we caught a guy trying to sneak in this bomb.

327
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:14.890
Right.

328
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.310
Are they going to stop and come sit on your couch and tell you all about it? No.

329
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.430
And if you're like on the radio and there's all these people going, oh my God,

330
00:17:21.431 --> 00:17:24.970
we're going to die. Obama, Obama bomb. There are, hold up a second. You know,

331
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.670
you're not going to die, but we need to learn more about this.

332
00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:30.640
And we've got to figure it out before we sit down and talk to you about it.
