WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.690
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um, wait, so what are, what,</v>

2
00:00:05.691 --> 00:00:09.750
what are we settling on for this month? Heroin. Heroin is that we're doing.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.230
<v 1>Everybody first time. I'm.</v>

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.430
<v 2>In, what are we doing?</v>

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.490
<v 1>Well, what we decided over the phone is one,</v>

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.290
one edition is we have to read 500 pages and by read 500

7
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.530
pages, I think we made read, we don't mean audio book, right?

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.880
<v 2>But I thought we were just doing these classes. Now we're doing the reading too.</v>

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.110
That's great. We should.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.970
<v 1>The reading too. Yeah. Well, you didn't read more so 10 classes of something.</v>

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.660
It can be hot yoga. It could be jujitsu.

12
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.900
It can be spin hot, spins some classes.

13
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.280
<v 2>Some hip hop dance.</v>

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.043
<v 1>About the pop dance.</v>

15
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.431
<v 3>By the way, by the way,</v>

16
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:53.400
how great would have hip hop dance been now that you saw the video?

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.990
We should have done that.

18
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.330
<v 2>That was a.</v>

19
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.310
<v 1>Great video. I knew what you were going to do. You're going to take your.</v>

20
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.350
<v 2>Clothes off. That hip hop dance video was great.</v>

21
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.180
<v 0>I also danced.</v>

22
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.670
<v 1>Dancing was okay. Maybe.</v>

23
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.250
<v 3>I'm so shocked that.</v>

24
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.430
<v 0>I was so angry. I got so upset that people complimented them.</v>

25
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.260
<v 3>America's got talent reached out to me. Jesus Christ.</v>

26
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.420
<v 1>Do you see, consider the bro? Do.</v>

27
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.360
<v 3>They go? Do you consider yourself more of a comedian or a dancer?</v>

28
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.590
Do you not have a Google search engine on your.

29
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.060
<v 1>I didn't want to bother with that.</v>

30
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.980
<v 2>They're monsters or they reach out on Facebook.</v>

31
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.320
<v 3>On, on, uh, they emailed me.</v>

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.400
<v 1>They probably have a million hyenas out there, rummaging the nation,</v>

33
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:41.580
trying to find people with any kind of town so they can keep that monster alive.

34
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.590
Yeah.

35
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.470
<v 0>The wait, the other thing is we didn't, we agree that within these classes,</v>

36
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.370
they don't necessarily have to be a physical strain.

37
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.520
It's like a class of anything. That's some class that's new.

38
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.560
<v 1>Um, and I were talking about taking tactical gun lessons. That'd be great.</v>

39
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.860
<v 0>But I'm saying that's not a workout, but it's still like a class.</v>

40
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.560
<v 2>One class. Are we better off with it than without them sword.</v>

41
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.320
<v 1>Fights this year? It's more about bettering ourselves.</v>

42
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:10.560
One of the things that I think we agreed to and your wife actually reached out

43
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:13.440
to me about, apparently her and Leanne are gonna get together and do like a,

44
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.910
a pod. They're doing a.

45
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.743
<v 0>Podcast.</v>

46
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.870
<v 1>For the month. Yeah, because last year it was insane. Look, I gave your.</v>

47
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.520
<v 2>Wife good ammunition. And the first.</v>

48
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.340
<v 0>Episode and the wives, Hey.</v>

49
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.320
<v 1>Mine did not. Well, she didn't like seeing that part of me either the like it.</v>

50
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.300
<v 2>Yeah, mine too. She was like, your body looks better, but so boring. Yeah. But.</v>

51
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.640
<v 3>Again, the live.</v>

52
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.710
And when she found out that I got roof a roofie because of sober October. Yeah.

53
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.090
She's was, she was so she'll never speak to RD again. Justifiably.

54
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.540
<v 2>What? Me? Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.570
<v 3>Yeah. Ari. You're the.</v>

56
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.540
<v 1>One she'll never speak to Ari again. No, our daughter.</v>

57
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.330
<v 3>Has never allowed in our house. It's so bad. I,</v>

58
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.040
and that's what was sucked is I had to take of both of them.

59
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.370
Like I had to take care of Ari and take care of Leanne. I think she's.

60
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.400
<v 1>Great. Whoa. She doesn't like you, bro. I think she's.</v>

61
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.040
<v 2>Great. This has been a great moms where kids with.</v>

62
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.860
<v 1>That's cool. I like how you look at that. Wonderful.</v>

63
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.010
You see the bright side of things, even when people hate.

64
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.680
<v 2>It was awesome. Always had your back. I think she's great. I think it was great.</v>

65
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:20.770
And her temporary anger at me is not going to make me stop liking her so much.

66
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.080
Oh.

67
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.780
<v 0>Oh wait, wait before I forget. Yeah. So within the 10 classes, yeah.</v>

68
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.500
You can't do more than how many of one class three, right?

69
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.360
You can do one class three times.

70
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:35.200
So you could technically do my classes three times. Why does that matter?

71
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.430
<v 2>So you can mix it up a little bit.</v>

72
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:38.170
So you don't just do one thing over and over again.

73
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.750
You don't just do spin class every day and be done with it.

74
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.110
<v 1>As long as you can do something. I mean, but a little bit,</v>

75
00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:46.000
like if you're doing jujitsu, like say, if you decide to do jujitsu,

76
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.760
you learn it. There's nothing wrong with doing six of them.

77
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.260
Like that's how you get better.

78
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.290
Or because if you do decide to do it and you get into it,

79
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.390
you're going to have to do more than one a week.

80
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.300
<v 2>To easy to do the same and not challenge yourself. Hm.</v>

81
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.200
<v 1>Says you. Yeah. Interesting. How you just making the rules up? Well, it seems.</v>

82
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.373
<v 2>To.</v>

83
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.470
<v 1>Think about that. Does that make sense to you? Don't only be.</v>

84
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.240
<v 3>Like that against our will kind of like he's slipping a drug to us. Doesn't it?</v>

85
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.990
<v 0>I think that if we,</v>

86
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.850
I think there should be one other element to it is that you, because there's,

87
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.080
there's always been like this physical element to the whole month. Yeah.

88
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.850
You should do something on your own that you don't talk about till it's over

89
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.890
that you're doing to challenge yourself like the.

90
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.880
<v 2>Crucible on it to.</v>

91
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.110
<v 0>Like you and it's not. Yeah. Like for instance,</v>

92
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.950
I'm not following, like for instance, you, uh,

93
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.150
like you like to run the Hills, right? So let's say, let's just say you go,

94
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:45.220
I run it once a week. I run it every Sunday or something.

95
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.260
So for the month you challenge yourself on your own to do it twice a week.

96
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.450
And at November 1st, you're like, I took these classes,

97
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.010
I read these books and I ran my Hills twice a week. Or like, you know, you go,

98
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.830
I want to, you know, I do a hundred pushups a day. What,

99
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.440
however you want to do it that way. There's a 50, that way.

100
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:05.470
There's like some other physical element of, you know,

101
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:06.400
wellness throughout the month.

102
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.980
<v 2>Okay. You want me to challenge yourself to that? I'm like,</v>

103
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:10.000
I think I can do this.

104
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.463
<v 3>Coming back with.</v>

105
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.520
<v 0>Basically.</v>

106
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.950
<v 2>Yeah. Kind of like lent when you give up something they do to.</v>

107
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.143
<v 1>That's. Right.</v>

108
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.440
So you would just actually have four things to do if you could only do three

109
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.550
no more than three of each one. So there has to be for individual things.

110
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.170
<v 0>That's right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean four things,</v>

111
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:30.730
four things total. Right? Cause you could do.

112
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.170
<v 1>Because you could do yoga, you could do spin. You could do jujitsu.</v>

113
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.740
You could do kickboxing. You could do. Yeah. CrossFit.

114
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.140
<v 3>I got to do four separate things. Tactical,</v>

115
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.280
tactical gun training yet I have a gun and I haven't even put bullets in it.

116
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.290
<v 1>I really don't want to say that. Now say I'm a awesome shot.</v>

117
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.680
<v 0>My uncle dress is.</v>

118
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.810
<v 1>Yeah. Um, yeah. I liked this.</v>

119
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.930
I liked the idea of mixing it up and I also liked the idea that we're not going

120
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:05.330
to go crazy. This is like something. See,

121
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:08.780
the thing about last year is like you open-ended. Yeah.

122
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:13.130
I mean I had 1100 points one day when you're doing 80% of your max heart rate

123
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:17.630
for a minute, you get one point I had 1100 points. That was a nuts day.

124
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.980
<v 2>Finished.</v>

125
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.950
<v 1>At 11,000. It's that John wick bathhouse scene.</v>

126
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.640
I watched that scene 50 times in a row and I just wanted to kill everybody.

127
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:26.900
Yeah. It wouldn't stop.

128
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.560
<v 0>No, no, I know. But I also felt like I was yeah.</v>

129
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.770
Mentally and physically breaking down throughout the month, you know.

130
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.230
<v 1>I put also I was getting really into it. Yeah.</v>

131
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.220
<v 0>That's the thing that it actually, it feels like the soreness,</v>

132
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:44.690
you would feel drained, but you would feel the cloud in your mind clear, right?

133
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.430
<v 1>Yeah. You and I talked about the chatter. Yeah. Internal chatter gone.</v>

134
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.960
<v 0>Stress is stress is like, yeah, I didn't have nothing really bothered me.</v>

135
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.483
<v 1>It bothered me.</v>

136
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.780
<v 0>Like three hours.</v>

137
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.150
<v 1>And my wife back, I remember saying to my wife,</v>

138
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.050
you could get this in a pill with this. Is this feeling of not giving a,

139
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.790
like really not giving a because generally I don't give a about things. But man,

140
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.570
when I'm doing cardio for five hours a day, you don't give a.

141
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.663
You really don't.

142
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.290
<v 0>You don't get bothered by things by anything. And the stresses of life.</v>

143
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.250
Just really start.

144
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.900
<v 1>To lose any weight though.</v>

145
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.880
<v 0>Yeah. You don't have any weight to lose.</v>

146
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.910
<v 1>I thought I was going to get, I am obese.</v>

147
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.040
I thought I was going to get at least some weight loss because of it.

148
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.180
I didn't lose a pan.

149
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.570
<v 0>What's your body fat. It's gotta be like what? 7%.</v>

150
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.560
<v 1>It's probably around 10, but somewhere around 10. That's just.</v>

151
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.360
<v 0>Cutting water to.</v>

152
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.140
<v 1>Then I was drinking all the water, but I was eating everything too.</v>

153
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.080
But I think I might've even gained a pound. Yeah.

154
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.810
<v 0>I thought I was muscle. Not going to, like,</v>

155
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.370
I was like watching what I ate as the week, as the months started.

156
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.750
And then when it w when I saw how competitive it was going and like how crazy it

157
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:03.740
started to be like six and seven days of working out, it was anything in sight.

158
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.230
And I was never full.

159
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.890
<v 1>Never. I was eating boxes of cookies. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

160
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.260
In between workouts just kept eating,

161
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.430
ate a giant box of vanilla wafers ate the whole box. Just shoved them down.

162
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:20.600
My fat hole, drank soda, like regular soda, which I never drank.

163
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.430
I always drink diet Coke.

164
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.250
<v 2>November was back. Cause I was eating like that, but still working out.</v>

165
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.340
And then I just kept it in like that and stop working out.

166
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.174
And then what happened to me?

167
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.250
<v 1>Yeah. You got shredded for a dude. Yeah.</v>

168
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.340
<v 0>They told me at that gym. Yeah. That was that body for a little bit.</v>

169
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.670
[inaudible] uh, they told me they were like, every time somebody blows out,

170
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.770
cause we hit, you. Remember they had the point thing at my gym.

171
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.250
Like every time everyone, like, like the next month, there's such a dip.

172
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.570
And they're like, they're like,

173
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.930
and then you broke that record for like the highest total.

174
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:55.830
And then the biggest dip ever. I was like, this.

175
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.620
I was written November, dude. How long.

176
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.300
<v 1>Did you guys keep using the [inaudible] thing?</v>

177
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.870
<v 0>Just to see what it was like brought back like anxiety.</v>

178
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.180
Oh yeah. It makes you anxious. I used it for awhile and then I would not use,

179
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.120
then I would take it again. And then recently I lost it and they were like, oh,

180
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.210
you know, find it. I go, I don't want to find it. Yeah. Like I don't want it.

181
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.220
And then I did find it. And I was like,

182
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:22.620
I'm not putting it on the sound mind when I moved. And I was like,

183
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.500
I'm going to tell you, touch it, you touch it, put, throw it away. It's like.

184
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.350
<v 1>A, like the thing they found the extra system when they brought it back home.</v>

185
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.310
<v 0>Wherever report though.</v>

186
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.250
<v 1>It has given you heart rate variability.</v>

187
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.320
It's also telling you how much you've recovered,

188
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.640
which I think is very important.
