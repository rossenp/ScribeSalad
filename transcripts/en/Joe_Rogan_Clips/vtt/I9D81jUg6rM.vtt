00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.300
Because things would play it at the drive-in and then go away. Yeah.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.100
That was like, that's how I felt when the first time, um, when I loved,

4
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:14.550
when 40 strike, second street, New York was the real 42nd street. Right.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.800
And I remember it was so funny. Me and my friend,

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.030
my roommate back then we'd always go to 42nd street to see movies could be like

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:24.390
cannibal Holocaust. I would just see the posts. What the is cannibal Holocaust.

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.110
And he goes, see this Italian cannibal movie. This is literally the most vile.

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:33.030
I cannot believe another human made this movie. Right. It blows your mind.

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.330
But every time I went to 42nd street,

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.610
I saw a really bad incident happened. Like, you could not go there.

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.850
Like, we'd be like, wait in line. And like, oh,

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.580
let's go get some French fries for the movie. Two guys to start fighting.

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.600
And McDonald's one guy would just pummeled the other guy.

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.430
That'd be blood everywhere. I go. It happened next time we go,

16
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.800
we'd see guy stab another guy in the theater while watching there.

17
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:58.380
It is it like, literally I'd never went there once.

18
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.860
And even right till I was recording my album before I moved,

19
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.130
I remember walking to the studio, which was like maybe 43rd.

20
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.490
And there was a dead body lying there and they had just found them and they were

21
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:11.250
just starting to put the sheet. So I actually didn't see the violent act,

22
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:12.480
but I saw the dead body,

23
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.760
but he didn't care like New York. It was like New York.

24
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:22.110
When I moved to New York in 82, still seemed like, you know, taxi driver in.

25
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.110
<v 1>New York. Yeah. Well that was when it was, it was coming from.</v>

26
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.460
<v 0>Heyvrill.</v>

27
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.030
<v 1>West. So exciting. Cause Heyvrill so boring in comparison.</v>

28
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.070
<v 0>It couldn't be more boring if its goal was to be boring. It's gold medal.</v>

29
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.390
It's exceeded. I remember Haverhill was so bad that when we were kids,

30
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.490
I remember, I don't forget what maybe this was.

31
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:43.110
Maybe the bison were on the bicentennial.

32
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.900
I think they were trying to drive business because main street,

33
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.140
they can't even blame Walmart back then. It was dead. There was nothing there.

34
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:52.560
It was just a ghost town. And they're like, they just put all these banners up.

35
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.790
Heyvrill the All-American city. But it was like,

36
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.760
the catchphrase is going to matter.

37
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.510
<v 1>Make people open businesses So bad I'm to sell flags.</v>

38
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.600
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

39
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.960
I went to New York city for the first time in the eighties as well.

40
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.330
I'm trying to remember what year it was. It was like somewhere,

41
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:15.000
probably around 82 or 83. And uh,

42
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.050
when we were in the city driving around, I remember thinking like,

43
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:23.670
this is the craziest place I've ever been in my life. The buildings were so big.

44
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:25.770
It didn't make sense. Pulling up to it.

45
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.580
I remember we drove up on the west side highway and you see the city coming up

46
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:32.520
in the dislikes, see the buildings getting larger and larger as you get closer.

47
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.360
It's mental.

48
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.150
<v 0>It seemed real. I remember being on the sidewalk.</v>

49
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.880
Now this is coming from a place where a sidewalk means.

50
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.990
There's literally no other person on the sidewalk as far as you can see. Right.

51
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.690
And they was standing on the sidewalk and must've been uptown somewhere.

52
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.880
And it was like, you couldn't move with people. I was like, what is happening?

53
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.260
Right. I never seen like, this is how it is all the time.

54
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.290
Like I live in the street in Haverhill, like a car drive,

55
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.540
drove down it like once a day.

56
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.230
And it was probably your dad coming home from work. Like there was just nothing.

57
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.780
<v 1>If you could have, if you had a time machine though,</v>

58
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.240
and you went from 1982 and you said, Hey,

59
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.410
what do you think it's going to look like here in 2019, you'd be like, man,

60
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:16.420
it's going to be mad max. Like,

61
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.680
there'd be cars driving with black smoke coming out of him and people shooting

62
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:23.440
people right on the street. It's going to be, it's going to get worse. It's.

63
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.130
<v 0>Yeah. The only thing I remember right towards my end of being there,</v>

64
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.860
there was the Tompkins square, you know, downtown.

65
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.620
And that was where it's just like wherever homeless people live.

66
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.880
It was the alphabet city. It was like the worst. Um, well wait,

67
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:40.030
I want to back it up. When I first moved here the first night I was there,

68
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.780
this sounds like I'm making it up. And I'm not the first night I was there.

69
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.560
The dorm that I was in with all my roommates overlooked, um,

70
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.430
union square park, which is like needle park. You just went there to buy dope.

71
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.200
And that was it.

72
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.210
It was now you go there for cause it's a farmer's market and it's beautiful.

73
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.230
And I heard this guy screaming and screaming and screaming. I was like,

74
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.050
Jesus Christ. What's going on? Cause it was like a hundred degrees.

75
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.550
And of course there's no air conditioning.

76
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.800
I look out the window and I watched these cops beat up this guy. And I was like,

77
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.200
and then they dragged him down to the subway.

78
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.620
And the next day all these cops showed up at the dorms.

79
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.680
And it was that it was this guy, Michael Stewart.

80
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.450
It became a really famous case. He was a,

81
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.080
they called him a graffiti artists and he had been beat to death by the cops

82
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.440
and me and all my roommates saw it.

83
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.790
And the next day they came and took our statement and we all had to testify in

84
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.700
front of the grand jury. This is my first day out of Haverhill.

85
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.890
I witnessed a murder, but again,

86
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:41.500
it's like the same thing with like my deal at universal.

87
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.330
I was like to not even where to really comprehend.

88
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.340
<v 1>Like things are happening.</v>

89
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.800
<v 0>I'm so jaded. It didn't disturb me or seem like, I don't know.</v>

90
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.731
I don't know what's wrong with me,

91
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:58.630
but I am desensitized by all the violence I've witnessed as a child.

92
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.810
<v 1>Well that w what did you see more violence before that?</v>

93
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.400
<v 0>Well, there's one famous thing. I remember as a kid,</v>

94
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.000
there's two famous things. I just saw him when I was a kid.

95
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.190
The family business that my mom came from was like carnivals.

96
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.580
Like you ever see that movie Carney with Gary. Bucy,

97
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.960
that's exactly the life as a kid that I remember when I saw the movie,

98
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:26.620
I was like, this is, this is what this was our life. We were told.

99
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.770
<v 1>That makes sense. This attraction, you have these drifters.</v>

100
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.480
<v 0>I was always wanted. I was surrounded by.</v>

101
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.120
So that was the thing I remember as a kid,

102
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.550
except it was around 1977. I think it was, I remember kiss, love gun.

103
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.090
It just came out. Cause I was all.

104
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.033
<v 1>Talked about it.</v>

105
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.440
<v 0>And the family worked at my mom and dad and we,</v>

106
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:51.750
me and my brother had to work and sell food and stuff. And I hated,

107
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.900
I w we used to have to dip the candy apples in hand with people and they've

108
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.150
healed now. But I, all my hands I had, I had burns all over my hands.

109
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.160
Cause the apple candy would be so hot.

110
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.810
It would drip on my hand and burn my hands. Um, anyway, I digress.

111
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.530
But one night there was the gambling tents, which were all rigged, of course.

112
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.200
And someone had some guide getting fleeced for all of his money and came back

113
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:19.780
and lit the tent on fire. And then suddenly hit the fan.

114
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.630
Everybody that me and my little brother had been around all the time. It's like,

115
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.960
boom, all these guns start coming out and you start hearing guns popping up.

116
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.170
And then the tents just went like nothing was fireproof.

117
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.960
So everything's on fire. It's complete chaos.

118
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.370
And I was probably in fifth grade. My brother was probably in second grade,

119
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.140
everybody screaming and running around. And my, and this guy was like that.

120
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:44.540
I don't remember his name, but he worked there. He was like, Hey,

121
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:46.400
you guys should come over here. And before he finished the sentence,

122
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.990
somebody ran up and hit him in the face with a hammer and broke his whole face

123
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.850
opening. It was just gushing blood. And we're like,

124
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.800
and then eventually my parents got us in the car and we left, which was,

125
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.710
that was my parent. My mom was like, we're done. This is,

126
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:04.910
we're not doing this anymore. That was the last time we ever did it. Um, wow.

127
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.680
<v 1>What a great way to go out though. But the.</v>

128
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.370
<v 0>Best was going to school on September. Like what did you do this summer?</v>

129
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:14.510
And that was my story. Wow. We didn't go to Cape camp. Zyppah Saki.

130
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.370
We were in a carnival riot.

131
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.710
<v 1>What was the gambling tent? Like what kind of games are they rigging?</v>

132
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.181
<v 0>I don't know. I mean,</v>

133
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:27.740
everything's rigged like anything from an it's even a great scene in

134
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.040
Carney where, um, a friend of mine, who's in a lot of my moves,

135
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:32.000
Meg foster plays. When,

136
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.940
when she's holding all the long strands of rope and Joanie fought,

137
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:35.810
she's trained Jody. I was like,

138
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:40.070
you pull the rope and it's connected to a prize or I, or like everything's red.

139
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:44.660
Like the weighted led milk bottles. You're supposed to knock down the softball.

140
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:46.880
I mean, everything's rig. I mean,

141
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.860
it's certain ways that you know how to cheat him. So the,

142
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:51.200
when the guy showing you how to do it, look, it's so easy to throw it like this.

143
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:52.400
But as a certain way, you can throw it to work.

144
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:55.310
But otherwise I would never be in the gambling tans.

145
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.500
Cause they were actual gambling. We were like little tiny kids,

146
00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:01.610
but it was probably roulette wheels. I'm guessing things like that though.

147
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.010
You know, the guys spins it and break, get something on his foot.

148
00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:06.470
And it never stops on the number that the guy's got all of his money on.

149
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.880
Cause he let him win a bunch of times or something.

150
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.150
<v 1>So when the fire broke out and people started shooting who.</v>

151
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.790
<v 0>Was shooting at who? I don't know what was going on. I just, you know,</v>

152
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.760
we're a little kids like you don't really comprehending this going on only

153
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:20.510
fourth or fifth grade. Just like that. Guy's now got a gun. I hear gunshots.

154
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:22.640
Everything's on fire. There's smoke people screaming.

155
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:25.640
This guy is now gushing brains out of the front of his head.

156
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.770
So I said, there were two stories. I was, oh, the second story.

157
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.850
The second story I kind of put in this, the new movie three from hell.

158
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.110
This was like a, when I was in high school, it was in the backyard,

159
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.190
uh, rehearsing with my two friends or, you know, band or whatever.

160
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.480
And we heard the screaming and it was a bright sunny day that seemed like a

161
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:48.950
David Lynch movie suburbia.

162
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.240
And this fat naked guy was running down the street covered in blood.

163
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.560
He'd been stabbed a whole bunch of times.

164
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.540
Only people are mowing their lawns and looking at,

165
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.020
and I just remembered a bloody naked guy running down the street,

166
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:04.080
screaming like a weird scream. People scream weird when they get stabbed.

167
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.660
And um, so I put some, something like that in the movie, but it just, yeah.

168
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.930
What happened to him? I don't know. I don't know. He was like ran out.

169
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.100
He was knocking on people's doors. Like, hi, hello. He let me in. And again,

170
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.730
I was like, oh, that's weird. And I just went back and we continued rehearsing.

171
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.580
Whoa. Like again.

172
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.500
<v 1>That must've flavored the music a little bit. Yeah. I don't.</v>

173
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.070
<v 0>Know. Just like I should be. I should be really bothered by things like that,</v>

174
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.383
but I'm not.

175
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.950
<v 1>Yeah. Well, I mean, there's a thing that happens when you see too much.</v>

176
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:39.870
It's one of the reasons why cops and soldiers have some of the artists

177
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.380
sense of humor. I can see that. Yeah. They've just seen too many bodies.

178
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.270
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I mean,</v>

179
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:48.240
imagine the guys that have to come scrape up all the stuff off the road and put

180
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:53.070
it in the bags and he's yeah. I mean, after, you know yeah.

181
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.250
But yeah, that was the life. I remember it. I remember my mom's brother.

182
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.570
He would always, uh, he didn't always use, but sometimes he was a biker,

183
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:04.210
so he'd come over to the house and he had a chopper with iron crosses on it and

184
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.720
he kind of looked at limited the big mustache. And I was like, this guy is bad,

185
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.020
like drives around the neighborhoods where everyone can see us. You know,

186
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.740
it was a lot of that stuff.
