00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I know you're not a big basketball guy,</v>

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.480
but have you been watching that at all? I don't not. No. I heard.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.313
<v 1>It's amazing though.</v>

4
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.360
<v 0>Yeah. That's one where I literally thought of you during this last one.</v>

5
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:14.400
And I'm like, I know Joe, isn't watching this cuz of basketball,

6
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.680
but you would love it because, um,

7
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.560
especially this last one,

8
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.310
coach Phil Jackson and his brain and the way he can motivate people,

9
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.190
I mean, it is shocking and never out of everything I've ever watched.

10
00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:34.630
Have I paused something and just thought about it for a few minutes and then hit

11
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.470
play again and rewind again on a documentary. It's insane.

12
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.100
Well.

13
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.780
<v 1>He's a Sue winner, you know? Yep. Those are always really interesting.</v>

14
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.100
Like anyone who's that driven to be such a winner.

15
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.500
Like you stand out amongst winners as being so exceptional that everybody like

16
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.460
who's the goat. Michael Jordan is always the first pick. Yep. Right?

17
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:58.860
There's the, the there's wonder like how would LeBron, how would,

18
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.340
how would this, that, but everybody always says, Michael,

19
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.170
like to be that much of a super winner,

20
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:06.210
you think about all the people that are playing basketball,

21
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.170
all the people that are around him that are world class athletes. Yeah.

22
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:11.690
Professional athletes. And he stands out amongst.

23
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.690
<v 0>Them. Well, he's so wildly competitive that he will beat you in your own game.</v>

24
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.690
He will ask you what you're playing. Yeah. If you were playing with something,

25
00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:23.760
you go, what is that? And he will immediately start.

26
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.840
And his only goal is to beat you at what you love and what you think you are

27
00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:30.320
good at, whatever it is.

28
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.760
So it just happens to be the basketball's the one that yeah. He chose.

29
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.520
But also then he got that way with shoes, with like, he's like, all right, well,

30
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:42.360
if I'm gonna sign a shoe deal, then I'm gonna do this the right way.

31
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.270
<v 1>Doesn't he do that with golf too? Doesn't he really in a gambling with golf?</v>

32
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.193
Everything.

33
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.870
<v 0>Yeah. They were throwing,</v>

34
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:52.030
they throw coins against a wall and he's gambling with the security guards and

35
00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:54.870
he can't wait to take their money. &lt;laugh&gt; he can't wait. He cannot wait.

36
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.710
He's talking to these guys that are protecting him. That is so.

37
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.783
<v 1>Crazy.</v>

38
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.990
<v 0>That's so crazy in a game where you throw, try to,</v>

39
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.500
to get the closest to the wall with a quarter, he used.

40
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.380
<v 1>To have a celebrity, uh, pool tournament in Chicago. Wow. Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.060
He had a pool tournament that he did all the time,

42
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:14.260
like a charity pool tournament. And I heard if you beat him at pool,

43
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:15.100
he hates you. Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.620
<v 0>&lt;Affirmative&gt; yep. That sounds about right.</v>

45
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.460
&lt;laugh&gt; everything that I'm gathering from this documentary is that if you're a

46
00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:22.294
super.

47
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.010
<v 1>I mean, I, not just a regular winner, but a, just a super winner.</v>

48
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.650
He's so off the charts, as far as like to,

49
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.210
to be that kind of an achiever, you have to have a madness about you.

50
00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:38.010
That's probably intolerable for most people. Yeah.

51
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.650
Just the desire to win conquer. In other days, man,

52
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.640
those are gladiators and other days generals mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

53
00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:49.840
there's a lot of people that get into pro sports that it is it's really in a lot

54
00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:51.320
of ways, it's it,

55
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.600
it moves them away from war in the best way that we know how

56
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.800
possible. But if we didn't have those,

57
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.400
if there was no sports and people just conquered each other,

58
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.480
those would be the Kings of the.

59
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.720
<v 2>World. It came up in the Jordan documentary too.</v>

60
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.080
He was like maybe 200 pounds for the first couple years of his career.

61
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.640
And then bulked up to two 15 solid muscle.

62
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.960
<v 1>Yeah. I heard he was after playing the pistons. There was,</v>

63
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.000
there were real physical.

64
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.660
<v 2>His trainer,</v>

65
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.950
he said would go back after every game and count the number of steps he took

66
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.550
with each foot in the direction he was taking.

67
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.270
So he would know how tired he should be and what he should be doing for him the

68
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:27.650
next day.

69
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.070
<v 1>And whatnot. Oh my gosh. So he had left foot, right?</v>

70
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:31.790
Foot left foot is back right foot for.

71
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.950
<v 2>He, he would play, which they don't do today. He played in all, all 82 games.</v>

72
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.940
He was rarely hurt cuz he knew that people were coming,

73
00:03:40.941 --> 00:03:44.700
which was true to see him play. And if he didn't give them that performance,

74
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.780
he felt like he was cheating everyone.

75
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.780
<v 0>And every time he would play anyone for the first time he</v>

76
00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:54.460
needed to show like he could never,

77
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.020
ever let anyone ever make them feel

78
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.810
they got one over on him.

79
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.810
So not only each game for the audience that are seeing him for the

80
00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:08.050
first time in which he needs to dominate,

81
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.170
but especially towards his opponent who literally thinks that maybe,

82
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.290
maybe today will be my lucky day. You know, I'm going up against Jordan.

83
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.290
This is, you know, it's the middle of the season. He'll probably,

84
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.840
he's not gonna, he puts up 60 points or whatever in your face,

85
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.720
like embarrass you, you fall on the ground. He crosses you over.

86
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.000
He does everything that, you know, you get embarrassed.

87
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.760
He would try to make a fool out of these people.

88
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.920
<v 1>I remember the first time I saw a photo of him,</v>

89
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.360
it looked like he had left from center court. Yeah. Flying through the air.

90
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.310
Yeah. To dunk. And I'm a like who, how does a human even do that?

91
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.250
Yeah.

92
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.470
How does a 200 plus pound human fly through the air like that?

93
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.110
<v 0>And, and you know, even towards the end of his career,</v>

94
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.550
they just showed one where it's the all star game.

95
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.430
So he got to go up against Kobe Bryant for the first time because they're in two

96
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:02.420
different conference is that don't normally play.

97
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.900
And Kobe's this 18 year old that just, you know,

98
00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:08.260
went straight from high school to the NBA,

99
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.300
completely dominating his side of things,

100
00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:13.420
going up against Jordan for the first time ever.

101
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.020
And everybody on Kobe's side is saying, you know,

102
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:20.380
Kobe asked us to let him have Jordan and Jordan's on his side.

103
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.130
They have act footage.

104
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.770
That's what's crazy about this documentary is that somehow this camera crew,

105
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.950
Jordan,

106
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.490
let them come along in the ride in this green room for all this crazy exclusive

107
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:37.090
content. And he's saying to the guys, he goes, you guys all know this is in the,

108
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.690
not the green room, but the locker room before you guys,

109
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:43.520
you guys all know this kid's coming after me. Right? Like he's gonna want me,

110
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.560
so let me have him, blah, blah, blah, blah, cuz he wants to show the kid.

111
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.960
And sure enough, even though Kobe's 18 in peak peak,

112
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.320
peak physical condition, Jordan wins the MVP of that all star game.

113
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.720
Crushing it against a young Kobe Bryant. Well.

114
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.840
<v 1>How crazy was he? He decided in the middle of all that,</v>

115
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.200
I'm just gonna play baseball. Yeah. I'm just gonna be the best at baseball.

116
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.240
<v 2>That comes up. He get there's. They go deep into, which is interesting.</v>

117
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.960
How the media and a,

118
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.240
not a social media time period was hammering him because they built him up to be

119
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.920
this young guy out of North Carolina,

120
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.910
Olympic superstar killing,

121
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:22.950
literally scored more points than anybody's ever scored as a rookie in the NBA,

122
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.230
all this attention. And now he's the man.

123
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.390
And they started like beating him down with some of the gambling stuff he was

124
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.430
doing. It got out leaked out and then just added attention. And he's like,

125
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.190
you know, this. I'm gonna quit. I'm out. See it.

126
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.980
<v 1>Quit. Wow. Because of all the negative tension, that's what they said.</v>

127
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.100
Interesting. Makes sense. Yeah.

128
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.700
Well that's what happens when you become that guy?

129
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.420
You there's so much interest like to, to be that guy. First of all,

130
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.860
you have to have a fire burning inside.

131
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:54.180
You like most people will never be able to comprehend and a guy like that's

132
00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:56.300
gonna be into other kinds of wild too, like gambling.

133
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.450
He's gonna wanna have thrill mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

134
00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.290
he's gonna drive fast cars. He's gonna, he's a wild man,

135
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.370
a wild man at the peak of like one of the, I mean,

136
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.170
if you think about professional basketball,

137
00:07:07.171 --> 00:07:11.690
you watch an NBA game and all the thought that's involved in which way you're

138
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:13.370
going and the ability to explode.

139
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.210
And then the ability to in the middle of all that land,

140
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.720
a precision shot into a hole. There's really not another sport like that.

141
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.320
I mean, baseball is, uh,

142
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.400
you're trying to hit something that's coming at you like crazy.

143
00:07:26.401 --> 00:07:30.160
You're swinging as fast as you can. And there's a lot of skill to that as well,

144
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.120
obviously. And there's a lot of skill to pitching,

145
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.160
but there's something unique about basketball and that in all this chaos,

146
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.710
you gotta find stillness in all this chaos.

147
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.830
You gotta find the ability to stop and throw a perfect shot off.

148
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.990
So it's not just in incredible physical ability.

149
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.550
It's incredible physical ability and then touch. Yep. It's real weird. Yeah.

150
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.390
It's a very interesting sport in that way.

151
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.910
It requires you to have your together. Yeah. Like to execute that shot,

152
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.660
to have your together and you have to have mad practice.

153
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.660
Like one of the things that I used to love, uh, about growing up in Boston was,

154
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.420
uh, Larry Bird stories.

155
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.540
Like Larry Bird was apparently just an insanely disciplined

156
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.660
professional basketball player.

157
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.260
He would get there and practice before everybody stay.

158
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:19.500
After everybody practice things left and run.

159
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.810
And when they would have those three point competitions,

160
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.370
remember we would have those Allstar three point competitions in the locker

161
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.204
room. He would just be,

162
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.610
which one of you guys coming in second that's what would do just walk in &lt;laugh&gt;

163
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.690
they all knew, but it was just because he, first of all,

164
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:37.930
he could execute under pressure. And two, he was just better.

165
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:43.120
He could do things better than people. And even he said,

166
00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:47.160
sometimes he thought it was God pretended to be Michael Jordan. Yeah.

167
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.200
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah. That's how good Michael Jordan was.

168
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.080
<v 0>Every single legend is completely.</v>

169
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.840
They have such good interviews with one with everybody.

170
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:02.240
Imagine they have such great stories. It's crazy how, you know,

171
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.320
I've always said a documentary has the potential to destroy to

172
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.720
be better than any other type of story.

173
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.440
Whether it be a movie or a book because it it's unbeliev.

174
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.390
It's like the tiger king, if it's amazing and it's real,

175
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.110
you can't beat it. You can't beat it. And uh,

176
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.670
that's what the last dance is doing. It's crazy.
