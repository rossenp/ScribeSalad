WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.180
<v 0>And so when I first saw it, I might like,</v>

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.980
I started my career as a hypnotist and I,

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.900
I saw this guy performing at university and I, uh, I just thought I'm going to,

4
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:12.060
I'm going to do that. I just, I, I didn't realize at the time,

5
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:15.210
all these boxes that it was ticking, you know, performing that sort of,

6
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:16.044
you know,

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.580
need for affirmation and love and center of attention and also the control

8
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:24.600
aspect of it, you know, the kind of, um, uh, yeah,

9
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:28.410
the control aspect and also the kind of people that,

10
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:32.100
particularly the sort of guys that would respond well to hypnosis and come up on

11
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.260
stage and, you know, I'd respond well to,

12
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:37.110
it tended to be exactly the kind of guys that would have really intimidated me

13
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:39.920
before. So that was later at an unconscious level.

14
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.140
And I hope I've grown out of that now mainly, but, uh, yeah,

15
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:48.210
it ticks a lot of it ticks a lot of boxes. So that was, that's how I started.

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.750
And yams definitely driven by insecurity because at Eddie's any sort of magic,

17
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.730
which sort of followed for me on from the hypnosis,

18
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.180
you're basically it is the quickest,

19
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.600
most fraudulent route to impressing people. That's, you know,

20
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.910
the subtext is only, you know, look at me on Tigray,

21
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.180
which is not that interesting after, after a while. So I've tried to, you know,

22
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.720
as I, as I've grown up, I've tried to move it into a different area.

23
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.780
And one that's a little more resonant than just showing off.

24
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.150
<v 1>That's fascinating that you started out doing it hypnosis shows at a comedy</v>

25
00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:17.984
show.

26
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.890
<v 2>No, it was sort of, um, I would mainly perform it.</v>

27
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.813
<v 0>Like, uh,</v>

28
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.290
colleges and I do a demonstration and then have questions and often, uh,

29
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.410
questions and answers afterwards. And I wasn't making people look stupid.

30
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:33.530
It was an entertainment show and I guess it was kind of funny, but it was, um,

31
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.690
it was, uh,

32
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.760
it was just a really interesting thing and the trouble with doing it onstage

33
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.370
is of course it gets mixed up with people just kind of playing along and stuff.

34
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:45.770
So it's, but if you take that out of it,

35
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.010
it's just a really interesting era and I've done this stuff for, you know,

36
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.040
20 years back home, and I'm not, I don't think of myself as a hypnotist.

37
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:53.990
That was just kind of where I, where I started. But the,

38
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.630
that the suggestion based techniques of that is something I've continued

39
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.080
with and brought into different areas. And I still don't fully understand it.

40
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.190
You know, now it's, there's,

41
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.480
you can have a quiet climates inside someone's head and know what they're

42
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:09.890
experiencing. Like I used to do in the,

43
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.060
when I used to do these like stage hypnosis shows. The last thing I did was to,

44
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.790
I tell these people on stage that I was invisible. Right. And I'd,

45
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.800
I'd float something through the air, right?

46
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.680
Like this bottle I've got here and it's normally something bigger,

47
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:24.890
like a chair and they'd be freaking out, you know, running off stage and so on.

48
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.240
But afterwards when I'd have this kind of Q and a I'd, um, I'd ask them, well,

49
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:31.640
what was your, what was your actual experience? Like,

50
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.830
like the show's over and I'll be honest, what were you,

51
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.560
what were you experiencing? And you'd get some people that would say, well,

52
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.100
yeah, you were obviously just floating that you were just holding it,

53
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:42.740
but I kind of felt like I had to play along and then you'd get this interesting

54
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.850
air in the middle of, of like, well, I kind of, I, now, when I think back, yes,

55
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:49.220
of course it was you, but it was, and I sort of knew it was you,

56
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:51.590
but I emotionally just completely,

57
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.120
I could only experience it as a terrifying floating bottle or whatever it was.

58
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.350
So that's a bit like an actor, like getting caught up in a role. I like,

59
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:01.960
they know, they know they're onstage and it's a character, but nonetheless,

60
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:02.800
emotionally committed.

61
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.610
And at the other extreme people that would not accept that it was me floating.

62
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.490
It just, they, that must've been on a wire or something. There's no,

63
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.490
there's no way that I can drop you back at the picture,

64
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:14.830
in my memory of that thing. So how do you know, how do you,

65
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.080
how do you judge what that experience is when there's, and,

66
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.050
and all those people that are saying, no, you are really invisible.

67
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.810
Are they just saying that because they want to be like the best subjects in

68
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.150
that, in that group. I mean, how do you tease it all apart?

69
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.890
<v 1>That is the, is that, that must be a real issue, right?</v>

70
00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:32.010
The people that just want to please you and are playing along,

71
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.770
how can you tell when, if you were hip and dicing.

72
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.950
<v 0>People? Yeah, I can tell, but I, the way I use it now is kind of,</v>

73
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.130
I use it quite sort of subtly in the show.

74
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.390
I don't like overtly, you know, hypnotized people. Um,

75
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.820
so that means it can mean one of two things. It either means it just,

76
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.910
I'm not interested in people playing along because I'm not just trying to create

77
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:55.110
the effect of someone hypnotized.

78
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:58.050
They need to genuinely be responding to this thing in order for the next bit to

79
00:03:58.051 --> 00:04:01.230
work. Uh, in which case I have to filter out anybody playing along,

80
00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:05.580
but occasionally, occasionally it doesn't matter. Like a lot of the time,

81
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:07.890
like I'll get people up on stage and I'll shake their hand.

82
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:12.030
And there there's a rapid handshake induction that the guidance know just falls

83
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:13.530
to the floor. Um,

84
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.580
and there are times that that matters and they have to be,

85
00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:19.080
that has to be a really honest response.

86
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.990
Other times I can tell they're sort of half into it and they're just a bit

87
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:25.290
intimidated. And, but for the 2000 people looking that might look,

88
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.380
they kind of might look like the same thing. And then how does that exactly.

89
00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:31.590
Does that work? The handshake induction, it's a, uh,

90
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.790
I take no responsibility for explaining this to your tens of millions of

91
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.600
listeners and viewers. Um, but, uh, it's, it's, you're,

92
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:43.740
you're interrupting a, an automatic process, right? This is the,

93
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:47.520
this is the key to it. There's made popular by, um,

94
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.490
made popular by it. I guess, Richard Bandler,

95
00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:52.830
who's the guy behind NLP and so on. Um,

96
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.890
I don't know if he kind of created this thing, but perhaps, uh,

97
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.730
perhaps Erickson did before him. I dunno. Anyway, you, you,

98
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.220
you take an automatic process and you interrupted in the middle.

99
00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:03.930
So like when you're shaking hands with somebody,

100
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.430
that's such a familiar process that when you start, you're not thinking, okay,

101
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:09.750
I'm going to grip this person's hand now,

102
00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:11.730
and I'm going to move my hand up and down with them a few times,

103
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.610
then I'll take my hand to what you just kind of do it automatically.

104
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.890
And there's something about interrupting that, that leaves people

105
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.180
really flummoxed and the world is because they're really,

106
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.080
really caught off guard.

107
00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:27.420
Like if you imagine somebody comes up to you in the street and says,

108
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.010
it's not half past seven, you know, your reaction isn't to go, yeah,

109
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.100
I know it's, uh, 20 past nine, your reaction is, is a sort of,

110
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.250
you think like you've missed something like you're trying to make sense of it.

111
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:41.970
It's a strange, uh, kind of puts you on the back foot.

112
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.530
And at that point, if you,

113
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.220
if you've got somebody who's fairly suggestible and people coming up on stage,

114
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.630
it's such an odd moment for them. Anyway,

115
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.430
they're naturally very suggestible that a clear instruction to sleep or

116
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.280
whatever you want to give them tends to be taken very deeply.

117
00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:58.730
And very often you'll see I'll shake hands and I'll,

118
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.650
I'll break the pattern at the handshakes. Well,

119
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.660
I'll often take their hand and lift it up to their face and say sleep and show

120
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.930
them their hand like that. And they just sleep and well, it's not sleep,

121
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:11.570
but it's a kind of, um, it looks like, I mean,

122
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:16.010
they they'll do anything from eyes closed, head drops down to just drop like a,

123
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.810
like a dead weight on the floor. You know,

124
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.610
I found this most interesting actually was, um,

125
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.700
like applying this in slightly more useful everyday situations was as a sort

126
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:30.140
of, um, like a self-defense technique. I was walking, uh,

127
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.150
between. So I was like, it must've been like 20 or something.

128
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.930
And I was at a magic convention and I was walking from one hotel to another and

129
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.370
I'd dress it like a three-piece velvet suit as a skinny British,

130
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.710
I might as well have, you know, punched me in the throat,

131
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.670
tattooed across my face. And this guy comes up and he's like, he's drunk.

132
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.670
It was about three in the morning. Drunk, aggressive is with his girlfriend,

133
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.440
clearly looking for a fight. And, uh, he sort of,

134
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.120
he comes up to me and he says, well, what are you,

135
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:00.470
what are you looking at when you're looking at?

136
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.420
And because I'd spoken about this, how to deal with this sort of thing,

137
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:07.100
but it never found myself in this situation.

138
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:09.890
I kind of had it all mentally rehearsed. So I said to him,

139
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.980
I said the wall outside my house, isn't four foot high.

140
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.320
And I guess there's an equivalent to this with a sort of adrenaline dump.

141
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:21.710
I think it's called in a, in martial arts, but there's a, it just like,

142
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.280
he's got all this adrenaline and then a thing like that for me,

143
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:27.380
which is just out of context, like, it makes sense.

144
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:30.500
I'm not like talking jibberish. It makes sense, but it's just out of context.

145
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.970
Right? So now suddenly his thinking I've missed something. So now he,

146
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.080
he was sort of, he went what, and I said, his girlfriend walked off and I said,

147
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.570
well, the wall outside my house, isn't four foot high.

148
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.150
I spent some time in Spain, the walls that were very high.

149
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:46.390
But if you look at the ones here that they're tiny. Yeah. Nothing.

150
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.660
And then he just sort of broke down and he sort of went what.

151
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.600
<v 2>Ha and, uh, start crying what you.</v>

152
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.600
<v 0>Eat. No, it wasn't quit crying, but it was just, it was like all the stress,</v>

153
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.660
the rental and everything just, just flooded out of him.

154
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:02.650
And he sat down and I ended up sitting next to him on the, uh, like, you know,

155
00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:07.030
on the roadside, um, asking him, you know, so what I was,

156
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.850
the plan was I was going to try and stick his feet to the floor and I had his

157
00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:14.440
whole plan and he just kind of collapsed and sat down. Yeah. That was the,

158
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.710
I knew it'd be like this highly suggestible state and like either way,

159
00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:20.560
the moment of aggression passed, but I ended up,

160
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.880
ended up really sitting with him,

161
00:08:21.881 --> 00:08:24.670
asking him what had happened that evening and his girlfriend,

162
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.860
I think she'd bottled somebody or something horrible had happened.

163
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.650
So we'd got out with all this aggression, but it's a, it's a good one. Isn't it?

164
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:33.040
If you just have like, um, it could be just a song lyric or just some,

165
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.900
some weird kind of thing that you can just go into in those situations. I mean,

166
00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:41.260
if someone's running at you with a knife, it's a bit difficult, but you just,

167
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:44.950
you, you're kind of strangely taking control of a situation.

168
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.810
Otherwise what you're going to do, if they say, what are you looking at?

169
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.070
You can't, there's no way you can answer that without being on the back foot.

170
00:08:51.071 --> 00:08:55.030
So it just kind of nicely kind of inverts the situation and puts them on the

171
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.230
back foot, which anyway, it worked, it was, uh, it was kind of.

172
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.153
<v 1>Fun.</v>

173
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.530
Isn't there like a process required to hypnotize someone.

174
00:09:03.531 --> 00:09:06.740
You could just do it that way and saying it didn't just talk them through some

175
00:09:06.741 --> 00:09:09.500
sort of a program that makes them think their foot is stuck to the floor.

176
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.820
<v 0>I, it, it all depends on the moment I had,</v>

177
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.590
I used to hypnotize people in my, um, in my room when I was a student. Right.

178
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:22.070
So I was the guy that did hypnosis. I'd have people coming, you know,

179
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.520
regularly coming to try it out. And, um, I, this,

180
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.380
this one time I used to leave people with like, if they were responsive to it.

181
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.500
And this was like, I was really early days. It was like, you know, 20 minutes,

182
00:09:33.501 --> 00:09:34.910
half an hour of relaxing somebody,

183
00:09:34.911 --> 00:09:38.420
and maybe suggesting that their hands were getting light and floating or heavy

184
00:09:38.421 --> 00:09:41.180
and they couldn't lift them. So it kind of, you know, kind of basic stuff,

185
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.750
but I would leave them if they were very suggestible with the instruction that

186
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.480
when you come back, if I click my fingers, you'll go back into the sleep state.

187
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.150
And they, you know, they kind of get conditioned to that. And it, you know,

188
00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:54.680
it'll often work even like a week later and this guy came and, uh,

189
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.500
I thought I'd seen him before. I thought he'd been on a previous week.

190
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.800
So he sat down and went, okay, look at me and sleep, click my fingers.

191
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.340
And he went out, whatever that means. Right. And then we did whatever it was.

192
00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:04.941
Maybe, you know,

193
00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:08.390
perhaps he wanted to stop smoking or his hands floating in the air or whatever

194
00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:09.320
it wasn't at the end of it.

195
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:14.240
I realized in talking to him that I hadn't met him before. So then I'm like,

196
00:10:14.241 --> 00:10:18.200
well, how did, how did, why did you respond to me clicking my fingers?

197
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.550
Because I don't have magic fingers.

198
00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:22.040
There's nothing like anything going on here other than,

199
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.120
and I realized it was just that it was just that moment of my kind of confidence

200
00:10:26.121 --> 00:10:26.421
with it.

201
00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:30.920
And the fact fortuitously that he was also very suggestible and put those two

202
00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:33.320
things together. And that's what made it work. It was just that,

203
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.990
that psychological moment for him that was more important than the nature of the

204
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:41.420
20 minute script that I'd been learning and using up to that point.

205
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.980
So that was kind of a semblance of Seminole.

206
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.300
<v 1>Your confidence in that he had already been under yeah.</v>

207
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.390
<v 0>Question it because I believed he had. And so it just kind of,</v>

208
00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:52.730
it just sort of happened. And then he just,

209
00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:55.790
if he hadn't been a suggestible type, then it probably wouldn't have worked,

210
00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.170
but luckily he was, and that kind of really, really changed the way that I, uh,

211
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.910
that I, you know, thought about hypnosis and also started this, you know,

212
00:11:04.911 --> 00:11:09.710
this realization that ultimately my, my kind of toolkit with what I do is,

213
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:13.430
is the stories that people are telling themselves. That's, that's kind of,

214
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.890
that's really, you know,

215
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.520
all there is even a magician showing you a card trick is just getting you to

216
00:11:19.521 --> 00:11:21.650
tell yourself a story, edit,

217
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.970
edit this event in such a way that you go, oh, you know,

218
00:11:25.971 --> 00:11:28.490
I picked a card and then it disappeared. And it was, it was in my pocket.

219
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.060
He never went near me. And you edit out all the bits that don't seem important.

220
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.210
Like when he complimented you on your jacket earlier on in the day and may have

221
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:36.740
stuck a card in there,

222
00:11:36.741 --> 00:11:39.230
or the bit where he took the card back for a moment or whatever.

223
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.370
Cause you don't, you know, you're, you're,

224
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.480
you're being sold a story with particular sort of edit points.

225
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.870
And you know, to me, that's interesting cause that's what, that's what life is.

226
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:52.370
You know, we have this infinite data source coming at us and we can, we just,

227
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.310
we have to kind of reduce it to stories to make, to make sense.

228
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.100
I think stripping aside,

229
00:11:57.101 --> 00:12:01.900
all the kind of vaudeville and tacky associations of hypnotists and magicians

230
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:02.231
and so on.

231
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:04.240
I think there's something there's something interesting at the heart of it.

232
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:09.130
I think that, that our storytelling capacity is kind of

233
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.840
endlessly fascinating.

234
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.440
<v 1>Well, it's fascinating in that regard,</v>

235
00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:16.830
but it's also fascinating that it seems there seems to be like some cheat code

236
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.780
to the human mind. Like there's a,

237
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:23.580
there's a way you can like lock into like an admin panel and all of a

238
00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:26.190
sudden you're, you're doing things like telling people,

239
00:12:26.191 --> 00:12:29.580
they don't really don't want to be smoking or putting them into this hypnotic

240
00:12:29.581 --> 00:12:34.380
mindset by just snapping your fingers and saying sleep like it's odd.

241
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.910
I don't think, I don't think it is that I think.

242
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.420
<v 0>It looks like that. And that's the problem because it looks, it it's,</v>

243
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.180
you so often see it when performers are doing it.

244
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.940
When they're often going for a kind of theatrical effect.

245
00:12:44.941 --> 00:12:49.020
If you go and look at it like a clinical environment where hypnosis is being

246
00:12:49.021 --> 00:12:53.550
investigated, it isn't like that at all. Um, it's much more, uh,

247
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.330
kind of boring in a way. It doesn't, it doesn't have any theater attached to it.

248
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.020
It's much more on, you know, kind of intuitively understandable.

249
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.850
<v 1>But like been hypnotized herself. I'm terrible.</v>

250
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.440
<v 0>I'm a really bad, really bad subject.</v>

251
00:13:04.441 --> 00:13:08.010
I had one experience where I only one when I was, um,

252
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.210
in like a workshop thing that I was there is like a, you know, uh,

253
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.530
paying a person. I wasn't giving the workshop. And, um,

254
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.130
I was sat with, uh, the, the exercise was, it really worked for me.

255
00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:24.000
It may work for others. So you're split into pairs. And, uh,

256
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.230
the idea is you start to describe a scene. So you sat up, sat with this woman,

257
00:13:28.231 --> 00:13:29.010
you close your eyes,

258
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.880
you start to describe a scene and you go back and forth adding details. Right.

259
00:13:32.881 --> 00:13:35.250
So she says, oh, okay, I'm laying on a beach. And um,

260
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.050
so I just imagined that like, okay, now I'm going to beach and I can, um, I can,

261
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.750
uh, feel the warmth of the sun on my face.

262
00:13:42.751 --> 00:13:45.450
So I'm just kind of like imagining it and joining him at the story.

263
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.610
And then I just remember somebody goes, okay, guys, time up time for lunch.

264
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.990
And I, I S I had been on a, behind beat on a beach and I had completely just,

265
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.870
I'd been there like a dream. It was completely real.

266
00:13:57.871 --> 00:13:59.790
At some point it had tipped into that.

267
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.550
That's the only experience I've had of it. Other than that,

268
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.770
I don't respond to it. I'm just not, I think it's just,

269
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.810
it's just suggestibility. It's something about, uh,

270
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.940
and we get it when you know, where you would get it.

271
00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:14.910
When a doctor gives us a placebo and we respond to that because this authority

272
00:14:14.911 --> 00:14:18.630
figure is giving us that, or, or the way we absorb, uh,

273
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.690
opinions of people that we admire and experts that we admire.

274
00:14:21.691 --> 00:14:24.420
How we just more easily take those on board on questioningly.

275
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:28.040
This is all the same thing. It's just suggestion. Um, the trouble is,

276
00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:30.920
is it most of the time it's done through the,

277
00:14:30.921 --> 00:14:33.050
the world of the performing hypnotist, which isn't, doesn't,

278
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.140
isn't giving really a very clear and fair view of what's of what's going on.

279
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.540
<v 1>Because it's so theatrical. And so.</v>

280
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.000
<v 0>Often you, you know, you're,</v>

281
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.330
you're relishing and things like I click my fingers and this guy went to sleep,

282
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.560
but that's not really, you know, the, what are they doing there? Are they just,

283
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.400
I think just kind of, cause you've just asked them to,

284
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.850
and they know that when you click the fingers they're supposed to go to sleep is

285
00:14:55.851 --> 00:15:00.710
there's a real range of possible experiences that you might look like a power,

286
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:02.240
but it doesn't mean it is. They might just be.

287
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.920
<v 2>Just complying. I don't.</v>

288
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.140
<v 0>I was going to do some of this stuff on stage without using the hypnosis to</v>

289
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:09.770
show that this,

290
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.900
I don't think there's anything that happens under hypnosis that can't be done

291
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:16.640
without. Uh, and I was, uh, having this discussion with my friend,

292
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.180
Andy, who directs and co-writes my stage shows with me. And, uh,

293
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.640
I was saying like that thing of, you know, when you,

294
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.320
when a hypnotist gets someone to eat an onion and says, you know,

295
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:29.780
this is a classic hypnotic, stung gives them a raw onion and says,

296
00:15:29.781 --> 00:15:32.060
it's a delicious, juicy apple. Now eat it and enjoy it.

297
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:36.590
And you get somebody munching into an onion, like having no problem eating it.

298
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:37.670
I was like,

299
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.510
I'm sure it feels like if you're just going to pull it off without hypnosis,

300
00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:43.760
would that just happen anyway? And Andy said, I bet,

301
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.000
I bet you can just do it anyway. And he went to my fridge, took out an onion,

302
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.820
took a big bite of it and it was fine because he's right.

303
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:51.350
So he's proving a point there, right?

304
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:55.400
So he's in a different mental state than somebody going go on a day to take a

305
00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:58.910
bite of that onion when suddenly you're like, you're preempting the, you know,

306
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:01.610
the disgust and, uh, all the reasons not to do it. Yeah.

307
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.820
But the fact that he was just going, I bet you can do it.

308
00:16:03.821 --> 00:16:06.610
And trying to prove a point, man, you did it. And it was fine. So that,

309
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.790
that was a different mental state worked that wasn't hypnosis,

310
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.200
but the end result still,

311
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.470
if you do that on stage and pretended to hypnotize somebody first,

312
00:16:14.471 --> 00:16:18.160
it would look like you've done something amazing. So yeah, I dunno.

313
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.110
Is it it's it's to me, it's just,

314
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.080
it's just that story that someone's telling themselves. Well.

315
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.990
<v 1>It didn't, it did, it tastes like an onion to him or did it, but it.</v>

316
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.090
<v 0>Just it's just, it would have no, no, no, no.</v>

317
00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:30.580
It would have tasted like an onion. There was no suggestion about the way.

318
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:35.170
<v 1>The people that are monetized. Does it taste like an apple to them? Well.</v>

319
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.900
<v 0>I dunno, it's like in money and invisible, what are the, what are they seeing?</v>

320
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.680
I think for some of them it will, you know, taste and pain and things like that.

321
00:16:41.681 --> 00:16:43.420
And discomfort, it's all very subjective,

322
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.770
but the end result of doing this thing that looks like it couldn't happen

323
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.230
without some magical process. That's the key.

324
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.560
And none of these things really demand that matter, even when,

325
00:16:53.561 --> 00:16:55.270
even when you look at people being, um,

326
00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.440
undergoing surgery through hypnosis and being wide awake and being cut open.

327
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.710
And so you think, well that must be evidence.

328
00:17:02.711 --> 00:17:06.550
That hypnosis is some special thing, cause that couldn't happen otherwise.

329
00:17:06.551 --> 00:17:08.320
But of course it can, you know,

330
00:17:08.321 --> 00:17:11.920
the layer of skin that feels pain is actually sort of quiet thin.

331
00:17:11.921 --> 00:17:14.770
So once you get through that, when you're moving organs around, that's not,

332
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.610
that's not a painful process. Anyway, plus very often we tend to use a bit,

333
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.890
a little bit of like a local anesthetic anyway,

334
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.500
just to numb the very top layer of skin. So again,

335
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:26.260
what looks amazing very often, isn't, it's a,

336
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:31.390
it's an endlessly rich and bizarre area to me.

337
00:17:31.391 --> 00:17:35.200
And I kind of, um, as I said, I don't really think of myself as a hypnotist,

338
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.880
but th the, that process, that kind of, uh, um,

339
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:44.860
ability for people to get into this space where they can have

340
00:17:44.861 --> 00:17:48.920
that kind of experience is, um, is something I, you know,

341
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.210
I'll always find interesting. One of the recent stage shows I did, uh,

342
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.690
it's called miracle. I don't know if you've seen it,

343
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:56.220
but I'm faith healing in the second half.

344
00:17:56.221 --> 00:18:01.140
So using exactly the same idea and I've, I've got an audience that are like me,

345
00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:03.000
you know, they don't believe in that. And I'm just saying, look, I'm, you know,

346
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:04.530
I'm an atheist, I don't believe in this either,

347
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:08.100
but will you just kind of go with me or at least at the start because the

348
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:11.070
results are, are really interesting. And I, um,

349
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.830
I just started doing this, this, um, slightly,

350
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.670
not really knowing if it was going to work. I thought, well,

351
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:20.550
I can get some adrenaline going. And I know could see the techniques that the,

352
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.380
the charlatan faith healers were using. And, uh, I thought, well,

353
00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:27.300
I'll just, you know, I'll, I'll do that. And I thought, well,

354
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.120
the adrenaline kills pain so I can get some adrenaline going.

355
00:18:30.121 --> 00:18:31.520
There's bound to be people that said, oh,

356
00:18:31.521 --> 00:18:35.400
I had a pain in my back and now it's gone. But the actual results, admittedly,

357
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:38.310
with like small percentages of the audience, right? Not everybody,

358
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:41.160
but the people that were coming up and saying,

359
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.280
I have this problem and now it's gone. And they were,

360
00:18:44.281 --> 00:18:45.960
there was a woman that had a,

361
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.470
she'd been paralyzed on one side of her body since a kid.

362
00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:52.410
And she's like in her forties, now she's in floods of tears going,

363
00:18:52.411 --> 00:18:54.510
I can move my arm. And this was,

364
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.230
this is a skeptical audience like me that know that there's kind of playing

365
00:18:58.231 --> 00:19:02.190
along with something and a nonetheless again, small percentage, not, not,

366
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:05.490
not everybody, but having, having these kinds of experiences. Uh,

367
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.900
it is so that's, that's the psychological component of suffering, which is yeah.

368
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.291
Which is,

369
00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:13.110
which was really eyeopening during that show night after night after night.

370
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.300
Well.

371
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.870
<v 1>Faith healing is gotta be a form of hypnosis. Right?</v>

372
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.680
<v 0>Exactly. It's the same world is playing. They both,</v>

373
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.790
well they're both joined by is, is the idea of suggestibility. And, uh,

374
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.990
it doesn't, and sometimes those healings are sort of, I mean,

375
00:19:29.991 --> 00:19:32.450
if you take an x-ray before and afterwards, nothing's changing,

376
00:19:32.451 --> 00:19:36.740
but in as much as a lot can depend on this psychological component, it can,

377
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.280
can really make a difference again, as the percentages are getting smaller.

378
00:19:40.281 --> 00:19:43.160
So 3000 people in the audience, 300 people come up,

379
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.940
10 people come up on stage and I'm, you know, involving them in the show,

380
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.700
but getting even smaller,

381
00:19:49.701 --> 00:19:51.860
there are people that like a year later we're getting in touch and say,

382
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.370
just so you know, that thing did actually clear, like it hasn't come back.

383
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:57.830
Cause I thought it would only last for 10 minutes while they're on stage.

384
00:19:57.831 --> 00:19:58.664
And then yeah.

385
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.310
Which is why you don't tell people to throw the pills away and so on. Right.

386
00:20:01.311 --> 00:20:04.640
But AC we're in probably like that half a percent now,

387
00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:08.240
which is always going to be kind of pretty extraordinary. But, um, uh,

388
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.080
it was like a real, a real thing. So still.

389
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.620
<v 1>If you had 200 people and one of them actually gets cured from that,</v>

390
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.170
that is immensely bizarre.

391
00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.000
<v 0>It's immensely bizarre, but it's, it's bizarre. And, and um,</v>

392
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.650
like I had this bad shoulder for a long time and I, uh, I got really used to,

393
00:20:27.651 --> 00:20:31.820
when I put a jacket on kind of putting this in my left arm, putting it in,

394
00:20:31.821 --> 00:20:34.970
like letting my left arm go dead and then using my right arm to pull that thing

395
00:20:34.971 --> 00:20:38.240
up right now. I don't know how much I really need to do that anymore,

396
00:20:38.241 --> 00:20:39.770
or whether I'm just doing it out of habit.

397
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.850
But if somebody got me up on stage and said, your left shoulder is healed,

398
00:20:43.851 --> 00:20:47.410
it's happened now and kind of made me feel a bit, well now gone, try it,

399
00:20:47.411 --> 00:20:48.550
try and move your, move your arm.

400
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.680
I think in the surprise of it and the sheer kind of just snapping out of

401
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:56.650
that habit of being like, this is my dead arm.

402
00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.100
I probably would be very surprised that I could actually move it as much as I

403
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.820
can. You know, it's, it's just, it's like when you break it down, it's like,

404
00:21:03.821 --> 00:21:07.520
not that amazing, but when you, when you, when you see the, the,

405
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:12.720
the kind of extreme and exciting ends of that, it's,

406
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.360
it is mind blowing. And then you realize how these performance,

407
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.760
how you start to go mad yourself and think, well,

408
00:21:17.761 --> 00:21:22.320
I've got this special gift and I could pack out stadia doing like, uh,

409
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.890
I did think at one point, why don't I do like a secular healing show?

410
00:21:25.891 --> 00:21:28.080
I could say, well, this is, it's just, you know,

411
00:21:28.081 --> 00:21:30.360
it doesn't work in everybody and it may only work seven minutes,

412
00:21:30.361 --> 00:21:34.380
but it certainly works in some meaning of the word. Anyway,

413
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.160
I didn't do that, but you know, you can start to go. Yeah,
