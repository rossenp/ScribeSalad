00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You're into ghosts, you're into Bigfoot,</v>

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.180
you're into aliens, UFO, abductions, everything. Well.

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.340
<v 1>It's entertaining. I'm an entertainer.</v>

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.233
<v 0>It isn't a.</v>

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.730
<v 1>And I feel like you remarkably.</v>

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.930
<v 0>Sane for somebody to call all of these different things inside their head.</v>

7
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.920
<v 1>I don't know. My family would maybe say not, but she smoked pot. Um, you know,</v>

8
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:27.090
I I'm allergic to turpines. I love the cannabis story.

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.680
I turpines are an oil that, uh, that that's, you know, it's, it's an everything,

10
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.040
you know, it's like lemonade hot turpines yeah, we have what you,

11
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:38.160
what if you have good pot and you're smoking good by what you're smoking in the

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.370
Turpin. That's what makes it that's what gives it its power. Turpines.

13
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.110
<v 0>Give pot it's power. Well, it's part.</v>

14
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.090
<v 1>Of the element that is THC. Well, uh, 1300 it's an oil therapies is the,</v>

15
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:52.560
as the, as an oil that's that's in there in all, in, in all, all, uh, marijuana.

16
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.730
You have the allergic.

17
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.563
<v 0>To marijuana.</v>

18
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.480
<v 1>I'm allergic to the terpene, the cannabinoid. I, um,</v>

19
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.190
my dad is on the cannabis oil right now to go to sleep. He's 97 years old. I,

20
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.840
everybody has everybody has, can, uh, can, uh, um, cannabis, uh,

21
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.530
cannabinoid receptors in them. It is a tremendously healing.

22
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.610
<v 0>There's the terpene. There's a chart with a cool chart. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.830
<v 1>Third term benefits. Beans. Yeah. So, so somehow, yeah, look at them now,</v>

24
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.920
you know, and different Britos will put something. My, uh,

25
00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:27.300
my partner and friend, Jimmy Belushi has a farm in Oregon. He grows it. Um,

26
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.170
and he's researching.

27
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.900
<v 0>Drug addict. It's up there selling drugs to people, Jim Belushi, pushing chucks.</v>

28
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.390
<v 1>Well, it's legal now John.</v>

29
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.943
<v 0>Drugs.</v>

30
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.610
<v 1>The point is that if John had been a pothead,</v>

31
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:46.380
he'd be alive today because he died of a cocaine and, uh, and, and heroin,

32
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.300
speedball, uh, injection. He w if I find I had him smoking pot,

33
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.750
bear out there in the vineyard, like, you know, back then he would,

34
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:55.890
he would be alive today. But yeah.

35
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.190
<v 0>And so I believe generation of comedians are potheads.</v>

36
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.950
<v 1>I hear Seth Rogan's office at Columbia pictures had to be D fumed and D D fog</v>

37
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:05.784
when he left.

38
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.890
<v 0>But I gave him stoner of the year award one, the one, the,</v>

39
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.750
one of the high times awards I presented him.

40
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.560
<v 1>What could happen? The cannabis is tremendously valuable.</v>

41
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.010
We're finding with our, if you take the THC out and put the CBD in there that,

42
00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:24.600
that that's great for arthritis. And that I, I like to smell a weep.

43
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.550
Doesn't bother me. It's just, it's just, it just bothers me. So she went to.

44
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.710
<v 0>An hour just to get that cured. Well, sure.</v>

45
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.590
<v 1>Sure. So I rely on the, on the, uh, on the beverage and alcohol.</v>

46
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.200
<v 0>Psychedelic experiences. Oh.</v>

47
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.780
<v 1>Yes. I've taken acid. Uh, and siliciden, and Mescalin yeah.</v>

48
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.780
<v 0>You ever had any, some sort of encounters while in siliciden one of,</v>

49
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:49.650
one of the things that makes me more, uh,

50
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.660
more open to the idea of extra terrestrials is some of the experiences that

51
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:58.890
I've had on tryptamines, you know, particularly dimethyltryptamine,

52
00:02:58.891 --> 00:02:59.830
but also.

53
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 1>That's wig. DMT goes way back for me, that goes back to high school.</v>

54
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.320
How long back is that? What do you mean the DMT? I mean, last.

55
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.270
<v 0>Time it was a year and a half.</v>

56
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.750
<v 1>And a controlled situation. Tell me about your experience.</v>

57
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.190
I'd be interested to know of.

58
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.250
<v 0>BB. This is a, that's a DMT tattoo. That's a DMT molecule. Okay. Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.383
I've got a bunch of them.

60
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.750
<v 1>Th they're finding that it's healing for mental health.</v>

61
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:30.130
They're finding that that has, it has a, a great effect, uh, as.

62
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.100
<v 0>Profound alleviation of anxiety.</v>

63
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.960
Cause it transforms your perception of where you stand in the, in the world.

64
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:41.350
And it's a absolute ego. Dissolver you you're,

65
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.300
you are confronted with, uh, experiences that defied logic.

66
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:48.670
And one of the things that this is interesting.

67
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.260
One of the things that shied me away from UFO's was DMT because,

68
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.910
cause it was so profound.

69
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.380
It was so crazy that if a UFO landed right in front of my house, I'd be like,

70
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:01.390
yeah, it's not DMT though.

71
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.190
Cause DMT was a completely different dimension and there were things there.

72
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.473
Then one of the things that's.

73
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.360
<v 1>You were wearing a controlled environment with friends. You are</v>

74
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.530
seated where you in nature, where you okay.

75
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.190
<v 0>The house in my house houses. Well,</v>

76
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.200
you take three giant. Who makes that stuff? I can't tell you. That's not.

77
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.160
<v 1>That's not something you.</v>

78
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.010
<v 0>Can buy shut down your scifi show for talking about alien.</v>

79
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.200
<v 1>No, no, that's right. DMT has some,</v>

80
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.750
there's some prejudice against it and you can't get that.

81
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.300
<v 0>The drug store it's in thousands of plants.</v>

82
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:37.090
It's literally in almost every plant in nature. In fact, the,

83
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.010
one of the universities in Israel believes that it was responsible for the

84
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:45.340
burning Bush that Moses got the 10 commandments from.

85
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.450
They think that burning Bush was actually the Acacia tree and the Acacia tree is

86
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:50.470
rich and DMT.

87
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.840
<v 1>It burst into flame and he nailed the vapor.</v>

88
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.520
<v 0>Exactly. They think, God,</v>

89
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.280
well they think that this is just a problem with translation.

90
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.030
Is that this what this idea of the burning Bush like, oh,

91
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:03.370
there was a burning Bush. Well maybe,

92
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.660
or maybe they figured out a way to extract the dimethyltryptamine from the

93
00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:11.110
Acacia tree or this Bush Acacia Bush as well.

94
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.910
And that they took this small amount of dimethyltryptamine from this

95
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:19.870
fire and inhaled it and had this profound religious experience.

96
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:23.410
Like I've experienced like many people who experienced that have taken it.

97
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.120
And I think that one thing that happens when you do this is you're

98
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:32.170
confronted with entities. Now, I don't know what these things are,

99
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.160
but they seem to be communicating with you and they seem to be talking to you

100
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.800
and they seem to know everything about you. So the question is like,

101
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:42.280
is that really your subconscious is this is, is this,

102
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.290
you know what you know about yourself,

103
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:48.670
stripped down to some very bare raw form and then

104
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.590
confronted with the psychedelics that perturb your, your visual cortex.

105
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:58.520
So they provide you with all these intense visualizations or is it a chemical

106
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:00.830
portal to another dimension? There's where.

107
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.420
<v 1>They fall gin beings, light.</v>

108
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.410
<v 0>Beams.</v>

109
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.190
The way I describe as their complex geometric patterns made out of love and

110
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.900
understanding, and that they're.

111
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.430
<v 1>Sounds like, you know, HP Lovecraft was a wonderful writer and uh,</v>

112
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.330
and he describes in, in time machine, uh, no that was HG Wells,

113
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:20.480
but HP Lovecraft, he wrote the cut-through Lou, uh, the, uh,

114
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:25.400
the dunnage horror and the books about to be kind of,

115
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.700
you know, walked out of his life and disappeared from his family and all that.

116
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:33.530
But, uh, well, they kind of went out for cigarettes and kind of never came back,

117
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.720
but no one ever found them. Well, no, I think they found him,

118
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:40.640
but he had vanished for a while. HP Lovecraft maybe look up a grave or demise,

119
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.240
but, but you know, he, he wrote about geometric shapes.

120
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.090
He wrote about interdimensional, geometric shapes and,

121
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.310
and getting to a space where you saw the universe in terms of geometry and

122
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.100
diamond shaped things and multi,

123
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.590
multi patterns and colors and.

124
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.930
<v 0>Artists, Alex Gray, Alex, crazy beautiful artists. I mean, amazing,</v>

125
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:07.700
amazing guy. And he, uh, all of his stuff is tripped to mean based artwork,

126
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.260
pull up some Alex Gray stuff so he could see it. It literally, when you see it,

127
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:15.620
you go, oh, that I recognize that. I recognize.

128
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.180
<v 1>That. How long was your voyage?</v>

129
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.620
<v 0>All of them are about 15 minutes to 20 minutes long,</v>

130
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:23.960
depending upon this is all Alex Gray style.

131
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.243
<v 1>Beautiful.</v>

132
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.300
<v 0>Pull, pull up the one with that one down on the very bottom in the middle.</v>

133
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.100
There wasn't a red. Yeah. Look at that.

134
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.300
That's very similar to what it feels like when you do

135
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:38.750
dimethyltryptamine and Alex has had a wow.

136
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.920
<v 1>If I dropped the little purple barrel right now and just looked at that,</v>

137
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.510
I'd have a nice afternoon.

138
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.550
<v 0>Yeah. Well, a lot of the things, the most profound, um,</v>

139
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.360
psychedelic experiences are the, the, the compounds,

140
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.420
they mimic normal human neurochemistry.

141
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.730
Like dimethyltryptamine is a,

142
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.360
it's a natural occurring compound in the human brain.

143
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:05.990
It's produced by your liver, your lungs. And there's a lot of evidence,

144
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:08.690
at least in mammals, it's produced by your pineal gland,

145
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.850
which is literally your third eye.

146
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.790
<v 1>Yes, that's right. I did DMT way, way back.</v>

147
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:16.750
I think I was in high school or something, something,

148
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.910
and I think I was at a motorcycle, ice race or something about doing it.

149
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:20.744
So that was.

150
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.620
<v 0>Oh, a cycle ice race and DMT. You're living on the edge and high school, man.</v>

151
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.543
It's got.

152
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.980
<v 1>That's what the, you know, motorcycle, ice racing. You get, you get the,</v>

153
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.880
you got a little small bike, like a Jawa CSA and you,

154
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.270
and you put the metal rims with the,

155
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.290
with the studs and then you race around the ice. I never did it, but I saw it.

156
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:41.120
And I think I was that's when I went to my, my, my, my, my friend said,

157
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.770
Dave, take one of these and we'll have a better time.

158
00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:45.500
So I didn't see any beings, but, uh, well.

159
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.250
<v 0>The race was fun. Take one house orally. How did you take it?</v>

160
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.460
<v 1>He said it was a pill was a cap. Oh, that doesn't work.</v>

161
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.450
<v 0>Well, no, you need to freebase it. C small T is.</v>

162
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.310
<v 1>We said it was a cat. He gave it to me in a hole, like the size of a horse cap.</v>

163
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.090
Maybe it was horse drank. And I didn't ever know. He said it was.

164
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.310
<v 0>It's not, well, if it was,</v>

165
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:11.520
it doesn't work because your body produces model Aimee and oxidase.

166
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.620
And the only way that DMT works orally is if you take an Mao inhibitor,

167
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:19.740
this is what Iowasca is. Yeah.

168
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:23.160
See Iowasca is what the, the indigenous people,

169
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:28.140
the Amazon have figured out is how to take DMT with harming from the plants.

170
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.470
Right. And harming is a naturally occurring Mao inhibitor.

171
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.050
So that's how you can take it orally.

172
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:37.640
It's also why the experience is not as intense, but it's a longer,

173
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.400
and many people find it more spiritual because he can relax Jimmy fall into the

174
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:45.860
experience. But this is not an, a capsule form. You were he get,

175
00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:47.490
he dosed you up with someone else?

176
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.160
<v 1>Well, yeah. I don't know. Yeah, no, I guess I have something that,</v>

177
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:51.060
who knows back then.

178
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.180
<v 0>It could have been silicide well, psilocybin, um,</v>

179
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.360
converts in the body to something very similar to DMT.

180
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.100
The DMT is the chemical compound is N and D

181
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.120
dimethyltryptamine,

182
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.500
but something happens in the body's production of DMT or the body's

183
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.130
breaking down of DMT where it produces something called

184
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.080
[inaudible] tryptamine. This is out of siliciden.

185
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.880
So maybe he gave you psilocybin pills, which is real common. That's real common.

186
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.490
<v 1>Usually if I were to take psilocybin, I'd eat them.</v>

187
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.600
Like I just eat the mushroom.

188
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.900
<v 0>A lot of people take them in capsule form though, so they can get an exact.</v>

189
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.230
<v 1>Dose. I remember sprinkling it on my cereal once and yeah.</v>

190
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.520
And then going to deliver the.

191
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.030
<v 0>Yeah. My friend took him in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. He just.</v>

192
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.490
<v 1>I ate a bowl of psilocybin and then I went and picked up my mail truck and, and,</v>

193
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.010
you know, I was, I was a Royal mail career. Oh, geez.

194
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.160
That was an interesting morning. Did you get everybody's mail to.

195
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:47.430
<v 0>Be fast?</v>
