00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.850
I'm super excited to talk to you about several subjects, but this one,

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.180
thank you very much for this first edition copy of your area.

4
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:13.140
51 and uncensored history of America's top secret military base book.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.890
I'm super excited about this. I heard through the grapevine, you are a fan,

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.430
I'm a freak when it comes to this stuff, what do you think is going on up there?

7
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.251
<v 1>I mean, same thing.</v>

8
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.430
That's going on all over the place when it comes to military secrets,

9
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:29.180
which is stuff that you want to know about very few people know about.

10
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:33.110
And every now and then a journalist gets a hint, right?

11
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.350
<v 0>Yeah. Do you think there's any alien stuff up?</v>

12
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.940
<v 2>I write in the book all about that last 12 pages you want me to</v>

13
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.910
read? Um.

14
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.270
<v 1>So area 51 was this secret test base where the CIA</v>

15
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.770
was running, uh, spy plane programs. Right?

16
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.000
So interestingly, my new book is about ground branch guys on the ground.

17
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.090
That's about air branch, what we were doing in the air.

18
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.860
And it was this idea that we should spy on the enemy. Okay.

19
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.710
And, but if you go back in time,

20
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.960
why area 51 really started you learn that it was a

21
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.960
base hidden inside of a base nuclear weapons.

22
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.030
And it was all about beating Stalin at his black

23
00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:24.740
propaganda campaign.

24
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.410
I right in the book to hoax Americans in a war of the

25
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:32.090
worlds type scenario,

26
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.620
whereby little men who looked like aliens would get out of an

27
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:41.120
aircraft and the government would go crazy about it.

28
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.040
And then Stalin would say, look,

29
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:46.220
we have not only do we have technology better than you,

30
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.910
but we have a better propaganda department than you.

31
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.460
<v 3>Route that Joe, you.</v>

32
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.680
<v 1>Got to read the whole book. I mean, this is like a, this.</v>

33
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.270
<v 4>Is a tough opening. You got me, but it's a good spot. Right? It's a good spot.</v>

34
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.500
<v 0>So Stalin just hired short people.</v>

35
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.730
<v 1>All right. I'm going to make you save that. I'm gonna make you earn. Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.700
I mean, you want me to talk about that right now? Right off the bat.

37
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.893
I'm sweating.

38
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.000
<v 0>We're going to get to surprise, kill vanish as well. But I want to just, yeah.</v>

39
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.863
Why does that make sense?

40
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.790
<v 1>Oh my God. It's such an incendiary topic. I mean, people,</v>

41
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.420
people want to believe they're aliens. Right? Right. Okay. I mean,

42
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.700
I've spent five books dealing with the mythology of area 51,

43
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.410
which is phenomenal in its own way because it speaks so much to power,

44
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.670
to morality, to information, to, you know,

45
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.880
people's desire to know what's going on and,

46
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.010
and the government's desire to keep things hidden.

47
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.750
So this topic is always coming up because a lot of people want to believe that

48
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.240
there were aliens in that craft. And my source,

49
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.700
who I write about in the book, uh,

50
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.280
told otherwise that they were genetically, you know, that they.

51
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.520
<v 0>Be right there. Because when you say that craft,</v>

52
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:09.510
what you mean is the supposed UFO records have crashed in Roswell,

53
00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:12.660
New Mexico in 1947. That's what you mean, right? Yes.

54
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.330
But that was never supposedly taken to area 51.

55
00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:17.880
It was supposed to be taken to Wright Patterson, air force base.

56
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.600
The legend has it, that Truman flew there to meet them and right.

57
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.820
<v 2>That's one legend. So.</v>

58
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.380
<v 1>In my book,</v>

59
00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:29.670
I interview a man who worked for the atomic energy commission who tells a

60
00:03:29.671 --> 00:03:30.510
different story,

61
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.280
tells the story of receiving that craft

62
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.830
at area 51 in 1951,

63
00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:40.410
which is why the base is called area 51.

64
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.200
And that inside the craft were humans who had been

65
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.540
altered surgically altered to look like aliens in a plan for

66
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:56.100
Stalin to sort of twist Truman's

67
00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:57.810
arm. Because at that time

68
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.500
we had the atomic bomb when Roswell happened,

69
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:04.050
we had the atomic bomb and the Soviets did not.

70
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.230
<v 0>When you say humans that were surgically altered to look like aliens,</v>

71
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.920
do you mean, so this is 1951.

72
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.990
So you're talking about four years after the supposed crash. Yes. So what,

73
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.500
what.

74
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.870
<v 1>Was left? They kept the bodies.</v>

75
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.100
<v 0>In what? Formaldehyde.</v>

76
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.200
<v 1>Yes. And also because the idea was, and remember, or I can't say remember,</v>

77
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.460
cause you haven't read the book yet. Right.

78
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.090
And I wrote this book eight years ago. Um,

79
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.010
but it did really impact a lot of my, a lot of my thinking and working on,

80
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.710
on, you know, government secrecy projects,

81
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:45.090
because it makes you really consider what

82
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.550
a hoax means and what it means to a population of people and

83
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:55.350
how the government begins to work with disinformation versus cover stories and

84
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:57.210
all of that. But going back to answer your question,

85
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.820
that is what I was told by the source that.

86
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.680
<v 0>But how reliable is this source?</v>

87
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:06.600
This is a very incendiary idea to rely upon

88
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:08.780
one individual's recollection.

89
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.350
Which is why the book went through the roof in terms of people being upset about

91
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:17.850
it. I mean, oh my God, I interviewed 79 CIA guys,

92
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:21.120
air force guys, spy pilots, engineers. I mean.

93
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.971
<v 4>They,</v>

94
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:28.380
conspiracy theorists were mad at me because they said this woman has bananas.

95
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.700
They were aliens.

96
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.950
<v 0>Even if they weren't aliens. Right.</v>

97
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:36.540
There's also there's accounts that it was some sort of a test

98
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.220
vehicle and that they were actually just dummies inside their crash test dummies

99
00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:44.040
that they used. There's been a bunch of different versions of it.

100
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.580
But the most compelling version of the area,

101
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.860
51 alien myth to me is Bob Lasar. Did you get into that? Yeah.

102
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:53.340
He plays.

103
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 1>A huge role in area 51. I mean, before Bob went public,</v>

104
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.280
no one even knew about area 51 people.

105
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.570
<v 0>New people. It was, it was common folk lore,</v>

106
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.500
but there was no definitive proof that there was something going on over there

107
00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:13.180
other than some weird VHS footage of things flying around in the

108
00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:17.920
desert that seemed to be behaving in a way that modern aircraft are not

109
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.540
totally capable of at least modern piloted aircraft are not totally capable. I.

110
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.080
<v 1>Mean, which brings me to another book I wrote called the Pentagon's brain,</v>

111
00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:28.870
which, you know, sort of off this idea, it was like, wait a minute.

112
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:31.420
What kind of technology is the government capable of?

113
00:06:31.421 --> 00:06:34.660
And we have a whole department for that reason called DARPA,

114
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.140
which looks at weapons systems 25 years out.

115
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.970
So the idea that you and I don't know what the military is

116
00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:45.250
capable of in the air underwater,

117
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.350
wherever it may be is because we're not thinking 25 years

118
00:06:50.351 --> 00:06:53.230
out and they are, and they're developing weapon systems,

119
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.050
the great weapons systems of the future. That's what they call them.

120
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.210
<v 0>Right? Like how they develop the stealth bomber,</v>

121
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.190
like in that was all out in area 51 and groom Lank. And um,

122
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.190
what do you think Ababil is our store? Cause Bob was our story,

123
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.070
what's it really there's some fascinating aspects to it.

124
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.350
One of the most fascinating,

125
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.240
some of the things that he's said that people said was horseshit is told,

126
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.270
has been proven to be true. Like one of the things, the,

127
00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:21.250
the biometric reader that measured the length of the bones in

128
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:22.001
your hand,

129
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:25.270
and that they are unique as unique as a fingerprint and people are like,

130
00:07:25.271 --> 00:07:25.991
what are you talking about?

131
00:07:25.991 --> 00:07:29.230
And then they actually found out that this was something they really did have,

132
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.490
and they have photos of this thing.

133
00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:34.120
Now this is something that he talked about and they claimed it was science

134
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:35.200
fiction. I.

135
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.800
<v 1>Mean,</v>

136
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.660
it's fascinating when someone touches upon a subject that the government does

137
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:43.120
not want known about for any reason.

138
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.480
And there is a campaign to discredit that person.

139
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:50.200
And there's no doubt that that happened to him. I mean, it was remarkable.

140
00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:53.650
And I write about him in the book because if you follow the logic that my source

141
00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:57.970
told me that these were, you know, modified human beings as part of a hoax.

142
00:07:57.971 --> 00:08:00.700
And the reason that I trust the source is because Joe,

143
00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:03.070
he told me that he also worked on the program.

144
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.440
So he had like a burden to unload. Right.

145
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.660
And so if you follow that logic through,

146
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:15.490
then the Bible is our story is that Bob one Bible is our set. I saw an alien,

147
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.180
it looked like this. It was small. It had big eyes it's yes,

148
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:21.100
those were the genetic genetically. I mean,

149
00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:24.580
those were the surgically modified humans that the government was doing

150
00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:25.450
experiments on.

151
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.580
<v 0>I think Bob blazars exact quote was he walked by a window and he looked</v>

152
00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:33.760
in and he saw two agents that were, it looked,

153
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.260
they were looking down at something that was very small and looked humanoid,

154
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.810
but he didn't know if it was a dummy or anything.

155
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:44.560
And he wasn't even supposed to be looking in there. And it was a brief,

156
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:49.420
like one second look that he has bounced around in his

157
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:50.320
head back and forth.

158
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.530
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe the guy who gave you that information did

159
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:59.160
work there, but is also feeding you horseshit?

160
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.490
Well.

161
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:06.080
<v 1>The source was a major player in the Manhattan project.</v>

162
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.800
He went on and worked in the atomic energy commission. I mean,

163
00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:13.940
there's a wing of a museum named after him. Um,

164
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.660
his accolades, his awards were so extraordinary. It would be,

165
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.900
I've never said his name. Although, you know, I will say this well.

166
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.580
<v 0>You're giving it away. Like you're giving away.</v>

167
00:09:22.581 --> 00:09:23.960
A lot of the stuff here recently.

168
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.370
<v 1>Died. And he did give me permission to tell his full story after he died.</v>

169
00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:31.790
And I'm circling around that, circling around that.

170
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:35.270
But he was absolutely, uh, you know,

171
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.730
with a queue clearance.

172
00:09:37.731 --> 00:09:41.810
That's what you have when you have access to nuclear secrets.

173
00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:46.340
So if someone has a Q clearance for decades and they're

174
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.640
full of garbage, you really have to ask my God,

175
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.590
should this guy have a queue clearance? I mean,

176
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.290
that's reverse engineering his credibility,

177
00:09:54.291 --> 00:09:58.940
but I think you should read the whole book because you know,

178
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.850
it's shocking what he says, but it does make sense.

179
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:05.570
If you can get through 400 pages of, you know,

180
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.920
the CIS idea about information disinformation,

181
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.800
why we need to cover things up. Why that's, why.

182
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.590
<v 0>I'm asking. If you think that he's, he might've been lying to you.</v>

183
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.180
<v 2>And he's feeding you information. No, I don't believe, I don't believe. So. You.</v>

184
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:25.070
<v 0>Think that the Stalin that the Russian government definitely did surgically</v>

185
00:10:25.071 --> 00:10:28.070
alter people to make them look like aliens? I believe,

186
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.400
I believe what he told me. Did you see photos? No, I.

187
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.380
<v 1>Did not see photos, but here's the rub ready?</v>

188
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.530
When I was writing another book called phenomena,

189
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:41.600
which dealt with the CIA and the Pentagon's use of psychics. Okay.

190
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.780
Um, over decades, I mean, this goes back.

191
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.020
Everything I write about pretty much goes back to post-World war.

192
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.270
<v 0>When we remote viewing stuff. Yes. Yes.</v>

193
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.160
<v 1>And it's all about government.</v>

194
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.310
Us government takes pole position after world war II.

195
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.210
And we now need to always be ahead of the curve. We must lead.

196
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.900
We can never get beaten by the Russians now it's China. Okay.

197
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.790
So the psychic program had a lot of people who really believe in

198
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.500
aliens or, you know, other Intel intelligence from other worlds.

199
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.020
And when I was writing the phenomena book,

200
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:20.480
I learned a whole bunch of new information about how upset they were with my

201
00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:23.930
story because they believed and they all knew the source, by the way,

202
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.370
they knew the source and they believed that he was fed misinformation.

203
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.510
So these are two sides of the coin, which are super interesting.

204
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.190
I think if you can look at them with your own biased

205
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.840
turned off and not have a desired outcome,

206
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.970
I want to believe this. I don't want to believe this. You know? Um, speaking of,

207
00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:47.781
I want to believe, you know,

208
00:11:47.781 --> 00:11:52.460
I was working on a project with Chris Carter who is the X-Files creator

209
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.130
and one person I took the source, um, that I wanted to meet.

210
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:58.570
The source was Chris Carter. And I,

211
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.610
we went out there together and sat with him and met him.

212
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.530
And it was well because the source had never even heard of the X-Files,

213
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.630
but it was like, oh, I know they talked about baseball, you know?

214
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.900
Um, see I don't have.

215
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.320
<v 0>A desired outcome. I mean, I would love it to fail and for real, okay.</v>

216
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:21.360
But when someone starts talking about disinformation and propaganda

217
00:12:21.361 --> 00:12:24.690
campaigns, but they want you to believe them. Right.

218
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.040
But don't listen, I'm here telling you the truth. I'm here telling you.

219
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.100
<v 1>I'm not saying I'm telling you the truth at all. That's.</v>

220
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.710
<v 4>Why I was Joe. Let's wait for an hour three.</v>

221
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.990
<v 1>Because it's too explosive.</v>

222
00:12:36.991 --> 00:12:41.700
People have such a horse in the race already. They with aliens,

223
00:12:41.701 --> 00:12:45.930
you think, well, I mean, maybe you are neutral. I don't know.

224
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.930
I know I'm neutral. Yeah. I.

225
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.780
<v 0>I will listen. I absolutely want aliens to be real a hundred percent.</v>

226
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:56.850
I'm not neutral, but I am neutral in my perceptions.

227
00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.540
And when I look at things, I go, Hmm. I don't know about that.

228
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.110
You want to see a picture? Like, what are these, what do these guys look like?

229
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:08.070
I mean, what did they do to them? Did he describe what kind of surgical? I.

230
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.150
<v 1>Stayed with a source. I mean, after the book published,</v>

231
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.280
I would go and visit him.

232
00:13:14.281 --> 00:13:18.420
We'd sit in a Chinese restaurant and eat and talk and I would try to get a

233
00:13:18.421 --> 00:13:23.220
droplet of information out of him. Oh my God. He avoided. I mean,

234
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.170
look, here's another thing. When the book came out,

235
00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:28.980
his wife of 65 years knew it was him. Okay.

236
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.960
And I went out to Las Vegas and sat there in a room with the

237
00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:38.220
source and his wife. And she said, tell me this isn't true.

238
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.910
Tell me you made this all up to her husband. And he said,

239
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.700
it's the truth. I mean, that's a triangular version of getting at the truth.

240
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.890
But again, to reiterate,

241
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.280
I believe he believes what he told me was the truth.

242
00:13:53.281 --> 00:13:54.570
That was the truth he was told.

243
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.430
<v 0>I think there's certain agents that think it's fun to with reporters and</v>

244
00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:02.580
journalists and make things up. I really do. And I think,

245
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.140
especially when they're talking about secret information that they were sworn

246
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.370
to protect,

247
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.570
and then all of a sudden they want to talk to someone that they don't even know

248
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.870
on the sneak tip. Let's meet at a diner. I'm going to tell you everything,

249
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.590
how we met. Well, I mean, yeah. I mean, however you met.

250
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.231
<v 1>Yeah. Well,</v>

251
00:14:19.231 --> 00:14:23.970
we met because I was interviewing nuclear weapons,

252
00:14:23.971 --> 00:14:28.320
engineers who were setting off nuclear bombs in area 51, mushroom.

253
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.470
I mean in the Nevada test site area, 12 area, 23.

254
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.570
And they all said to me,

255
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.610
you've got to talk to the top engineer of all this weaponry.

256
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.500
And they gave me his name.

257
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.860
And we talked for days and hours about nuclear weapons.

258
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.980
And then in one conversation,

259
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.880
he began to cry and told me this story, that I was like.

260
00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.560
<v 3>What was crying? He.</v>

261
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.390
<v 1>Was crying because he participated in our version of the</v>

262
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:03.620
human experiments because what the Russians do,

263
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.730
we do look, I've written five books about this altered.

264
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.650
<v 0>People to make them look like alien.</v>

265
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:09.401
<v 1>I am,</v>

266
00:15:09.401 --> 00:15:14.140
we had a small program in 1951 where we wanted to see how the

267
00:15:14.141 --> 00:15:17.770
Russians did what they did, how they made human beings look like this.

268
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.270
<v 0>Well, they do take prisoners or something like what? Who are they? He.</v>

269
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.600
<v 1>Said they were handicapped children. Oh Jesus.</v>

270
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.230
And he told me that he participated in this. So again, I mean,

271
00:15:29.231 --> 00:15:33.130
unless you have someone that lost their mind at age 90 and was willing to tell

272
00:15:33.131 --> 00:15:35.290
their wife of 65 years, I lost my mind.

273
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.090
<v 0>So he's saying that he participated in something that</v>

274
00:15:40.091 --> 00:15:42.880
altered handicapped children. When you say handicapped,

275
00:15:42.881 --> 00:15:44.650
you mean like down syndrome or something like that.

276
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:49.660
And they made them look like aliens and then killed them.

277
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.950
Like, what did, how did they, what did they do with this is where we get.

278
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.870
<v 1>Into drops of information coming out.</v>

279
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.860
But what I can say is he had a grandchild that was born that way.

280
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.100
And, and the grandchild did not live long.

281
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:07.690
The grandchild died and it made him feel so guilty about what he had done,

282
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.010
that he felt compelled to con to confess if you will.

283
00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:14.290
And I remember saying to him, why are you telling me this?

284
00:16:14.291 --> 00:16:15.850
Why don't you tell a priest? And he said,

285
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.780
a priest would judge me and I can tell you won't.

286
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.350
<v 0>Why wouldn't you judge them? I judge him. Well.</v>

287
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.270
<v 1>I guess that's why I'm a born journalist joke because I really try not to judge</v>

288
00:16:28.271 --> 00:16:31.810
people. I mean, my new book surprise, kill vanish. It's about assassins.

289
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.220
It's about people who work for the CIA who do what needs to be done on the

290
00:16:36.221 --> 00:16:40.990
ground, uh, in the name of national security. I don't judge them.

291
00:16:40.991 --> 00:16:45.340
This is why, you know, what's really at issue here is morality, right? Yeah.

292
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.570
I mean, can I tell you how I got the idea for this book?

293
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:54.300
<v 0>Sure. But let me, before we go any further, so I'm not saying, yeah.</v>

294
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.020
Was he saying that there have never been any encounters with

295
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.100
alien spacecraft?

296
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.670
<v 1>He was totally neutral about aliens. He had nothing to do with aliens.</v>

297
00:17:03.671 --> 00:17:07.000
He could have cared less. He didn't watch the X-Files take on.

298
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.080
Bob are his take on Bob Lazaro was that he probably saw

299
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.910
something that the government had an extension of the program. I mean,

300
00:17:15.911 --> 00:17:18.370
he didn't know that was speculative. We didn't talk about that. I mean,

301
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:23.470
you know, other than inference, he was very limited in his,

302
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.320
in the information that he would get out. But I mean,

303
00:17:26.321 --> 00:17:29.860
I used 79 sources in that book that all went on the record in name.

304
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.110
And he was the one anonymous source because, but like I said,

305
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.230
you know, he told me after he died, that I could tell the whole story. I mean,

306
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.650
I might, I might come back. If you give me a break and back off of the subject,

307
00:17:44.651 --> 00:17:46.360
I might come back and tell you and.

308
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.010
<v 4>Your audience, his name's your book want to promote your book.</v>

309
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.240
<v 0>I know you want to promote your new book,</v>

310
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:52.620
but I want to promote this book as well.

311
00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:57.080
<v 1>I mean, I'm teasing you, but it's, it's like,</v>

312
00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.800
it's an astonishing story.

313
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.970
And I think the best line of all is that people that read about that in the very

314
00:18:04.971 --> 00:18:07.490
end of what we did, they go, I wish they were aliens.

315
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:14.030
<v 0>So Stalin created some sort of a craft that you're going to read it.</v>

316
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.000
<v 1>That's what you're going to do the rest of the afternoon. Nope. I'm going.</v>

317
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.790
<v 0>To come back on your daughter fast and we're talking.</v>

318
00:18:19.791 --> 00:18:22.610
I think we should probably get into this a little bit. Okay.

319
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.120
<v 1>Come on with a question, because I'm used to asking the questions. Oh.</v>

320
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.200
<v 0>Right. As a journalist. Yeah.</v>

321
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:32.000
Now Stalin and the Russians created something that mimicked

322
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.270
a UFL something that looked like it would be from another planet.

323
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:36.163
Is that what they did.

324
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.320
<v 1>In those days, drones were,</v>

325
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.040
there was a mothership and a drone was attached to it and it was jettisoned off.

326
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.910
Okay. So according in those days, well,

327
00:18:46.911 --> 00:18:51.650
in 19 47, 48, well, they didn't, I mean,

328
00:18:51.651 --> 00:18:54.170
that was drone technology then, right? So there's a mother,

329
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.570
a mother craft like an aircraft.

330
00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:01.550
And then the drone is like a small aircraft under it and it gets

331
00:19:01.551 --> 00:19:06.350
jettisoned off. And that was what the craft was. It was jettisoned off. So that,

332
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.920
so stolen actually, according to the source invaded our airspace,

333
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.080
which was the deep embarrassment to Truman.

334
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:17.570
<v 0>So he invaded our airspace and then let this drone crash land on the</v>

335
00:19:17.571 --> 00:19:21.560
ground with these things that turned out to be human.

336
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.120
They looked like aliens,

337
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.930
but they turn out to be humans that were manipulated surgically. Yes.

338
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.410
<v 1>As a way to, and remember, I mean, not remember, but where,</v>

339
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.810
where this was was, you know,

340
00:19:32.811 --> 00:19:37.550
very close to a nuclear weapon space to our white sands, military base. I mean,

341
00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:42.200
this is like not a place you want the Russians to be able to get near, you know,

342
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.360
I mean, what was interesting is that area 51,

343
00:19:44.361 --> 00:19:46.670
we then went on and mimicked all of those.

344
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.070
One of our early drones was a mimicry of that.

345
00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:50.210
It was the [inaudible], there was an M 21, which was the mothership and a D 21

346
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.043
, which was the daughtership. So, oh.

347
00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.210
<v 0>I let them, was it wirelessly like we do now? No.</v>

348
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.290
<v 1>No. Then it was like,</v>

349
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.660
there was a pilot in the mothership and they kind of let it go and it flew off.

350
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.961
I mean,

351
00:20:05.961 --> 00:20:10.670
there's incredible stories of what the CIA was able to do out there at area 51

352
00:20:10.671 --> 00:20:14.060
with their air branch, you know, um,

353
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.600
the technology they're always ahead of technology. That's what's remarkable.

354
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.040
<v 0>Well, what Bob was our did film that was really shocking was the film,</v>

355
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.990
the filming of these drones flying around and performing these

356
00:20:26.991 --> 00:20:30.200
really crazy. You've seen those videos. Yeah. In the eighties.

357
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.620
<v 1>It gets really crazy with what they're able to do and what they're. But I mean,</v>

358
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.130
why I like looking at history is because you can see the progression, you know,

359
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:42.440
you see how science evolves, you know, bit by bit.

360
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:45.740
And then there's these great breakthroughs because what the government is always

361
00:20:45.741 --> 00:20:50.140
looking for is called a revolution in military affairs. Right.

362
00:20:50.141 --> 00:20:54.430
And that's certainly what drone technology did. Um, later on,

363
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:56.830
as drones became developed after the Vietnam war.

364
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.600
<v 0>So in the 1980s, when Bob was our was filming all this stuff,</v>

365
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:05.490
you think this was similar to the technology that we see publicly described

366
00:21:05.491 --> 00:21:09.660
today in terms of like what drones are capable of. Sure. I mean,

367
00:21:09.661 --> 00:21:11.640
that's all we had, something like that back then.

368
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.020
<v 1>Oh, you know, when,</v>

369
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:18.270
when the F1 17 was revealed during the first Gulf war,

370
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.950
that aircraft was being developed for 20,

371
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.780
25 years out at area 51,

372
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.190
actually at area 52 was where they had it set up, um,

373
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:33.390
to develop that stealth technology think about and what was amazing.

374
00:21:33.391 --> 00:21:35.550
Talk about keeping secrets. Um,

375
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.120
they had something like 10,000 people working on that.

376
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:44.430
No one knew about it. That story was never broken by the press. Not by anyone.

377
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.690
It just suddenly appeared in the Gulf war and took out Saddam Hussein's,

378
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.340
you know, facilities. That's a revolution in military affairs.

379
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.180
What becomes interesting is then it becomes obsolete because now everybody knows

380
00:21:57.181 --> 00:21:59.310
about it and everybody's going to mimic that.

381
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:03.840
And now you have to have a new weapons system and that's the military industrial

382
00:22:03.841 --> 00:22:04.590
complex.

383
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.100
<v 0>So was this drone aircraft that was released from the mothership?</v>

384
00:22:08.101 --> 00:22:11.310
Was this capable of autonomous flight or was it just,

385
00:22:11.311 --> 00:22:13.080
they just threw it out there and let it crash.

386
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.690
<v 1>Th uh, the ladder. Right. And remember that information, I am very limited to,</v>

387
00:22:18.691 --> 00:22:19.950
that's why it's 12 pages.

388
00:22:19.951 --> 00:22:23.490
It's like the source gave me these little bits of information,

389
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.860
which I felt I felt was important to include because it speaks to the

390
00:22:28.861 --> 00:22:33.750
big issue. Why is area 51 classified? I mean,

391
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:38.520
now it's not president Obama was the first president to actually say area 51,

392
00:22:38.521 --> 00:22:42.540
publicly. Some people say because of my book, right. Meaning it was out,

393
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.160
the secret was out. But before that,

394
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:48.600
I went through 10,000 pages of documents from the national archives.

395
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.640
And every place you see the word area, 51 was actually redacted,

396
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.310
right? Why would you keep that? So secret? I mean,

397
00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.310
all the guys that I was interviewing say, they could call it, you know,

398
00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:01.620
groom lake. They could call it the test facility.

399
00:23:01.621 --> 00:23:05.940
They could call it paradise ranch, but they couldn't say area 51.

400
00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.550
Why? And the source said, well,

401
00:23:08.551 --> 00:23:12.660
because we did this horrible program out there and the government doesn't want

402
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.900
anyone to know about that ever. I mean,

403
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:20.760
there are stories of like somebody asking bill Clinton, you know, about area 51,

404
00:23:20.761 --> 00:23:25.350
him going white. I mean, human experiments, who wants to be part of that?

405
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.270
It's horrible. The human experiments.

406
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.780
<v 0>Were,</v>

407
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.010
were they limited to this mimicry of the Russian experiments where they were

408
00:23:32.011 --> 00:23:34.290
trying to get people to look like aliens or where there's something else going.

409
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.610
<v 1>On. Wow. My goodness. I mean,</v>

410
00:23:35.611 --> 00:23:40.410
you read now the declassified documents tell us how many different

411
00:23:40.411 --> 00:23:45.410
human experiments were going on around nuclear weapons. Okay.

412
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.580
Horrible experiments where they were subjecting people to radiation,

413
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.590
because they wanted to know, they felt well,

414
00:23:51.591 --> 00:23:55.760
it's more important to know what happens to people than to not know.

415
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:59.060
And so they would take groups of people that say had cancer or something and

416
00:23:59.061 --> 00:24:03.830
test them. So there's no doubt that the government has experimented on humans.

417
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.810
It's just, is that something that is wise to make public? And, you know,

418
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:11.540
there's two sides of the coin on that. I mean, you, you,

419
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.600
when you reveal these kinds of things, when you write about them, I mean,

420
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.880
people get really upset and, you know,

421
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.770
vilify the government partially with good reason and partially it's like

422
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.140
bad for national security.

423
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:28.040
So I think that's the justification on the part of the fence department to keep

424
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:28.280
things.

425
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.420
<v 0>Secret. That makes sense. Wow. That's a,</v>

426
00:24:31.421 --> 00:24:33.670
that's an interesting tank that I never thought of before,

427
00:24:33.671 --> 00:24:37.510
but if I was stalling and I was trying to air quotes,

428
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.890
with the Americans, that's maybe way I would do it. Hey man,

429
00:24:41.891 --> 00:24:44.830
you got a problem lands. They're coming. And there was,

430
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.030
if people it's hard for people that live in 2019,

431
00:24:49.031 --> 00:24:52.450
especially if you're young to really imagine a world,

432
00:24:52.451 --> 00:24:56.620
not only without the internet, but with two television channels, right.

433
00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.670
And radio, which was where people got all their information from. I mean,

434
00:25:00.671 --> 00:25:04.810
was there two channels? How many channels were there in 1947? Maybe three.

435
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:09.640
<v 2>Maybe. I mean, it was radio in world war two. Right? Most people had radio.</v>

436
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.980
<v 0>Yeah. Mostly radio and newspapers.</v>

437
00:25:11.981 --> 00:25:13.540
And that's where people were getting their information.

438
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:18.400
And there was a mass hysteria where people were absolutely

439
00:25:18.401 --> 00:25:23.020
terrified that we were going to be invaded, which is why when Orson Welles,

440
00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:27.520
war of worlds, which when they released it, when they did it on the air,

441
00:25:27.521 --> 00:25:32.380
they were very clear that this is going to be a reading of

442
00:25:32.381 --> 00:25:37.060
Orson Wells war of worlds book or that a HD, well, excuse me,

443
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.810
war of war, right. Was HG Wells book and Orson Welles Reddit. Yes.

444
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.740
And when they were talking about this on the radio,

445
00:25:44.741 --> 00:25:49.630
a lot of people miss that part. Right. And so as the radio went on,

446
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.420
as the broadcast went on and people were tuning in later in the day,

447
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.480
it erupted in mass hysteria. People were freaking out.

448
00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.870
Hundreds of thousands of people really did think that it was.

449
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:03.280
And it was also something that was recreated in other countries.

450
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.040
I don't know if you know that they did that in other countries,

451
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:10.330
in different languages when they saw how cute it worked in America and well, so.

452
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.400
<v 1>You see, you can see the logic. I mean,</v>

453
00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:14.500
at first it sounds absurd and it sounds ridiculous.

454
00:26:14.501 --> 00:26:16.240
And that's why I was sweating because it's like.

455
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.580
<v 2>I know Ryan, but.</v>

456
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.050
<v 1>When you think it through,</v>

457
00:26:20.051 --> 00:26:23.530
and I challenge you to read the whole book because you start piecing together,

458
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.420
these various ideas and disinformation becomes less vague and more specific and

459
00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:29.950
you go, oh, that's how it works.

460
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:35.020
And you begin to see how people's perception and how they're easily manipulated

461
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:39.820
factors into national security. Just like you just described stolen,

462
00:26:39.821 --> 00:26:43.980
knew about that. He was a master, he was the master of propaganda.

463
00:26:43.981 --> 00:26:48.360
He invented it. I mean, he didn't invent it, but he invented it in a,

464
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.700
you know, on the political stage to be used to mess with another country's

465
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:58.260
perception of things. Think of what he did with brainwashing. Right. Okay.

466
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.140
So like in the fifties, and this is journalists, you know, said,

467
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.280
so there was a journalist who was putting out stories about brainwashing.

468
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:09.660
And there was this idea, which is well-taken that totalitarian governments,

469
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:12.120
brainwash people. And this became a big code word.

470
00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:15.810
It was introduced into the American lexicon in 1950.

471
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.830
Well then we're in the Korean war. Our pilots start getting shot down.

472
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.900
They're put on TV by the communists saying terrible things about America,

473
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:29.250
the American pilots. And suddenly it was like, they've been brainwashed.

474
00:27:29.251 --> 00:27:31.560
It was very convenient to have that story.

475
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.440
So these things work part and parcel,

476
00:27:34.441 --> 00:27:38.400
and you've got all kinds of smart people behind the scenes, knowing this,

477
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:42.450
looking at it, examining it and using it to their advantage,

478
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:47.190
to stay aware in the pole position. That's the goal of the U S government.

479
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.360
<v 0>So the propaganda that we did that sort of copied</v>

480
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:55.790
Stalin's that were kind of playing catch up in that sense.

481
00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:00.080
<v 1>I mean, we're playing catch up then we're ahead. We're behind. It's always a,</v>

482
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.530
it's a game it's. I mean, you're a competitor, you know, this, how.

483
00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:08.570
<v 0>Do you crazy thing to do to make a fake spaceship and just let it</v>

484
00:28:08.571 --> 00:28:12.830
slam into the ground with a bunch of people that you cut up to look like aliens.

485
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:17.270
Did he say specifically what kind of modifications they made to people that made

486
00:28:17.271 --> 00:28:18.104
them look like you?

487
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:22.580
<v 1>I got drips and read it in those 12, 12 pages.</v>

488
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.730
I'm telling you that because you're asking me these questions that as if I

489
00:28:25.731 --> 00:28:29.840
spent, I mean, look, I did spend literally hundreds of hours with a source.

490
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.190
We sat there and talked about everything and I would try to squeeze out just

491
00:28:34.191 --> 00:28:36.290
like you're trying to squeeze out of me. And that's what I'm saying.

492
00:28:36.291 --> 00:28:40.220
Read it because I literally tell you everything that there is.

493
00:28:40.221 --> 00:28:44.330
I think what's most interesting about the source and why I might come back and

494
00:28:44.331 --> 00:28:48.620
talk to you about it and tell you who he is on your show is because,

495
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:53.630
because of his backstory, right. Why he did what he did,

496
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:55.880
how he wound up in the Manhattan project.

497
00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:00.710
<v 0>Sounds like he was probably Jewish from Germany. No, no.</v>

498
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.700
<v 2>I'm trying to catch ya. Okay.</v>
