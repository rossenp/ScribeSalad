<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.600
What is it about that feeling of discomfort that brings you

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.240
joy or what that, that you enjoy giving to,

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.120
to people that are reading your stuff? Is it just that

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.560
you don't like the cliche

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.063
sloppy endings,

7
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.990
the way where everything is gonna be fine and everything's great.

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.830
And the world is different in literature than it is in real life.

9
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.670
Like, what is it about these moments?

10
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.670
Like these moments of darkness where you do break everybody's heart?

11
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.510
Why do you enjoy them so much?

12
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.620
<v 1>I enjoy them because they prove, but I'm not the only one. Ah,</v>

13
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.780
I'm not the only one that's had these moments of complete humiliation

14
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.220
or complete powerlessness. Um,

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.500
one story I've always loved is my best friend in college. Hi,

16
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.420
his father was this mining professor in this very super macho guy and my best

17
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.250
and Fran was like the son that just wasn't turning outright.

18
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.810
And in their household, they had a bunch of kids, girls, and boys.

19
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.930
And one day Fran's dad had all of his,

20
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.170
his beer drinking football buds over to watch the super bowl.

21
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.530
And Fran found this old doll that had been around the house for, for decades.

22
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.960
It was called sissy and it barely had a hair left on its little doll head.

23
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.120
And Fran sat there as maybe a five or six year old little boy.

24
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.320
And he very carefully untangled Sissy's hair and he backcombed it.

25
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:38.120
And he teased it and he dressed it into a big B font and even got one of his

26
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:39.000
mother's broaches.

27
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.390
And he put that broach through the front of this beehive hair to hold it in

28
00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:45.230
place. Very Marie Antoinette.

29
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.430
And he was so proud that he turned this really decrepit

30
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.910
ugly thing into something passively pretty.

31
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.070
He had sort of redeemed it and then he took it to his father in front of all of

32
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:02.670
his father's friends in the super bowl. And he said, daddy, daddy, look,

33
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.780
I made sissy pretty.

34
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.420
And his father was so humiliated that he beat Fran right there

35
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.420
in front of their whole peer group.

36
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.380
He just beat Fran.

37
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.850
And the story is so painful,

38
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.770
but everybody's had a pain like that. Everybody has done that,

39
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.810
that thing out of innocence and expression that for whatever reason,

40
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.410
gots you slammed and nobody talks about it.

41
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.170
Nobody talks about it because it's so painful.

42
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.490
And because everyone thinks they're the only one.

43
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.880
And so if I can take some of those stories and bring them to light,

44
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.000
it creates this opening for everyone to say, oh my God,

45
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.640
I once did this thing. And my parents reacted badly to it,

46
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.280
or it destroyed my life and I've never been the same. Uh,

47
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.080
and when Fran told me that story, he was almost weeping,

48
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.280
but he was laughing as he was telling the story because he had to keep laughing

49
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.280
in order to keep telling the story. And that's what I'm always shooting for.

50
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.440
<v 0>Those are the moments like tho those kind of,</v>

51
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.590
of stories are the ones that hit people the hardest,

52
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.150
because you know that the child has no idea that what they're doing is going to

53
00:03:26.151 --> 00:03:30.030
be uncomfortable for anybody. Like they have real pride in it, like, uh,

54
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.150
here as a parallel, as a story that you told before, uh,

55
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.390
I guess three years ago,

56
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.740
when you were talking about the writing workshop that you had done with, uh,

57
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.100
you were talking about someone else's story about how they were

58
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.460
jacking off in a jacuzzi and their anus got prolapsed.

59
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.020
And this woman in the writing workshop

60
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.620
felt comfortable enough because you told that story to tell her story

61
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.490
about being, uh, in the girl Scouts or the brownies,

62
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.490
the brownies before the girl scout, the heating pad story pad story. Yeah.

63
00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:08.770
Where she had put this vibrating heating pad on her vagina and had her friends

64
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.730
do the same thing. And the mom came home and she was only seven years old.

65
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:14.530
She thought it was cool. Like, look, I found this thing.

66
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.690
And then the mom beat her with the wire that was plugged

67
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.600
wall and called her a dirty. And she never orgasmed again.

68
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.120
<v 1>And she said in summation that if I could tell</v>

69
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.720
this story that I had just told it was so, so,

70
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.160
uh self-pacing and so humiliating,

71
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.760
but also make it funny then that would,

72
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.510
that gave her her proof that she could make her own story funny.

73
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.950
And that maybe she could someday go back to her mother and say,

74
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.230
remember that heating pad and that maybe ultimately she could have an orgasm

75
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.790
because until you can kind of reveal these things and, and resolve them,

76
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.830
they run the rest of your life and you're never gonna get beyond them.

77
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.300
<v 0>Yeah. Especially when you don't see it coming when you're just a child and then</v>

78
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.860
you do something that you think is totally fine.

79
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.740
And all of a sudden you're getting the beaten out of you.

80
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.100
And you don't understand why all you did is make a doll pretty like what

81
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.890
happened.

82
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.610
<v 1>Well, and it it's, it occurs in so many different ways. Uh,</v>

83
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.610
several years ago I got a job house sitting a farm that was famous for being

84
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:29.850
haunted and had all these paranormal studies.

85
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.370
So as soon as the owners were gone, I invited a bunch of psychics out to do a,

86
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.330
a seance. You know, I wanted to know,

87
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.970
and my father had been murdered about five years before that.

88
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.120
&lt;affirmative&gt; and one of these psychic women that I'd never met before

89
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.880
said there was a man standing with you,

90
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.560
he's wearing a white t-shirt and he he's holding something wooden.

91
00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.160
And he is really, really sorry. He did what he did, but he was in a very,

92
00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:04.920
very young man at the time, he was only 23 or 24. He's holding something wooden.

93
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.240
And he's about to dismember you. Does that make any sense whatsoever?

94
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.680
And I just kind of noded my head. And I said,

95
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.360
I have no idea what you're talking about, but when I was,

96
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.790
was maybe three or four years old,

97
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.630
my mother had taken my siblings into town and I was, you know,

98
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.430
in our rural farm. And I put a, a,

99
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.150
a fender washer around one of my fingers and I couldn't get it off.

100
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.230
And so I waited until a finger was swollen up and turning sort of purple black.

101
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.740
I went to my father and I said, can you help me with this washer thing?

102
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.900
And my father had said, I can help you,

103
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:46.820
but I want you to learn lesson that you have to,

104
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.060
there are consequences to everything you do,

105
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.020
and I will help you with a washer.

106
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.170
If you accept responsibility for your actions for the rest of your life.

107
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.210
And he took me and we had to wash the ax that we kill chickens with.

108
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.050
We had this hatchet and he took me and we sharpened the hatchet and we washed it

109
00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:10.010
really thoroughly. So there were no germs on it.

110
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.290
And then he had me kneel down by the chopping block and put my hand on the

111
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:18.480
chopping block. And at the time there was no, oh, drama.

112
00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:19.600
It was just complete clarity.

113
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.960
My father was helping me to resolve this situation. And at the last moment,

114
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.200
he missed my hand with the ax. The AXS went into the chopping block,

115
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.600
and then we went inside and used, uh, dish soap to take the washer off.

116
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.880
And I knew that story would just make my mother insane.

117
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.190
So I never told anybody my entire life, that story watch the.
