00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.920
<v 1>Who is the other homeboy surprise play Batman. Well,</v>

2
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:09.960
a Christian bale was the best Batman,

3
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:14.070
in my opinion is what just his voice bothered me. Ooh. It was a little fake,

4
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:18.780
right? Yeah. When he was at Mel Batman, he's going to make a fake voice.

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.760
You're going to make a fake voice that people don't recognize.

6
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:21.900
You're Bruce Wayne. Yeah.

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.170
Don't you at least have like some mouth thing that Jimmy catchphrase or some

8
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:27.450
people would know that would be dope if you covered your face. Like,

9
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.820
why do we need to see the lower chin of Batman? First of all?

10
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.860
I don't think that's a good idea for protective measures.

11
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.870
The chin part is terrible because like, that's the part you'd want to punch.

12
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.700
And it would be like so white, if you're in a fight with that,

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.620
man, just shoot for the chin. You can't miss it.

14
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.250
You think you have camouflage on everywhere spot. You're get knocked out.

15
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.970
It's like, I deal with, he looks stupid

16
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.020
when he looked at it. It's the dumbest idea ever.

17
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.240
Like you're going to not protect the most vulnerable.

18
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.590
How about just open up the nose, nose part up to let your nose get smashed.

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.740
That's so crazy. That's so strange.

20
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.790
It's like Bruce Wayne from Batman in the light, Dan. And then, and then,

21
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.870
and then the Batman,

22
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.050
at least he didn't have like a protective suit on Adam West. No,

23
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.900
he just had that thing over his eyes. He was just in disguise.

24
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.170
This Batman is gotten to the point where he's in his,

25
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.700
like basically it was an armored suit and meanwhile, he doesn't cover his face.

26
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.920
He was going to war with Superman. Do you know how stupid data's and doing work?

27
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.910
How to look to sass? Superman is from another planet. He can fly so fast.

28
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:36.810
He makes the world spin backwards. He makes time goes backwards.

29
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.970
He can cut things in half with his eyeballs. He's got laser shoes,

30
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.540
pick his dumb up and carry him as high as he wants. And let some go. Yeah.

31
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.040
In space movies over could bring you to the sun. Yes. Throw you into the sun.

32
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.360
You talking about Hollywood, push it on my face. How,

33
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.370
how crazy is the idea that gravity is so dense on Superman's world?

34
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.620
That when he comes to earth, he can fly.

35
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.340
And then the atmosphere is so different than his body's Bulletproof,

36
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:06.450
but he looks just like us.
