00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.780
<v 2>Did you read the email leaks? Do the emails from intersect sick and yeah.</v>

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.331
All the,

4
00:00:07.331 --> 00:00:12.300
the different discussions that they had about their concerns that they were

5
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:15.090
responsible for this through gain of function research.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.230
<v 1>They applied for a grant to specifically do a fear,</v>

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.090
to insert a fear and Cleveland site,

8
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:24.960
which is that particular part of the virus that, that raised so much concern.

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.680
Yeah. I mean, look, the thing is like this gets back,

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.830
this gets back to the same thing. I think we're dancing around a little bit,

11
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:35.970
which is, I don't know sometimes what to do with this. It's highly suspicious.

12
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.570
I think of this sometimes the way I think about my teenage kids.

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.730
They're not telling me everything here now,

14
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:44.520
do I automatically assume they're totally guilty of everything I think they're

15
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:47.610
guilty of or is there something else going on here? You know,

16
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.620
I think China has not w it,

17
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.060
part of being prepared in my world, war C book is, is that, is that, um,

18
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.980
we have to have a,

19
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.450
a world health organization that's actually empowered to be able to do things.

20
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.080
It's just, it's too beholden, I think to China. And,

21
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.100
and w there was a letter that came out from Peter dash in February of last year

22
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.600
that he wrote in the Lancet,

23
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.960
along with a bunch of other people saying this thing, uh, you know,

24
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.620
this is ridiculous to suggest that this had somehow been bio-engineered in the

25
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:20.454
lab, you know.

26
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.170
<v 0>And while the internal emails suggested that he had very different concerns.</v>

27
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.340
<v 1>That's, that's, that's worrisome. And I said that the P I said, Peter, this,</v>

28
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:30.720
this is not making sense.

29
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.800
<v 0>And what did he say? He.</v>

30
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.820
<v 1>Said, Hey, there's no evidence that the virus ever existed in this lab.</v>

31
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.710
There's no evidence that it leaked out because they.

32
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.400
<v 0>Destroyed a lot of evidence. They, they.</v>

33
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.270
<v 1>Th th this is concerning.</v>

34
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.000
<v 0>Deleted. And how many, how many,</v>

35
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.130
how much evidence did they delete in 2019? I mean, some stunning amounts.

36
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.840
<v 1>Well, the entire database went down exactly. Now. I said, what I said to him,</v>

37
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.840
you were a part of the, who investigation. Did you see the database? Now?

38
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:00.630
It's been over a year later. He said, no. When I said,

39
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:04.290
is that not of concern to you? He said, look, he goes, it was a public database.

40
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.160
They were worried about hacking. And so that's why they took it down. I said,

41
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.740
if it was a public database, why were they worried about hacking? You know,

42
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.800
what were they, what were they trying to hide? You know? So I don't,

43
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.640
I don't know Joe, what to make of it. It's they there's clearly,

44
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.420
as you said earlier, I think he said where there's smoke. There's fire probably,

45
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.980
but can I say conclusively? No. And part of me thinks we may never know.

46
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.740
We don't have a system in place at a,

47
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.480
at a sort of global level to mandate that these things actually come to light.

48
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.410
We don't treat this. Like we treat department of defense issues. We don't treat,

49
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.920
you know, we, we should be thinking about this more from a defense standpoint,

50
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:43.560
rather than a public health preventive standpoint.

51
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.230
<v 0>Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Um,</v>

52
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.890
when you see Fowchee being grilled by Ron Paul,

53
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.090
and he denies that they were doing gain of function research,

54
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.500
what are your thoughts on that?

55
00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:59.920
Because by any definition that was gain of function, research, gain of function.

56
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:02.470
Research is taking a virus.

57
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.360
We should probably Google the exact definition, but what my, um,

58
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.030
impressionist gain of function means you are imparting new

59
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.300
ability to this virus to infect humans, right?

60
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.810
The idea is that you're juicing it up and making it more contagious, right.

61
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.260
<v 1>And, and that type of research has been done. And in fact,</v>

62
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:27.430
I think it wasn't 2015, I think, in the, in the Netherlands somewhere.

63
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.380
<v 0>But if the NIH was,</v>

64
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.030
was giving funding to EcoHealth Alliance and EcoHealth Alliance was

65
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.640
funding that kind of research,

66
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.790
I think [inaudible] is not being honest about that.

67
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.420
<v 1>I think,</v>

68
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.140
I think the NIH is clearly funding EcoHealth Alliance and EcoHealth Alliance is

69
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:46.570
clearly giving grants to Wuhan Institute of virology.

70
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.030
Here's how they answer the question. When I asked them,

71
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:51.490
including Francis Collins, who's the head of the NIH.

72
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.060
They S they define gain a function, research. This,

73
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.780
you have a known bad contagious pathogen,

74
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.170
and you're going to essentially do a, you know,

75
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:05.850
use the backbone of another known bad pathogen. And you're,

76
00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:09.820
you're going to splice them together. Essentially, you're taking one thing that,

77
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:13.300
you know, to be bad and contagious and splicing it with something else that,

78
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:15.460
you know, to be bad, that is,

79
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:18.340
you're expecting this to be worse than what you started with.

80
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.810
If you're taking a novel virus and you don't know how contagious this is,

81
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.130
and you're basically saying, look, I want to,

82
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.950
I want to isolate the spike protein on this new virus.

83
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:29.110
I'm going to put it on the backbone of something I do know.

84
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.940
<v 0>And make it contagious to humans. We'll.</v>

85
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.830
<v 1>See how it behaves at that point.</v>

86
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.750
Does this actually start to behave as something super contagious or not? The,

87
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:40.930
the, the possibility is that it could, but they're not sure.

88
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.920
So this is nuanced. And, you know, a lot of people have taken issue with,

89
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.750
and including scientists who work in the field,

90
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.740
but the strict definition is that you got to know for gain of function research,

91
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:52.930
you know, that it's gonna lead to gain a functions.

92
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.530
<v 0>Maybe the problem is using the term gain of function. Yeah.</v>

93
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.390
If we instead abandoned any sort of a

94
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.360
nomenclature that might be problematic and say,

95
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.420
were they doing experiments to make viruses more contagious to people?

96
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.020
The answer would be yes.

97
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.370
Were they doing experiments that could lead to viruses being more contained?

99
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.520
Yes. Yes. I think that that's right. Um, that is,

100
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.010
that is research that is done to try and figure out. I mean,

101
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.050
it's a lot of these pathogens. They, they examine their,

102
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.400
that they're not contagious.

103
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:27.460
They put the spike protein and they put some component of the virus onto the

104
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:30.610
backbone of a known thing, and it doesn't do much. So they say, well,

105
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.930
we don't have to worry about this,

106
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.860
but it could turn into a situation where you take a component of a new virus.

107
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:38.260
You put it on the backbone of a known virus,

108
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.410
and it does lead to something much more contagious.

109
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.920
And that's what a lot of people are concerned about here. I mean, you know,

110
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:47.530
there was the part of those emails, as you know, Joe were,

111
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:51.160
were emails that were sent to Fowchee January of last year,

112
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.890
where Christian Anderson raised this concern.

113
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.160
He subsequently wrote a paper saying, Hey, those changes that we saw,

114
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.920
I thought that that was clear evidence of bioengineering,

115
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.600
but now I've seen evidence of those same abnormalities in existing naturally

116
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.690
occurring viruses. So now I don't think that's, that's the problem,

117
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.960
but it's just, it's, it's going back and forth. And, you know, frankly,

118
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:13.900
we may never know for sure. What's.
