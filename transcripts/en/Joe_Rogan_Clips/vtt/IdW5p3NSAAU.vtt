00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience this fight, man. Holy.</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.560
<v 1>This fight is crazy. Here we go, baby.</v>

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.540
Jamie, give me a little volume since I don't have headphones on,

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.940
I'm going to hear a little of this, the great Bruce buffer.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.140
I can't wear headphones with this beautiful kangaroo.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.310
<v 2>Meat hat. I don't know what this is made out of.</v>

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.860
Is this made out of kangaroo? Does it say

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.950
he told me I forgot.

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.281
<v 3>What do you think?</v>

10
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:35.990
Like the most like demonic or haunted Relic you have in here is

11
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.810
like, I feel like so much of this crazy.

12
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:43.040
Stuff's probably from some hidden temple or something, right? Question.

13
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.330
What's.

14
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.160
<v 1>The most haunted we have in here.</v>

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.490
<v 4>But she's picture of Brody's picture.</v>

16
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.560
<v 1>Pro. This picture might be the most haunted.</v>

17
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.260
Yeah. I would say part of an Aztec empire.

18
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.190
[inaudible] dinosaur food who gave us that again?

19
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.120
<v 4>The energy from that, those things are Mitzi's the.</v>

20
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.900
<v 3>Horns. Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.250
<v 1>That's that's dinner. That's great energy. That then gives me good.</v>

22
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.670
I love those things. Did you eat that animal?

23
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.620
The out of that one that one's already eaten.

24
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.430
That's I shot that elk two and a half, three years ago, whatever it was.

25
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.670
Yeah. I ate him. Wow. I ate his liver. I hate his heart. I hate everything.

26
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:35.504
How big was he?

27
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.470
<v 5>Just a big elk. You have a big apple.</v>

28
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.070
<v 1>Took me like a year to eat him.</v>

29
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.830
I had elk and eggs this morning for breakfast. That's great, bro.

30
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.620
They do like an analysis of my DNA. They'd be like, what? In the?

31
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.380
This dude is 90% deer meat.

32
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.040
<v 4>It's not all you eat now. I eat a lot.</v>

33
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.240
<v 1>Of it, man. I cook, uh,</v>

34
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.010
I'll cook a big elk roast every week and then

35
00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:08.030
I'll uh, I'll eat it for breakfast. I'll slice it up. I put hot sauce on it.

36
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.100
Eat it, eat it up.

37
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.750
<v 3>You get a Trager yet. Joey Diaz, a Traeger grill a smoker.</v>

38
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.940
No I'm telling you dude. You would, if you had this mammoth jam, right?

39
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.580
I'm telling you, bro, bro, you.

40
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.640
<v 2>Don't like looking at food raw. You mean, if you look at me.</v>

41
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.010
<v 4>You're like Joey is a great cook.</v>

42
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.630
I could sit with you and tell you how they do certain restaurant

43
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.640
because I'm not the kitchen.

44
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.230
But as far as me looking at a chicken or raw chicken and touching it,

45
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.770
all that really? No, I.

46
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.330
<v 3>Could picture you over a grill.</v>

47
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.300
You'd get cast for every character that stands over.

48
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.750
<v 4>A girl. I used to make chicken, all that cocoa. Yeah. When I was a kid,</v>

49
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:53.270
which was chicken cutlets like onions and garlic.

50
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.103
<v 1>And stuff,</v>

51
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.080
man just walked all the way across the cage and stood right in front of

52
00:02:59.081 --> 00:03:02.700
Mazda doll. As they said his name. Wow,

53
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.750
this is going to be crazy. This is very interesting.

54
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.120
Very interesting because this is the biggest strongest guy that Mazda dolls

55
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.310
ever fought at welterweight.

56
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.980
Luckily he was a pretty big guy Walter way too. But um,

57
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.370
physically Comoro is a different animal.

58
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.110
I mean he's a national champion wrestler and just a

59
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.430
spectacular physical specimen. Look at this.

60
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.900
<v 5>[Inaudible] low.</v>

61
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.340
<v 1>Kick right away from Mazda at all, another low kick.</v>

62
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.920
And he clicked on the left hook. Wow.

63
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.240
Oh, inside low kick Boswell took him down or excuse me.

64
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.590
Kamara took him down.

65
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.123
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

66
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.220
<v 1>Mozza was a very good wrestler though. He's real sneaky.</v>

67
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.110
Very sneaky with his grappling.

68
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.940
<v 3>Yeah. It's interesting that it's down this fast. Yeah, it is interesting.</v>

69
00:04:16.941 --> 00:04:18.410
But he's.

70
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.820
<v 1>Kind of holding on. Let's see what he's able to do.</v>

71
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.390
You just fart. No. Yeah.

72
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.810
But I was going to say is that, you know, he fought at lightweight.

73
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.580
Most of his career Mazda at all did and boost Mon

74
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:44.690
is much bigger. I mean, he's a, an enormous lightweight.

75
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.600
He's about as big as a lightweight, excuse me. Enormous welterweight.

76
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.360
He's about as big as a welterweight can get. And the only guy.

77
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.490
<v 3>To beat Huseman was a lot taller than him.</v>

78
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.310
<v 1>Right? Isn't that what he said? I got caught in, uh,</v>

79
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.290
I think it was his first pro fight.

80
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.280
He got caught with a rear naked choke and he got tapped, but it,

81
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.040
I don't think it had anything to do with someone being bigger.

82
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.090
He just didn't understand you Jitsu then. Yeah.

83
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.540
He's out. He's up. Interesting. Not interesting at all.

84
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.370
Nothing very little happened there.

85
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.910
But now on the feet I give a big advantage to Mazda doll,

86
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.790
especially when it comes to uh, wow.

87
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.170
Especially when it comes to combinations, he lands wild combinations

88
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.530
inside, low kick. Again.

89
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.850
I hate that bro. MOSFET all wins his fight. He's a superstar. Yeah.

90
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.890
Oh nice knee to the body. Oh. He heard him. He heard him with that and oh,

91
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.460
when he kicked him in the body. Ooh.

92
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.050
What did you say in Cuban a second ago?

93
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.600
The thing about this fight is it Mazda at all was training for a

94
00:05:56.601 --> 00:06:01.370
fight on July 11th, but then the negotiations didn't go well.

95
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.410
And then they gave it to Gilbert burns because Gilbert burns was willing

96
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:10.850
to take a, a D a different deal. That Mazda wouldn't take,

97
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.130
but he was still training. Now. He says he was ready anyway,

98
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.860
because he thought the one of these guys was going to fall out because a lot of

99
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:21.500
times guys do fall out. Guys get injured all the time.

100
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:24.770
I would say it's like 40% of the time in these big fights.

101
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.780
Some happens and things fall apart.

102
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.570
<v 4>I mean, he said he's been training. Yeah, he does.</v>

103
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.070
<v 1>It's smart, man. It's smart.</v>

104
00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:37.990
Look at Khabib and Tony Ferguson have never happened every time.

105
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.220
They're supposed to happen.

106
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:41.890
It doesn't happen that flight's been canceled five times.

107
00:06:41.891 --> 00:06:45.100
So when you're at this level, it's a smart move.

108
00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:48.610
If they're negotiating with you for a fight on July 11th, just keep training,

109
00:06:48.611 --> 00:06:50.980
man. Even if the negotiations fall apart,

110
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.630
because if you do get that call six days out and you are in shape,

111
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.920
but the question is like, is Mazda at all? I mean, we don't know.

112
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.430
We don't know how much he was training and we don't know what he did do. Oh,

113
00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:04.600
big shot by Huseman.

114
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.900
<v 3>Little blood over mass Fidel's eyebrow.</v>

115
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.670
<v 1>Ooh. See, see what I'm saying? He's sneaky. He sets stuff up.</v>

116
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.440
He does like some crafty veteran in there. See,

117
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.370
like he he'll rush. You hit you at shots coming in

118
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.660
because those calm and steady, calm and steady.

119
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.510
That's how I was with Colby too. Calm and steady.

120
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.670
Just kept that pressure on didn't really throw a hundred percent heat

121
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.210
until he knew he had him hurt. He just stays calm and steady.

122
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.420
He'll stab you in the stomach a lot with those front kicks too.

123
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.630
But see Jorge is catching them with these combinations.

124
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.600
Oh, this is not good for [inaudible].

125
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.550
<v 5>Oh.</v>

126
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.390
<v 1>Mazda doll is just too clever and fast with his hands.</v>

127
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.780
He's got to get away from that cage

128
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.950
with the right hand. Oh,

129
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.040
big shots of the body by ma by Huisman hoof.

130
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.900
<v 3>The wild thing about Masa doll is he basically outboxed Nate Diaz, who.</v>

131
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.730
<v 1>Out of nature of this man who out of him. That was a box.</v>

132
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:47.470
<v 3>Conor McGregor who won rounds against around at least against</v>

133
00:08:47.471 --> 00:08:48.130
Mayweather.

134
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.360
<v 1>Well, they were talking about setting.</v>

135
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:52.300
I'm also a doll and Connor McGregor and Dan, and what it was like,

136
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.250
get the out of here.

137
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.290
It's like them not having that fight happening. That is not.

138
00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:03.140
And they were also talking about setting them up with Uzma. And again,

139
00:09:03.141 --> 00:09:03.974
Dan white was like,

140
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.300
get the out of here because they were talking about it right after three knocked

141
00:09:08.301 --> 00:09:10.220
out cowboy. When Conor knocked out Cowboys, like.

142
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.820
<v 6>I love myself, had 1 74 strong.</v>

143
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.360
I feel great, Joe.

144
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.240
That's a much better Jimmy Schumer.

145
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.720
I can do all these things. I can do all these tings at one 70.

146
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.820
Look at this boom.

147
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:43.880
<v 1>Oh, big right-hand there boost model on the brake bank.</v>

148
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.390
Look at that right hand. And the left hook on the brake.

149
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.480
Again, chopping at that leg. That low calf kick,

150
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.760
you know, what's interesting Mazda. It all stands dead straight. Like you,

151
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.320
you watched how he stands up. He doesn't look like he's avoiding the takedown.

152
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.540
Oh, look at that. Take single leg. Got out of it. Wow. I know.

153
00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:10.730
Way high too. Stretched them out.

154
00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:14.643
Oh, look at this.

155
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.170
He's deciding he must've got some good coaching in the corner and they're like,

156
00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:22.880
Hey, listen, all this boxing. You're the best wrestler in this division.

157
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.610
Get ahold of, there you go. Get ahold of this guy,

158
00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:29.300
drag him to the ground and Maul him.

159
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.900
That's what you do. Cause he's getting hit too many times.

160
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.970
And he's only human is tough. As it was spawn is a guy like Mazda,

161
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.851
all clips.

162
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:45.320
You a few times that little video game power bar just keeps dropping.

163
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.050
Kind of impressive.

164
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.110
What I was going to say about Mazda doll is that he stands straight up.

165
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.090
He doesn't like have it.

166
00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:02.060
Doesn't look like he's trying at all to stop take downs.

167
00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:03.710
It looks like he's in a kickboxing fight.

168
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.250
He's like got perfect upright posture.

169
00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:11.990
But his balance is so good in his take-down defense is so good.

170
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.100
It usually can avoid them.

171
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.530
It's a weird position. They're in, it's got risk control.

172
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.510
It's taking a lot of foot stomps. Yeah. Those are weird, man.

173
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:38.330
If someone doesn't perfectly. Woo, nice elbow there.

174
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.130
Wow. Someone does it perfectly. You can, uh, you can,

175
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.790
you can damage someone's foot, but it's oftentimes it's just annoying.

176
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.070
<v 5>It seems like those would really hurt. Was a good left-hand of the body,</v>

177
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:54.904
but it was spawn.

178
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.580
He's digging into the liver with that.

179
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.740
<v 3>I guess in the new video game you could do like Florida backyard octagon.</v>

180
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:11.843
I think I saw.

181
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.310
<v 1>Mazda doll and Kimbo slice used to fight. Yep.</v>

182
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.450
<v 3>Does it look like MOSFET? All his like white stuff on his face,</v>

183
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.110
maybe the only one seeing that on the close ups. Do you mean.

184
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.880
<v 5>It looks like he is like, he's like losing color in his face or something.</v>

185
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:38.790
What are you talking about?

186
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:43.320
<v 3>You see that like how it looks like he sorta has like a sun suntan lotion on or</v>

187
00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:44.154
something.

188
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.950
It's not the like the contrast is just sweat. Yeah.

189
00:12:49.951 --> 00:12:53.130
Maybe it's just the contrast on the TV or something.

190
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.140
<v 1>I think was just sweating in a fight.</v>

191
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.180
He's got to get away from the cage

192
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.580
stop when this poor guy's leaning on it. Oh, I understand.

193
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.590
<v 3>Oh, this man definitely just doesn't want to F.</v>

194
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.800
<v 1>Well, he's just being smart. His,</v>

195
00:13:10.801 --> 00:13:14.910
his strength is in his grappling and his physical size and power.

196
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.710
And the more he does this to Mazda doll and the way he's digging into the body,

197
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.000
the more he does this,

198
00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:24.000
the more it's going to take away from Mazda doll's ability to explode on him.

199
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.890
What.

200
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.060
<v 3>Is MOSFET I'll need to do here?</v>

201
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.790
Big step to the left and push with the left hand.

202
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:34.140
<v 1>He's uh, he's definitely got to get his back away from the cage for sure.</v>

203
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.420
He's got to try to turn him. He's got escape.

204
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.210
He's got to somehow or another get out of this clench,

205
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.620
but it's like how much energy is it going to take to do that?

206
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.180
And if he does do that, will oops. Mom be able to put them right back on there,

207
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.230
but he's got to do something or he's losing this round. I mean,

208
00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:55.440
he's only got 55 seconds to go, right? Oh.

209
00:13:55.441 --> 00:13:57.690
And he's keeps shoulder checking them.

210
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:05.400
I mean, Mazda. We're all smiling, but he's for sure. Giving up this round.

211
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.670
Oh, good. Left hand by Uzma.

212
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.300
<v 3>MOSFET. I'll still as a full gas tank right now.</v>

213
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.730
<v 1>Nice inside locate. Oh.</v>

214
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.320
<v 4>Oh God.</v>

215
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.340
<v 1>That's. That's why [inaudible] oh.</v>

216
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.670
Oh, nice. Low kick. They didn't catch that one on camera. They were, uh,

217
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.880
they had a mid body camera shop. That was a nice low kick.

218
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.640
Yeah. Must Fidel

219
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.630
big control stand up.

220
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.110
What does that mean? It means good. Oh good things are happening. Tony

221
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.760
white people. Am I right? Joey.

222
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.340
<v 3>Cubans. You talk a whole different language here. What? A crocodile.</v>

223
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.190
<v 1>Yeah. It was the contrast by the way. There's no. Yeah, it was beautiful. Yeah.</v>

224
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.480
So perfect skin. He's telling them don't let them hold on to you.

225
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.010
Oh yeah. You can translate this. Oh, your nose breathe.

226
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.920
They must have listen to my podcast with James nester.

227
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.000
Got a lot of Google over his left eye. Look at that.

228
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.600
They should wipe that off all Yoel Romero. That goop is, uh,

229
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.190
it'll get into his eyeball though.

230
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:57.870
I think it's just Vaseline. But

231
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.860
in boxing they actually use adrenaline to stop cuts, to stop bleeding,

232
00:16:05.861 --> 00:16:08.230
which is interesting. I wonder how that even works.

233
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.110
Like it's a cream. I think it's like a, an ointment,

234
00:16:14.111 --> 00:16:17.170
like an adrenaline ointment that they use to stop the bleeding.

235
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.680
I've never asked a doctor about it,

236
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.370
but I know that they I've heard commentators talk about it.

237
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.590
How they use adrenaline. Have you ever interviewed Tyson fury?

238
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.930
Yes. He's awesome.

239
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:37.450
<v 3>Any chance he got to use the kick machine? No, he didn't use the kick machine.</v>

240
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.730
I'd love to know what he'd score on that.

241
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.610
If he tried from a positive that dude could kick.

242
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.470
If he could land a kick with his punching and just brains.

243
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.143
<v 1>Well,</v>

244
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.980
[inaudible] punches almost as hard as I kick.

245
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.310
Like when you look at the meter, like what it registers,

246
00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.920
he has the hardest registered punch on that thing.

247
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:05.680
And for awhile I had the hardest registered kick. Some of the dude bested me.

248
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.800
I my knee. You.

249
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.750
<v 3>Can kick as hard as Negan who can punch or harder. I kick harder. Holy. Yeah.</v>

250
00:17:13.751 --> 00:17:16.690
But it's all like, dude. Right. It's I get it.

251
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:19.570
But that's still pretty cool thing to think.

252
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.080
<v 1>But I, uh, I was doing it with Joe Schilling and oh. And I, since I locate, oh,</v>

253
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.750
they're getting after it here. Oh,

254
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.920
third round here. Things are heating up.

255
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.330
Anyway. I tore meniscus doing it like an idiot.

256
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.560
Me and Joe Schilling were doing it. I had my pants on no warmup.

257
00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:00.600
I'm 52 years old, full blast kicking this bat like an idiot.

258
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:04.620
And then the next day my meniscus was really sore. I got an MRI.

259
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.600
I have a little tear in there now

260
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.850
I've been working on it ever since trying to fix it.

261
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.370
<v 3>That stretching is important.</v>

262
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.480
<v 1>It's not even stretching. It's getting everything right. Warmed up.</v>

263
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.640
The latching is okay.

264
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:24.630
But really what's important is getting heat in your muscles. Sweating.

265
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.690
Did he take one of the nuts there? What happened?

266
00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.043
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

267
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.680
<v 1>This is nicely. I'll take a little break here for Jorge.</v>

268
00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.290
What did he do here? I'm confused.

269
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:53.683
I didn't see that.

270
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.890
<v 3>Yeah. Didn't look like a low blow there. Maybe it was a different shot.</v>

271
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:03.260
<v 1>I didn't see the replay at all. The replay looked above the,</v>

272
00:19:03.261 --> 00:19:04.094
a.

273
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.430
<v 3>Groin, but I think they may have shown me as a time punch.</v>

274
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:08.263
<v 5>After that.</v>

275
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:22.100
[inaudible] talking to him. I don't think so.

276
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:33.020
Let me see this. Hmm

277
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.430
[inaudible] whoa. What's that? That's the part that was weird.

278
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.720
He tea cup does nuts.

279
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.180
<v 3>Yeah. Yeah. That was it. It wasn't the punch.</v>

280
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:48.980
Cause that's when he racked reacts on the other angle. I'm serious cup.

281
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.350
It's like, you're going to let them squeeze my junk like that.

282
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.640
[inaudible] Hmm.

283
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.670
Who's your favorite referee? Joe Rogan.

284
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.150
<v 1>Herb Dean. Yep. I think herb Dean is the best,</v>

285
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.390
but there's a lot of guys that are really good. There's like,

286
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.090
there's that level? That herb Dean level. Now,

287
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.230
especially now the big John McCarthy's retired, but uh,

288
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.580
there's a lot of really good guys. I just, when I see her Dean,

289
00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:32.970
I get a feel safe. My curve is not going to this up.

290
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.393
<v 5>[Inaudible]</v>

291
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.120
so weird. How quiet it is in there.

292
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.140
<v 1>Oh, it's weird. show. You got to go there. Live.</v>

293
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.650
<v 4>Come with, I'm watching this. I'm like this just wish you.</v>

294
00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.550
<v 1>Could come with me to one.</v>

295
00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:03.120
There's a lot more people in the audience in this one than normal. Wow.

296
00:21:03.121 --> 00:21:06.180
Look at that big take down for [inaudible]. This is big. This is big. If it was

297
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:06.180
small, I can get a couple of takedowns

298
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:06.180
 like this that's big. And here is inside control. Wow. Big striking advantage for 

299
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:06.180
loose Mala that 144 toll strikes versus 89. Here we go. I'll get that

300
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:06.180
 up. Nope. Control them. Oh, big elbow by Huseman. Yeah

301
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.013
. This is the first fight where I'm, [inaudible]

302
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:03.700
working with Trevor Whitman too.

303
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.140
He's down in Denver with just engag and,

304
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.860
and that's where a rose Namajunas is training to

305
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.680
shout out to pat Barry.

306
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.420
<v 3>Oh, look at that. They all train in Denver. Yeah.</v>

307
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.570
[inaudible] they're a big advantage with that altitude.

308
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:33.550
<v 1>That's a good question. Because some people say yes and some people say, no,</v>

309
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:38.620
some people say you're better off training at sea level because at sea level you

310
00:22:38.621 --> 00:22:42.040
could put in more work cause there's more air.

311
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.640
And really what the altitude is for is for recovery.

312
00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.690
So you should sleep at altitude, but train at sea level.

313
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.190
That's what a lot of people think.

314
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.780
That's what like the current cutting edge science seems to indicate.

315
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:57.090
So they think that the,

316
00:22:57.091 --> 00:23:02.080
maybe the best thing to do is to train at sea

317
00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:06.400
level and then sleep in an oxygen tent. My.

318
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.140
<v 4>Best sleeping ever was when I lived in Stalmaster village. Yeah.</v>

319
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.580
That's when that waking up in the middle of the night, ended in my life.

320
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.300
I would leave the window opened two winches.

321
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.230
You get that cool air at two in the morning. Have you stayed?

322
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:28.330
<v 3>Have you stayed in a hotel since the lockdown? No, we.</v>

323
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:33.040
<v 7>Stay when we were in Houston, we, you know, there was nobody there, nobody.</v>

324
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.630
<v 3>There, Joey, you can't find sleep like this in Los Angeles.</v>

325
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.320
You'll there will be a helicopter at some point within six hours. I mean,

326
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.710
I didn't realize until I woke up, I didn't hear a peep for eight, 10 hours,

327
00:23:45.711 --> 00:23:49.370
something crazy championship brown. Who's a nobody in the hotel.

328
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.350
So it's it's oh, you're on the 12th floor of it.

329
00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:59.380
<v 1>Joe grabs that leg. Dude. Undeniable, undeniable,</v>

330
00:23:59.381 --> 00:24:04.150
wrestling and strength. Look at those MOSFET all fought it off.

331
00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.650
Yeah. It's so different with no crowd, man.

332
00:24:11.651 --> 00:24:15.850
You hear these shots when you're there live, you hear them breathing.

333
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.750
It's crazy.

334
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.800
<v 3>It's wild. Because even when it's packed arenas,</v>

335
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.620
even when it's packed arenas, you can hear so much.

336
00:24:23.621 --> 00:24:27.850
So I can't even imagine what it's like. It's amazing when it's empty. I got it.

337
00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:27.970
To.

338
00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.830
<v 1>Be honest, I kinda like it better.</v>

339
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.300
There's something about the undeniable energy of a big crowd.

340
00:24:34.301 --> 00:24:36.430
That's pretty amazing too. It's not like it's bad,

341
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.740
but there's something extra special about being able to watch these fights

342
00:24:41.741 --> 00:24:44.590
with no audience when you're there live. Because first of all,

343
00:24:44.591 --> 00:24:46.690
you feel so fortunate. Like, man,

344
00:24:46.691 --> 00:24:49.750
I can't believe I'm here watching Tyron,

345
00:24:49.751 --> 00:24:53.260
Woodley and Gilbert burns live. You know,

346
00:24:53.261 --> 00:24:57.520
no audience does not that many people got to see that fight live

347
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.370
two Mazda dolls. He's just fighting off these takedowns all the time.

348
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.203
<v 5>Now</v>

349
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.383
[inaudible].

350
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.833
<v 1>Man.</v>

351
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.160
Jorge is just having a hard time with his wrestling and here we are in the

352
00:25:27.161 --> 00:25:27.994
fourth,

353
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:32.830
it's just got him covered.

354
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.401
I wonder what,

355
00:25:39.401 --> 00:25:42.970
if anything would have been different if he did have a full training camp for

356
00:25:42.971 --> 00:25:46.810
this because oops,

357
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.390
man just looks sensational

358
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.470
saying something.

359
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.110
It's nine 30 in the morning there right now in Yas island. Yeah. Oh my God.

360
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:00.963
<v 5>Is it really?</v>

361
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.840
<v 1>That's kind of crazy. So when was the first fight?</v>

362
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:10.000
<v 3>I can't imagine them ever getting, going, trying for that schedule though,</v>

363
00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:11.590
to them. It's got ups still be.

364
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.880
<v 1>So the first fight was like what? Six hours ago? Yeah.</v>

365
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.330
So they started fighting at three 30 in the morning. Oh.

366
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:26.320
<v 3>They did that once and we had to do that one. Caught him with a big shot.</v>

367
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.550
The one we were at in Sweden was it dude.

368
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.303
Whoa.

369
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.770
<v 1>Been letting them stand. Yeah.</v>

370
00:26:56.771 --> 00:27:01.240
He's trying to lure him into something. So he does, he does these rushes.

371
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.670
<v 5>Oh. Oh,</v>

372
00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.750
don't give him that far off that take down.

373
00:27:16.751 --> 00:27:19.720
Nice big punch by useless,

374
00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.190
straight press.

375
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:13.710
<v 1>These fights are so like these kinds of fights are so interesting to me because</v>

376
00:28:13.711 --> 00:28:16.440
it's like, you see a guy who's as strong as it was Mon.

377
00:28:16.441 --> 00:28:20.280
It's such a good wrestler and figures out how to get a guy up against the cage.

378
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.140
And I know for a lot of people that boring. Cause it's not a lot happens,

379
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:29.910
but it's so hard for him to avoid like as a

380
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.240
tack, nice elbow as a fighting tactic,

381
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.370
it just cuts out all the striking cuts out all the danger and then oops,

382
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.980
Mon completely controls what's happening.

383
00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.773
Wow.

384
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.710
I was really interested in seeing Gilbert burns versus Comoro too.

385
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.420
Cause they train together. They know each other's.

386
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:00.983
Wow.

387
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:09.810
<v 4>This round is going to be tremendous guys. I bet this is going to be tremendous.</v>

388
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.490
<v 3>What do you tell MOSFET? All right. Now you got to win by knockout.</v>

389
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.353
You gotta knock them out.

390
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:21.270
<v 1>You got to find a way to knock them out. Do not let him touch.</v>

391
00:29:21.271 --> 00:29:25.230
You do not let him grab a hold of you. And if he grabs a hold of you,

392
00:29:25.231 --> 00:29:28.080
you gotta fight for your life. You only have five minutes.

393
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.780
Just give everything you got for that five minutes,

394
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.290
but do not let him grab you. Do not let him press you up against cage.

395
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.420
Don't resign yourself to that position either.

396
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.283
There we go.

397
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.820
<v 3>All right. Round five.</v>

398
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.620
<v 1>It's just that clinch is so hard for Uzman to be denied.</v>

399
00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.310
You know, he's just so good at getting it. And then what do you do?

400
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.593
You can't get them off.

401
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.970
<v 3>He's had mustard all on the cage. Like, uh,</v>

402
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.840
like Khabib keeps people on the ground. Okay. Yeah.

403
00:30:33.841 --> 00:30:35.970
But there's a big difference. She knows two things, right?

404
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.060
<v 1>It's not as good. It's not as good as getting a guy to the ground.</v>

405
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.630
Getting the liquid Khabib does is the most dominant. Yeah,

406
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.380
but it's still it's like that was Randy.

407
00:30:46.381 --> 00:30:50.040
Couture's move to get guys up against the cage and beat him up against the cage.

408
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:54.660
They couldn't do. Where are you out? Ah, there it is.

409
00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:56.363
Okay.

410
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.080
[inaudible] on top here. Relentless pressure,

411
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.080
man. There's just no,

412
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.880
there's no substitute for that elite wrestler

413
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.330
grappling ability. Those elite wrestlers.

414
00:31:30.331 --> 00:31:33.690
When you get to that national champion world champion level of grappling,

415
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.300
those guys like Daniel Cormier.

416
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.050
Comoro like so many of these like top flight wrestlers.

417
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.220
They get ahold of and it's like, that's just a,

418
00:31:44.221 --> 00:31:45.360
such a big advantage.

419
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.230
This is not good for Mazda at all.

420
00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.480
And that's to go stuck underneath here,

421
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.730
neon his neck right now. I just got his knee. Yeah.

422
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.370
Tomorrow does it looks like I get that.

423
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.400
Yeah, it does. It looks like he's that's his, his left knee. That's interesting.

424
00:32:17.401 --> 00:32:20.070
Right? That's the police move.

425
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:32.010
See how he's using his toes. You're not allowed to use your toes in the cages.

426
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:32.933
It's so crazy.

427
00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.810
Well, that's what I was gotta get out of there, man.

428
00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.760
He's got to figure out a way to get out of there.

429
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.720
If he's underneath this for the remainder of the fight,

430
00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:53.290
he is not going to win this fight. No chance,

431
00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.750
but if he can get up and get out of here, anything can happen.

432
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:06.340
1 55. Oh,

433
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:10.810
sliding in the Mount. Uh here's the roll. Come on,

434
00:33:10.811 --> 00:33:13.540
stand up, get a foot under.

435
00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.550
It's going to be a lot of energy to try to get up from here, man.

436
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:23.620
It was the ones keeping that weight on him. Got that front headlock

437
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.020
and then way he man handles people. Man, me, he manhandled Tyron Woodley,

438
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:36.640
which is crazy.

439
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:45.040
What is he doing here? It looks. Is he going for an Anaconda choke?

440
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.540
It's hard to tell here. He might be going for an Anaconda choke. Uh,

441
00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.930
I don't think so. Look at his right arm. He could see it.

442
00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:06.010
<v 3>With one knee down. He can only loose man can only meet him in the body.</v>

443
00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.170
<v 1>Right? Or the legs.</v>

444
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:15.850
Oh, he's up? He's up? Come on 40 seconds. See some, what can you do?

445
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.350
He's so tired, man.

446
00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.650
I mean he might not even physically be able to get him away from him at this

447
00:34:20.651 --> 00:34:23.050
point. That's why this is so interesting.

448
00:34:23.051 --> 00:34:26.680
I know people don't like these positions, but God. It's crazy.

449
00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:28.330
Here we go.

450
00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.480
<v 3>30 Seconds left. They're both on their feet. Oh.</v>

451
00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:44.493
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

452
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:50.620
<v 1>10 Seconds.</v>

453
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:13.600
Well the winter instill. Yeah, for sure. Right?

454
00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:14.590
Absolutely.

455
00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:24.070
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>
