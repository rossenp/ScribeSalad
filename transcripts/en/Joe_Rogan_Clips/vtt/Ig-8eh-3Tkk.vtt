00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.440
<v 2>My balls was hot. One was the famous one. I don't.</v>

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.400
<v 0>Remember that one. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.340
<v 1>So how's things.</v>

5
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.280
<v 0>Man. Things been crazy. You've been really, I can.</v>

6
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.080
<v 1>Only imagine. Yeah. After that knockout of Curtis blades, like, uh, whew.</v>

7
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.480
I mean, that, that got a lot of attention.

8
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.390
<v 0>Oh yeah. Yeah. And it felt real good.</v>

9
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.630
Good to knock him out because he was talking a lot of trash before the fight.

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.550
<v 1>Isn't that like par for the course though, everybody talks before the fight.</v>

11
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.950
<v 0>Um, even whenever I'm doing good though,</v>

12
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.670
he been talking at least three years now he been talking mess to me. Really?

13
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.693
Yeah.

14
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.350
<v 1>Do you take that personally?</v>

15
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.740
<v 0>Um, I, I do because I'm not in there trying to sell tickets.</v>

16
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.420
Don't just come to me, try to sell tickets to talk trash. You know,

17
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.540
I take everything personal.

18
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.620
<v 1>Yeah. Some guys do just try to sell tickets and then they they'll say it's not</v>

19
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.580
personal. It's just like, when KIB mcg ran off was up Connor.

20
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.620
When he was on top of him, pounding on him, going,

21
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.450
let's talk now let's talk now. Remember that? Yeah. Yeah. And he goes,

22
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:05.730
it's just business. You know, it's like, this is not business. No.

23
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.650
<v 0>No. I go in into every fight, like life or death. And I go in,</v>

24
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.490
I enter a deep dark place every time I step inside the octagon.

25
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.650
So it's not business for.

26
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.890
<v 1>Me. What was interesting is after the fight, I mean,</v>

27
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.770
there was just such a spectacular knockout,

28
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:22.880
but after the fight you were so nonchalant,

29
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.520
you were just so relaxed and you like,

30
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.200
I couldn't get started in there and everybody's like,

31
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.160
what the are you talking about? You couldn't get started. You just,

32
00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:33.080
it was one of the most spectacular knockouts in the history of the heavyweight

33
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.240
division. And you're like, ah, I couldn't get started.

34
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.320
<v 0>Yeah. Um, so I went back home and got my blood and everything tested.</v>

35
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.870
And my T levels was like in the 300 S so I had

36
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.390
very low T so it's like, you mean testosterone?

37
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.550
<v 1>Yes. You mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; have low testosterone. Yes. That's ridiculous.</v>

38
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.310
Yeah. I would never, if you had, if I was gonna make a bet &lt;laugh&gt;.

39
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.270
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; it's so like, I try to spend all my energy on my wife.</v>

40
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.780
So it's the hard, cause if I don't have the energy for her,

41
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:09.340
then she'll think I'm out there messing around and stuff like that. So, so do.

42
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.740
<v 1>They know why your testosterone was low? Um, maybe overtrained or something?</v>

43
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.020
<v 0>No, I don't. We, we don't know yet,</v>

44
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.940
so I want to go to another doctor that the lady was just telling me about. Oh.

45
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.810
<v 1>Wow. Yeah. That's crazy. So that's why you lethargic. Yes.</v>

46
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.810
<v 0>It was, it was like that all week. So at first I was,</v>

47
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.210
I thought it was the jet lag or something like that, but,

48
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.890
and it ended up just me, my T levels.

49
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.410
<v 1>That was like one of the most, perfectly timed up cuts I've ever seen.</v>

50
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.543
It was perfect.

51
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.970
<v 0>Yeah. We practiced that for the last few months. So that was.</v>

52
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.800
<v 1>The game plan when he shoots to catch him in? Yes.</v>

53
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.040
<v 0>Either the knee or the upper cut. Um, we knew he was going to be there.</v>

54
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.120
We knew he was gonna try to play the game, try to stand up for a little bit,

55
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.920
then the way he shoots, he don't really shoot like, um,

56
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.080
a real wrestler he shoots like from the hip down and come in like that he

57
00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:03.440
doesn't bend a knee and try to come in. Mm.

58
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.960
<v 1>That's interesting. So he goes, he hinges, he goes forward. Yes.</v>

59
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.040
Why do you think he does that?

60
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.160
<v 0>Um, I don't know. I don't know. Cause usually the wrestlers,</v>

61
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.400
they drop a knee then shoots. Yeah.

62
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.790
&lt;affirmative&gt; but he just bend down and I'm guessing he was just trying to grab

63
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.670
my leg to pick it up or something like that. I don't know. So how.

64
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.430
<v 1>How did you get involved in fighting? What was your first experiences?</v>

65
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.670
<v 0>First experience was like, cause everyone knew I loved fighting in the streets,</v>

66
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.830
like every weekend at parties and stuff like that.

67
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.540
And so one of my friends that told me, um, about MMA and I was like,

68
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.740
I didn't really know anything about MMA at the time. And he, he took,

69
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.460
how long ago was it videos? It's like 10 years ago.

70
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.700
<v 1>Did you have any martial arts training at.</v>

71
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.620
<v 0>All? No, I don't. I, I still don't have any martial arts. Really?</v>

72
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.260
&lt;laugh&gt; that's.

73
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.060
<v 1>Ridiculous. Of course you do.</v>

74
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.380
<v 0>You're professional martial arts. I'm watching YouTube videos now.</v>

75
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.850
So I'm learning some stuff now. Really?

76
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.050
<v 1>Yeah. You're not, you're not around like really you learn from YouTube.</v>

77
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.490
<v 0>Videos. I learned, I learned from my coach as well,</v>

78
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.770
but I watch YouTube videos and stuff like that too.

79
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.610
<v 1>So 10 years ago you had no martial arts training at all? No.</v>

80
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.443
<v 0>Martial training.</v>

81
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.850
<v 1>And where did you first start training?</v>

82
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.640
<v 0>I started training at a gym called civil back MMA.</v>

83
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.640
<v 1>And so this was 10 years ago. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you just decided to learn?</v>

84
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.560
Were you thinking about being a professional? Were you just doing it for fun?

85
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.120
<v 0>Um, they say that back then, I thought like 500, 500 was pretty good money,</v>

86
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.080
you know? So they were saying that you could get paid, um, $500. Um,

87
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.400
just three rounds or three minutes. I said just three minutes.

88
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.430
I didn't think three minutes was a long time until I got in there. It's like.

89
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.270
Okay. &lt;laugh&gt; and so we just started training from there though,

90
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.910
and I fell in love with it. So to me it is almost like street fighting.

91
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.470
So it's like, yeah, I could do that.

92
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.071
<v 1>Well,</v>

93
00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:00.990
one of the things that's changed about you over the years is you're enduring

94
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.940
your endurance is it came up in a big way.

95
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.860
Like you can see in the Gabriel Gonzo fight,

96
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:07.420
you can see in a lot of your fights. Like you can,

97
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.740
you can put pressure on people now and,

98
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.980
and you have a lot of high volume with which in the beginning of your career,

99
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.300
I think you had a harder time with.

100
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.500
<v 0>Oh yeah. And so that's really what we focus on now at, um, main street boxing,</v>

101
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:24.930
gym, it's my, um, conditioning and my endurance and stuff like that.

102
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.490
Cause we feel like that's the only weakness, um, in my game right now. Yeah.

103
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.490
<v 1>But it is like, you're so big. I don't even know if it's a weakness.</v>

104
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.690
I think it's just part of being a giant person, you know? Yeah. Yeah.

105
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.450
But the Travis brown, fight's another example.

106
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.480
Like that was a crazy fast-paced fight, but you, you know,

107
00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:43.400
you overwhelmed him.

108
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.800
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Um, &lt;laugh&gt; I love that fight too. Before the,</v>

109
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.920
this, this past fight with cur, that was one of my favorite and

110
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.360
that that week going into Travis brown fight, I took some laxatives, um,

111
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:02.880
just try to help me cut some weight, but you know,

112
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.960
I took it that Wednesday and you was still lingering around. So it's like, man,

113
00:06:06.961 --> 00:06:09.400
he kicked me in my body, but he also broke my rails,

114
00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:14.000
but I also did have to take a that day &lt;laugh&gt; so I wasn't lying about that.

115
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.000
So yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; that was.

116
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.990
<v 1>A ridiculous interview though. Yeah, that fight was, uh,</v>

117
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.550
that was, that was a heavy duty fight. It was a lot of bad blood in that.

118
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.950
<v 0>Fight too, right? Yes. And ever since then, like whenever I do my, um,</v>

119
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.790
you know how they come in few days before the commentaries try to talk to you

120
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.550
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and ever since then I stopped telling the,

121
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.700
the guys was my game plan and stuff like that.

122
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.300
Cause I didn't know him and Brian staying at the time was friends. And so,

123
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.980
oh, our game plan was to come in and try to, um,

124
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.940
to kick his legs because he used to stand real wide mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but

125
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.380
whenever me and him fought, he didn't stand like that at all. Like not one time.

126
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.210
<v 1>So you think Brian, Stan went.</v>

127
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.970
<v 0>To him and told him I believe so. I believe so. Oh, Brian. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

128
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.610
&lt;laugh&gt; that's kind of dirty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So.

129
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.130
<v 1>And he didn't tell you his strategy.</v>

130
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.650
<v 0>No, he didn't. Brian's.</v>

131
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.530
So &lt;laugh&gt; I'm just believe that's that was the case catch.
