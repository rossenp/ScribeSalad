00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.840
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Do you ever do a demographic breakdown of who watched,</v>

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.361
like,

3
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:10.960
does Netflix have a demo demographic breakdown of who watches those crime shows?

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.880
Because it's mostly women, isn't it? Anecdotally, that's what everybody says.

5
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.040
There was a funny bit on Saturday night live the other night that was like,

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.390
you know, what do ladies do in their home alone? You know, wait, wait, wait.

7
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.510
You know, then they like throw on the murder shows. Yeah. Why is that?

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.630
I don't know. It's a weird thing. And when we were making night stalker,

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.590
there would like, we would get to the,

10
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.350
the point in the interview where it's finally, you know, I would,

11
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.830
I would ask everybody like, okay, so for some reason or another,

12
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:39.630
this guy becomes like the Jim Morrison of serial killers.

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.500
Because like when he's paraded through the courtroom,

14
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.620
all of a sudden he's got these like groupies and fans and they're sending him.

15
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:52.020
And I had gotten access to all of the like naked pictures that the girls are

16
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:54.860
sending in, you know, cuz this author had written a book about him,

17
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.300
had all this stuff and I was like,

18
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.380
and you always have to kind of ask that awkward question of like,

19
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.730
so why does this guy become sort of crazy sex symbol object of Des you

20
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.370
know, obscure object of desire.

21
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.130
And it's always like kind of an particularly with the, you know, the,

22
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.890
the women who are being interviewed, but everybody and nobody quite has an an,

23
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.570
is it the bad boy thing? Is it the celebrity thing?

24
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.440
But this is somebody that like, you know, I think is one of the P people said,

25
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:24.760
this is somebody that would eat you for dinner. Not like, you know,

26
00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:29.360
there's no it's craziness to have any attraction to it, but yet it exists.

27
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.960
You know, this guy has like groupies and fans and.

28
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.200
<v 1>It's very common for murderers to get,</v>

29
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.200
especially murderers of women to get all these propositions from

30
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:43.150
women. Yeah. It's very strange, super strange. And you know,

31
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.310
I read something about that. No,

32
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:48.990
you know who Whitney Cumings was actually telling me about this? She said she,

33
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.150
she read that it was something that had to do with, there was like, uh,

34
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.550
an evolutionary benefit to getting close to killers like that.

35
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.950
I think this is theoretical in what regard that the idea of it,

36
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.180
it's very hard to kill someone.

37
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.380
<v 0>Once you have like human personal contact. Is that what you're saying? No.</v>

38
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.620
<v 1>No, no, no. The, the,</v>

39
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.020
the act of killing someone that it's difficult to do,

40
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.340
that it requires like someone who is

41
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.810
to be capable of taking another person's life and to be close to

42
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:27.890
that person means somehow or another you're protected by them.

43
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.410
And that they're, they're willing to kill.

44
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.850
And that this is like something that existed thousands and

45
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.490
thousands of years ago in our DNA,

46
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.210
this desire to be close to killers because you were more likely to survive.

47
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.480
Cuz there were so many killers. Like if you went back in time, you know,

48
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.520
a few thousand years ago, murder must have been like really common.

49
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.520
Like when, when people were sword fighting all the time and dude, there's.

50
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.880
<v 0>A crazy, there's a crazy book on this.</v>

51
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.200
Steven Pinker wrote this book called the better angels of our nature.

52
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.160
And what he does is he tracks over time kind of the nature of violence

53
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.040
in humanity. Yes. And he's like, okay,

54
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.000
once upon a time there's Kane and able and Kane kills able like the murder rate

55
00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:15.480
is like 50%. So actually we've been trending up ever since then. And like,

56
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.880
it literally looks at how, you know,

57
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.390
over the incidence of like violence has actually,

58
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:24.670
even though it doesn't seem like that dramatically decreased.

59
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.110
<v 1>In, it does seem like that. It does seem like that.</v>

60
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.470
I think we just focus on the instances of violence because we have mass media.

61
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.430
Right. And.

62
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.140
<v 0>Because, and it's fascinating.</v>

63
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.270
<v 1>Yeah. And if it bleeds, it leads so.</v>

64
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.900
<v 0>There's but, but why is that, you know, like that's something that, you know,</v>

65
00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:44.460
making the night stalker or even making silk road, it's like,

66
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.140
why are we fascinated by the underworld? You know,

67
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.460
the sort of like the worst things that people do to each other, like what is it?

68
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.740
You know, and, and I'm, you're participating in it.
