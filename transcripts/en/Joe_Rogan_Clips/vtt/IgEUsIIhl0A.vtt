I did Wendy Williams on Monday.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.460
And then I flew back and went to Vegas for a day, as soon as I got back.

15
00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:50.180
And then I had three auditions. So I was run down. And that weekend.

16
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.660
Were you.

17
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.540

<v 2>Tired. No, just tired. Tired, but I mean, we're always tired really? You know,</v>

19
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.380

21
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.130
<v 2>You. Yeah. And, and I was, I was moving all the time and very stressful,</v>

22
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.210
you know, you're, you're trying to perform,

23
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.250
you're trying to learn lines for an audition. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so I was,

24
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.210
I was very stressed out.

25
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.330
I was traveling a lot and that was like my third weekend in a row. So it was,

26
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:13.770
you didn't.

27
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.650
<v 1>Sleep much sleep.</v>

28
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.770
<v 2>Or not? Yeah. I, I get great sleep, but you know, with two kids,</v>

29
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.970
like they're both at the age where, you know, you have to have both eyes on 'em.

30
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.200
<v 1>Do you ever, um, wear a sleep monitoring device or anything that.</v>

31
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.160
<v 2>I have, but I like a whooprap no, I I've never worn that,</v>

32
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.960
but I get eight to nine hours of sleep every night. Like I'm a great sleeper.

33
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.280
Okay. Like I sleep through anything. So it wasn't a sleep day. I was just,

34
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.750
I was just tired overworked maybe, but Satur that's Saturday.

35
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.190
I didn't feel right. My temperature went up to like 1 0 1.

36
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.870
<v 1>This is, you flew to New York. What day?</v>

37
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.710
<v 2>Uh, it was, I performed, I was there Wednesday,</v>

38
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.790
which would've been I'm guessing at dates. May 4th. I mean, yeah. March 4th,

39
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.633
March 4th,

40
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.540
I performed the sixth and seventh stayed the eighth.

41
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.220
Did Wendy Williams on the ninth. Flew back on that Monday.

42
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.300
Went to Vegas, Tuesday morning. Came back that same day then.

43
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.060
<v 1>What'd you do in Vegas besides heroin?</v>

44
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.300
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; I, we were, you know, we visiting her parents,</v>

45
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.770
my wife's parents with the kids and then, but was no party in no party.

46
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.290
It was drive in and drive out. Okay. But that's exhausting.

47
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.170
That's that's exhausting. That's 10 hours on the road. Yeah.

48
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.970
And then dealing with two kids in a car and then the three auditions.

49
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:35.490
And then that Saturday, I didn't feel right. And this is,

50
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.410
you gotta remember when I performed in New York,

51
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.170
there's only 11 deaths and it was like 3000 cases. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

52
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.080
that's how much, this thing has changed. But Saturday I didn't feel right.

53
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.960
1 0 1, it went, I said, I should isolate myself because I in New York,

54
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:55.400
that's all you heard about. So I was like, let me just be safe and isolate.

55
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.520
<v 1>Myself. So let's, let's break this down. Mm. So you leave Wednesday,</v>

56
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.520
you go to New York. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you do a couple of different TV things.

57
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.950
Yep.

58
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.440
Then you do the weekend at Gotham mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then you fly home

59
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.280
and then you go to Vegas on Tuesday and then you drive home on Wednesday,

60
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.920
drive back Tuesday, night, Tuesday. Oh Jesus. Yeah. So in and out in one day.

61
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.990
<v 2>In and out in one day, and then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, then Saturday,</v>

62
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.190
I was like, okay. I, this is my rest day.

63
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.310
And then I woke up and something just didn't feel right. Mm. So I was going,

64
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.230
okay, it's probably the road, you know what? I I'm stressed road.

65
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.230
So it's about during the day I hang out, I isolate myself,

66
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:38.510
but I'm between one hundred and one oh one second day.

67
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.780
I'm a like 1 0 1, 1 0 2, but I'm still like, look, I'm,

68
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.580
I'm gonna beat this thing. They say, stay at home.

69
00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:47.180
Because at that time mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they said, if you have symptoms,

70
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.660
stay at home because they're taking the more serious cases. Right.

71
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.780
So the Sunday, Sunday came around.

72
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.180
I kind of went down a little, I was taking aspirin,

73
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.210
a lot of aspirin because one doc at the time said, take it every four hours.

74
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.210
And I was also taking, um,

75
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.570
aspirin and something else to bring your temperature down. I forgot what it was,

76
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.570
but oh, ti um, aspirin. And, well, you said.

77
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.490
<v 1>When you started taking ibuprofen, that's when it you up. That's.</v>

78
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.040
<v 2>When I felt it did. So Sunday I started to in this massive headache.</v>

79
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.320
So that's when I really started popping the aspirin three, every three hours,

80
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.520
but aspirin.

81
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.353
<v 1>Or ibuprofen.</v>

82
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.920
<v 2>Uh, it was ibuprofen.</v>

83
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.120
<v 1>That's a big difference between aspirin and ibuprofen.</v>

84
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.880
Ibuprofen is a non-torsteroidal antiinflammatory.

85
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.480
<v 2>Okay. Well, okay. I was taking, I was taking Advil.</v>

86
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.480
<v 1>Whatever Avil yes, that is a non-steroidal. Anti-inflammatory okay.</v>

87
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.950
This is what I keep hearing.

88
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:45.670
And I don't know if this has been substantiated that you shouldn't take, um,

89
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.070
ibuprofen while you have this. Okay. Well, for whatever reason,

90
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.190
I don't know what that is.

91
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.590
<v 2>I don't know. I don't know if that's been discredited or is that,</v>

92
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.750
is that real either? I don't know either. So I, I was taking a lot of Advil.

93
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.900
Okay. Lot of Advil in, uh, Tylenol, bring the fever down.

94
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.220
So I got it down on Sunday, but then I had a massive headache.

95
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.500
So then they said, well, your temperature's going down.

96
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.940
This was our doctor friend, your temperature's going down, just hit the Advil.

97
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.420
So I hit the Advil Monday at noon.

98
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.300
I couldn't breathe like gasping for air.

99
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.010
And my wife had to call 9 1, 1 to the house to get me.

100
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.330
So I'm gasping for air nine. One one shows up. They bring me outside.

101
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:31.010
They throw me on this huge, this oxygen machine right away. They like,

102
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.490
you know what kind of an, a ventilator? Uh, not a ventilator. No, just a,

103
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.210
just a normal oxygen machine. But they say we gotta get oxygen in you. Okay.

104
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.930
And it, it is almost like a movie. I'm the neighbor,

105
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.320
all out ambulance is overlooking me. You know, the ambulance is there.

106
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.480
All the neighbors are looking. I can't breathe. My son is in the window.

107
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.320
This is the worst. My son is in the window. He doesn't know what's going on,

108
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:55.960
but he knows it's not good. And he's only three and he's crying. Oh. Uh,

109
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.560
and I'm watching him cry and I can't do anything. I can't breathe.

110
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.800
And literally when they picked me up to carry me to the ambulance,

111
00:06:04.801 --> 00:06:06.400
cuz they need to get me to the hospital right away.

112
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.400
It was the whole window thing. He put his hand up. Oh, oh Jesus. It, it, it,

113
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.120
it really hurt me really bad.

114
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.190
So I get into the ambulance and they take me it's soon as I get to

115
00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:20.110
the hospital, the doctor goes, you got Corona.

116
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.350
So they take how, but did they do a test or did you just, yes.

117
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:28.550
The first thing they do is they do a chest x-ray mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they

118
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:31.070
go, you got double pneumonia and Corona.

119
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.230
What's double pneumonia when it's on in both lungs. Okay. So double pneumonia.

120
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.060
And you have Corona, we believe, but we got in test. So they, you know,

121
00:06:39.061 --> 00:06:41.700
swabbed me and stuff. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but they took all the precautions.

122
00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:44.700
Like I had Corona, I was the first Corona patient at this hospital.

123
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.340
This is how early it was, you know? So, um,

124
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.660
they took me to ICU, uh, and the doctor came in and I go, Hey,

125
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.290
this is escalating real. And I'm still can't breathe. I go, I gonna make it.

126
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.130
And he goes, well, no, in two days it's gonna go really good or really bad.

127
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.570
And we'll know in two days and every nurse or doctor that came in,

128
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.210
when they can't tell you, if you're gonna make it or not, you know,

129
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.040
they try to comfort you, but they can't really say you're gonna make it. And

130
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.520
it, and I was in the worst pain I've ever felt in my life too. Like what,

131
00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:29.480
where had, I mean, just think about the worst migraine you've ever had.

132
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:33.640
Times a hundred, my body was hot and cold. It would get so hot.

133
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.480
My temperature got up to 103.8 and they had to bring

134
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.350
down and then it would go up to a hundred, 3.8 again, uh, I couldn't move.

135
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.910
My body was aching literally the second night I was there.

136
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.700
And I, and, and I know this is the wrong thing to think,

137
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.340
but if they had a eject button on life, I may have hit it.

138
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.740
I was in that much pain like that.

139
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.250
I couldn't even think clearly it, I,

140
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.770
I can't put into words how bad it was for me. So your head, your body,

141
00:08:04.771 --> 00:08:08.330
everything, everything, everything where you just want it to be over. Wow.

142
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.170
It's either you're gonna make it. You're like,

143
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.970
and it was so bad where you want to think about your family.

144
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.210
But I was in so much pain, you know, I thought about 'em, but it was,

145
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.840
I can't make it. This is, this is the end.

146
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.800
And I can't see my family because they already told me that no one can come into

147
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:31.600
the hospital and I'm texting my wife,

148
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.960
lying to her saying, Hey, babe, I'm gonna make it through.

149
00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:37.200
I'm gonna make it through where I'm talking to my parents going.

150
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.110
This may not go well. You know? And my parents,

151
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.150
the first thing I texted my parents is I'm scared. I've never texted.

152
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:50.190
'em something like that. And they knew how serious it was. And I, I said,

153
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.310
look, Claire's my wife, Claire is at home with the two kids.

154
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:57.480
I can't let her worry about this. You know, she was already stressed out enough.

155
00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.280
She saw enough, you know,

156
00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.440
so I'm in there and the doctor says that no one can come see you. So I'm going,

157
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.360
if these are the last two days of my life, I'm gonna die alone in this hospital.

158
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.710
And, and it just broke me up so bad that &lt;affirmative&gt;,

159
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.790
you know, I've taken care of myself, I've done everything I can, you know,

160
00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:22.310
to take care of myself. And why am I lying in this bed right now? You know?

161
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.430
And it was a thing where,

162
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.540
when I did think about my wife, it was,

163
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.570
I will never see my wife and two kids again. You know,

164
00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:35.920
that that's all that went through. My mind is like, I, it.

165
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.360
<v 1>Did they put you on a ventilator?</v>

166
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.520
<v 2>No, my doctor saved my life. My doctor said, if we put you on a ventilator,</v>

167
00:09:42.521 --> 00:09:44.960
he said that he says, cuz a nurse brought it up.

168
00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:47.360
Should we put him on a ventilator? And he goes, no way.

169
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.000
If we put him on a ventilator, he's gonna die because his body is gonna say,

170
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.280
okay, this machine is breathing for us. We don't need to work anymore.

171
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.670
I and your body shuts down. If you heard in New York,

172
00:09:58.671 --> 00:10:01.230
80% of the people put on ventilators die.

173
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:02.990
<v 1>And that's why you.</v>

174
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.990
<v 2>Think, I think that's why I survived. I've.</v>

175
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.430
<v 1>Heard that. I've, I've heard that being speculated by other doctors as well.</v>

176
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:12.190
And it's very controversial because so many doctors put people on ventilators.

177
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.870
And the last thing they want to hear is another doctor saying,

178
00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:17.460
you've put someone on a ventilator. They would be eye, but you, well.

179
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.620
<v 2>My doctor said that straight up in the room in front of me to the nurses,</v>

180
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.380
like if we put him on it, he's gonna die. Because his thing was,

181
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.180
it just makes sense why he would,

182
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:31.140
because now this machine is gonna breathe for him. So his body's not gonna,

183
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.940
it's like working out, you don't work out on muscle. It gets weak. Right.

184
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.370
This machine is doing all your lifting. So will we wanna put 'em on that?

185
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.610
Unless it's, it's just, we have to put 'em on it. You know?

186
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.970
But you've heard doctors were putting on people so fast because their oxygen

187
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:51.730
levels were so low. Right? They're like this isn't, this is not normal.

188
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.530
So we need to do something to get their oxygen level up.

189
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.040
<v 1>I think doctors are like everything else. Right? There's really good ones.</v>

190
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.080
Then there's ones that aren't as good. No, it's true with everything else,

191
00:11:02.081 --> 00:11:05.480
with everything. Carpenters, plumbers, everything, every and everything.

192
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.480
<v 2>And it's really, I look back. I'm still, now I've become very close to him.</v>

193
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.600
And the dude saved my life. Cuz if I went on a ventilator, bro, I don't,

194
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.880
I may not be here because I when.

195
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.710
<v 1>Want a ventilator, they kind of knock you out. You.</v>

196
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.830
<v 2>Out. Yeah. Yeah. You're unconscious.</v>

197
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.030
Literally that machine is doing all your breathing.

198
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.830
<v 1>Whew. So what did they give you?</v>

199
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.270
What kind of medication did they give you while you were out? While, while you.

200
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.670
<v 2>Were down, I'm healthy. Don't drink. Don't do drugs.</v>

201
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.510
I was the perfect test subject. Maybe that's a problem.

202
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.060
<v 1>Your body's not used to fighting out know.</v>

203
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.140
&lt;laugh&gt; maybe if you gonna party all the time, your body's like,

204
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.540
we know how to recover. Right. This went.

205
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.140
<v 2>On a bender. Listen, it, this, I gave it to my mom. Oh no. I gave,</v>

206
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.480
so she gets home. She didn't tell me while I was in the hospital.

207
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.000
She beat it in one day and she talks to me now. Oh see,

208
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.040
I beat it in one day I have one fever.

209
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.360
&lt;laugh&gt; you take eight days in ICU, you know? And then she tells me,

210
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.080
let's cut you too healthy. You need carbs now &lt;laugh&gt;.

211
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.280
<v 1>You need carbs. That'silarious now she's.</v>

212
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.710
<v 2>A doctor. Now she's a doctor. But I gave it to, to my mom. She beat her one day,</v>

213
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:14.830
but well.

214
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.510
<v 1>She probably wasn't run down. No dude run down is the thing, man. You know,</v>

215
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.870
look, I'm a guy. I take a lot of vitamins. I work out a lot.

216
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.910
I get in the song every day, but I, I just flew back from Florida.

217
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.710
Like I saw you flew to Florida and came back yesterday. I felt like dog.

218
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.260
And just from the flight man, just from the and it's day. So, um,

219
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.820
I scheduled an IV vitamin drip. I had the vitamin drip people. Yeah.

220
00:12:38.821 --> 00:12:43.340
Come to my house, hit me with glutayone zinc, vitamin C everything.

221
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.620
And uh, I felt better almost immediately.

222
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.180
<v 2>Yeah. You gotta take care of yourself.</v>

223
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.860
I've heard from so many di after I went through this and big shout out to your

224
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:54.930
fan base because they reached out to me and show me so many love when I was in

225
00:12:54.931 --> 00:12:57.610
the hospital and I just got out and that means so much to me. That's awesome.

226
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:01.410
When they reached out and it was, it was really all love. Uh,

227
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:05.210
but so many doctors reached out to me too and said,

228
00:13:05.211 --> 00:13:07.090
there's so much misinformation out there.

229
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.210
And I texted you about one that people should know about.

230
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:13.410
When people get out of the hospital with Corona,

231
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.200
there's no magical time. They're saying 14 days.

232
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:21.480
Literally when I got out the hospital, I was in the hospital for eight days. Uh,

233
00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:24.360
the last three days I didn't have a fever. So they let me go.

234
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.760
They said seven days, six days after that, I would be fine.

235
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.760
But another doctor told me, look, after you're cleared. After 14 days,

236
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:34.950
people still have Corona.

237
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.590
They're they're taking the chance that it's not contagious.

238
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.910
And that's why hospitals don't test people.

239
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.630
And he said that this is why hospitals don't test people before they let 'em go

240
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.190
is because they know they still got Corona, but hopefully it's not contagious.

241
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:51.910
So that's why they never test.

242
00:13:51.911 --> 00:13:54.470
Because if they did that means people gotta stay there two to three weeks

243
00:13:54.471 --> 00:13:55.740
longer. Oh.

244
00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.460
And that's the real reason he says we would never te can you imagine when New

245
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.180
York was going through that, like really bad. I mean,

246
00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:05.260
they're still going through it, but when it was at its peak. Yeah.

247
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.300
If they tested everybody that left,

248
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.540
most of those people would still have Coronas.

249
00:14:09.541 --> 00:14:11.580
So that would back up the system even more. Mm.

250
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.690
And then insurance has to pay for an extra three weeks. So I learned that.

251
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.450
I learned that my other doctor said this whole, uh,

252
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.290
preexisting conditions is. He goes, you came in. He says,

253
00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:30.970
this is how much it is. You came in. If I would've died in the hospital,

254
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.530
they would've said my pre preexisting condition was migraines.

255
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.770
They would've gone down as he said, they, but there.

256
00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.730
<v 1>Are some preexisting conditions that week in your immune system, like obesity,</v>

257
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:43.800
diabetes.

258
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.330
There's a bunch of 'em that they're saying in New York are the primary factors

259
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.250
of the people that wind up having a really hard time with this.

260
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.040
<v 2>Well, he's saying though, they're using.</v>

261
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.760
<v 1>That preexisting conditions.</v>

262
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:58.480
And I say it in quotes to let healthy or other people

263
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:03.320
almost like, oh, well, if you don't have this preexisting, you're gonna be fine,

264
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:08.280
but it's not true. He's like, they're using it to calm people down. He goes,

265
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.190
it's not true at all. He says, I see people that are fine. Just like you might.

266
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.910
I see people that do have preexisting conditions. I, I see the whole gamut.

267
00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.550
It's not just people with preexisting conditions,

268
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.670
but they're finding those people and highlighting those. And he's even at,

269
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:27.310
they're even adding deaths to that preexisting conditions total because they,

270
00:15:27.311 --> 00:15:30.910
they need some, what you mean deaths to the preexisting? Forist like mine, it,

271
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.100
my preexisting condition. He said, if I were to die in that hospital, he says,

272
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.980
oh, well he had migraines in his past.

273
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.580
So they would've put that down as a preexisting condition. Well,

274
00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:41.700
how often do you get migraines?

275
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.620
<v 2>I mean, ever since I was a kid, but really well, I, you,</v>

276
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.180
I played college football, uh, for university of Arkansas. I,

277
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:55.490
I got so many concussions. I couldn't play anymore. So,

278
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.330
and this was before the whole concussion. Right? So my mom made me quit.

279
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.610
She was like, you're not playing anymore. So it, it was a thing where,

280
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.330
but it wasn't a condition. I have 'em once every, I have one every five,

281
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:11.810
six months maybe. But he says, would you come in with,

282
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.440
since I had migraines mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they didn't know my history of

283
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.600
migraines. Right. But he goes,

284
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.520
we would've had to say that was a preexisting condition.

285
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.320
<v 1>I haven't heard that preexisting condition being migraines, but I,</v>

286
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.640
I have heard diabetes is a giant factor.

287
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.960
Obesity is a giant factor and vema-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; people smoke cigarettes,

288
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.560
but then there was an article recently,

289
00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:33.790
something I got super suspici and I didn't even read the article.

290
00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.830
It was an article that said that, uh, nicotine may help people with coronavirus.

291
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.790
And I was like, that's the cigarette industry. Right?
