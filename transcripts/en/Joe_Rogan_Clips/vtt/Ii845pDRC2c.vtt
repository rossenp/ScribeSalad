00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Let's talk about endurance.</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.500
So there are different aspects to endurance.

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.443
And

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.940
so there's cardio and there is the low,

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.640
the peripheral endurance in the muscles, muscular endurance.

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.630
So first let's discuss, how do we develop cardio?

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.050
Let's discuss how we develop endurance in the muscle.

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.780
The best,

9
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.610
the healthiest way to develop your cardio is just

10
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:35.540
steady state exercise like running at a particular,

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.800
particular speed does not do fast as very simple way to develop cardio

12
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.400
for most people. It is for most people. It is. And so here's, what's happening.

13
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.260
What's happening is, um,

14
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.030
the hardest stretching when you increase your heart rate up to a certain point,

15
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.230
the heart starts stretching more and it stretches more and more.

16
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.730
So that increases the stroke volume.

17
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.580
So pretty much you've got a bigger heart and as good,

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.240
that works opt to

19
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.960
not quite 90% of heart rate.

20
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.200
When you start a red lining your heart rate,

21
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.570
when you start getting to 90% and higher,

22
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.480
the heart does not have time to relax fully.

23
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.610
So it really pretty much is twitching.

24
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.450
So you're no longer really stretching that heart.

25
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.910
So you want to be training at the metabolic

26
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:29.220
intensity. That's much lower something.

27
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.750
We can pretty much sustain a conversation.

28
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.970
So let's say you're running and talking to your buddy.

29
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.290
That's what you want to stay to the develop endurance that will to develop,

30
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.070
to stress your heart. That's the basic method. So that's one method.

31
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.190
So the second method is interval training. So,

32
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:49.080
and the interval training for the heart was developed by Germans

33
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:53.250
decades ago. And these guidelines still stand. So here's what they figured out.

34
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.790
They figured out that your well,

35
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.620
we know that this various systems in your body have inertia. So for instance,

36
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:07.170
notice that when you're running hard and you stopped,

37
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.180
your heart's still beating hard.

38
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.850
And then maybe after 10 seconds after there's a sudden drop right in there, sir,

39
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:14.790
is that inertia.

40
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.100
So the Germans figured out if you get your heart rate up to about 85, 90%,

41
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.850
which is it's hard, but it's still not maximum.

42
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.150
And then you switched to walking or jogging.

43
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.590
So the heart is still beating and there is this extra volume, uh,

44
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.340
of blood is moving in a stretches to heart. So it works really well.

45
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.040
So you can use the intro method as well, but it's,

46
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.600
it was found it's used best after, um,

47
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.930
after a period of steady state training,

48
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.400
it's very demanding on the body and it's not, it's just,

49
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.490
it's too easy to have problems with the heart.

50
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.930
If you started using it prematurely,

51
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.250
then there's also such a thing as high heart rate

52
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.790
under heavy loads. So in this particular case,

53
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:11.500
we're talking about dynamic exercises. So as dynamic exercise, running, uh,

54
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.700
bicycling, skiing, even light kettlebell swings,

55
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.150
that's dynamic exercise. When you start doing static exercise,

56
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:22.870
let's say you're trying to do squats, heavy squats for, you know,

57
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.340
to get your cardio. So to say,

58
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.770
that's not the best idea because that interferes

59
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:34.180
with the blood flow, that, that something called afterload versus preload,

60
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.570
the heart gets thicker instead of the heart gets, you know,

61
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.780
gets stretched and bigger. So it's not the optimal way to train the heart.

62
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.390
You can, again,

63
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.330
the simple way you can use a dynamic

64
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:52.510
exercise in interval type training or repeat training.

65
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:57.460
In this case to train your heart is to do an exercise that's dynamic

66
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.690
in nature to raise your heart rate to about,

67
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.360
let's say, 80, 90%, which would be 80,

68
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:10.720
90%. It would be where you can say maybe a couple of words, you know,

69
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.060
you're not, you're not dying yet.

70
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.520
You can still answer a question and then you just walk around and you do it

71
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:21.430
again. So that's a simple way of how much time walking.

72
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.450
<v 1>Around. That.</v>

73
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.640
<v 0>Depends that toll. It depends on who you are.</v>

74
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.290
<v 1>How fast your heart rate drops back down. And what do you want to like,</v>

75
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.720
is there a number, do you want to keep it in the one forties,

76
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:33.680
the one fifties is dependent upon your age?

77
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.940
<v 0>Yeah. In this particular case, you would do, you would drop it down.</v>

78
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:40.390
The regional guidelines were done for young people. Those 120, 130 beats,

79
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.890
or you're talking about 60, 65%. And pretty much,

80
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.500
if you were just looking at being able to pass the talk test,

81
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.370
which means you can talk, you know, uh, short sentences,

82
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.660
I can speak in short, something like that. Right? So for example,

83
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:56.800
you do a set of 10 swings,

84
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:00.190
really powerful with a kettlebell walk around a little bit.

85
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.890
When you feel that you can speak again, you do it again, do it again.

86
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.690
So that's a simple way of doing that,

87
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.400
but the heart is only a very small part of endurance.

88
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.680
So we definitely need to do some cardio for health and athletes definitely

89
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.740
need to do for their performance. But, um,

90
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.910
what we're really need to focus on is you need mitochondria.

91
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.570
So mitochondria in the, in the muscle cell.

92
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.440
So that's where energy is being converted to aerobically,

93
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.610
which means efficiently.

94
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.190
So if you look at the way you muscle

95
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:40.450
uses energy, so he will get this energy with food converted,

96
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.250
it goes down eventually the final, uh, currency,

97
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:49.630
so to say is so something called ATP, but it's only used, you know,

98
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:53.350
you only have it for a few seconds. So it has to be re reloaded.

99
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.190
So we have three main energy systems. So have the, uh,

100
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.900
creatine phosphate system. It's very powerful,

101
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.920
but it's only going to go for just some seconds. And as clean burning,

102
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.360
we have aerobic system. That's not powerful at all, but it's longer lasting.

103
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.460
And we have the glycolytic system that's kind of in between that dumps a lot of

104
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.740
acid and other fatigued metabolites in there.

105
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.200
So what we want to do as we want to develop these

106
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:25.670
mitochondria in our muscles, it's easy to do a slow fibers,

107
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.480
and it's a little more involved in fast fibers.

108
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.950
I'll tell you how we can do that, but it can be done. So what we're looking for,

109
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.720
instead of trying to trash the muscle with acid,

110
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.290
we're trying to train in a way that to produce less

111
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.183
acid.

112
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.780
And then only before the competition read before the competition,

113
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:52.880
couple of weeks out, you do a couple of,

114
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:56.600
kind of a smokers like that to get yourself used to that. That's saying,

115
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.050
so the way we develop mitochondria,

116
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.660
which means make your muscle oxidative,

117
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.760
make your muscle enduring and not polluting in slow fibers.

118
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:11.570
It's simply moving a ride below in Arabic threshold.

119
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.180
So on aerobic threshold,

120
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.130
it's that intensity at which you,

121
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.540
you know, acid is accumulating just up to a certain point.

122
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.870
It stays at that steady state.

123
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:27.710
Then you can keep disposing of that for a while for quite a while.

124
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.210
As soon as you go above it, very rapidly, you crash.

125
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.673
So

126
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.580
running ride below that aerobic threshold is

127
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.060
the primary training method for endurance athletes.

128
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.800
And how do you know that you ran the threshold when you failing the talk test?

129
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.240
That's a simple way to do that.

130
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.840
And it's very interesting that endurance athletes,

131
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.090
even though who are not necessarily well-educated,

132
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.230
they can attend to grab it, taste her that intensity.

133
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.700
And so what happens is we are producing just small amounts of acid

134
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.200
and the body finally is able to produce less and less.

135
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.950
So that's how we train our aerobic. Um, I'm sorry.

136
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.810
That's how we train mitochondria in slow fibers for a fast fibers.

137
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:19.430
It becomes something more interesting.

138
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.260
So the conditions,

139
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.170
the conditions for making the mitochondria, uh,

140
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.970
be able to handle more traffic without producing as much acid

141
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.260
is pushed them just to the edge of a sudden dosas Jess,

142
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.220
just to the edge and dude over and over and over. So

143
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.720
[inaudible], uh,  back in the eighties for God

144
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.720
 that that's the guy who invented plyometrics and so on. So he figured out, so here's what we do. Imagine that you are sprinting 

145
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.720
less

146
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.720
, you sprinting for five, seven seconds, and then you were just walking and you're sprinting again, and you're just walking, but you're doing that. You measuring your blood

147
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.720
, uh,

148
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.720
 Lactaid, and it still keeps below the threshold. And you sustain that for, let's say 40 minutes. So think of this for a second. So you're sprinting very intensely, but you do you 

149
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.720
stop

150
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.720
 before you start burning, you get to the point of just light, muscular fatigue and you 

151
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.553
dude, over and over and over.

152
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.170
So if we talk about the coaching terminology,

153
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.970
it's a repeat training versus interval training.

154
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.240
So what is interval training? Barbie Joel have to take a step to the side.

155
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.100
So the three types of rest periods between your sets, whether you're running,

156
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:52.770
lifting, whatever. So there's a stress period.

157
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.440
That means that you will have a harder time to do the same

158
00:09:58.441 --> 00:10:02.460
thing, or you will not be able to repeat it, right? That's interval training.

159
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.330
There is the super compensation period,

160
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.050
which means if you wait extra long time, you'll perform even better.

161
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.910
By for example, if you do a sat of pull-ups wait for 15 minutes,

162
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:16.680
you might be able to do more 15 minutes later.

163
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.630
And there is the ordinary period, which is, does,

164
00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:24.810
you'll be able to repeat it over and over. So that's in coaching speakers,

165
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.360
skull, repeat training, repeat versus interval.

166
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.950
So we're trying to sustain that same level of performance for 40 minutes,

167
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:32.933
let's say.

168
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.040
So that's an example of how we develop mitochondria fast-twitch

169
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:41.370
fibers and the same thing we can do with kettlebell swings, the same thing.

170
00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:44.640
You can do a work in Abbey bag and so on and so forth.
