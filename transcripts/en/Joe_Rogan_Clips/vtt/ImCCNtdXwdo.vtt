1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Work that I've done in the past,</v>

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.170
particularly with the urban explorers that got me into a lot of trouble. I mean,

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:10.110
I got arrested. Um, my,

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.320
all of the people that I worked with ended up getting arrested because the

5
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:18.150
police got my notes. And, uh, I mean, it was, uh, it was a terrible,

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.590
terrible situation. Well, I, so we, I was,

7
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:26.370
I was going out with these urban explorers into all of this subterranean

8
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:31.020
infrastructure underneath London. And after we went into those sewer systems,

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.770
then we got into electricity tunnels. Then we started getting into bunkers.

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.530
So these are all illegal. These are like layers under the city.

11
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:41.160
So imagine there's like, you know, five layers under the city, right?

12
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:44.760
So we go from those sewers to the electricity, to total us, to the, uh,

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.890
infrastructural systems, to the bunkers.

14
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.730
And then we started getting into what are called deep level systems. Right.

15
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:53.970
And they're, they're, they're very similar to, uh,

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.170
the bunkers that the U S government is building here that they called,

17
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.930
they called doms deep underground military bases. Right.

18
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.230
We started getting into like serious critical infrastructure,

19
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.100
like at some point, how easy was it to get into those?

20
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.930
It took us years. It took us years. There's quite a lot of research,

21
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.590
but I mean, at some point we got into, uh, what are called the,

22
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.580
the BT deep level tunnels, British telecommunications, deep level tunnels.

23
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:24.900
And we were like inside the telecommunications trunk for all of the

24
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.810
United Kingdom, you know, um,

25
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.520
and at this point we're like, you know, a hundred feet underground,

26
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.420
120 feet underground. We were actually, we were walking through,

27
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.550
uh, this tunnel about, you know, about a hundred feet underground.

28
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:44.010
And one of the explorers I was with is like, there's a,

29
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.560
there's a manhole above us. It was like, what do you, what do you mean?

30
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:48.570
There's a manhole above us, you know, we're like,

31
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.330
we're in the deepest level right now. Um,

32
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.470
and we popped this manhole and a camera swivels, you know,

33
00:01:55.471 --> 00:02:00.150
and stares at us like, oh God. And then we realized we were into some,

34
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:04.440
some critical. So it was just,

35
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.810
it was just telecommunication hubs. Right.

36
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:09.280
It's just like the trunk of all of the, the, the,

37
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.620
the infrastructure for fiber optics and phone lines. And they.

38
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.100
<v 1>Just have unexposed manhole cover and a tunnel that you can get to. Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.340
And we.

40
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.800
<v 0>Wiggled through, like, we wiggled from tunnel to tunnel,</v>

41
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:20.360
like through tiny crevices.

42
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:23.480
We were getting into like the deep underbelly of the city. I mean, it was not,

43
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.280
it was not easy to get to, but,

44
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.360
but here's the thing at the same time we had been cracking all of the,

45
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.380
the abandoned tube stations, Metro stations in London. Right.

46
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.670
So we took a,

47
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.170
we took a map of the tube from 1932 and we set a

48
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:42.440
map from, uh, 2008 on top of it.

49
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.730
And what you see are a bunch of stations that are no longer on the map, right.

50
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:50.090
That's your first clue. So there were like 47. Then we,

51
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:53.720
then we started doing research and we figured out that there there's gotta be at

52
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:58.070
least 14 stations that still have like ticket offices or

53
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:01.360
platforms are there, like there's something there that you could find.

54
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.830
So we started sneaking into the tube to go and find these places.

55
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:08.950
Like we would wait until the train stopped at two in the morning. And they,

56
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.980
we would like climb up a bridge and get onto the tracks and we'd run through the

57
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.360
tunnels. And we,

58
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.890
and we refining these stations one after another incredible time

59
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:22.450
capsules, you know, where there were artifacts left behind posters,

60
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:26.530
like we'd find tickets on the ground from 40, 40 years old. You know,

61
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.260
I mean really cool stuff. Some of the, a lot of these stations were,

62
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.210
were bombed out during world war II. Um, but, uh,

63
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.670
finding these, like, again, this kind of like,

64
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.470
like here's the archeologist semi, right?

65
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:40.540
Like we were having this visceral connection to history.

66
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:44.650
We were finding this stuff that was giving us like a real sense of being inside

67
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.510
history in material terms. So we're,

68
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.170
we're posting every time we crack one of these stations we posted on our blogs

69
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.380
or like, oh, we've, you know, we've cracked Mark Lane,

70
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.870
we've cracked down street, we've cracked whatever.

71
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.240
And we're all excited about it. And, and like the window's narrowing and we,

72
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.130
we get, we get towards the end of the 14 stations and we're starting to think,

73
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.323
you know,

74
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.280
like the cops are surely watching what we're doing, right.

75
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:18.940
The British transport police, and kind of know where we're going to go next.

76
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.720
Cause there's only a few stations left. So we stopped posting stuff.

77
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.030
And on Christmas of 2012,

78
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:29.860
we cracked the last station underneath the British museum, uh, which like,

79
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:31.750
there's all sorts of cool stories about like, there was a,

80
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.330
there was a ghost in here it's a haunted station and whatever,

81
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.640
but we did it and we never got caught. So for me,

82
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:41.530
this is the end of the research project.

83
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.860
<v 1>Like a year of being like retroactively prosecuted for</v>

84
00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:50.400
this. We'll get, we'll get there. So.

85
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.430
<v 0>I'm done with my research project. I've written my PhD.</v>

86
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:57.240
I published my first book, explore everything about a lover or a,

87
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.060
or I hadn't published the book yet actually. And I fly,

88
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.320
I fly to Cambodia to work on a totally different research project. Right?

89
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.660
Like I'm switching gears, I'm going to go do something else.

90
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.570
And I fly back from Cambodia via Singapore and the plane lands

91
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:15.630
at Heathrow. And you know, the thing goes off ding,

92
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.290
and you stand up and you get your bags and then nothing's happening.

93
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.120
And they say, can everyone, please sit down again. And I sit down,

94
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.280
I look out the plane and there's cop cars everywhere. And I'm like, oh.

95
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.060
You know, I came from Singapore, someone brought drugs. I don't know.

96
00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:33.210
There's a terrorist and look like, like who I have no idea what's going on.

97
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.730
And the cops get on the plane and they're like 42, K 42 K Dr. Garrett. Yeah.

98
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.440
You're coming with us. Okay. So they cuffed me.

99
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.990
They, they have me like retrieve my bag from the baggage claim and they take me

100
00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:52.080
through, through passport control in handcuffs.

101
00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:54.150
And obviously the UK government's like, yeah.

102
00:05:54.151 --> 00:05:56.160
W we'll go ahead and keep that passport. Thank you.

103
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.750
So they eventually charged me with, um,

104
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.050
conspiracy to commit criminal damage.

105
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.370
Now what's weird about England is that trespass. Isn't a criminal offense.

106
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.443
So you can't,

107
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.170
you can't charge people with trespass unless you're in very specific

108
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.040
circumstances.

109
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.780
So they tried out this charge of conspiracy to commit criminal damage because

110
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.910
it's, it's about intention. It's a thought crime.

111
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.320
Like if I text you and I'm like, Hey dude, uh, you know,

112
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:27.200
the bar is closed right now. Cause it COVID, you want to break in and just like,

113
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.140
pour ourselves a beer. And you're like, yeah, let's do it.

114
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.290
Like we've committed conspiracy to commit criminal damage.

115
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.480
Like we've committed to the crime. So, uh, anyway,

116
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.860
we for years were dragged through the British legal system and I got trapped in

117
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:47.000
the UK for three years. Well, they kept my passport dude.

118
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:47.900
I was trapped there.

119
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.850
And here's where it kids really weird is that when the plane landed at

120
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:54.980
Singapore, there was a,

121
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.730
a journalist from GQ who was supposed to meet us.

122
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.790
Cause we were going to take him into some of this subterranean infrastructure

123
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:05.300
and show him all these spaces. And he's like, you know,

124
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:09.290
by the time I got out of jail, like 48 hours later, um, I had,

125
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.660
I had all these messages from like you. I came,

126
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.150
I showed up at the airport and you weren't there and whatever, you.

127
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.670
<v 2>Know, and I finally find this guy, Matthew power. And.</v>

128
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.460
<v 0>He, and he's like, are you serious? Like you got,</v>

129
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.300
cause we had timed it to land at the same time. And he's like, you serious,

130
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.630
you got arrested at that moment. And he said, what about your house? I said,

131
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:29.171
I have no idea.

132
00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:33.520
So we go to my house and we unlock the door with these keys that the police had

133
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:37.660
given me because they took down my door with a battering Ram. Right. And then,

134
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.000
you know, like put some padlocks on there that they drilled into the,

135
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.980
the door and the doorframe.

136
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.780
And I open it up in my apartment has just been ravaged, right? Like stuff ever.

137
00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:49.360
The mattress has flipped over. All the cupboards are torn apart.

138
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.950
There's like pieces of the door all over the floor and underneath all of it,

139
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:54.784
there was, uh,

140
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.260
a job contract from the university of Oxford to do a post-doc after I,

141
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.970
because I had just finished my PhD.

142
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.390
<v 2>And the journalist from GQ. He's like, dude, I can go home right now.</v>

143
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.510
We've got this story. I don't need to explore anything I've done.

144
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.760
And how did it resolve? Well.

145
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.740
<v 0>The, um, by the time we got to court, I mean th the, the prosecution,</v>

146
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.720
it was just in shambles. I mean,

147
00:08:16.721 --> 00:08:20.800
it was a total debacle because there was no evidence that we had broken

148
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:25.450
anything, you know, two laws you had just trespass, which is we just trespassed.

149
00:08:25.451 --> 00:08:29.050
Yeah. But they spent, you know, 300,000 pounds, I don't know,

150
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:32.410
$400,000 of taxpayer money to run this prosecution.

151
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:37.030
So they were going to see it to the end and essentially, um, you know, they got,

152
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.890
they, they confiscated my computers, my hard drives my notebooks.

153
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.040
And, uh, that was the,

154
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.960
that was the central component of the evidence that was used to prosecute

155
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:51.280
everyone. So essentially, like I just made a deal with them. I was like, look,

156
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.030
I'll, I'll take a hit. You know, if you just like,

157
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.260
everyone else can just get off, you know, I'll take the hit for it.

158
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.690
So I pled guilty to, uh, uh, I think it was four counts of criminal damage,

159
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:08.670
which included damage to his screw from a board that I had taken off and

160
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:13.170
put back on to event shaft. I know, slide sliding,

161
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:14.790
open a window. Oh, that was aiding.

162
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:18.060
And abetting side opened a window for someone to crawl through. I mean,

163
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.830
it was just like a list of ridiculous things,

164
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:23.730
but they didn't care cause they just, they needed there. They needed a win,

165
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.850
you know? So I gave him that, but now I've got no,

166
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.670
I've got this criminal record in England.

167
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.000
<v 1>So when you land, you get pulled aside. If you go to England.</v>

168
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.300
<v 0>I used to, I actually filed the complaint with the government and I, you know,</v>

169
00:09:35.301 --> 00:09:39.020
they would like severely harass me. And then when I moved to Australia,

170
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.100
I had the same problem. Like they had put flags on my passport. Um,

171
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.580
and you filed a complaint and did it go through the complaint and they fixed it.

172
00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:50.390
They took the flags off the passport. Yeah. Essentially saying like, you know,

173
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.330
I did my thing, you know? Yeah. Like,

174
00:09:53.331 --> 00:09:56.710
why do I have to keep paying for this over and over again? So,

175
00:09:56.711 --> 00:09:58.310
but it was really funny when I tried, when they,

176
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.650
when they originally gave me my passport back. So like,

177
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.270
I go to court and then they're, you know, the judge is like, Dr. Garrett,

178
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:05.120
you're very naughty or.

179
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.520
<v 2>Whatever, you know, here's your hair, take your passport back.</v>

180
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.460
<v 3>They have wigs on. Yes. The wigs are fantastic. Yeah. They still do that.</v>

181
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.560
They still do that. They're really good. That's real. Yeah.

182
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.750
<v 0>Yeah. The barristers all have their wigs and they can carry them around like,</v>

183
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.810
like a cat and then they have to put it on when they're to put it on two dots,

184
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.200
one bonkers. But so like, so they gave me my passport back and I,

185
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:31.890
and the next day I was supposed to fly to Sydney to go speak at the

186
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.170
festival of dangerous ideas. I was the obvious speaker.

187
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.590
<v 2>And I go to the airport and the guy swipes it.</v>

188
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:44.060
<v 0>And he's like, oh yeah, you don't want to use this. I was like,</v>

189
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:47.180
what w what does it say? What does the screen say? And he's like, I can't,

190
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.570
I can't relay that, but you should probably go,

191
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.400
it gives me a password back. And then I should probably leave the country. No,

192
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:57.650
like you should not get on a plane with this. Like,

193
00:10:57.651 --> 00:11:01.220
you're going to have a problem on the other side, you know, whatever he was.

194
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.380
Can you travel well, exactly. So then,

195
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.740
so then I missed my flight and I had to go back.

196
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.260
I had to go to the U S embassy and I'm like, you know, I've,

197
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.440
I've just tried to fly with my passport and it doesn't work.

198
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.740
And the guy at the embassy swipes that, and he says, oh, wow.

199
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.370
<v 2>And then he gets out a whole puncher and he goes, don't.</v>

200
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.940
<v 0>Don't write through my passport. And he says, you shouldn't use that.</v>

201
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.570
And then like three hours later, they gave me another passport and I flew out.

202
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.000
<v 1>And the passport is good. The new one's good is fine.</v>

203
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.960
<v 0>Yeah. Wow. But then I, but then I started getting stopped again. So they, like,</v>

204
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.740
I don't know, tack the flags on there later. I mean, it was a real ordeal,

205
00:11:36.741 --> 00:11:41.570
but th th you know, the thing, I mean, it was, it was, it was traumatic for me.

206
00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:44.420
Of course it was like stuck in a foreign country. And, you know, like,

207
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.950
you get worried about your income.

208
00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:49.790
I guess it was worried about being D they did try to deport me at some point.

209
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.670
Cause once you have a criminal offense, they can try and deport. So anyway,

210
00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:55.420
I beat down. Do they find you.

211
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.610
<v 1>Like, what was the ultimate judgment? Yeah.</v>

212
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:02.040
<v 0>Yeah, it was, I think he was to 2000 pounds, about $3,000. I got fined.</v>

213
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:03.900
Um.

214
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.050
<v 1>Not, not too bad, not a big deal. Sure. You made some money off the book.</v>

215
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.660
If not, you're gonna make some now, you know what dude, I.

216
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.350
<v 0>I made, I made, uh, all the money that I made on my first book,</v>

217
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.010
explore everything, went to my lawyers, who I have to say were phenomenal.

218
00:12:17.011 --> 00:12:20.100
Like they did a great job, but it was like, every time I get a royalty check,

219
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.030
I'd just sign it over.

220
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.550
<v 2>To them, you know? And it did seem like karma.</v>

221
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.140
<v 0>It was like, well, I broke into all this.</v>

222
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.080
And then I wrote a book and then the money went to the lawyers and the lawyers

223
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.840
got me off and it all kind of worked out.
