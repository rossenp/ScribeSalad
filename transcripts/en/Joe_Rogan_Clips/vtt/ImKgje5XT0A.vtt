00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.440
<v 3>He, he performs like it doesn't exist. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,</v>

3
00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:07.840
cancel culture. Doesn't exist. Kinda like the way Jack Johnson,

4
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.960
just kind of Jack Johnson. You ever see that documentary? Jack Johnson? Um,

5
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:13.400
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. Well,

6
00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:18.080
he just like lived his life as if racism didn't exist and people like didn't

7
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:19.920
even know what to make of themed. A lot of white chicks.

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.753
<v 1>He did.</v>

9
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.390
<v 0>In their face during a time where like you get Lynch for that.</v>

10
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.510
He was mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he almost seemed like he was taken from another era

11
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.910
and put into, he would talk while he was you up. He had gold tea,

12
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.110
had gold fronts. I mean, before hip hop, I mean, he like, he,

13
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.070
he almost looks like he was like time traveled. Yeah.

14
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.220
<v 1>Well, you know, it's interesting. His nickname him was the Galveston giant,</v>

15
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.580
you know, he was only like six feet tall or six foot one, I think.

16
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.420
I don't think he was even, he might have been 200 pounds. Yeah. You know,

17
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.980
like how pull up, how tall and how much did Jack Johnson weigh foot tall.

18
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.060
Six foot tall. Yeah. Galveston giant. A giant six foot. You're six foot tall,

19
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:02.250
right? Yeah. Yeah. How crazy is that? You're a giant people.

20
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.210
<v 0>Had no food back then. Yeah. They didn't grow that big.</v>

21
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:05.090
They didn't have any food.

22
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.930
<v 1>Dude. This is how soft we are. People were tiny back then.</v>

23
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:11.130
Like if you look at the average size of the civil war,

24
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.650
an average man was 130 pounds. Cause they didn't have any food. Yeah.

25
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.250
<v 0>They must have looked like a Lincoln. Like holy, this guy's tall.</v>

26
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.290
He was like six, two. Not that big. Yeah. I mean.

27
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.280
<v 1>But Jack Johnson was guys got big.</v>

28
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.760
<v 0>Balls. Literally look at that package.</v>

29
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.000
<v 1>Sack. Huge. I'm sure. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; look at that right there. I mean,</v>

30
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.520
you gotta think this is there's no steroids back then. Yeah.

31
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:36.360
There's just superior genetics and also just hardship.

32
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.041
Right. You know,

33
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:41.960
talk about KIB growing up in Dastan imagine being a black man as a

34
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.910
boxer, a back when they all wanted white men to be the champ, like, look,

35
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.590
look the size of him, man. Yeah. Shreded he was, shreded built like a,

36
00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:55.590
like a modern elite athlete. Yeah. And this is, you know, what year was that.

37
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.183
<v 0>Turn of the century?</v>

38
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.790
<v 1>What year was it? Jimmy? Does it say that he was a champ? Was.</v>

39
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.980
<v 0>It like 1908? I early, early turn of the century. Uh,</v>

40
00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:08.500
I started eating a little bit there. What can you do? Buster Douglas?

41
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.260
It happens in between fights. What? That right there. Yeah.

42
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.140
He looks like he had a couple cheeseburgers or whatever.

43
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.660
<v 1>Well, what does it say here? Does it say there? It says, uh,</v>

44
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.180
he was born in, he died in forty six, nineteen ten.

45
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.340
<v 2>Was up to five of the century.</v>

46
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.890
<v 1>He was born in 1878. Wow. So it's probably the early,</v>

47
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.010
early 19 hundreds. And but,

48
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.290
but they would get giant crowds and you barely could see anything. Yeah.

49
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.410
You know, and all guys had top hats. You ever see the, the crowds? Yeah.

50
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:41.970
They're wild. Yeah. Did he.

51
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.920
<v 2>Lost over a hundred pounds to get into that fight? Yeah. What in 1910? Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:48.800
He hadn't fought in six years and had to lose will over a hundred pounds to get

53
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.400
back into his championship. Fighting weight.

54
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.880
<v 1>Really? Yeah. It was, yeah. He was probably just drinking and eating,</v>

55
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.720
living like a killer. Oh, the guy he fought. Oh who'd you fight?

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.080
Was that Jeffries? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. James Jeffries. Yeah. Yeah. Oh,

57
00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:05.320
well that makes sense. Well, they,

58
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:08.760
they brought Jeffries in to try to beat him because Jeffries was the former

59
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.873
champion and.

60
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.160
<v 0>He was a big kid too. Right. Jim Jeffries, like, uh, he's.</v>

61
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.880
<v 1>A big fellow. Yeah. But you know.</v>

62
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.600
<v 0>They were that's where the great white hope kind of probably originated.</v>

63
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.830
They were trying to beat him.

64
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.510
<v 1>Oh yeah. For sure. That's exactly where it came from. Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.950
<v 0>And then he was, he was about to win that fight and they cut the broadcast.</v>

66
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.470
<v 1>What's that there was a broadcast.</v>

67
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.303
<v 0>Back then. Yeah. They,</v>

68
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.070
there was like the first televised boxing match and he was,

69
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.190
I forget who he was fighting.

70
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.670
Some white guy number five or six &lt;laugh&gt; they were putting up, well, this is a,

71
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.780
and before he knocked him out, they just cut the broadcast.

72
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.980
Cuz they didn't want the, the country to see.

73
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.660
<v 1>It. They had broadcast back then.</v>

74
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.580
<v 0>It's towards the end. Yeah. I mean like, uh, yeah, that fight.</v>

75
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.660
<v 1>Huh? I.</v>

76
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.180
<v 0>Don't think it was that fight. It wasn't that fight.</v>

77
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.780
<v 1>I don't think they had TV. When did they have TV? When did TV?</v>

78
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.740
What was the first television broadcast? I wanna say 1940.

79
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.450
When was the first let's let's figure out when the first television broadcast

80
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.930
was. Yeah. I mean his, I know that. Take a guess. One's the first.

81
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.170
<v 0>Television B I'm gonna say like, uh, 1917 &lt;laugh&gt; 17, 19 17.</v>

82
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.730
<v 1>Hey, back in the day, people would talk like.</v>

83
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.410
<v 0>Yeah. Why did they talk like that? I don't yeah. Welcome to the fight.</v>

84
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.410
<v 1>Yeah. They, 20, 19 28 was the first broadcast. So one.</v>

85
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.690
<v 0>Of his fights was broadcast. Right.</v>

86
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.360
<v 1>I don't know, man. I, was it one in the stadium? It, I don't know.</v>

87
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.800
I don't think they did. I don't think they did. I,

88
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.320
I wanna say if that was the case, it was like way late in his career.

89
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:36.320
They think like, even like when he lost, like lost later in his career,

90
00:04:36.321 --> 00:04:38.720
they think he took a dive. Cuz there's a,

91
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.550
there's a video of it where it doesn't really looks like he's hurt.

92
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.470
He just kind lays down. Like they might have threatened him or you know,

93
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.190
he might have got a big payday to take a dive.

94
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.230
There's always a lot of speculation in boxing. Yeah. But guys taking dives,

95
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:53.030
especially the.

96
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.590
<v 0>Mob was heavily involved in it. Oh.</v>

97
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.950
<v 1>Yeah. My God.</v>

98
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.150
And you imagine the amount of money you could win betting on a white guy against

99
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.710
Jack Johnson. Yeah. A lot of money.

100
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.140
<v 0>Yeah. A lot of it. One of his quotes, I remember like he was so wild.</v>

101
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.740
I think he got a, he used to like drive a fast car. He made some money and.

102
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.380
<v 1>And what was fast back then? 35. 35.</v>

103
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.140
<v 0>Miles an hour. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; like, wow. He,</v>

104
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.860
uh, he got a ticket and the guy, he was like, Hey, don't gimme a ticket. Now.

105
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:22.650
He was like, cuz I'm gonna drive back. You gimme two tickets.

106
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.250
<v 1>Well he, no, what it was is they gave him a ticket for $50. He has,</v>

107
00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:29.330
here's a hundred because I'm gonna be going the same speed the way back. Wow.

108
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.330
<v 0>Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; that's not given a, I mean he had no to give. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

109
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.190
<v 1>I mean, what are you gonna.</v>

110
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.890
<v 0>Do guys like him almost like, uh, when you look at history you're like, um,</v>

111
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.610
you know, is this sort of just a natural evolution?

112
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.880
Like no certain guys move history forward. Oh yeah, yeah.

113
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.521
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

114
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:50.160
