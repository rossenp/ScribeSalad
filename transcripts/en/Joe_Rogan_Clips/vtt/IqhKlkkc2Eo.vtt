00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.040
<v 2>So they hired the guy, the best friends at the lab to investigate the lab.</v>

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.920
Right. It's like hiring Robert Kardashian to investigate OJ.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.360
&lt;laugh&gt; you know what I mean? It's like, and, and,

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.240
and when they interview these guys on TV, they always say the same thing.

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.120
Don't you want the best friends of the lab to interview the lab?

7
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.080
Isn't we know the most about it. We're doing the research.

8
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.990
It would be like Robert Kardish and being like, I know OJ really well, you know,

9
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.990
let me do the investigation. I'll figure out the truth.

10
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.990
I'll get to the bottom of this. Right. So anyway,

11
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.870
so they go to the lab for three hours, talk to their best friends,

12
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.990
looking straight and like, did you do it? No, we didn't do it. Okay.

13
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.853
Case closed.

14
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.150
And then they concluded in their w H O report that the lab theory was very

15
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:37.630
unlikely.

16
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.700
<v 0>And we don't need to look into the lab case closed. And everybody was like, oh,</v>

17
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.860
that doesn't make any sense. We can't have that.

18
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.420
These guys have a conflict of interest. Their careers are tied to this lab.

19
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.260
If the lab were found to be guilty again, we don't know. I don't know.

20
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.980
You don't know Peter Daik doesn't know. Well, maybe he knows,

21
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:57.940
but I don't think he knows, you know, their legacy,

22
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.010
this entire project of $200 billion, 200 million,

23
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.570
rather to dig up viruses all over the world would be cap put,

24
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.930
it would have to necessarily be stopped this whole industry. Okay.

25
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.290
Now here's the part where I'm gonna get a little controversial. Are you ready?

26
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.090
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is it okay? Sure. Okay.

27
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.770
So if I've gotten you that far again,

28
00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:22.720
just to say that I don't blame anyone out there for having

29
00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:25.840
this notion that like this lab accident theory is kind of a kooky thing that

30
00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:28.000
like was cooked up by Mike Pompe or something like that.

31
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.520
I get why you think that, but now Trump's not, he's not here anymore. Right?

32
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:35.440
We don't have to argue about Trump anymore, hopefully, ever again. Right.

33
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.920
And we can just look at the piles of circumstantial evidence,

34
00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:42.400
and there's a plenty of circumstantial evidence that it could have come.

35
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.510
The there's some circumstantial evidence that it could have come from nature.

36
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.310
I feel that the lab theory has more compelling circumstantial evidence,

37
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.990
because again, they were doing that kind of research. They also,

38
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.990
there was a huge cover up and the virus database went mysteriously offline

39
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:58.710
somehow in December, 2019. He's also the evolution of the virus itself, right?

40
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.510
That it that's what Robert, so Robert Redfield,

41
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.180
who was the CDC director of the time trained virologist, he says,

42
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.180
I took a look at this virus and I concluded that it is so powerful that it must

43
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.260
have been evolved in a lab setting.

44
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.700
And he pointed to the gain of function research,

45
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:15.740
and they called him a racist conspiracy theorist and all the rest. Yeah.

46
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.020
Right now here's the controversial part that the godfather of

47
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.500
that industry, the head of the, the,

48
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.970
of the pyramid is a guy you may have heard of called Anthony Fauci.

49
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.730
I I've heard of that guy. Right? Yeah.

50
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.570
Do you wanna hear more? Yeah. Okay. So Anthony Fauci,

51
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.130
the hero of the pandemic

52
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.290
is the most important person in the world of gain of function research.

53
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:47.280
There is, in other words, he is, and not just him,

54
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:51.520
there's Francis Collins at the NIH and some other people, but basically he,

55
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.960
he is the one dispersing all of the grants for this.

56
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.080
He is the one who pushed to turn it back on after Obama turned it back off,

57
00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:58.360
that's a whole nother, crazy story.

58
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.800
He turned it back on without really consulting the white house.

59
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.240
That's breaking news, never been reported.

60
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.360
Just broke some news on your show right now. Really? Yes. Uh,

61
00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:08.960
he consulted the office of science and technology policy,

62
00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:11.920
which is like a part of the white house, but he didn't, uh, you know, the,

63
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:16.000
the white house put a pause on it. And then he like undid the pause. It,

64
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.600
the details are a little sketchy.

65
00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:21.350
I'm not saying that he didn't anything necessarily wrong or illegal.

66
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.270
I'm just saying that a lot of people that I know inside the Trump administration

67
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.230
had no idea. This had turned it back, turned back on.

68
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.670
He found a way to turn it back on in the mess of the Trump administration,

69
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.310
cuz the Trump administration was full of bunch of clowns, right?

70
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.230
So at the end you could get stuff done. If you just knew how to work,

71
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:38.070
the system felt you is the head of that system. Why, what was.

72
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.903
<v 1>His incentive?</v>

73
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.620
<v 0>That's his, that's everything. That's his whole career that's.</v>

74
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.340
So what he would say and uh, to be fair again, to be perfectly fair to him,

75
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.980
he's trying to predict the next pandemic.

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.180
He thinks this is the way that you predict the next pandemic.

77
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.860
By digging up all these viruses,

78
00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:54.620
we gotta dig up more and more viruses and play around with them,

79
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.900
cuz we're gonna find how they evolved.

80
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.260
Then we're gonna come up with therapeutics and vaccines and all this stuff.

81
00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.300
<v 1>But there were no the.</v>

82
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.250
<v 0>Right, but we did have vaccines quicker than most because the DARPA funded a,</v>

83
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.450
a program to make R mRNA vaccines 10 years ago that actually worked, you know,

84
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:12.890
that was a military funded program, but we can get to that in a second,

85
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.783
but that's.

86
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.570
<v 1>Not related to this. Right?</v>

87
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.080
<v 0>So my that's that's, that's a very fair OBS. In other words,</v>

88
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.780
the,

89
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.560
the $200 million program to predict and preempt the pandemic failed to predict

90
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.040
and, and preempt the pandemic. But it may have also sparked.

91
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.360
<v 1>The pandemic, but may have sparked. But, but here's my, my, my question,</v>

92
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.440
when I read all about the research they were doing,

93
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.280
I didn't see what they were doing to prevent it. I just,

94
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.670
they were what they were doing was examining these viruses and trying to find

95
00:04:43.671 --> 00:04:47.550
out how they work and trying to see what happens when they get more virent.

96
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.830
But what I didn't see is that the invention of therapeutics.

97
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.710
<v 0>Or the, I, I hear what you're saying. I'm, I'm,</v>

98
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.950
I'm willing to give these scientists the benefit of the doubt that they're

99
00:04:56.951 --> 00:05:00.790
honest goal was to create, do good science to prevent and predictive.

100
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.460
<v 1>Oh, I am too. That's not what I'm saying. What.</v>

101
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.580
<v 0>I'm I, I don't know if they produced therapeutics what.</v>

102
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.460
<v 1>I'm saying, but did they have a lack of funding in that department?</v>

103
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.380
Was all the funding. I dunno. I, I, you know,

104
00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:15.100
allocated towards examining the viruses themselves and not towards developing

105
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.860
some sort of, uh, a therapeutic, uh, I, I.

106
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.260
<v 0>Don't yous a good question. I don't know the answer to that question. Okay.</v>

107
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.370
But what I do know is that the majority of their time was spent digging up

108
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.650
viruses in the wild and bringing them.

109
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.450
<v 1>Back to these labs. But Fauci yeah. When he started it back up,</v>

110
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.330
did he start it back up with the intent to just uncover more information?

111
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.170
So be better informed.

112
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.690
<v 0>His argument was this is vital research. The longer we pause it,</v>

113
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.720
the more danger that we're in, I'm trying to save the world.

114
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.840
And so we gotta turn this stuff back on,

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.520
cuz this is how we're gonna save the world from the next pandemic,

116
00:05:46.521 --> 00:05:49.680
which I'm sure he believed. And I'm sure a lot of these people believed, right.

117
00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:51.440
But there is another school of thought out there.

118
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.320
And the other school of thought is, Hey,

119
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:56.960
instead of taking $200 million to dig up viruses and make them more dangerous,

120
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.440
why don't you put that money into monitoring and surveillance in the places

121
00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:00.920
where the bats are. In other words,

122
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:04.040
if you put resources where the outbreaks are likely to occur,

123
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.840
then you could squelch them when they pop up.

124
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:07.960
Because actually viruses change every day. And,

125
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.640
and trying to predict the pandemic is a fools era.

126
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:14.040
That's another scientific school thought. That's not the one that F's in. Right?

127
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.310
But the reason that there's no debate about this is because the NIH and ni a I D

128
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.190
structure such that everyone gets funded by them. They're funding everybody.

129
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.790
So if you are in the field of virology, there's a 99.9,

130
00:06:24.791 --> 00:06:28.750
9% Chi that you're getting money from Anthony Fauci in one way or another,

131
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.430
your grants, your careers, your chairmanships. So there's no,

132
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.070
there's no dissent allowed in that community.

133
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.500
I learned a lot about the scientific community and, and the VIR.

134
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.260
So no debate. I talk, I talk to scientists all the time who say, I,

135
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.060
I think this gain of function research is really dangerous.

136
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:46.780
I can't say anything. I'm gonna lose my grant. Geez. I gonna lose my career.

137
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.500
This happens to me all the time. And when Robert Robert Redfield spoke up,

138
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.780
because he's a big mocker and he's head of the VI head of CDC, he said,

139
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.740
it it's my opinion that it came from the lab.

140
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.410
Cause he can't declassify a bunch of classified information on CNN. Right.

141
00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:04.410
But he's talking about what he knows. Right? It's obvious to everyone,

142
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.650
who's in the know that he's seen the intelligence and he's not just talking out

143
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:12.090
of his. He's not some Joe Schmo virologist. He was the head of the CDC.

144
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.810
He's seen all of the secret, secret stuff. Even the stuff I never got,

145
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.680
got a whiff of. And he, and he went on TV and said, Hey, uh,

146
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.280
I think this probably came from the lab. We should probably look at the lab.

147
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.920
And he was called a racist in a conspiracy theorist. And, but by foolish people,

148
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.640
but what he's saying, but Fauci disagreed with him publicly. Right.

149
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.720
So that's the thing. So if you, if you just think about it just for once again,

150
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.840
I, I I'm begging people out there just like, think again,

151
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.200
whatever you thought about the lab accident, it doesn't matter.

152
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.550
Whatever you tweeted and 20, 20 March, it doesn't, nobody cares. Right.

153
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.350
And the same thing for the media, let it go. Yeah.

154
00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:48.150
Because it's all confirmation bias now. Like, oh, I, I, I tweeted this in March,

155
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.710
2020, and I want it to hold up. Nobody cares what you tweeted in March, 2020.

156
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.110
Let's just have a, a rational yeah.

157
00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:57.710
Moratorium conversation about what are the likely ways we got into this horrible

158
00:07:57.711 --> 00:07:58.630
crisis that we're in.

159
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.060
And so for people in the know who are listening to Robert Redfield,

160
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:04.420
it's clear that he's calling out Anthony Fauci. In other words,

161
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:06.060
he's pointing to the gain of function research,

162
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.380
which he knows cuz he's the head of the CDC reports up to Fauci. He knows that.

163
00:08:10.381 --> 00:08:11.214
Right, right.

164
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.900
But he's not saying that because even that's too hot for him to say it's hot and

165
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.580
it's too. And the scientists are not gonna say that either.

166
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.620
Now you have a lot of people sort of on the,

167
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.050
on the right media and the mega media. Who've been saying that for a long time,

168
00:08:22.051 --> 00:08:24.890
but they don't have any credibility with the mainstream media. And I'm,

169
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:28.410
I'm just like in that weird space where like I've wrote a book about, you know,

170
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.250
us China relationship. So I had all these,

171
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.450
this good reporting and I'm not bag media.

172
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.650
Cause I criticized Trump in my columns all the time. So I am mainstream media,

173
00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:39.330
but I'm saying we should look at the lab and it messes with people's minds.

174
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.880
Cause they're like, oh what, why is he doing this? Why is Josh pushing the lab?

175
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.720
I'm not pushing the lab. That's the problem today with these rigid ideologies.

176
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.960
Exactly. Everyone's on teams. It's all Fashional yes, yes. But I don't care.

177
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.320
I don't even care if the lab accident theory is true.

178
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.120
If the natural origin theory is true, then great.

179
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.120
I will leave the ticker tape parade,

180
00:08:56.121 --> 00:09:00.960
celebrating Peter Daik and Anthony Fauci through down, you know, fifth avenue.

181
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.320
I'm, I'm happy to do that.

182
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.880
All I'm saying is that we have to also look into this lab, these labs rather,

183
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.040
and that we can't hire the best friends of the lab to look into the labs.

184
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.280
Cause they have a clear conflict of interest and they it up already.
