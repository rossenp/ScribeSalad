00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's true. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it's true. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.520
Why sh why should joy have boundaries? It shouldn't.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.480
<v 1>It shouldn't, we're all scared. No, you I'm not. This is,</v>

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.280
I had this conversation, this friend of mine about, uh, Bernie Sanders.

5
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.120
We were talking about socialism and you I'm like, he's like,

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.070
I never thought you'd be into socialism. I got, I'm not in his socialism, but,

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.230
but what,

8
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.830
what about fixing the things that are broken doesn't seem appealing to you.

9
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.830
And we have socialism for a lot of different things like the fire department,

10
00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:33.230
the police department. Right. But I'm like, but I, that's not what I'm into.

11
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.790
This is what I'm really into.

12
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.150
I'm really into like people having a big stake in the community.

13
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.500
And I think when you look out for other people,

14
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:45.060
that's when you have the biggest stake in community mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

15
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:47.260
And I think that's one of the things we're missing today and we're missing.

16
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.260
We can, we can do it in our neighborhoods. Like we were talking about like,

17
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:51.500
you know, your neighbors, it's really nice,

18
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.820
but I think we could do it in an expansive way,

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.980
as long as we didn't give in to the, the,

20
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:59.860
the temptation to be to people that we don't know. Right.

21
00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:02.690
And we treat everybody as if we're all, all a part of a community,

22
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.450
I think that can be done.

23
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.570
And I think the best way to sort of enhance that kind of thinking is to make

24
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.050
decisions that are for the downtrodden,

25
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.050
make decisions that are for the working class and the people that are struggling

26
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:17.770
and the people that are just trying to put food in the table and keep a,

27
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.080
a home heated that's that's concentrating on that first before anything,

28
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.080
cuz those are the hardest hardships. Yeah.

29
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.160
And there's too many people that have this idea that everyone that's in that

30
00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:34.840
experience is there because they're lazy or because they don't work hard or

31
00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:35.800
because they people really.

32
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.040
<v 0>Think that they do. That's.</v>

33
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.040
<v 1>So ignorant excuses. There's a lot of people that do think like that,</v>

34
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.480
but it is because it is, it is if they're ignorant, but it's, it's a,

35
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.710
also that they don't know,

36
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.790
they haven't experience with those people who experience. And if they,

37
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.310
this is the thing about every person alive, you look at a person,

38
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.790
look at a person who's doing great. Look at a person who's falling apart.

39
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.750
You would be that person. If you did what they did,

40
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.590
there's not much difference between us. Yeah. Agree.

41
00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:57.990
Unless you're talking about physical things,

42
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.750
like the difference between you seeing bolts running speed and the difference

43
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:05.620
between mine. Like this is certain physical things. This are, unsemmountable,

44
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.660
I'm positive thinking, bro. Like it's not happening. It's it's not happening.

45
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.820
Right. There's certain things you can't get past. Right.

46
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.380
But there's a lot of things you can. Yeah. You know, I agree. And,

47
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.180
and one of the problems that we all have is our perception.

48
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.153
The way we look at things,

49
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.090
if we could look at things as more like we're all cool, we're all, all together.

50
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.410
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, nobody wants you to do bad. Like let's all do good.

51
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.010
We can all do good together. We can,

52
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:31.450
we could all go forward with that mindset wrong. There are.

53
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.770
<v 0>Some people that want you to do bad. And those people also deserve attention.</v>

54
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:36.250
Exactly. Need a need hug. They need.

55
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.370
<v 1>That part. They need a hug. We're we for?</v>

56
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.370
They're just so scared history we're treating. 'em the wrong way. Yeah.

57
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:44.960
We're treating them like we need to kill 'em and drown the.

58
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.240
<v 0>River. No, they're they're they're not the bad guy. It's like,</v>

59
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.200
it's like the hurt people hurt people thing. You know? You just,

60
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:52.680
you gotta exactly see those people and say, Hey,

61
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.480
I see you and I'm gonna hug you. And yes. And like let's all move together.

62
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.680
<v 1>Yes. And then the problem is some of 'em are, are really legitimately broken.</v>

63
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.390
Yeah.

64
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.600
Like some people have done a terrible job of raising their kids to the point

65
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.680
where they're broken their kids and those kids need to have,

66
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.480
find some way back to the garden. You know, it it's hard.

67
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.280
And that's the reality of scale. The,

68
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:16.840
the fact that there's 350 million people just in America.

69
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.310
I mean, is' that the number is that north America that's pretty close.

70
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.550
That's crazy for us to try to put that into perspective is almost impossible.

71
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.150
I don't think we even understand what that number means and that we're all

72
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.990
supposed to be a team, but I think it's possible.

73
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.190
I think we just have to look at it the right way.

74
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.590
Like you have to have no room for.

75
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.420
Bagery no room for treating. That's impossible, but it's not impossible.

76
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.340
I don't think it is.

77
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.300
I think people just need a higher level of guidance and of understanding

78
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.580
of the consequences of not behaving that way.

79
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.380
And the benefits of behaving that way.

80
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.820
The problem is we look at it like it's a negative, like somehow or another.

81
00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:57.420
It's a weakness. If you're, if you show,

82
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.170
if you show any sort of sympathy or compassion or right.

83
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.383
Or under,

84
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.650
or try to have some understanding for people who are downtrodden or poor people

85
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.130
who look at you, like you're weak. Like no, you're,

86
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.210
you're looking at the wrong way.

87
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.690
You're looking at you feel uncomfortable about it because it makes you feel

88
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:19.850
weird because there's too many variables and it'd be better if you just nail it

89
00:04:19.851 --> 00:04:23.200
down into a one or a zero either're lazy or they're good. Hardworking people.

90
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.000
If they're good, hardworking people to figure it out. And if they're lazy,

91
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:28.160
they don't it's, it's not binary. It's.

92
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.040
<v 0>Not B like that's the thing. Exactly. That's exactly rights. Like we're so yeah,</v>

93
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.920
it's, there's so.

94
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.040
<v 1>Much more just too many of us. Yeah. There's too many variables.</v>

95
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.440
The idea that like no one should get help. That's so crazy.

96
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.230
I was on welfare when I was a kid. It's it's important.

97
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.830
It's important for people. It keeps 'em fed. Yeah.

98
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:45.790
Like gives people a chance mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

99
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.910
and that doesn't mean that people are gonna come steal your money.

100
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.710
That means we should all chip in a little bit. Yeah.

101
00:04:52.711 --> 00:04:55.630
But we have to figure out how to make sure that the government has our

102
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:56.431
confidence, right.

103
00:04:56.431 --> 00:05:00.390
That we feel like we can throw them our money and they're gonna do the right

104
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:03.020
thing with it and we're gonna help communities. We're gonna help people.

105
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.140
And that's what everybody's wary about for a good reason.

106
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.540
It's cuz who the knows who's taking your money.

107
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:09.100
They don't give you an accountant sheet.

108
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.180
They don't show you what they're spending it on. You just give it.

109
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.020
<v 0>Up. Know that's what I meant earlier when I was like, I don't know. What's true.</v>

110
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.020
I don't know. I know it's hard, but at the same time,

111
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.810
I think what you're saying is so powerful because like, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

112
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.410
you can have your sort of government, uh, uh,

113
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:27.650
affiliations and like, oh,

114
00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:29.850
these are the people that are quote unquote taking care of us.

115
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.450
And then you can also take care of yourself and each other and recognize your

116
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.410
neighbors and recognize your community and,

117
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.090
and kind of build from the ground up. Know who your,

118
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.570
your local representatives are, you know, for Fox sake,

119
00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:43.640
like your kids in their schools. And like, yes,

120
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.520
all that stuff like that is a very powerful tool.

121
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.360
<v 1>Well, and, and even, I mean,</v>

122
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:51.960
those are official titles and official designations and all that stuff is

123
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:56.280
awesome too. But it's also just know who the is around you. Right. And like,

124
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.360
and, and, and being nice to each other and figure it out together.

125
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.760
Like we're all acting like everybody is not gonna help

126
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:08.600
you and everybody's not gonna understand you. And then when that gets fed to a,

127
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.200
a scale of this impossible number of 350 million people,

128
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.160
350 million people doesn't even make sense to us.

129
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:21.030
It's so hard for us to ever understand what it's like to try to like do

130
00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:24.710
what's best for 350 million people. It doesn't make sense. Right.

131
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.710
So you just do what's best for yourself and you go, it's gonna work itself out.

132
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:31.190
Yeah. It's gonna sort itself out. And if there's ever a conspiracy,

133
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:32.910
there's no action involved in that. Exactly.

134
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.460
And if there's ever a conspiracy to keep people stupid, that's a conspiracy.

135
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.420
Yeah. Make that seem like it's normal. Yeah.

136
00:06:39.421 --> 00:06:41.740
Make that seem like everybody shouldn't go, Hey, Hey, Hey,

137
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.500
you really can affect things and you really should pay attention to this.

138
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.860
And we should all figure out a way to do it together where the, the,

139
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.820
the whole motivation is to make life better for everybody.

140
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.100
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; when you really, really, really, really rich,

141
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.690
let's say really, really, really, really, really rich.

142
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.530
What if you just really, really, really, really &lt;laugh&gt;. You could notice,

143
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.210
you ain't noticing. You're not gonna notice,

144
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.810
but you are contributing in a dynamic way to a system

145
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:16.170
that helped you get really, really, really, really rich.

146
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.400
See the balancing act is not wanting to get to a place where you stifle

147
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:25.600
people's need to do well because they, they have,

148
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.320
they need to have some sort of motivation.

149
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.400
Some people do you want 'em to have motivation,

150
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.080
but you want 'em to feel good about contributing too. Sure.

151
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:33.120
That's that's what's up.

152
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.800
It's not this idea that they're gonna come steal your money. It's like, no,

153
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.510
we're you are gonna help. You're gonna, we're not stealing any money.

154
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.910
You're gonna help people that can't help themselves.

155
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.070
Like there's people you might have got lucky.

156
00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:47.470
You might have got a good parent in, in a good situation, a good neighborhood,

157
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.550
good school. You did well. Some people don't, some people get.

158
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.350
When they're real young, they get robbed. They get beaten up. They get tortured.

159
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:58.990
They get scared. That's normal in life too. And you can help that.

160
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.260
And this is what I think when you get lost,

161
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.700
in words like socialism and libertarianism and all these different

162
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.460
labels that carry all this weight behind them. If we just say like,

163
00:08:11.461 --> 00:08:15.220
what's your intentions is your intentions to make the community a,

164
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.660
a better place for everybody and make people happy and make sure people have

165
00:08:18.661 --> 00:08:21.810
food and make people are loved and make sure people are in a war.

166
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.330
That's what we should do as a community. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah.

167
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.290
That's what we should do. Although this stuff is. Cuz if you don't have that,

168
00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:29.570
you don't have anything and you're gonna real.

169
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.650
You're gonna feel really uncomfortable. Yeah. Yeah man. That's the thing.

170
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:38.810
That's the thing. And these labels, whether it's liberal, Republican, you cook,

171
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.040
you know, you hippie and all these different labels of people.

172
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.480
It's so easy to dismiss people with these labels and they have such an agenda.

173
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:46.800
Right. And it,

174
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.760
it plays on that part of the human psyche that wants to be a part of a team

175
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.720
and attack opposing ideas. And it becomes a tribal thing.

176
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.400
It's so hard to sort out what's right. And what's wrong, you know?

177
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.160
But I think we're in a weird space where there's no one at the wheel,

178
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.320
I think is the first time there's no,

179
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.440
the government doesn't have a hold of wheel. There's no mystery media. No, no,

180
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:14.990
that'ss all, what's so scary. It's all eroding for our eyes, but no, the,

181
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.510
the helm, no, one's got a hold of that. battleship, you know,

182
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:22.350
the parroshipss they have those handles on the wheel da and you know,

183
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:25.590
strap yourself in and. No one's at that wheel. That thing is just, well.

184
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.670
<v 0>You know, I'm gonna,</v>

185
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.150
I'm gonna go out out on a limb here and you said this earlier and we laughed

186
00:09:31.151 --> 00:09:34.950
about it. But like the thing is, you know,

187
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.980
you said the word love and like music and art

188
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.821
and you know,

189
00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:45.180
things that are cohesive in communal environments and

190
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.860
helping people come together.

191
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.020
Like in terms of like, feeling like, like what, what can I contribute? Like,

192
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.170
how can I help? Because this feels like an epidemic, this, this disandment,

193
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.490
you know, amongst us. Yeah. And all this fear, everybody's so scared.

194
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.930
I'm scared. You know, I, I am, I'm really scared not I go in and out of it.

195
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:06.730
I go in and out of.

196
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.690
<v 1>You just bring us back in. Right. I don't know.</v>

197
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.010
<v 0>My, my fear is fleeting. You know, it it's things that are, that feel,</v>

198
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.760
feel a little superficial at times. But the end of the day, like this,

199
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.880
the love thing that, the energy that, you know, you, you could make fun of me.

200
00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:27.280
I don't give a. You know, like the fact is like, we all need it.

201
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.760
You know, we all want it and we all deserve it. So what,

202
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.240
what are you gonna do with that? You know,

203
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:39.030
like we can sit here and dive sect politics and agendas

204
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.910
and this guy and this guy and socialism all this stuff,

205
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:47.150
but we all need to feel that thing. And it is love. Yeah.

206
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:52.350
And it's very, very, very powerful. Um, and it comes in many forms and,

207
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.830
and has, you know, different hats. And I think that right now,

208
00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.140
like, like I'm sure that you feel it at a show, right.

209
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.700
When you play music for people, you know, uh,

210
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.500
I'm sure you feel it all the time. &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

211
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:14.540
with your podcast and with your shows and with the outreach that you have and,

212
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.930
you know, and forgive me, I don't wanna assume, you know, and, and I feel it, I,

213
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.770
in all the varying degrees of the shows that I play and things,

214
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.010
and like at the end of the day, this stuff I like where we're at, uh,

215
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.330
is a scary place, but there's like this thing,

216
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.050
there's this like kind of one thing. And it's, it is the love thing.

217
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:38.240
And that has like a bunch of different adjectives around it and verbs that it,

218
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:42.880
or like recognizing each other. Yeah. And seeing each other and saying, Hey,

219
00:11:42.881 --> 00:11:45.600
we're different, but we're the same. And we're, we're okay. Like,

220
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.440
let's keep moving. You know, I,

221
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.360
the thing that saves me from all this like deep depths of fear

222
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.160
is that, mm, like, period,

223
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.680
there's really nothing else. I have to say, like,

224
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.360
cuz it's a weird world that we're living in, but that's the thing, that's it.

225
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.000
<v 1>It is a weird world and people can tip left our right.</v>

226
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.870
Or I that's a bad analogy. People can tip good or bad one way or another,

227
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.670
depending upon how you approach them. Sure.

228
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.750
And this is the thing that a lot of us get wrong. You run into someone,

229
00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:23.550
they're a Dick, you're a Dick back. It turns into a fight and you're like, oh,

230
00:12:23.551 --> 00:12:24.950
that guy was a Dick. Yes.

231
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.270
But sometimes when someone's a Dick and you're not a Dick,

232
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:29.190
they stop being a Dick.

233
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.910
<v 0>We literally talked about this at the beginning of the podcast. That's right.</v>

234
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.860
That's right. We did. Where like, will you diff diffuse a situation where um,

235
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.020
energy gets heated and somebody's angry or, or, you know, um,

236
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.700
I don't know if I should retell the story, but like, you know, you, uh,

237
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.460
it's accountability too. Like, you know, when you mess.

238
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.900
<v 1>Up, it' up, it's the presumptions. Right? Right.</v>

239
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.650
You go into conversations with presumptions of how this guy feels about you.

240
00:12:54.651 --> 00:12:57.330
Like this guy thinks I'm an idiot. I know. Ooh.

241
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.970
<v 0>Well it's like a winner society. It's like, you have to be right.</v>

242
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.730
But you know what? It's a, it's okay. To be wrong. I made a mistake.

243
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.863
I'm so sorry.

244
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.370
<v 1>It's not just okay to be wrong. It's a gift when you're wrong. It's a gift.</v>

245
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.410
Cuz that humility that comes with being wrong is what really helps your

246
00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:16.960
education as a person. Yes. Agree. As a, as a, a,

247
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.080
a girlfriend, a boyfriend, a lover, a father, a son,

248
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.600
you learn, when you up, you learn, you learn like, God I was wrong. Like that.

249
00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:29.800
That's a valuable lesson cuz it's a humiliating lesson. Well.

250
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.520
<v 0>And you set yourself free too, because there's a, um,</v>

251
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:37.710
there's some you're hanging on to righteousness like this. Like you know,

252
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.590
an ability to say that you were wrong. Yep. That is a burden.

253
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.070
<v 1>It's not just a burden. It's, it's a foolish pursuit.</v>

254
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.110
Like you should relish every opportunity to apologize and say you're wrong as a

255
00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:53.590
showing of strength. Yeah. Because if you think you're strong, you,

256
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.100
you think you're strong and you know you're wrong and you don't tell the truth.

257
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.260
Well then you are a fool. You're,

258
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:01.900
you're missing out on an opportunity for you to be strong.

259
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.780
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; for you to show that you're strong.

260
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.380
The show that you made a mistake, I've made a lot of mistakes.

261
00:14:06.381 --> 00:14:11.020
I make 'em all the time. I'm a dummy. All right. Like I do my best, but you,

262
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.060
but ultimately at the end of the day, there's a lot of dummy. And then,

263
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.610
and I do my best. But if I, I make a mistake, I,

264
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.410
I will own the outta that mistake.

265
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.010
If you talk to me about it and you want to have a discussion about it,

266
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.650
I'm not one of those people that I just,

267
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.610
I don't think there's any value in pretending you didn't make a mistake.

268
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:27.290
I think there's a.

269
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.450
<v 0>Real, but that's societal. But I think we're wrong with that misconception.</v>

270
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.610
<v 1>Like it's it's they don't know the people that did it didn't understand. The,</v>

271
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:33.990
the, the,

272
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:38.040
the rules that were written were written by people who really hadn't had a good

273
00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:40.760
grasp of the territory yet. They didn't really understand what they were saying.

274
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.360
They should have taught people that in school,

275
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.000
they should have taught people like that in junior high school, high school.

276
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:49.080
For sure. They should have said your, your failures,

277
00:14:49.081 --> 00:14:52.760
those feelings that you feel like they teach you about history and math and

278
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:54.360
those things are great. There's nothing wrong with that.

279
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:59.000
But they should have taught us about how your failures are a very valuable

280
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.480
fuel. Yeah. That,

281
00:15:00.481 --> 00:15:04.520
that feeling that you get when a girl dumps you or that feeling that you get

282
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:09.360
when you crash your car or that feeling that you get, when you ruin something,

283
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.430
you say something wrong. When something comes outta your mouth, when you,

284
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.790
anything you do wrong, you flunk out of a class. Yeah. Whatever the it is,

285
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.270
that negative feeling is a boost.

286
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.470
It's supposed to take you into the next orbit. Yeah.

287
00:15:22.471 --> 00:15:26.750
It's almost to blast you into the next level of understanding what you were

288
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:29.790
doing wrong and how to improve in your life and how to go forward with better

289
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.780
habits. If you don't experience that pain, that feeling that embarrassment,

290
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:39.420
then you don't really know how valuable it is to stay on your grind.

291
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.540
And people say it all the time and it resonates with people.

292
00:15:43.541 --> 00:15:46.460
You gotta stay on your grind. You're like, yes, yes. But you almost.

293
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.780
<v 0>Why do you, why do you think that it's not okay to be human?</v>

294
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.810
Like why do you think this societally speaking?

295
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:58.090
We can't just be like accountable and strong at the same time. Well.

296
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.890
<v 1>We're, we're just nervous. It's not that we don't. But like, I.</v>

297
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.170
<v 0>Mean like systemically, like that is since the beginning is that like the,</v>

298
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:09.210
the like monkey brain in us. That's like, you have to be the alpha, all that.

299
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.360
Like I've thought about this forever boggles my mind.

300
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.960
<v 1>It's just because we're worried about people that are not pulling their weight.</v>

301
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.560
When people are starving at death, it's an, an ancient, ancient instinct.

302
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.000
When there, like,

303
00:16:21.001 --> 00:16:25.120
if we barely had enough food to keep our babies alive and our friends alive and

304
00:16:25.121 --> 00:16:28.600
our parents alive, barely had enough food. And we saw someone slacking, holy,

305
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.080
did you wanna kill them? If you saw them,

306
00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:33.950
someone that was sneaking food that was taking too much food,

307
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:37.430
or you saw someone that wasn't putting in their work and you were just slightly

308
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.070
shy of being comfortable and you knew this lazy,

309
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.870
they just did their work. We would all be fine, but they don't do what we do.

310
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.471
They, they,

311
00:16:46.471 --> 00:16:49.550
they claim their foot hurt or they claim their back hurts and they go back to

312
00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:52.270
their cave and everybody wants to kill 'em that's what the that's for?

313
00:16:52.271 --> 00:16:54.900
It's a Reese horse balanced relationship. That's.

314
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.180
<v 0>Like the, um, sort of aggression against like welfare people that need it. Yes.</v>

315
00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:02.340
And people that don't people that ex that exactly. You know, exploit it.

316
00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.420
<v 1>I get it. Exactly. Exactly. Well, what's,</v>

317
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:10.420
it's attaching ultimatum or ultimate rather like this is the ultimate

318
00:17:10.421 --> 00:17:14.890
truth to any sort of circumstance in a general sense, like to pretend that, uh,

319
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.970
you have a million,

320
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.490
let's pretend you have a city of X amount of people and you have a million

321
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.570
people that are on some sort of assistance,

322
00:17:22.571 --> 00:17:25.130
whether it's food stamps or welfare or whatever, to pretend,

323
00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:28.250
they're all one thing mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is crazy to pretend.

324
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.930
It's all one story. It's crazy. Yeah. One set of circumstances.

325
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.920
One set that's nuts that it's nuts. The, the, the question should be like,

326
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.480
look, there's no billionaires that are signing up for food stamps. Right?

327
00:17:40.481 --> 00:17:43.880
There's no millionaires that are trying to get welfare for money. Right.

328
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.520
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so it's only when you're desperate.

329
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.400
So the question is like, how do we engineer society?

330
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.520
So that even the most desperate people never hit that spot,

331
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.920
never hit a spot where they need assistance.

332
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.760
The most desperate people are always taken care of,

333
00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.000
or they don't have to worry about it. And then what motivation is,

334
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.840
is just following your dreams, doing what you enjoy doing, whether it's a,

335
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.350
a thing like playing music or writing books or whatever it is,

336
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.030
whatever it is, finding that thing. But that,

337
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:16.710
that motivation for doing that thing should be above all above

338
00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.230
the idea that you have to survive by doing some job, to make a living,

339
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.350
to pay for your bills and just Rob you of your, your,

340
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.460
your time and your resources. It should be like, Hey. Face wrecking. Nice. This,

341
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:32.580
you don't have a lot of resource. Okay. All right. Let's just pretend you don't,

342
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.900
you don't need a job. We're gonna give you the money. You don't need a job,

343
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.340
but understand this. You're giving it a gift.

344
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.500
You give it a gift that Beethoven never had. Hendrix never had nobody had it.

345
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.700
You got, you got money enough to live. Now go, but understand. You got,

346
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.010
if you're lucky, you live 80 years, every ING over there. And I' like, tomorrow,

347
00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.170
every time yousne, you're worrying, you're gonna die.

348
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:54.913
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

349
00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.170
<v 1>We just have to look at the way we distribute money as being like,</v>

350
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.090
we think about it right now as being, this is the way we've always done it.

351
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:05.570
This is the way we're gonna do it. But money didn't even exist.

352
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.890
&lt;laugh&gt; this is always, that's so crazy. This is really recent.

353
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:10.960
It doesn't mean you were doing it right.
