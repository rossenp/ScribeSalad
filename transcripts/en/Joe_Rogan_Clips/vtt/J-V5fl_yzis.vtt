00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.360
<v 1>Did I ever tell you the story about, uh, my friend Phil Hartman?</v>

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.640
When he was a kid, he was, uh,

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.040
a roadie for Jimmy hendris for one night. He was like, what?

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.960
Whatever you would call it, a grip, someone who's a staff,

6
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:22.230
the stage take something on. Yeah. Yeah. Stage, state, age hand. Yeah. And, um,

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.870
he was a, he was a teenager and, uh,

8
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.870
Hendrixs is at the whiskey and he's there putting his hands on

9
00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:32.870
the speakers, making sure they don't fall over because they were kind of,

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.430
perously close to the edge and hendris is just going off playing.

11
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.950
He was just going off right in front of him. Wow. You

12
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.500
right in front of him right in front of him. And he said, dude, he goes,

13
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.660
he was feet away from me. I could have touched him. He was right. Hendrix.

14
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.660
Phil Hartman told me with great. Me and Phil Hartman got high a couple times.

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.340
&lt;laugh&gt; when, uh, we did news radio together.

16
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.210
It was one of the only couple of times that I got high during that era. Um,

17
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.970
it was, it wasn't much, he got high. He got high a lot. Matter of fact,

18
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.170
I might have not have even gotten high. I definitely got drunk. Anyway.

19
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.530
He was telling me about when he was a teenager that he worked with Jimmy

20
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.570
Hendrixs. Wow. He was a stage tech at the whiskey. Wait,

21
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.610
so how old was Phil then? He must have, when I met him,

22
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.480
I wanna say he was 46 when I met him coming off of Santa Atlanta.

23
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.720
So like nineties 94 is when I met him. Okay.

24
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.800
I don't wanna say he was like late forties. So when he was a teenager,

25
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.160
Jimmy died in late seventies. Right. He died in 1970, I think. Right? Oh,

26
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:41.640
early seventies. Yeah. Nineties straight up. So how old of Phil?

27
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.430
So when I met Phil, it was 94. That was 24 years later. Does that make sense?

28
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.350
If he was like, uh, 19 at the time or something like that? Wow. So anyway,

29
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:54.790
he's a kid and Hendrixs is right in front of him.

30
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.510
And his job is to make sure that the speaker doesn't fall into the crowd.

31
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.950
So he's standing there and he is looking up at the stage.

32
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:03.580
He standing in front of the stage and Jimmy Hendrix is right in front of him in

33
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:06.500
this prime. You know, when all, when everything is going down,

34
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.820
you couldn't believe he was real.

35
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.700
You couldn't believe he's standing right in front of you. Oh my gosh.

36
00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:13.820
Like a Hendrixs didn't exist before there was no, he there's. No, prehendrix,

37
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.220
there's just Hendrix and everything else is like,

38
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.860
like you read about Eric Clapton, like Eric,

39
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:21.940
Clapton's quotes about seeing hendris play for the very first time.

40
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.690
It's fascinating. Yeah, because you realize like,

41
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:28.770
with these top of the food chain guitarists go to see Hendrix and they go,

42
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.170
what the are we doing? What are we doing? What is he doing?

43
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.290
What the is happening here? Yeah. And then Phil said he,

44
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:39.570
it was happening right in front of him. Phil, you know,

45
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:43.210
would dabbling music for fun. He really enjoyed like playing guitar in around.

46
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.960
So for him to be a kid and to be standing right in front of Hendrixs performing

47
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:51.160
was like, whoa, that's a new one. Right. Dog.

48
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:54.840
Whistle's only been around for like two years people calling something, uh,

49
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.680
transphobic or homophobic. Yeah. Or sexist dog whistle.

50
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.080
Like mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; holy. Like you can't say anything.

51
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.720
<v 2>Anymore. Well, let's go back to the basics. Um, yeah.</v>

52
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.800
I was on the internet very early, 1987 before the worldwide web.

53
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.640
And um, you may remember we had something called Usenet groups. Yes.

54
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.120
And the Usenet groups and the way it used to work, because, you know,

55
00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:17.280
we didn't really have a widely spread internet back then,

56
00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:21.110
except in universities. I was on MTV. And when I saw the in I'm like, holy.

57
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.830
I'm emailing with kid, my audience who were not counted in the ratings,

58
00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:26.271
by the way,

59
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:29.510
college audience don't count in the Nielsen ratings or at least didn't at the

60
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:33.310
time. And they want something very different from what MTV is playing.

61
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.830
So I was like, wow, this is interesting.

62
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.260
So I got into these use net groups and the way that worked is you'd post thing.

63
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.140
And then overnight, it would be copied all around the internet.

64
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.300
And you had to connect to a special server and you pulled in the groups that you

65
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:48.020
had subscribed to. And so really it was kind of a,

66
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.980
it wasn't an immediate conversation,

67
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.940
but we'd post something and then people would reply back.

68
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.340
And I just kind of jumped in two feet and, and immediately you,

69
00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:02.610
commercial MTV. What are you doing here? off that. You don't,

70
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:04.010
you're not supposed to quote like that.

71
00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:06.970
You're supposed to quote at the bottom and the top. And I was like, whoa,

72
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:07.810
what's going on?

73
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.250
And what that was is the minute you have the opportunity for people to say stuff

74
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.170
anonymously, they turn into giant Dick bags, almost everybody.

75
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.320
This is just an easier a way to do it. Yeah. Now we've made it so easy.

76
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.160
And with all the little, the, you know, the, uh, the, the,

77
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.600
the blips and the blooms and the rewards that you feel when something is posted

78
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.520
or someone, you know, goes against you. And it's like the, and again,

79
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.440
I think a amygdalas have swollen because of this. So then you get this, this,

80
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.070
you respond differently to what you think, an attack and the attack reg,

81
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.470
and you know, this mm. Registers in your brain as,

82
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.390
as something really dangerous. I'm BA I'm gonna go back at 'em,

83
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.670
but they're anonymous. And that's the, that's the best thing.

84
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.590
Then the blue check mark became a little more interesting, um,

85
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.190
which I don't have. And, uh, I tried to get one for a long time.

86
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.830
Someone over there hates me and now really? Oh yeah. They wouldn't. No,

87
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.700
that's what it is. They hate you. So they, what else could it be?

88
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.980
I've never gotten a blue check mark. I don't want one. Now, now to me,

89
00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:10.100
it's the mark of the beast. &lt;laugh&gt; you got a blue check mark. You know,

90
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.100
I'd be looking over my shoulder, man. I was like, eh,

91
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.660
so now that's become kind of those to UN those are the people that now risk

92
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.810
being deplatform because you have status, right. Her,

93
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:24.770
it's fun to bang against these people. Like the, this guy,

94
00:05:24.771 --> 00:05:29.130
I'm gonna bang against him. Mm. So it's some human nature that is,

95
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:33.370
that just exists within us. Um, like, you know,

96
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:35.930
it would be really easier for me to go online, you know,

97
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.250
under whatever Twitter handle that Joe Rogan you, Dick.

98
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.320
I wouldn't say that to your face. Look at you, you know, beat me the up. So no,

99
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.980
both.

100
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.880
<v 3>My parents converted from Judaism to Catholicism before they met each other.</v>

101
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.120
Whoa. Yeah, it was, it was very unusual. How did that happen? Uh,

102
00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:55.560
it's a long story. I'll tell you if you really wanna know, but anyway, I'll,

103
00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:59.520
I'll, I'll do the short that's what I'm getting to. And this was during the,

104
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.800
during the second world war, they were both in New York, both first generation,

105
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.360
uh, American Jews. That makes sense.

106
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.560
They converted for different reasons from each other.

107
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.640
And then they met my father's family was Orthodox. Um,

108
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.440
and his father, a guy named shepsel Dubner, uh,

109
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.790
would come here when he was in his, maybe late twenties from Poland.

110
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:22.550
He still lived his every day in Brooklyn as if he were still in Poland.

111
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:23.384
He didn't change at all.

112
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.630
When my father converted and his father found out my father

113
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.310
was in the war, he was overseas.

114
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.110
He was home on leave and his father was cleaning up.

115
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.860
And from my father, his pants that he'd left over a chair, uh, rosary beads,

116
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:41.140
slipped out and fell on the floor.

117
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.460
That's how his Jewish father Shepzel Dubner found out that his son had become a

118
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.580
Catholic. Whoa. So what he did is he proceeded to, uh,

119
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.140
sit shva for him. The Jewish mourning ritual were for seven days,

120
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.220
you mourn the dead. He,

121
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.450
he declared that he would no ever again speak to his son.

122
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.050
And he forbade everyone in his family from speaking to his son.

123
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.090
So I, by the time I was born,

124
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.490
I was the youngest of eight kids in this family because they'd become very

125
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.530
Catholic.

126
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.290
I didn't know this whole family of my father's was unknown to me

127
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:19.720
entirely. So they did exactly. You're saying now. Holy.

128
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.360
Yeah. Yeah. That was what I thought too, when I, holy.

129
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.960
&lt;laugh&gt; mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and my mother's did the same thing,

130
00:07:27.961 --> 00:07:31.600
but it was less dramatic cuz her family was less religious.

131
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.240
So they still didn't like at all that she had converted. Um, but uh,

132
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.270
do you have any children? Uh, yeah, I got a couple I'm Jewish again though.

133
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.750
I it's a long, so my first,

134
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.470
the first book I wrote long before freakomics was called turbulent souls.

135
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.350
Although it got then republished under a different title called choosing my

136
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.070
religion and it tells this, this story of my, uh, my two parents. Me. Yeah.

137
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:53.910
I uh, so I would love.

138
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.151
<v 1>To hear that,</v>

139
00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:57.710
but I just want to put in your head that what I was gonna ask you is like,

140
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.990
how could you,

141
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.140
you imagine a scenario where you would be capable of doing that to your

142
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.133
children?

143
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.660
<v 3>So, uh, no chance, no chance, no chance,</v>

144
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.940
but it's so scary. Yeah, it's scary. It, it is. But on the other hand, I mean,

145
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:13.774
this is, um,

146
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.180
what freakomics is what I try to learn through doing freakomics is,

147
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.073
you know,

148
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.930
to measure the what and try to figure out the why,

149
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.530
but then not be the judge who says that was terrible.

150
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.570
This is wonderful because you know, different people have, look,

151
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.810
if shepsel Dubner were here, we could ask him what's your side of the story.

152
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.400
He could tell us a story that might convince us that, you know what,

153
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.920
this son of his did a terrible thing to the family. He did a terrible thing.

154
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.600
You know, he would say,

155
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:52.000
how could it be that we Jews existed for generations and generations and

156
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:56.160
generations. When everywhere we lived, there was always someone trying to,

157
00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.240
you know, get rid of us. And then we finally come to America, you know,

158
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.800
the land of freedom, religious freedom, economic freedom,

159
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.640
and here after generations and generations of forefathers fought to stay Jewish

160
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.240
here, my son decides to become Catholic. What are you thinking? So, you know,

161
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:14.040
everybody's, everybody's got a perspective,

162
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:17.590
everybody's got an emotional experience. So I try to respect that. But no,

163
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.870
I would not do that to my children that.

164
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.190
<v 4>They're pull, what are they pulling it back with fishing wire to keep it up,</v>

165
00:09:22.191 --> 00:09:23.630
up on his head. It just seems.

166
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.630
<v 1>He seems oddly stiff. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.</v>

167
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.390
Like it seems like everything's pulled, like there's not a,

168
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.100
I expect a certain amount of laxity in a man's face when he reaches a certain

169
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.300
age, particularly around the forehead area. &lt;laugh&gt;

170
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.060
I'm just not seeing it. I'm not seeing any movement either.

171
00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:47.580
Which makes me wonder about that. Like I wanna see expressions in your forehead.

172
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.420
<v 4>My worry is his lack. He has a very big his,</v>

173
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.730
he lacks the ability to have like a cohesive story. Yeah.

174
00:09:55.731 --> 00:09:57.090
Like he's not good at being like,

175
00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:00.010
like have you ever seen him talking to the kids by the pool? It's the weirdest,

176
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.850
I'm talking about his hairy legs. What the?

177
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.410
He's like to a bunch of little black kids he's like,

178
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:07.890
and the black kids would come up and they'd see my hair go up and bubbles.

179
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.730
<v 1>Come up and they touch my hairy legs. &lt;laugh&gt; what.</v>

180
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.610
<v 4>The. I just think his brain is, he's losing a lot of,</v>

181
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.800
I tweeted something this morning, cuz there was someone put up a video of, uh,

182
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.640
of models on a runway,

183
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.240
on a catwalk and they're all tripping and falling at the same spot.

184
00:10:22.241 --> 00:10:25.640
These dumb shoes they're wearing. And I was like, this is Biden's brain cells.

185
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.150
It's like,

186
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.760
they think they're on the right path and that they get to the spot and then they

187
00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:29.920
just can't, did.

188
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.120
<v 1>You see the thing that he was talking about? God creating women or no. And, and,</v>

189
00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.990
and then he called his wife, his sister, you know the, you know,

190
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.350
I forget what it was. I forget what the gaff was,

191
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.470
but it was one of those we listened to him like what you're,

192
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.550
what are you saying? Like it's, it's like he has no breaks. Right?

193
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:50.790
Like his car is going down the hill, like, ah, geez. I had a tree.

194
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:51.624
He's like hit the wall.

195
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.150
it is can't remember the word creator refers to God as the thing &lt;laugh&gt;.

196
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.500
<v 4>Hey, actually I like that more. That'ss funny. No, you.</v>

197
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.500
<v 1>Know what? I think I have a different take take on it. Let's play it.</v>

198
00:11:02.501 --> 00:11:05.140
Cause I want, I want, I have a different take on it. Cuz when I listened to it,

199
00:11:05.141 --> 00:11:07.340
I said, oh I know what he's doing, which is one. Do you think it is his first?

200
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.580
The bottom one? The second one? Yeah. He doesn't want to here. Let's wait.

201
00:11:10.581 --> 00:11:11.260
We know these truth.

202
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.900
<v 5>To be selfevent all men and women are created by the go. You know the,</v>

203
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.793
you know the things.

204
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:22.050
<v 1>Stop, pause. You can't be president. What? Stop, pause, pause.</v>

205
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.250
Listen, we can't play any games here, folks.

206
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.170
This is a really old man who can't talk like this is not a joke

207
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.890
like that right now. Yeah. You know the thing, play that again. Play that again.

208
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.730
This should get you into a mental hospital. Right? They should be like, Hey, um,

209
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:37.983
Joe, you are right.

210
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.160
<v 5>We hold these truth to be selfevident all men and women created by go,</v>

211
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.680
you know the, you know, the, he.

212
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.720
<v 1>Had three strokes while he was saying that Jesus, the first one,</v>

213
00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:51.360
what was that word? Selfevident is that what he hold.

214
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.080
<v 4>These truth to be selfevent but it didn't even sound right.</v>

215
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.720
<v 1>He hear it again. Listen't do it.</v>

216
00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.760
&lt;laugh&gt; we owe these truth to be selfevent self evidentevidence.

217
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.880
Selfevent he's drunk that dude's either drunk or he can't talk. We,

218
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.080
we are just truths to be allevent he shouldn't be doing this anymoreeverent.

219
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.360
<v 4>And then he says, when he goes, he could have just said,</v>

220
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.510
all men and women are created and he could have just said equal and gotten out

221
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:15.750
of there and been like, it B instead he goes.

222
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.190
<v 1>You the thing by the, we,</v>

223
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.510
I think he didn't wanna say the creator because there's a lot of people,

224
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.150
the religious thing. Yeah. There's lot of people that would say, well,

225
00:12:24.151 --> 00:12:24.850
what are you trying to say?

226
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.230
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; do you believe in evolution or nothmm are you a science

227
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.710
denier? Joe Biden. Joe, Biden's a science denier.

228
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:40.660
<v 6>I.</v>
