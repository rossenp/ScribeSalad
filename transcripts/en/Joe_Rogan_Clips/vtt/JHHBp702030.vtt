00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.910
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I have a question about MMA for you. Okay. Why do we.</v>

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.920
<v 1>Keep hearing about the underpaying stuff?</v>

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.540
<v 2>Well, right now in particular, um,</v>

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.550
there's probably less money because the fighters have to, um,

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.010
they there's no gate, there's no live gate. Yeah.

6
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:21.560
There's no live gate and that's an extreme amount of money,

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.340
but there's also fighters that agreed to certain deals.

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.180
They agreed to like an eight fight deal at X amount per fight,

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.990
and then they become more popular and then they want to renegotiate their deal.

10
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.170
And the UFC is like, look, we're just trying to stay open. Yep.

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.610
We're not going to renegotiate anything. So they're like,

12
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.180
take it or you can leave it, but this is what it is. Yeah.

13
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.920
I think it's a matter of that.

14
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.680
But looking at it from the fighter's perspective fighters would be certainly

15
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.400
better off if there was more competition, that's always how it works.

16
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.110
So whether it's Bella tour or one FC or all these different companies,

17
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.610
the more of those,

18
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.870
there are the more world series of fighting the moral professional fighting

19
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:05.840
league, whatever the it's called. Now, the more of those rise,

20
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.950
the better it is for everyone. It's just how it is. It's like,

21
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:13.400
if there's only improv's and then you get banned from the improv's, you're.

22
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.650
But if you got funny bones, yes, yes. It's exactly like that.

23
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.550
You know,

24
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.880
I've seen that happen before with people I've seen that happen with comedy

25
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:24.710
clubs, and I've seen that happen with fighting too.

26
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.660
You get banned from a big organization and then you're, man. Nobody's like,

27
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.380
it's not a monopoly in that. You do have choice. You do have choices,

28
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.080
but there's one clear top of the food chain choice,

29
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.000
but it's because they do it the best.

30
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.380
They're also the only ones that are having fights during this quarantine.

31
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.940
The only people that are putting on any live sporting events,

32
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.460
but they're also a part of a company in WME that's hurting and

33
00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:51.350
needs it really bad.

34
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.430
So there's not a lot of money to throw around like that,

35
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.310
to keep the doors open, to keep people employed.

36
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.110
A lot of money is, is, is missing. Right?

37
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.580
All these shows got canceled. There's all these, uh,

38
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.240
audience members that are going to be there buying tickets. And so it's tricky,

39
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:15.260
man. So this is why I think they're complaining about fighter pay.

40
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.340
I think they should get paid more. I think everybody should get paid more.

41
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.260
I'm thinking it's a crazy way to make a living.

42
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.350
I think you should get the most amount of money you can possibly get,

43
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.120
but it's also a business.

44
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.620
And I think that if they are struggling as much as I think they are,

45
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.600
I don't talk finances with them, but I know that WME people own it. Yeah.

46
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.690
They're hurt. Yeah. Bad. They're laying people off. Yep.

47
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.370
Most businesses are hurting. It's in all the entertainment.

48
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.330
Business is live. Nation's. Right? All these people are. Yeah. Big time.

49
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.350
So what do they do? That's what I think. But yeah. You know,

50
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.470
when it comes to me as a, as a human that likes fighting,

51
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.230
I know how dangerous that is.

52
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:02.140
You should get paid an incredibly generous amount of money to step into a

53
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:04.320
cage fight for millions of people. Yeah.

54
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.710
<v 1>Yeah. It is interesting because you have, um,</v>

55
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.110
you have this situation where like the quality of the fights

56
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.060
is undeniably better because it's not in the free market.

57
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.320
You have people that are really good at picking out fights.

58
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.110
And for the most part, I say this as a boxing fan, right.

59
00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:28.860
So I grew up in boxing where there are tons of different divisions or tons of

60
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.790
some companies. If you all WBC, WBL, all these different promoters.

61
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.730
And sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. Right. But like it's a mess.

62
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.820
And then sometimes what happens is you have guys who are like really boring

63
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:39.654
fighters,

64
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.890
but they get a position where they have the belt and then it actually hurts the

65
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:47.790
sport in a way, but they earned it and they deserve it. So as like a sportsman,

66
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.910
I'm like, they deserve to have it. Like a lot of people.

67
00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:51.930
I love Floyd Mayweather.

68
00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.960
I think he's the best fighter in the history of fighting. Right.

69
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.860
I think he's actually one of the greatest people at their job ever.

70
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.130
Like I think he's Michael Jordan of boxing is one of.

71
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.290
<v 2>The, without a doubt, one of the greatest boxers,</v>

72
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:07.770
if not the greatest boxer that has ever lived, he's unbelief DNO.

73
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.160
<v 1>For average people fought for me. I loved it.</v>

74
00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:14.250
But for an extra thought it was boring. So he needed the antics. Yeah.

75
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.560
<v 2>He needed to get people angry at him yet.</v>

76
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.940
<v 1>They get me. Right. And it works.</v>

77
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.310
But the thing is with the UFC is I'll watch guys.

78
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.760
I don't know and I'll enjoy it.

79
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.720
And I feel like, I don't know if that's just because of the sport,

80
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:31.290
but also because of the way that they're matching the fighters and it's not

81
00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:33.600
specifically, Hey, you're ranked here or you're ranked here.

82
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:36.900
We have to match you. Part of it is you're right here. You're right here.

83
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.380
But also.

84
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.430
<v 3>Your styles would make something interesting. So I wonder if it's correct no.</v>

85
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.390
<v 1>Better to not be completely free market. Do you?</v>

86
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.570
It's better to have the fights for the quality of the.

87
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.400
<v 2>Sport. If you're a fan, it's certainly better for you, right?</v>

88
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.320
If the fighters get,

89
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.050
if they all get together in one organization and then that organization makes

90
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:02.250
them fight each other, that way,

91
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:05.910
there's not as many dream match-ups you never get to see. Right.

92
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.090
Like one of the things that everybody got upset was by the time Floyd fought

93
00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:09.930
Manny Pacquiao,

94
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.590
it was like past man he's prime and Manny had a bum shoulder and all these

95
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:16.740
different things we would have liked to see that fight five years earlier.

96
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.813
And the UFC.

97
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.150
<v 3>Def gets made easily. Yeah. It gets made, but.</v>

98
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.060
<v 2>It gets to a situation where a guy like John Jones says, Hey,</v>

99
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:28.050
I've got a contract for light heavyweight fights, but you know,

100
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.210
what do you want to give me a fight? Francis and Ghana,

101
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.320
because I want a lot of money because that guy's terrifying. Yeah. And they say,

102
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:36.990
well, you get what you're paid in your contract. That's what you get.

103
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.350
And he's like, well, I'm not fighting then. And they go, okay.

104
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.360
It is interesting. See,

105
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:44.790
that's one of those situations where I don't know who's right or who's wrong

106
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:46.860
because I don't know how much money they would make for that.

107
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.490
If there's no audience, let's say the Frances and gyno fights a big fight.

108
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.780
And it gets like 500,000 pay-per-views 600, 700,000.

109
00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:58.370
Pay-per-views that's a lot of pay-per-views. Yep. Um, alive gate.

110
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.520
How much in the hole are they? How much money?

111
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.940
How much money in the hole are they right? How much,

112
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.330
how hard is it to make money right now? How much can you afford?

113
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.730
How much did they make? I don't know. These answers.

114
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.080
How much do they make for a pay-per-view where 700,000 buys a million buys.

115
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:19.580
How much do they make? How much what's the overhead? I mean, I.

116
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.280
<v 1>Don't know. It's less, but it's not. I mean,</v>

117
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.360
it has to be less because you're not.

118
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.450
<v 3>Maintaining these venues of venue is so much smaller.</v>

119
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:28.930
You have to pay way less people. That being said, the ticket prices,

120
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:33.310
like the live gate we'll have gates, big 20,000 people, 18,000 people,

121
00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:35.350
all spending on average, $150 a ticket.

122
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.310
<v 2>And on top of that, there's merged. There's all sorts of is, you know,</v>

123
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:42.970
I'm sure they probably get some sort of a food ISA, all that stuff. Yeah.

124
00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:46.510
So there's a lot of money. And then there's also, they had to operate.

125
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.820
They didn't fire anybody. It's one thing about the UFC.

126
00:06:48.821 --> 00:06:50.140
They would not fire people.

127
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.820
So they stayed open wouldn't wouldn't fire anybody while they were going on for

128
00:06:54.821 --> 00:06:56.110
months, just paying people,

129
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.170
trying to figure out how to put this together and make fights happen.

130
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.400
They tried to do that one at the Indian place. Uh Tachi palace in Lamar,

131
00:07:03.401 --> 00:07:05.410
California. They are real close to doing that.

132
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.270
But then the governor got ahold of the head of Disney and eyes during the call,

133
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.660
Dana white. And they told the pull out, pull out. Okay.

134
00:07:13.661 --> 00:07:17.380
So they back out of that. And then two weeks later Florida's like, come on in.

135
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.110
So then we do one in Florida with no audience.

136
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.880
And then finally they're allowing us to do them at the apex center in Vegas.

137
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.530
And I think right now it's a triage right down there trying to stop the bleeding

138
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.100
and the [inaudible] like WME and the UFC,

139
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.780
the UFC is operating with full costs for months without

140
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.470
any money coming in at all. So you have to think that, yeah, that's.

141
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.450
<v 3>Right. Yeah. It's like WME,</v>

142
00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:46.630
I think P paid 4 billion or something for them or so they, a little more.

143
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.820
<v 2>Than that. So they have this giant monthly nut.</v>

144
00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:51.340
They have to have to cover cover every month. People,

145
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:52.990
I guess don't realize is like an agency.

146
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.510
<v 3>Makes money off of the commission of their clients.</v>

147
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.780
And if their clients can't work because of Corona,

148
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.860
the agency has no revenue coming in. None. Zero there's no TV show.

149
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.580
I guess there's some TV shows getting made, but like still they're not,

150
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.850
they're not doing production on like films or anything like that. Yeah, no,

151
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:12.550
it is interesting.

152
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.380
<v 2>Well are starting to do a films next week. They are.</v>

153
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.360
<v 3>It's coming back. What was your thoughts on you?</v>

154
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:23.380
Get sick and then you're liable. That's the tricky.

155
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.930
<v 1>Thing. It's like, they don't want it. God forbid.</v>

156
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:30.550
<v 3>Somebody ends up one of these, like an NBA coaches. Who's old, God forbid,</v>

157
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:35.050
Greg Popovich, who's 70. Oh yeah. Gets Corona death.

158
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.170
It is. And now you want to be the NBA commissioner.

159
00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:39.070
They're killed Gregg Popovich.

160
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.830
<v 2>Oh my God. Or be, um,</v>

161
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.280
a UFC promoter that you a fighter gets sick,

162
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.640
goes home and kills his mom and works with him. You know,

163
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.550
maybe your mom helps cook for you. Your mom gets sick.

164
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.060
Maybe mom's helping you in camp. Your mom gets sick,

165
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.780
dies from Corona because they had the fights.

166
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.050
I don't think that's going to happen.

167
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.860
I think particularly now when you're hearing these reports of the cases

168
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:05.950
diminishing the,

169
00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:10.140
the viral load that they're finding like in Italy is so small,

170
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.330
it's barely detectable. You know, the, the hope is that, same happens here.

171
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:16.080
As it gets hot out.
