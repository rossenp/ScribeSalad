00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.140
<v 2>Chris Rocca is so big for awhile that I think people stop paying the respect.</v>

3
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:09.540
He deserved a hundred percent and I,

4
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:14.160
and when he got COVID I realized how, just how important Chris rock was to me.

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.110
Like, I'd like just, you know,

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.070
cause I think Norman just passed and I was at the biggest norm fan in the world.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.900
And then Chris rock got sick and I did like a deep dive on my own head of like,

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.570
just how great that guy.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.430
<v 1>Well, if you go back to like bigger and blacker or you go back to.</v>

10
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.170
<v 0>The pain, the.</v>

11
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.180
<v 1>Pain, the pain, those are two of the best specials of all time.</v>

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.740
Like if you want to look at your top 10 comedians of all time, in my opinion,

13
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.090
you have to have Chris rocker there.

14
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.850
<v 0>Without a doubt, without a doubt. There's no questions. Call is the.</v>

15
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.683
<v 1>Dark horse.</v>

16
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.820
<v 0>Hold on, give me a second. Now I have a lot of dark horses,</v>

17
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.690
but I don't know.

18
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.070
<v 1>Martin Lawrence, Martin Lawrence in the 1990s. So people forgot.</v>

19
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.390
You must be crazy, dude. Oh, you so crazy. Rather you so crazy.

20
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:03.390
And he had like a couple of other specials that were on that same level.

21
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.890
He had like two or three specialists that were like lightning bolts.

22
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.280
And it's hard because you got to compare them for the time.

23
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.440
Like comedies comedy is a weird thing, man.

24
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.760
Like even like comedy movies from the eighties or nineties that you thought were

25
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.720
the. Some of them just don't hold up for whatever reason and standup comedy.

26
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:25.770
A lot of it just seems different because the culture so different cause the

27
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.610
world. So like everything's evolving and changing so fast. It's hard,

28
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.010
but there's a few guys from the 1990s that would

29
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:37.170
just obliterate,

30
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:40.020
like you forgot how good comics can be.

31
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:44.250
And I remember I saw Martin Lawrence at the comedy store many times,

32
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.650
like seven,

33
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.900
10 times when he was in his prime somewhere around then I remember he would

34
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:55.710
come by and just sell out the main room and he would just sit there and watch

35
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:57.840
him murder. I mean,

36
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:01.560
murder people falling out of the chairs.

37
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.600
I mean screaming in agony because they're laughing so hard and it was,

38
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.400
you know, this was 1994. Martin Lawrence was the king dude.

39
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.234
I'm telling you.

40
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.990
<v 0>The thing, the thing that Chris rock brought, uh, once again, um.</v>

41
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.930
<v 1>Um, but hold on, let me tell you something, before we go any further.</v>

42
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.150
One of the things that happened to Chris rock was he had a follow Martin

43
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.450
Lawrence at the store. No, no.

44
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:31.320
They did a show together and Chris rock talked about it and talked about it.

45
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:35.850
How forced him to tighten up his act because he had a follow Martin Lawrence and

46
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:38.880
he realized it, no disrespect intended white people.

47
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.570
He realized that he said that he'd been playing it too many white rooms.

48
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.880
And he realized like he had,

49
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.380
he had gotten like a little bit lazy or maybe a little slower than he should be

50
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.101
whatever he had, uh,

51
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:54.570
developed a style that maybe wasn't he saw Martin crush and then he had a hard

52
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:55.404
time after.

53
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.950
And then after that you get some of the greatest Chris rock performances of all

54
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.280
time. After that, you get, bring the pain after that,

55
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:06.850
you get bigger and blacker after that you get some of the greatest bits ever.

56
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.680
So he, he, he saw like we all like every time you've bombed.

57
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.330
How many times do you hear it goes right here.

58
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.630
He goes up one night in Chicago as usual. I was the headliner.

59
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.950
And on this night,

60
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:21.610
my opening act was an up and coming comic named Martin Lawrence. Now,

61
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:25.060
normally I never used to watch the opening acts,

62
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.070
but I was in my dressing room and I heard a roar.

63
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.000
I got up to see what was going on. I thought it was a fight or something.

64
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.540
So I got up and went to the side of the stage. When I got there,

65
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.980
I realized it wasn't a fight.

66
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.370
It was people laughing so hard that the building was shaking.

67
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.630
People were crying, standing stomping, their feet screaming.

68
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.610
Laughter I was terrified.

69
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.750
It was like watching somebody your wife with a bigger Dick.

70
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.110
That's how good Martin Lawrence was.

71
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.520
I followed Martin Lawrence almost every time I worked on a night with Martin

72
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:59.710
Lawrence Mitzi always made me follow Martin Lawrence.

73
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.930
I never bombed harder in my life with three quarters of the artist is walking

74
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.240
out as you're going on stage. I mean three quarters.

75
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.750
That's how good Martin Lawrence was in the 1990s. I'm telling you, dude,

76
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.280
I'm telling you I would watch him. And I was like, this guy is like,

77
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:19.810
he's hitting some crazy RPMs. You know, if you ever like a sports car,

78
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.080
like 8,000 games is crazy. Some of them go to nine. Someone's like,

79
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.820
[inaudible] like, how long can you go at that RPM?

80
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.200
Like Martin Lawrence was on this wild RPM where he was,

81
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:36.790
he was crushing so hard,

82
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.430
but then he had a bunch of issues and then he had his show.

83
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.640
He had a show Martin and then he had a bunch of issues. You know, he had like,

84
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.640
like a, like a breakdown. Right? Remember that, but too.

85
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.810
But I think a lot of that. No, no, no, no. I mean maybe I don't,

86
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.680
I don't think about that, but I know he had no, no, no, no, no, no.

87
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:58.120
I think he had like some sort of a manic attack and he got arrested for wearing

88
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.800
like a sweatsuit. No, no. It was like a wet Sumo. He fell a stroke,

89
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.940
heat exhaustion from heat exhaustion or preparing for big mama's house.

90
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.450
So he was losing weight. Is that what he was doing with the wetsuit on?

91
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.440
I had to go on a ventilator, Jesus Christ. But then they think that he had some,

92
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.353
an episode

93
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.980
I make what's body temperature up to 107 degrees.

94
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:24.160
So something that could have caused, I mean like a mental episode.

95
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.770
I mean that made him think that that was a good idea to do.

96
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:29.740
Maybe I think it was judge edit this.

97
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.110
<v 0>Too much. Editing my thing with Martin Lawrence is,</v>

98
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.390
and is that more Lawrence seemed like someone, it was a God gift to him.

99
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:42.820
Right? Like the, the guy he was sent at a.

100
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.610
<v 1>Super duper talented, but he also worked really hard, man.</v>

101
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.760
<v 0>But that's the thing with a guy like Martin Lawrence or Jay Z.</v>

102
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.880
It doesn't seem like they work hard to see Richard Pryor seems like,

103
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.990
or Eddie Griffin, it seems like a justice. What they do, you know, it's that.

104
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.570
<v 1>Too, you know, there's a lot of those, just what they do,</v>

105
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:03.620
guys that never get to that level. Like what separates a guy like that?

106
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.640
You know, from a guy who's just a funny dude that we all know.

107
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.470
<v 0>That we hang around with at the store.</v>

108
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.720
There's always a guy who's just like really good.

109
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.980
And they go on stage and they're really good,

110
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:16.580
but they never figured out how to like get to a place like those guys.

111
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.930
Like what's the difference? The difference for me. I mean, I, I know for a fact,

112
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.000
my difference is when I saw Chris Rockton,

113
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.380
he talked about how you train for a special, I was like, oh yeah, that's.

114
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.070
<v 1>Oh, he would bring in comics and pay them to watch his set and give them notes.</v>

115
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.120
Like he was, he was working in collaboration with other people where he's like,

116
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.930
he had like a group of peers and he would throw his ideas at them and say,

117
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.500
you know, like,

118
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.520
what do you think about DePaulo made some brilliant DePaulo rich Voss,

119
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.490
Jay Richard, Jenny was a big war, was a thing that happened.

120
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.670
Oh it says Lawrence rented traffic in Los Angeles,

121
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:54.230
screaming and acting like a mad man. That's what I remember. According to. Yes,

122
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:55.064
that's right.

123
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.330
Big mama's house asked her also had a loaded firearm in his possession.

124
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.930
Lawrence was removed from the scene by law enforcement and hospitalized.

125
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:06.980
Martin was yelling a fight, you know, don't give up,

126
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.080
fight the power or something like that.

127
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:12.020
A witness told a witness told K cow,

128
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.650
he was shouting some obscenities or something. Maybe he's just doing his Zack.

129
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.360
Maybe he's working on a bit. Yeah.

130
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.400
<v 0>I'm a Martin Lawrence fan.</v>

131
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.190
<v 1>Up and down. Listen, dude, I'm telling you I am too.</v>

132
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:24.500
But I just think it's hard to be that good.

133
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.400
I think there's something about being that good as a guitarist or something to

134
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:32.990
be about good as a test player or what a bike ride or whatever the you are.

135
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.800
I was, I was just talking to a friend of mine about a, uh,

136
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.590
tour de France and about, uh, Lance Armstrong,

137
00:07:39.591 --> 00:07:42.320
like how crazy you have to be to be that good. Like,

138
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.770
[inaudible] be that good against other people who are just like you. Like,

139
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.330
you have to be so driven that you're better than all these other

140
00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:51.590
insanely driven.

141
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.780
Like you're dealing with like insane RPMs insane,
