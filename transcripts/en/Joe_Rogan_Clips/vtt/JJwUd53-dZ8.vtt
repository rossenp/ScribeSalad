00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. The idea that there's an,</v>

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.360
an enormous number of you making various choices. Yeah.

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.160
And that these various choices will ultimately affect how long you exist.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.120
<v 1>In some branches. So there is a weird thing called quantum imortality,</v>

5
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.630
which I think is a bad idea. And I don't like to talk about it,

6
00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:25.990
but people hear about it. So I sometimes need to mention it max tagmark,

7
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:29.710
who is a friend of mine and very smart guy popularized this idea. He said, look,

8
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.950
what, and it's a little bit, MCAB sorry about this a little bit, uh, you know,

9
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:35.950
weird the experiment, but imagine you're doing,

10
00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:39.670
you're playing quantum Russian ruleette so you have your universe.

11
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:42.940
Splittter okay. You have app on your iPhone and you split the universe.

12
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.420
And if it goes one way, you don't do anything. If it goes the other way, uh,

13
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:52.260
faster than you can react, a machine is activated. That kills you instantly.

14
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.820
Okay. So you, you don't even know it. You don't even perceive it.

15
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:58.420
You don't have any pain, you just instantly dead. Um,

16
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:00.580
and you do this over and over and over and over and over again.

17
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.410
So in most branches of the way you function, you're dead.

18
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.610
But in those you're dead, you don't know anything. You don't,

19
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:10.970
you don't feel like you're dead. You know, there's no ex regret after the fact,

20
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.370
the only version of you that survives is the one that was lucky enough to be in

21
00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:17.570
the branch where you didn't die every single time.

22
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.810
So techmark's argument was that the, if you do this over and over again,

23
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:22.840
and you survive,

24
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.440
you should take that as good evidence that the many world's interpretation of

25
00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:27.440
quantum mechanics is correct.

26
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.720
&lt;laugh&gt; because in other versions you probably just died. Right? Um,

27
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.480
I don't think that's quite right.

28
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.200
I don't think that's a good way to go through your life.

29
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.560
I think that the reason why we don't want to die is not just that we will

30
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.240
experience pain, but that sort of

31
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.230
prospectively right now, the idea of being dead in the future bothers me. Right?

32
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.390
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, I, if someone said, you know,

33
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.790
you're going to die in this, in that date might be useful information,

34
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:55.910
but I'd be sad, right? If that date was soon.

35
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.950
And I think the same thing is true in the quantum mortality experiment. I,

36
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.060
I don't buy the move that says, well, all the branches where you're dead,

37
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:06.180
it doesn't matter. Cuz you're dead. You don't feel anything.

38
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:10.100
Like I think that right now it's okay for me to be bothered by the prospect that

39
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:13.340
in many future worlds I will not be there. So I, you know,

40
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:14.900
I think that at the end of the day, once again,

41
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.900
you should act in quantum mechanics, just like you act in the regular world.

42
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.220
<v 0>Are there competing theories to this,</v>

43
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.690
that this many world's theory that you've embraced and then discarded? Yeah.

44
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.290
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. There abso there's two big ones that are, that are quite popular.</v>

45
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.530
Um, one is more or less what Einstein had in mind,

46
00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:37.170
which are called hidden variable theories. So basically, you know, if you have,

47
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.210
uh, an electron and you say, look, when I'm not looking at it,

48
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.680
it's wave-like when I look at it, it's like, particle-like, maybe it's both.

49
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.560
Maybe there is a wave and there is a particle. So in a hidden variable theory,

50
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:51.480
there's a wave function just like there is in many worlds,

51
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.400
but there's also another set of variables saying there's really a location of

52
00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:57.680
the electron, right? Maybe I don't know where it is,

53
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.800
but there really is an electron located somewhere.

54
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.520
And that location of the electron is pushed around by the wave function,

55
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.320
but it's a whole new part of reality.

56
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.720
So there's not so that there's separate branching of the wave function and all

57
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:13.440
that stuff. But that none of that is reality where reality is,

58
00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:14.440
is where the particles are.

59
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.790
And this is now called bomian mechanics at bone in the 1950s

60
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:23.310
developed the most, uh, respectable version of this. Um,

61
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.070
it's sort of therapeutic if you don't like all the other worlds, it's basically,

62
00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:29.271
you know,

63
00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:32.590
the equations are the same as many worlds except there's new equations and new

64
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:36.310
stuff. So it complicates the theory by adding new variables. Uh,

65
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:39.540
but the good news is it says only one of the branches of the way for function is

66
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:43.820
real. I don't need to worry about the other ones. The problem is it's very hard.

67
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.260
My, my particular problem is it's very hard to reconcile these ideas with modern

68
00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:51.540
physics. Like if you thought the world was made of individual particles,

69
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.020
it would be do okay.

70
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.100
But these days we use quantum field theory and quantum gravity and things like

71
00:03:56.101 --> 00:04:00.290
that. And those more modern ideas are harder to attach hidden variables too.

72
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.730
So hidden variables are, you know, an old idea, but, uh, they're,

73
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.770
I think that they're hard to make work. The other idea, which is more dramatic,

74
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.130
a little bit more fun is every single electron has a wave function.

75
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.650
And it seems to you that when you observe it, it collapses, but,

76
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.850
but maybe what's really going on is the following that there's a random

77
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.000
probability of re second that every electron will just spontaneously collapse.

78
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.440
So it's all spread out,

79
00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:29.920
but it's way function just randomly lo localizes to some particular region of

80
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:30.960
space. Very,

81
00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:34.280
very rarely like if you have one electron and you wait for it to happen,

82
00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:37.080
it will happen like once every a hundred million years. Okay.

83
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.680
But if I have lots of electrons, like in a table,

84
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.710
there's way more than a hundred million electrons in this table. There's,

85
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:46.030
there's, you know, billions and billions and billions of electrons.

86
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.790
So somewhere in the table, all the time,

87
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.790
an electron is localizing at one particular position.

88
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.990
And because that electron is entangled with all the other electrons,

89
00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.190
the table maintains a location in space, and this is,

90
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.220
uh, spontaneous collapse or G R w theory after the initials of the people who

91
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.054
invented the theory.

92
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.020
And the great thing about G R w theory is that it's experimentally

93
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.100
distinguishable from many worlds because it says that if I have a collection of

94
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.140
atoms, even if I'm not observing it, even if I'm not entangling it,

95
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.620
one of the wave functions should spontaneously localize occasionally,

96
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.610
and that will heat it up. Energy is not in this theory.

97
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.490
So people are doing experiments to test this. So it's really, you know,

98
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.690
legit experimental science.

99
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.453
<v 0>Adams,</v>

100
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.810
the current perception by the general public of Adams is that

101
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.410
it's mostly empty space.

102
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.130
<v 1>Yeah. This is not.</v>

103
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.120
<v 0>Good idea. This is not true. &lt;laugh&gt; well or not correct or not. It's.</v>

104
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.920
<v 1>Certainly not what many world says, right? So this is, you know,</v>

105
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:50.920
there are two enormous problems with our current way of presenting quantum

106
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.680
mechanics. One is the measurement problem, which is this question like,

107
00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:57.040
what do you mean, look at it? What do you mean observe? Like what, what,

108
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.720
what actually happens when does that happen? That's the measurement problem.

109
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.240
But the other problem is what I unhelpfully call the ontology

110
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:09.800
problem. &lt;laugh&gt; is ontology is the philosophy of being of what is real,

111
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.720
what is actually existing. So we just talked about hidden variable theories.

112
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.000
So in Everett, what's real is the wave function.

113
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.630
The way function of the universe describes the universe. Exactly. And,

114
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:24.790
and completely in many world in, uh, hidden variable theories.

115
00:06:24.791 --> 00:06:29.150
There's a wave function and there's also particles. So there's extra ontology,

116
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.230
extra pieces of reality. So the question of is the Adam mostly empty space

117
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.100
depends on, on what you think is real.

118
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.460
So the wave function of the electron fills the atom.

119
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.660
So if you're a many worlds person like me,

120
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.500
you think what is real is the wave function.

121
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.300
It fills up the atom and the atom is not most the empty space.

122
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.580
The atom is the wave function. It has that size, right?

123
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.940
You get the feeling that,

124
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.290
that atoms are the empty space because you think that really the electron is a

125
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:04.090
point and the way function is just telling you where you might see it when you

126
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:05.930
measure it. When well, yes,

127
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.530
so many worlds says there's no such thing as where it is.

128
00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:13.090
There's only a probability of seeing it. Everyone knows that,

129
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.290
but people kind of die.

130
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.690
They talk as if there really is a location of the electron,

131
00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:17.690
even if they should know better.

132
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.600
So people who generally people who say that atoms are mostly empty space are

133
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:23.480
just being sloppy.

134
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.040
Mm they're just really thinking of the electron as a little tiny dot rather than

135
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:28.874
a wave function.

136
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.160
There is an exception to that because there is a fourth version of quantum

137
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.280
mechanics that is somewhat popular. I said three. I said many worlds,

138
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:38.320
hidden variables and spontaneous collapse.

139
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.110
There's another version that just says, look,

140
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.550
the wave function has nothing to do with reality in many worlds.

141
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.110
It's all of reality in spontaneous collapse. It's all of reality,

142
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.310
but it obeys different equations and hidden variables.

143
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:54.110
The wave function is part of reality, but there's also,

144
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:57.110
partparticles in the other approach,

145
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.700
which is called an episem approach to quantum mechanics.

146
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.540
The wave function is just a way of talking about your personal knowledge of the

147
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:08.340
world, your knowledge or lack of knowledge, your ignorance of the world.

148
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.740
So your wave function is just a tool you use to make a prediction for what the

149
00:08:13.741 --> 00:08:15.700
experimental outcome is gonna be. Right?

150
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.330
And that's more or less what we teach our students. And this is approach says,

151
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.050
don't bother about reality.

152
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.850
What we should concern ourselves with is the experiences of agents

153
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.610
who make predictions and update their probability expectations of the world.

154
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.490
And so if someone like that, if you ask them, you know,

155
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.400
how is an electron located in an atom?

156
00:08:41.401 --> 00:08:45.840
Or how is it an atom, mostly empty space? I think if they're honest,

157
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.680
they would say, don't ask those questions. Those are no,

158
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.360
we don't ask reality questions. We just ask, what are you gonna see?

159
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.920
Kinds of questions. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

160
00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:54.840
But I think that some of the less honest ones will say sure,

161
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.880
and Adam is mostly empty space. Cuz an electron has location somewhere.

162
00:08:57.881 --> 00:08:58.800
We just don't know what it is.

163
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.360
<v 0>Why do they approach it in this? What you,</v>

164
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.680
the way you're describing it a sloppy way. Why,

165
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.120
why do you think that is so common?

166
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.080
<v 1>Well, you know, it is part of, um,</v>

167
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.110
the attitude that physicists physicists have did that.

168
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.310
We use quantum mechanics, but we don't try very hard to understand it.

169
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.670
So you can talk to plenty of physicists on the street and they will tell you to

170
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.910
your face, that understanding reality is not their job. And I,

171
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.670
I think that's terrible, but it, but they will say it.

172
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.860
And so when you press them too much on questions like, you know,

173
00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:38.380
is the ATO mostly empty space?

174
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.260
You know what happens when they make an observation,

175
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:41.900
they just kind of get uncomfortable and say, no,

176
00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:43.100
you're asking the wrong questions.

177
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.660
Let's ask questions about what will we see at the large Hadron collidder if we

178
00:09:47.661 --> 00:09:50.860
smash protons together. Right? And those are perfectly questions too.

179
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.540
But I think that the what's really going on questions are also interesting.

180
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.050
So they don't care about these questions.

181
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.730
They will often be sloppy in answering them. Right. They don't, you,

182
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.650
it is hard like, like, like you said, it's, it's hard when you read the book.

183
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.210
It's hard when you write the book, it's hard.

184
00:10:05.211 --> 00:10:07.690
When you think about these things as a professional physicist, it's,

185
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.050
it's not natural. It's not easy. It's not intuitive.

186
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.970
So even if you're a super duper expert at solving the equations and making pre

187
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.400
addictions understanding what's going on is a whole nother

188
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.760
activity that a lot of physicists don't try very hard to do.

189
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.600
<v 0>Now, how was all this stuff verified or argued?</v>

190
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.000
Like say your come, you're sitting down,

191
00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:34.680
you're having a conversation with someone who, uh, spouses, a competing theory.

192
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.430
How are you guys working this out?

193
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.750
<v 1>Good. I think that, um, if,</v>

194
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.750
if everything were going along really, really well,

195
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.470
we would be making experimental predictions and testing them.

196
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.030
But I think the theorists have sort of dropped the ball here, um,

197
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.550
in the sense that the theoretical physicists should have since the 1930s

198
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.420
in developing these alternatives, like many worlds, hidden variables, whatever,

199
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.860
and make using them to make predictions. Um, but we really haven't.

200
00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:06.100
They were neglected. They were backwaters. There were a few people,

201
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.740
a few plucky souls who, uh, really put their efforts into understanding.

202
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:12.900
These many of them got pushed out into philosophy departments. Um,

203
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.340
but that's what we need to do.

204
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.370
We need to like catch up on the last 70 years of lost time and

205
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:24.370
work out what the implications are of these ideas. So it's in the ball,

206
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.690
I think is in the theorist court, the experimenters are working hard.

207
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.450
Experimenters are doing amazing things with lasers and, um,

208
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.091
atoms and,

209
00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:35.850
and learning about how to manipulate quantum systems at a delicate level.

210
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:40.520
But the theorists have not given them sharp, experimental questions that they,

211
00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:44.280
that would really illuminate the foundations of quantum mechanics. So honestly,

212
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:47.360
what it is is a bunch of people get around a table and talk to each other.

213
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.040
&lt;laugh&gt;, you know, they're like, all right.

214
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.240
I think that what happens when the wave function branches is this.

215
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:56.360
So a typical question we'll try to address is in ordinary quantum

216
00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.080
mechanics, we say, if I send the electron through one way,

217
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.280
or I send it through the elec the other way, there's a 50,

218
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.640
50 chance that I will see it go left or go, right. And someone says,

219
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:08.560
what do you mean 50 50 chance,

220
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.470
especially in many worlds where there's a 100% chance the will be a world where

221
00:12:13.471 --> 00:12:16.430
it goes left and a world where it goes, right? How, what,

222
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.190
what is the meaning of the phrase? There's a 50, 50 chance.

223
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.550
What is the nature of probability in this game where everything is perfectly

224
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.590
deterministic, right?

225
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.430
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so that's not the kind of question that you a answer very

226
00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:28.990
easily by doing an experiment, you have to think about it. Right?

227
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.390
So that's what, the kind of thing that we argue about now,

228
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:35.340
how often do you guys get together? Um, yeah, you know, it happens, uh,

229
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.580
there's conferences. It's a small community.

230
00:12:37.581 --> 00:12:39.540
Someone asked me just the other day, cause you know,

231
00:12:39.541 --> 00:12:42.860
the book came out something deeply hidden last week. And I been on book tour.

232
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.540
So I was on, uh, I was being interviewed and someone said,

233
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.140
how many people do you think in the world are,

234
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.540
would classify themselves as working on the foundations of quantum mechanics?

235
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.010
Um, um, maybe a hundred, something like that, not a very large number.

236
00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.570
Like if you say how many people would classify themselves as particle

237
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.090
physicists, it would be tens of thousand.
