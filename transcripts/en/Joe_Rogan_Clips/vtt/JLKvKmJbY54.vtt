00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know, I wrote a, um,</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.400
a piece a long time ago on my blog. And, um, um,

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.350
I talked about it in one of my comedy specials that, uh,

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.910
I had a crazy experience with dolphins once, um,

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.160
when I was really, really high and I had this, um, I mean, it's,

6
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:24.870
it sounds silly to even talk about,

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.580
but I almost feel like I kind of understood that they're like us,

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.120
but they just don't alter their environment. What I realized,

9
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:34.470
like when they were playing with us,

10
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.260
when they were jumping by the boat and they were looking at you,

11
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.810
they're looking at you while they were jumping around with the boat.

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.140
And I was like, they're playing. And they're looking at you.

13
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:44.850
Like a person would like a water.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.370
<v 1>We're interacting. There's almost a language at this point.</v>

15
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:50.460
There's some level of bridged gap in the communication.

16
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:54.270
When you get to see that they're expressing themselves in interest in you and

17
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:54.870
whatnot and,

18
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.560
and scoping them when you get really close and establish a relationship with

19
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:00.300
these animals, that's when things start getting real squirrely,

20
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.700
because you start to find that happy medium language.

21
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.860
And now all of a sudden you are starting to sort of speak so to say, yeah.

22
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.820
<v 0>Um, well, I started getting really weird, um,</v>

23
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.510
feelings about SeaWorld and,

24
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:17.910
and animal captivity like this.

25
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.590
W w w why do we need that in this day and age like this, isn't the dark ages.

26
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:27.420
We shouldn't be putting whales and orcas and dolphins putting them

27
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:32.250
in these tanks, these water, fish, swimming pools, they're swimming pools.

28
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.200
And you have these things that are probably as smart as us in some different

29
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:37.351
way.

30
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:42.120
Like we're so prejudiced in that we only think of intelligence as something that

31
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:45.720
can manipulate its environment. That's our problem. Like we're like,

32
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:48.690
look at them, they're world. They don't have any houses.

33
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:52.320
They can't write a letter. They they're stupid, man, stop it they're stupid.

34
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.420
But the dolphins apparently have a cerebral cortex at some something around

35
00:01:57.421 --> 00:02:00.720
40% larger than a human beings. They have super complex language.

36
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.360
<v 1>Their emotional intelligence is the mystery,</v>

37
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.920
and it appears that it's far beyond anything we ourselves can understand.

38
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.230
Uh, same as orcas. They've got that. Uh,

39
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.470
they've got another part of the brain in the front,

40
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.240
which is its function in the front of the cerebral cortex. That function is to,

41
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.270
um, as for communication and for, and for it.

42
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.470
And it enhances their emotional capacity to a point where we don't really know

43
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:29.070
the depth of which they are, uh, the power of their emotion, but we know that,

44
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.810
uh, they stay with their families for their lifetimes. The males born, uh, from,

45
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.930
from the mothers will, will rarely leave the mother's side,

46
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.930
quite literally the distance of an Orca itself.

47
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.410
The only time that male will go on is when it's matured and it will go to a

48
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.130
total procreate and then back to the mother and it will live its entire life as

49
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:50.730
such. And the sad fact about that is in my experience,

50
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.930
working with male orcas caught from one of which cut from the wild,

51
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:59.260
a big bull Orca is he was a mama's boy. You can see something was missing.

52
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:01.240
He was traumatized from something. And of course,

53
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.490
even myself as a regarded whale expert in the capacity of working at a fricking

54
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:07.780
place like Marine land,

55
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.610
even I would have never known this information when I started this,

56
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:15.610
this is not information that was available to us back in. I started in 2000.

57
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.510
It makes sense. Now, this animal's traumatized from birth,

58
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.020
his will to live is just gone it's at,

59
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.610
and the male. It appears to me. And in my experience,

60
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.290
the male sex of, uh, well,

61
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.560
I've worked with seals, I've worked with sea lions. I've worked with, uh,

62
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.920
walruses, uh, uh, dolphins Balugas and orcas,

63
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.910
all of them die younger. The males die younger.

64
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.720
And I think, well, definitely in the orcas and the,

65
00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:49.360
and the dolphins cases is they just don't have that will to live without that

66
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.090
strong maternal figure in their life.

67
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.760
<v 0>Well, I try to explain to people that don't see it, and they think that the,</v>

68
00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:59.760
the dolphins get treated well or the orcas get treated well. This is what,

69
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.870
imagine if someone stole your son and put him in

70
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.520
an air box at the bottom of the ocean and dolphins and

71
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:13.060
whales and fish just came by and stared at them imagine,

72
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.800
and he lives his life like that with no contact, other than with his,

73
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.310
his dolphin handlers or whoever's taking care of him.

74
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.840
And he just lives in this box, missing his family, missing his loved ones,

75
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:28.630
missing his life, confused, lost, and with,

76
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.430
with a language that is, especially with orcas and dolphins,

77
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:35.140
they have a language it's so complex.

78
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.800
We haven't been able to really decipher it. We don't understand how it works.

79
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.630
You know, John Lilly spent, they spent, I think,

80
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:48.220
decades working on trying to get dolphins to speak human noises.

81
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.090
He had a bunch of studies that he did. And, um,

82
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.700
he even had a D it's a crazy story.

83
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:58.540
I'm sure you've heard of the woman who lived with the dolphin. She,

84
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.510
she tried to establish a relationship with the dolphin where she,

85
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:04.090
they made an apartment that was half under water,

86
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.990
but the dolphin always wanted to. So she just jerked the dolphin off.

87
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.310
And when she jerked the dolphin off,

88
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:11.890
that was the only thing that calmed him down. And then she could do her work.

89
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.910
So for her, it was just like a technicality. I just got a jerk, this dolphin,

90
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.730
all it's in the animal. It wants to be rubbed.

91
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.620
All the moral stuff that's attached to that is all in my own head. She's like,

92
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:27.100
I'm just going to be a scientist. And they were like, cut. Get that.

93
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.240
<v 1>I think they were also injecting ketamine into the dolphins or something as</v>

94
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:31.360
well.

95
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.460
<v 0>I do not know if they were doing that into dolphins,</v>

96
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:37.630
but I do know that they did some experiments with LSD and that, uh,

97
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.420
John Lilly, who was one of my personal heroes,

98
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:44.260
he's the creator of the flotation tank. This is all John Lilly stuff.

99
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.480
He was a pioneer in interspecies communication.

100
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:50.560
He would take acid and think that he was communicating with dolphins. Did you.

101
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.150
<v 1>Know you're on the cover of one of his books.</v>

102
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.180
<v 0>Was yes. We talking about.</v>

103
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.000
<v 1>Face is, I mean, it's, it's a spitting image on,</v>

104
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.800
in one of his books.

105
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.110
<v 0>Lily's books. Do this.</v>

106
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.880
<v 1>Look this up. Maybe the spirits.</v>

107
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.413
<v 0>Travel or.</v>

108
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.550
<v 1>Dude. It's not you, man. I'm sorry. I was that.</v>

109
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.370
<v 0>Oh man. That's weird. Yeah. Wow. Uh,</v>

110
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:19.820
so that's a pro I can't read that. What does it say? Something the human,

111
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:23.240
human bio-computer biochem. Yeah. I didn't read that one.

112
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.990
I read the deep self though. The deep self is really interesting. Um,

113
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.490
and the deep self, I think the deep self is the one that also has, um,

114
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.090
diagrams on how to build a tank. He was trying to get people to build tanks.

115
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.770
He was like, listen, man, I found some out. You gotta try this.

116
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.100
<v 1>The last time while I was here. Uh, not the last time two times ago,</v>

117
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:45.110
you actually, uh, sent me to crash.

118
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.720
<v 0>Crash, crash.</v>

119
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.550
<v 1>The float lab. Yeah. And he, uh, you know,</v>

120
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:51.950
I thought I'd be in there for an hour. It turns out I was in there for a couple.

121
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.230
And when I came out, I'm like, dude, I was waiting for the knock.

122
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.020
He's just like, oh no, man. It's just letting you stay in. And I'm like, oh.

123
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.243
I'm looking at the time of.

124
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.270
<v 0>Crashes. The lack of legit hippie. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. He's great. He's great.</v>

125
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.060
He's he's the mad scientist behind float lab. Yeah.

126
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.600
That's why those things are so well engineered. When I met him,

127
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:12.880
I was like what I was like. Cause I tanks before that, when I, I,

128
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.740
I first got a tank in like 2002,

129
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.570
somewhere around in 2002, 2003. And, um,

130
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.550
it was, uh, it was great, but it was like, it would break things would go wrong.

131
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:29.990
It flooded my basement. It was like, there was disasters. It wasn't. And then,

132
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.790
um, my friend who was a, a tank technician, there's actually tank technicians.

133
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.280
He said, listen, you gotta get checked out this guy in Venice.

134
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.360
So some mad scientist down there in Venice,

135
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.290
it's just making these super over-engineered float tanks. And he goes,

136
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:45.350
they look like walking meat lockers. Right. I was like, what?

137
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.310
And then she showed.

138
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.110
<v 1>Me, you had like a pod installed. Had.</v>

139
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.280
<v 0>Um, it was a very good tank. It's just, uh, it just,</v>

140
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.780
it wasn't as well constructed. It also wasn't nearly as expensive. It just,

141
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.600
he went the distance, he went the distance and he still keeps,

142
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.730
keeps coming over here. I've got to change things. We've got to,

143
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.350
we're upgrading, we're doing things. He's.

144
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.200
<v 1>Always cramming, trying to enhance the experience for everyone. I mean.</v>

145
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.680
<v 0>He's always trying to make it better. He's the front of the line.</v>

146
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.430
And when I first started working with him,

147
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.140
like when I first started having him on the podcast and I hired him to build me

148
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:21.590
a tank and I'll let you, I was like, there was no tanks. It was,

149
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.820
it was real rare that you'd find tank centers. Now they're everywhere, man.

150
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:26.683
They're everywhere.

151
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.501
<v 1>Well, I'll say this,</v>

152
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:31.010
the experience I had in his tank versus the one that I there's a local place,

153
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.740
uh, from where, uh, where I'm from, uh,

154
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.890
was hands down a different experience because he really isolates you there.

155
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.980
Whereas this was like a pod that they bought and installed in a room. I mean,

156
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:40.820
it was great, please.

157
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.670
<v 0>Is super insulated. So there's no noise.</v>

158
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.510
<v 1>Getting in that thing.</v>

159
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.420
And he gave me the tour of the whole backstage to where I was all back to check

160
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.230
that out. It's like 12 minutes. It's got a serious complex there.

161
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.010
<v 0>It's hard to appreciate. But when he first started making tanks like that,</v>

162
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.040
which like, again, I think I bought one of his tanks in 2005,

163
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:01.190
I think somewhere around then, dude. Well,

164
00:09:01.191 --> 00:09:03.450
there was no one making anything like that. He was,

165
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:08.340
he's making these super high-end crazy double wall insulated

166
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:13.170
tanks and you get in there. It's just, yeah, Justin nothing.

167
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.360
And you just will swallow. You just get taken into the,

168
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.560
this it's a good place to think about the subject.
