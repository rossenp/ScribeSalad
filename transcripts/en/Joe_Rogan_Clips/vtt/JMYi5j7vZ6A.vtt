00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What do you think consciousness is? Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.760
Do you think consciousness is clearly just a,

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.080
a factor of brain tissue and, and energy,

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.880
or do you think it's possible that what our brain is,

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.920
is something that tunes into consciousness?

6
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.510
<v 1>Yeah. Um, well, I spend, I've spent some time thinking about this question.</v>

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.430
I think it's perhaps the deepest question that faces science or even humanity at

8
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:31.150
some level. And, um,

9
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.990
my own personal perspective is that consciousness is nothing more

10
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.630
than the choreographed motion of particles in various,

11
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.700
from states inside a loppy gray structure that sits inside this thing that we

12
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:48.300
call ahead. Do I have any proof for that? No.

13
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.540
Does anybody have any proof for what consciousness is not at all at this moment,

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.220
but the history of the reductionist program,

15
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.180
where we've been able to take some of the more spectacular creations that have

16
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.730
a Mer in the world and recognize that they are nothing but

17
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.570
the product of their ingredients and the laws of physics leads me to extrapolate

18
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.170
that idea to the experience of consciousness. Now,

19
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:16.330
having said that there's a deep puzzle,

20
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.650
it's called the hard problem of consciousness,

21
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.640
which is if electrons I and corks and particles and laws of physics

22
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.080
are all that there is.

23
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.000
And if you buy into the fact that electrons don't have an inner world,

24
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.200
that corks don't have an inner world,

25
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.800
how can it be that by taking a collection of those particles,

26
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.280
you can turn on the lights.

27
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.480
How can a collection of mindless thoughtless particles somehow yield mind,

28
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.270
full experience?

29
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.830
And that's a deep question that science has not yet

30
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.510
answered my own feeling is when we understand the brain better,

31
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.350
that question will evaporate.

32
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.230
We'll look at the brain with our new found understanding.

33
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.790
Maybe it's a hundred years in the making,

34
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:04.100
maybe a thousand years in the making and will say, aha,

35
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.340
when electrons and corks and protons move in this particular configuration,

36
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.940
one of the byproducts is an inner sensation that we call conscious

37
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.183
experience.

38
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.980
And that to me is the likely answer that we will find,

39
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.500
but there are some very smart, well,

40
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.970
all respected people who go in a very different direction.

41
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.970
There are some who say electrons and protons and corks.

42
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.890
They do have a fundamental pro conscious quality.

43
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.450
They themselves are conscious beings of a sort.

44
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.730
Now it's not like you're gonna have electrons that are crying or arequarks that

45
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:44.800
are in anguishing.

46
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.160
But if you have a little proto element of conscious experience that is imbued

47
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:53.280
into a particle, and then you take a lot of the particles and put them together,

48
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.640
the ideas that yields the manifest conscious experience that we're familiar

49
00:02:57.641 --> 00:03:00.680
with, I don't buy into that, but there are people who do, why.

50
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.640
<v 0>Why do you pick a position? Well, I.</v>

51
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.120
<v 1>I take a position on this because I guess my view is</v>

52
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.640
you look out at the world and what you do as a physicist is you

53
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.360
move the smallest degree required to explain the

54
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.350
phenomena that you are observing and to move from our

55
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:23.550
current understanding of the world,

56
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.270
to leapfrog to a place where electrons are conscious and corpsrks are conscious

57
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.670
to me is such a fantastically radical move that I don't consider it

58
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.230
justified to make that move with our current level of understanding,

59
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.100
there was a time back in the 18 hundreds when life itself was so

60
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.140
mystical that people basically said the same kind of thing.

61
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.540
How could a collection of lifeless particles ever come together and yield a

62
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:55.900
living being? They said that they can't, you have to induce a life force.

63
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:58.940
You have to inject vitally. You have to inject a life force.

64
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.170
That's what sparks the emergence of life on lifeless particles.

65
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.290
I don't think any serious scientist thinks that today.

66
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.530
I think most serious scientists say yes, life is wonderful.

67
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.890
Life is in some sense, miraculous,

68
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.090
but life is nothing but the particles of nature coming together to yield the

69
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:22.840
complex molecules of DNA and an RNA, the complex cellular structures,

70
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.520
the cells come together to yield the more complex multicellular organisms.

71
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.360
And that's all that it takes to have something that's alive.

72
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.920
No life force is necessary. That way of thinking about the world has gone away.

73
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.140
And I,

74
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.350
my own feeling is that that kind of progression is gonna for consciousness

75
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.111
today.

76
00:04:42.111 --> 00:04:46.830
It's utterly mysterious how it is that I have this inner voice talking inside my

77
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:47.250
head,

78
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.030
how it is that I look around the world and I can see the color red and I can,

79
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.630
and I can experience the color red.

80
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.190
I don't just have sensors that can call that red. I mean, an iPhone can do that.

81
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.860
I actually have an inner world where I feel the, that color red.

82
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.180
Where does that come from? Hard to answer that question,

83
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.100
but I think a hundred or a thousand years from now will look back and smile at

84
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.900
how we in this era invested consciousness with such mystical

85
00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:16.380
quality. When in the end,

86
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.220
it's nothing but particles in the laws of physics and that's all there is to it.

87
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.140
Well, what's.

88
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.250
<v 0>Interesting too, to me, is that as a human being, my,</v>

89
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.450
my thoughts on consciousness are, are very deep and profound. And this, this,

90
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:30.370
this idea, like what is this thing?

91
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.090
But if I really break it down objectively and animals have some sort of a,

92
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.450
a consciousness, I mean, including they have instincts, right? They,

93
00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:42.360
they try to get away from danger. They try to survive and pro create.

94
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.320
And we developed something far more complex in our ability to express ourselves

95
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.240
in language. And in doing that language,

96
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.320
or during that creation of that language,

97
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.400
we developed all sorts of bizarre concepts.

98
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.600
And we've developed all sorts of different ways to describe feelings and,

99
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.520
and emotions and, and contemplate the future as well. Yeah.

100
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.080
And these things are continually getting more and more complex.

101
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.440
If you go to single celld organisms, work your way up to, you know,

102
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.880
early hoades and then get to human beings.

103
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.710
You just see this ever increasing four of complexity in, in every way.

104
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.430
Yes. And in the way that the things see the world,

105
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.550
of course, it makes sense that there would be more complexity. Right.

106
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.270
But we don't think about that when we think of a perricket,

107
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.230
we don't think of a paraket as being conscious,

108
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.220
but a paraket relatively speaking is far more primitive at

109
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:40.260
chimpanzee, which is relatively speaking, far more primitive than a human being.

110
00:06:40.261 --> 00:06:44.820
Right. And it's just gonna continue to evolve. Or if we survive,

111
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.820
things will continue to improve due to NA natural selection and yes.

112
00:06:48.821 --> 00:06:49.940
Random mutation and all,

113
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:54.380
all the other factors and will be something that makes this today

114
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.770
look like primitive the way we look at single cell over S or champs or whatever.

115
00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.170
Yeah.

116
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.330
<v 1>I can. Well, imagine that. Yeah. I mean, because we see, you know,</v>

117
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.210
small changes in DNA, you know, tiny fraction of percent yields,

118
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:09.850
a radical change in what the being that has, that DNA is able to accomplish.

119
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.730
But at the same time, you, you made reference to psychedelic experiences. Yeah.

120
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.680
And I trust you agree, but tell me if you don't,

121
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.240
that those psychedelic experiences were generated by a slight change in the

122
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.080
chemical makeup of the particles cosing through your brain and your body.

123
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.080
<v 0>Sometimes not even a change, sometimes a, a lot of them,</v>

124
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.600
the heavier ones are actually produced by the brain. Right.

125
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.600
<v 1>So, so, so to me, that's a great piece of data</v>

126
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:44.070
speaks to the fact that all it is is particles and chemicals

127
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.510
coercing through a structure,

128
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.950
because if the mind was somehow external to the physical

129
00:07:50.951 --> 00:07:52.470
makeup and the loss describing it,

130
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.030
then how would the injections say of some kind of foreign substance?

131
00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:57.730
Or as you say,

132
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.300
the brain producing some sort up and said it didn't ordinarily have within its

133
00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:02.134
makeup,

134
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.620
why would that be able to have such radical impact unconscious

135
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:07.703
experience?

136
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.420
<v 0>The way I would look at it,</v>

137
00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:13.900
if I was trying to argue against that would be that your eyes and

138
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.060
the, the organs of the human eye are taking in light.

139
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.410
And through that light able to perceive physical objects in the world that they

140
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:25.090
would not be able to do without light. Yes, there's, it's a,

141
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.290
it's something that allows you to see,

142
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:32.410
and it allows you to take in depth perception and understand shapes that the

143
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:33.244
human mind,

144
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.730
and particularly these glands that produce these psychedelic chemicals when

145
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.400
experiencing these goals,

146
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:45.400
it allows the brain to experience things that might be there all

147
00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:50.080
the time. Yes. But that you cannot perceive with normal human neurochemistry,

148
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.560
it needs to be enhanced, or the levels need to be changed and shifted.

149
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.360
And what's really perplexing about the,

150
00:08:56.361 --> 00:08:59.840
these chemicals is that these chemicals are produced by your brain.

151
00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:03.080
And if you do take these like particularly dimeethyltriptomine, yeah.

152
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.160
Is the most potent of all the psychedelic chemicals. If you take that,

153
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.040
you have these insanely profound visions. Right. Which is, you know,

154
00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:14.120
leads to a lot of people have these religious, spiritual epiphanies.

155
00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:15.150
Have you done anything?

156
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.790
Have you done any psychedelic experiences that you're allowed to talk about?

157
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.270
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, I, I, I have, uh, what have you, not, not many,</v>

158
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.670
and I'm a complete lightweight in this arena because I hardly drink, you know,

159
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.670
I hardly do anything that puts foreign, uh,

160
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:32.870
substance into the body mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. But, um, yeah, I was in a,

161
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.660
I was in Amsterdam. Uh, I, I was, uh,

162
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.780
I was there because I was giving a lecture to the queen of Holland and I gave

163
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.460
the lecture and my wife and I were both there. And after that was over,

164
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.260
we decided to do a little experimenting. Uh,

165
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.420
and for somebody like me who doesn't experiment, um,

166
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.420
I made a mistake &lt;laugh&gt; uh, uh, because, uh, did you eat it well? Well,

167
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.450
well, the first night we went out and we went to one of these coffee bars and,

168
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.770
uh, I guess I can speak about this, you know, I, um, it's legal here. Yeah.

169
00:10:02.771 --> 00:10:05.890
Totally legal. Exactly. You know, I, we, we took the, like the,

170
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.210
the easy way in like the, the, the, the novice mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,

171
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:13.370
version. And it did nothing to me at all that first night.

172
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.330
So the next night when we went,

173
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.200
I went right to the bottom of the list where they, it was something,

174
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:21.880
it was in Dutch or something, but it had like machine guns mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

175
00:10:21.881 --> 00:10:25.400
you know, pointed at a brain kind of thing. Oh boy. Yeah. So, so I,

176
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.400
I did that version and it was the most terrifying experience of,

177
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.720
of my life. &lt;laugh&gt; I was gonna say that either, but, um, we were in a club,

178
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.950
we were in a club, all of a sudden the world changed. And,

179
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:45.070
uh, what started happening is my brain started manufacturing

180
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:50.470
versions of myself that would converse with me and convince

181
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.630
me that the reality that I was experiencing was real.

182
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.820
And then that version of me would destroy the, at reality.

183
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.500
And the process would start over and over and over again, is.

184
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.540
<v 0>This something you smoked or you ate, smoked? Yeah. Wow.</v>

185
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.580
<v 1>Definitely smoked. Um, and again, wow.</v>

186
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:10.420
I suspect that the impact was because my body has no experience.

187
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.020
Oh, for sure. Oh, you know, and, and so I think that just enhanced the,

188
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.060
the impact and, um, Y Y you know, uh,

189
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.650
it was terrifying. It was utterly,

190
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:24.570
I was in the hotel room and I was clinging to the bed &lt;laugh&gt;

191
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.690
and, and I actually said to my wife tie me up. Not, not in,

192
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.770
not in any, not, it sounds wrong. I, I meant, I mean,

193
00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:37.010
tie me up cuz I'm like terrified of what I'm gonna do. Right. You know? Wow.

194
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.520
You know, and so instead, you know, she, she called the doctor and I was like,

195
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.920
she was like, afraid, this would be like in the newspaper.

196
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.200
Cause I just like give lecture to the queen, you know? Right. Uh, but you know,

197
00:11:47.201 --> 00:11:50.400
they're so used to Americans getting in over their head yeah.

198
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:51.280
With this kind of experience.

199
00:11:51.281 --> 00:11:54.520
So it was something that they were completely used to. So, you know, they, they,

200
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:58.480
they sent up a doctor and, and the doctor basically just gives you sugar.

201
00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.360
And my wife knew that this was a, uh,

202
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.840
an extreme circumstance cuz I don't eat any sugar, but I was like, he said,

203
00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:08.200
eat as my, I was like taking the Milky way bars. Like.

204
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.160
<v 0>I'm so sugar, somehow.</v>

205
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.520
<v 1>Another counter sugar, some, I don't know,</v>

206
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.070
I don't know the chemistry behind this, but sugar is the,

207
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.950
the antidote caffeine is supposed to help us. Well, caffeine can help too. Yeah,

208
00:12:16.951 --> 00:12:19.830
I guess. But it, it lasted eight hours.

209
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.670
&lt;laugh&gt; even flying home on the plane. The next day,

210
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.390
all I did is I sat on my seat and uh,

211
00:12:26.391 --> 00:12:30.190
I put on the headphones and there was a beetles channel and I just like listened

212
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:33.980
to beetles perfect for like, for like seven hours. And I, I was just, you know,

213
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.460
in this, in this place that I had never experienced before now, now, you know,

214
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.700
for our conversation, you know,

215
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:45.020
this just made it so intuitively obvious to me that my

216
00:12:45.021 --> 00:12:49.540
conscious awareness is totally dependent on chemical, on, on a,

217
00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:53.260
on a few chemicals. Right. That's all that's happening inside of the head.

218
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:55.690
So in a way it was a valuable experience.

219
00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:58.970
It's not something that I want to ever experience again. Absolutely.

220
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.010
But it was something that helped align my intuitive understanding

221
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:09.090
of what consciousness is with the scientific recognition

222
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.890
that it all relies upon the stuff that's circulating inside of your mind.

223
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.600
<v 0>Yeah. What's interesting about this, this,</v>

224
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.080
these heavy duty psychedelic experiences,

225
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:23.600
cuz what you took was by most people's idea. Very mild. Yeah.

226
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.160
But the more profound psychedelic chemicals that are also produced by your

227
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:30.840
brain, if you just shift that ratio and not by too much,

228
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:32.240
really you're not talking about even,

229
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.030
you're talking about little small to OSISS of this stuff shift that ratio,

230
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.150
it produces these profound visions is this like ioka type type. Yeah.

231
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.510
Ioka is just an early active version of dethylritoectomy. Okay. Okay.

232
00:13:45.511 --> 00:13:47.190
They figured out how to, you know, your brain,

233
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.790
your gut rather produces monoamian oxidase and it breaks down dethylriptomine

234
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:56.740
and so they figured out how to combine an Mao a bit with the leaves of another

235
00:13:56.741 --> 00:14:00.420
plant that has the dethylriptamine and I see, but you could take it there,

236
00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:01.940
there there's synthetic versions of it.

237
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.020
But the point is this is something that your brain produces,

238
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:08.220
your liver produces. We know you, we know it it's produced in the lungs.

239
00:14:08.221 --> 00:14:11.020
It's the body makes it. Yeah. Right. But it's got it's in there,

240
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.940
but then we change the balance, shift the balance.

241
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.260
And all of a sudden you have these incredibly profound visions.

242
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.690
It makes you think like what,

243
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.570
what we have now in terms of our balance and our,

244
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.770
our chemicals must be different than with this fella must have had yes.

245
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:27.810
Chimpanzee thing.

246
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:37.640
<v 2>I.</v>
