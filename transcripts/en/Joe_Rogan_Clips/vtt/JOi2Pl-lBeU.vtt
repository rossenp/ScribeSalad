00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.733
<v 3>Shelly Duval.</v>

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.280
<v 1>Uh, Shelly Duval. Yeah. And she had trauma from it to this day.</v>

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.160
She talks about the trauma she had in that movie.

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.800
<v 0>I was reading a story, an interview with her, like she kind of vanished. Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.760
And then they were interviewing her and she sounded insane. Yeah.

7
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.320
<v 1>I think it pushed her over the edge. I think that movie people up.</v>

8
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.990
<v 0>Cubic was a strange guy. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.990
Do you know who would do complex mathematics in his spare time? Really? Yeah.

10
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.630
He's like a legitimate genius. Wow. And he would put all sorts of like weird,

11
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:35.470
hidden meaning into all of his movies. Like a thing was never just a thing.

12
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.790
Like a, a, there was, there's a big,

13
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.700
crazy conspiracy about the shine that inside of it

14
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.420
is all sorts of, um, information that,

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.660
uh, is it relates to the moon landing? Yeah. You know? Yeah.

16
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.220
<v 1>Like room. Yeah. The room room room in the hotel. It was room 1 27.</v>

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.340
And the moon is 127,000 miles from the earth or.

18
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.490
<v 0>Something. No, it's, it's like 2 37, 2. Yeah. Whatever it was. The moon is,</v>

19
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:08.250
yeah. The moon is like 200. I think. I think it's room 2 37, right? Yeah. 2 37.

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.930
That's the documentary on it? The, the moon is, well,

21
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:13.970
it depends on what time of the year and where,

22
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.370
but it's between 237 and 265,000 miles.

23
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.050
<v 1>Away. Well, and they say that he directed the,</v>

24
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.320
the fake movie at about the fake moon landing.

25
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.880
<v 0>Well, that's the, that's the big conspiracy theory. What is the thing in the,</v>

26
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.040
the, the circle with the Jack Nicholson picture there? Oh, there's uh,

27
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.920
the coffee. What does it say? It's.

28
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.600
<v 2>The coffee. It might be the coffee that KME.</v>

29
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.200
<v 0>For. Almet what does that mean? What does Kalam and then the other one,</v>

30
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:44.030
you go up, scroll up, you see the circles there's rockets on the wall. Uhhuh.

31
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.070
<v 2>Sort of, sort of, yeah. That is, that is whatever that is. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.390
<v 0>Strange. Yeah. There's but he was into weird. He was, I mean,</v>

33
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.830
he was a legitimate genius. Yeah. Like eyes wide shut.

34
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:59.870
That's another strange movie. He did a lot of strange movies, man. Yeah.

35
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.870
<v 1>He did. What did he do? Clockwork. Orange. Was that him? Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.500
Those cubers dad was.

37
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.620
<v 2>Full metal jacket documentary. That whole thing they shot in London really?</v>

38
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.580
Cause he didn't want, he wouldn't leave his home really.

39
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.860
So they made like the second half of the movie supposed to be in Vietnam and

40
00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:18.740
like some area in part of England. Really? Yeah.

41
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.420
<v 0>Wow. He wouldn't leave London. you. I'm staying here. But,</v>

42
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.650
but this movie's supposed to be in the middle of the jungle. Yeah.

43
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.810
Well it's right here. Here's the jungle off. Right?

44
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.050
He did some wild movies on that. Yeah, he did 2001. The, the, I,

45
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.330
the, this conspiracy theory about him directing the moon landing was that he was

46
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:44.960
doing it at the same time. He was doing 2001.

47
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.960
So because he was faking this space movie. Okay. 2001,

48
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:53.640
a space odysey that they used him to fake the moon landing footage,

49
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.160
Uhhuh &lt;affirmative&gt;. And there's a fake documentary, not a real documentary,

50
00:02:57.161 --> 00:02:57.994
but a fake,

51
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.560
like a where he's admitting and people are talking about.

52
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.320
Have you seen that one? No, but that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.000
A lot of people are like, dude, you didn't even know there's an actual,

54
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.160
real interview with him where he admits that he faked the moon landing,

55
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.800
but it's not. Yeah. It's just, it's fake. But it's were you ever.

56
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.960
<v 1>On the, uh, in the camp of the moon landing was fake.</v>

57
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.470
<v 0>For yeah. Yeah. It's one of my favorite all time conspiracies,</v>

58
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.390
because it's so strange that we never went back. I,

59
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.150
I abandoned it because I don't know anything about astrophysics or space

60
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.430
travel or any of that stuff. And the people that do think it's real.

61
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.460
So I'm like, okay,

62
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.790
well most likely they think the landing really happened to me. Yeah. Yeah.

63
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.260
But it there's so many weird things to it. There's so many,

64
00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:46.020
there's so many weird things with the photographs and there's like intersecting

65
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.460
shadows that indicate different light sources. There's all sorts of weird.

66
00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:54.380
The flag waving. Yeah. It's weird, man. There's a lot of weird. The fact that,

67
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.340
uh,

68
00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.090
that this is the only time in human history that something is cheaper,

69
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.770
easier, and faster to replicate than it was in 1969.

70
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.170
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; see. 19 69, 19 72, there was seven trips,

71
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.050
six successful where they went to the moon and back.

72
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.530
And uh, every, every space flight since then has been like near earth orbit.

73
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:19.970
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, everything is like, you know,

74
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.960
know just a few miles up. It's not, they don't,

75
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.120
they don't go like they did then. I mean,

76
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:27.280
I think everything since then is like 300 miles.

77
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.120
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; every human travel, you know,

78
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:33.560
like every space shuttles and stuff like that. They, they never go that far.

79
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.840
Yeah. They never go into deep space and come back.

80
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.560
The only time they came back was during the moon landings in the sixties when

81
00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:40.950
they were lying about everything. Yeah.

82
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.510
But the thing is like Nixon was president back then it was like,

83
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.870
it's so romantic bombing Cambodia and yeah.

84
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.510
It's so romantic to think that they faked it. Also.

85
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.190
Here's another reason if you watch the post flight press conference,

86
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.190
and again, I'm not saying that this is what's,

87
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.460
this is actually what's happening, but it seems complete completely.

88
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.580
Like they're full of when they come back,

89
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:05.380
it seems like they're lying and they're nervous.

90
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.180
And they ask them about the stars. And, and again, I'm,

91
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.340
I'm not on the camp that they faked it. But, uh,

92
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.940
there was, uh, you know, buzz, Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and, um,

93
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.500
Michael Collins and Michael Collins. They,

94
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.530
they asked him about stars and in the press conference, he's like, uh,

95
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.890
I don't recall seeing any stars.

96
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.970
The problem with that is like Michael Collins never left the lunar module.

97
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.370
He wasn't supposed to be one of the guys that was on the surface of the moon.

98
00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:37.570
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he was up in the, the craft that was circling, you know,

99
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.490
those in orbit around the moon.

100
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.880
And then later when he were wrote a book about it,

101
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:47.360
he talked about how magnificent the stars looked. Oh, so he has inconsistencies.

102
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.800
So the, the, the hoax people point to that,

103
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.520
they also point to the inconsistencies of the, uh,

104
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.760
the actual movement of the astronauts on the moon. Like, uh,

105
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.760
there's videos that make it look like they were on wires. There's videos that,

106
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.280
yeah.

107
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.800
There's like the back of this suit is being pulled by something it's weird.

108
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.800
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but again,

109
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:09.520
like when was the last time you saw someone in one, six earths, gravity,

110
00:06:09.521 --> 00:06:11.240
maybe that's just maybe things just look weird,

111
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.400
but there's a video of them where it looks like they're on trampolines.

112
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.710
It's very strange. And they're bounce it around on the surface, the moon,

113
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:18.430
like literally,

114
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.430
and you can't see their feet or they're like hidden behind equipment.

115
00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:23.390
They're just bouncing up in the air and you're like, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

116
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.940
it's fun.

117
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.190
It's fun to think the cubic faked it all catch new episodes that Joe Rogan
