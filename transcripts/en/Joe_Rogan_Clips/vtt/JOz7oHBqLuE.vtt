WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:03.961
<v 1>Yeah, we,</v>

3
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:08.490
you and I privately had this conversation through text messages about the

4
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:13.110
way reporters are using this moment to criticize

5
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:16.260
Trump with in ridiculous ways.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.880
And one of them was this a questioning

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.590
of whether or not he should describe these drugs that have some promise,

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.870
which many doctors are describing hydroxy chloroquine with a Z pack.

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.980
And zinc apparently is a combination that keeps getting brought up.

10
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:38.550
And there's a doctor that has been using this, uh, to, uh,

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.400
some reported success in New York city. Um,

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.590
but what drives me crazy is that these are rare opportunities that someone has

13
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:51.450
to talk to the president and they're using it to chastise him for bringing

14
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:55.920
up drugs that do show promise and hope. He's not telling people to go take it.

15
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.060
He's not advocating it.

16
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.450
He's not pretending that he's some sort of medical professional.

17
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.560
He's just talking about some things that show promise in the medical community.

18
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.780
You know, what, what is your take on all this? Cause this is a w it's,

19
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:13.530
it's a weird situation that he finds himself in with the press is very strange,

20
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.100
uh, and antagonistic position.

21
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.910
<v 2>Yeah. You know, the press needs to figure out who they want to be. And, uh,</v>

22
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.780
it's actually like chapter two in my book, it's called who is your hero?

23
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.990
And that in that conversation is about who we think we should be like, well,

24
00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.750
what kind of people do we think we should be?

25
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:36.210
What does it mean to be a good American, a good citizen?

26
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.340
The press believes it is their duty to only be adversarial

27
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.670
to, to politicians, mostly conservative politicians.

28
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.810
They don't treat Democrats the same way, but, and that is their job. Okay.

29
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:50.100
I wish they would treat all, all,

30
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.660
all politicians the same and intuitive to an extent that is their job to be

31
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.900
adversarial, to question what is coming out of government.

32
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.150
But I would argue that their main purpose is to simply educate the public,

33
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.100
educate the public full. That's a faxed full context,

34
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.760
a full understanding of what's going on. Uh, I think on that point,

35
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.370
they're utterly failing. Um, and to, to a huge extent,

36
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:15.720
I think they've been failing for a long time,

37
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.750
but in a time of crisis where it's so important that they actually do that,

38
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.170
that, that more important thing of informing the public they're really failing.

39
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.410
And they, they, they, they, they completely wasted time. I mean,

40
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.570
how many reporters actually get access to the president?

41
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:31.290
I bet there's hundreds of thousands of reporters out there. Good ones who would,

42
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.100
who would love to be able to be in that press briefing room and actually ask

43
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.750
legitimate questions that would inform the American public. But, but they don't,

44
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:42.390
they play these gotcha games. Now the last question is like,

45
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.160
what do you want to say to people who are upset with you right now? It's like,

46
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:48.600
what, how is, how does that a good.

47
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.650
<v 1>Question? How's a news right.</v>

48
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.400
<v 2>In the middle of Japan. I mean, it was,</v>

49
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.510
it's so utterly absurd and unnecessary.

50
00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.680
I actually have a list of questions. I don't want to read them all,

51
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:02.830
but they're there, they're a complete waste of time.

52
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.050
And I think they're failing us miserably.

53
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.780
And then there's the opportunism that occurs like, listen,

54
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.580
there's if you're writing an op-ed, if you're a journalist writing an op-ed, um,

55
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.280
let's say an opinion journalist, especially, I,

56
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.210
I fully understand why you, you might, you might say,

57
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.910
you might write in your report. Okay. The president said this today,

58
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:26.650
but three weeks ago they said this, so there's been a change. That's fine.

59
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.980
That makes total sense. That that provides context to the reader.

60
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.820
Even it might be biased and whatever, but, but, but to,

61
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.660
but to only do that indirect questioning with the president,

62
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:41.350
just to try and play this gotcha game. I, it's not helpful.

63
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.430
It's not helpful at all. And it's not informing anybody. Um, in the least,

64
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:49.600
you know, you mentioned the, uh, the president talking favorably about, um,

65
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.340
the, uh, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, and you remember the,

66
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.030
the couple that ingested that out in Arizona. Um,

67
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.820
because that I, something, something similar to,

68
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:04.480
I think it's a core core queen phosphate or something like that.

69
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:08.650
It might be misspeaking its but that's an yeah, it's an ingredient on fishbowl,

70
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:11.770
cleaner fish tank cleaner. And so they saw it and they ingested it,

71
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:15.310
which was obviously a terrible idea. Nobody would, nobody told them to do that.

72
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.060
Um, and then the media, the media, instead of saying, wow,

73
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:21.790
this is a shame that they take, get this,

74
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.300
they blame the president and they blame the president for talking about what,

75
00:04:26.301 --> 00:04:31.240
what is a at least anecdotally, a proven way to combat this disease.

76
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.240
We don't know through clinical trials, whether, uh,

77
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.040
in mass it will actually work, but, but to express optimism over it, um,

78
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.450
it does seem to be a, a punishable offense.

79
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.030
But the outrage mob is, is, was,

80
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.720
was fully invested in this kind of outrage reasoning to, to,

81
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:53.020
to tear down the president over this. And it just, it just feels so unnecessary.

82
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:55.270
I mean, oh, that's right. That's why I wrote this book.

83
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.600
But the book is about outrage culture. Um, in our, in our,

84
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:03.430
like in this sort of weird new cultural need to just go after each

85
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.990
other in the worst of ways.

86
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.230
<v 1>What is it? There's a new ability to do that. I mean,</v>

87
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:11.110
this is what it is with these new tools that people have through social media

88
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.530
and through making these viral video clips,

89
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.640
which is what each reporter is hoping they're going to accomplish by being

90
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:21.250
combative with the president and trying to catch him on something.

91
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.070
They're hoping that they're going to create this viral video that's gonna

92
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.150
accelerate their career.

93
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.220
It's it's very self-aggrandizing it's and it's disturbing that there's,

94
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.840
there's not someone who stands out that does these sort of press

95
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:36.370
junkets that doesn't do that.

96
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.290
<v 2>Yeah. Um,</v>

97
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.970
I actually write about that exact point in my book like this w w we've begun to

98
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:45.910
do is reward this sort of,

99
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.370
I would say overly passionate, emotional behavior. So we,

100
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:55.870
we we've replaced sophisticated reasoning with outrage.

101
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.450
You know, we, we we've to change who we actually view as heroes.

102
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:02.540
This is how I describe it. We all have hero archetypes. Okay. And like,

103
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.140
we grew up this way and there's, there's like fictional characters,

104
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:09.540
like the Jetta, like that's a, that's like a hero archetype for Superman.

105
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.180
We kind of look up to this person or, or like, or like real characters,

106
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:16.100
like Rosa parks or Jesus. Like there's,

107
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:19.620
there's people that we actually look up to and we identify with,

108
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.550
and there are certain attributes that we use and we say, I want to be like that.

109
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:26.270
And so when I act in public, I'm going to, I'm going to,

110
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.600
I'm going to access that attribute and I'm going to be better. And according,

111
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:30.950
according to that archetype,

112
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.700
and we've sort of turned that on a Ted and in our,

113
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:36.260
in our current outrage mob culture,

114
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.650
like we see somebody who plays the victim and we cheer them on.

115
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.760
When the reality, what we used to do is see somebody who overcame the adversity,

116
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.600
who was a true hero. And then we cheered them on we've totally reversed that.

117
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.040
And like, so and so,

118
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.060
and so you actually get more points if you're more snarky,

119
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:55.070
if you're meaner, if you're, if you're,

120
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.400
if you're playing this kind of cheap shot game. And like, in my book,

121
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:01.480
I use this example of like these, these, this group of veterans, they,

122
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:05.120
they were waiting for me in my office that was going on.

123
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.550
And, um, I knew something was off because the veterans, my age, they,

124
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.530
we never wear the, like the ball cap, you know,

125
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.530
like with the gold letters that say veteran on it, we never wear that.

126
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.360
But these guys were wearing that. So that was,

127
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.700
that was my first sign that something was different about these guys,

128
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:22.220
but they just asked for a picture and, um, I figured that was it.

129
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:26.060
And then we'd keep going. But, uh, the second thing that was off was like, they,

130
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.320
they weren't, um, they weren't looking at the camera, they were fiddling as,

131
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:33.110
as I was like posing for this camera for this photo.

132
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:34.370
And I thought that was strange.

133
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.520
And it turns out they were just getting their own video camera ready to record.

134
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:39.440
And then they start following me and like, just go nuts.

135
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:44.420
Like they lose their minds, um, talking about Trump and, you know, uh, uh,

136
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.700
betraying the country and just all this nonsense.

137
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.070
And so there was just trying to have a.

138
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.940
<v 1>Gotcha moment with.</v>

139
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.180
<v 2>You. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Th th this is what they do. They're a,</v>

140
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.600
they're an activist group and they'll they'll corner people like me and try and

141
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:59.390
get like a viral video going. And then, you know,

142
00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:01.960
it's up to me at that point to just like, understand what's happening.

143
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.290
It just kind of walked silently.

144
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:05.720
And then I kind of engage with them in some funny ways, but they were,

145
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.290
they were becoming extremely emotional. I mean, their voices started to crack.

146
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.520
It was, which was, you know.

147
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.000
<v 1>Who knows what that's saying about you or to you?</v>

148
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.700
<v 2>Oh, how, how could you, how could you let,</v>

149
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.580
how could you betray the country by supporting the president? I mean,

150
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:21.890
things like that, mostly sloganeering like this,

151
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:25.820
wasn't like a deep conversation by any means, but, but that's the point,

152
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:31.160
the point is, is that they're rewarded for that, like overly emotional, um,

153
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.650
in motion, like, you know, filming while,

154
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:37.400
while walking type of type of scenario. And then they like,

155
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.310
and then there's this whole deal where I have to get in the elevator,

156
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.160
because that's how I get to the votes. Like I leave my,

157
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.500
my office on the fourth floor in cannon.

158
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.140
I take the elevator down to the basement. I walk across, like,

159
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.420
that's just my route. And so,

160
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.050
but what they do is as I get into the elevator, they're like, Joe,

161
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:56.160
he's hiding from us, running away from us.

162
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:59.040
And the Newsweek like writes up the same story. Like, there's this,

163
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:03.580
there's this entire culture behind this notion that, that,

164
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.580
that you, that you have to use as much emotion as possible. And as an express,

165
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.550
your anger in, in the most exceptional of ways,

166
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.300
otherwise it's not worth listening to, but we haven't stopped as a culture.

167
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.580
We have to stop rewarding it. And that's what I talked about.

168
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:21.150
We have to stop rewarding, that kind of behaviors that actually ceases to

169
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.210
control us that way.

170
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.100
<v 1>Well, they accomplished what they wanted to do.</v>

171
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:27.420
We're talking about them right now,

172
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.600
although you didn't give up their name good for you, but you,

173
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.570
you talked about them and that's what they wanted. I mean,

174
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.490
there's so many groups out there that are,

175
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.420
I don't even know if they have an end game, the end game seems to be,

176
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:41.460
just get attention and, you know,

177
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.850
and shine the light on these atrocities or whatever, the,

178
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.620
whatever they feel like is an atrocity.
