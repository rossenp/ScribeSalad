00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.763
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 1>That is what, what I like, why,</v>

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.000
why conservatives have to care more about government? That's something I like,

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.920
one of my pet causes is look like we are living in a society where

5
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:17.880
the culture is against you. Like we are living in a society where, you know,

6
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.400
the cultural elite, the commanding Heights of American culture,

7
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:24.240
and you're living in a society where you don't have real power there. And so,

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.030
and you're also living a society where you have corporate America look at these

9
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.030
protests right now, Amazon supports the protests, right?

10
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:33.270
Like Amazon supports the protests, Citibank CEO.

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.160
It's it's the people with the most accumulated capital in America are

12
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:41.310
also on the side of this protest. Why? Because in my view,

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.130
they use identity politics and racial politics.

14
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:47.340
They want to split the country along those lines every single day that we're

15
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:51.000
talking about identity politics and having debates about race.

16
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.880
<v 2>Really want to split the country along the lines.</v>

17
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:55.680
I think they just want support for their company.

18
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.330
And they think that it's a good PR move.

19
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.630
<v 0>It's a good brand. It's a brand new move. And here's the thing is,</v>

20
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.380
and this goes back to the coalitions of the parties, right?

21
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:09.150
So the democratic party caters largely to these like white affluent women

22
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:13.440
basically is like the base that they mostly, right. I know this space. Well,

23
00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:14.640
I'm closely affiliated.

24
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.473
<v 2>With the space.</v>

25
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.150
<v 0>The joke, the joke of base, right? And so, you know,</v>

26
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:26.130
for those, for people who are more or less doing well, as things are right,

27
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.630
they've got their health insurance,

28
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.750
they've got a job where they're treated like a human being with humanity.

29
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:34.980
They can get their UberEATS, they can get whatever they want on demand, right?

30
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:39.870
Their way of virtue signaling is on identity issues.

31
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:44.700
And if you only confine the conversation on

32
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.170
policing too, like let's deal with this. Let's, let's have more body cameras.

33
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:53.280
Like if you keep it in that lane, that's very comfortable for them, right?

34
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.580
If you have a broader conversation about a society that, you know,

35
00:01:56.581 --> 00:02:01.560
has decimated unions has decimated working class power about who has power

36
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:05.010
in the society and why like that's more of a threat to them. So yes,

37
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.490
for corporate brands, it's very comfortable to have like,

38
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.180
let's have a diversity initiative. It's less comfortable to say no, no,

39
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.550
let's actually value the worth of everyone.

40
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.470
Let's actually have a different set of power.

41
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.760
Let's actually not have corporations able to give on lemon and limited money and

42
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:23.880
buy off our politicians and then be able to go work on your boards, et cetera,

43
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:26.430
et cetera. Like that's a very non-threatening conversation.

44
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:29.790
That's how you end up with was a bank of America who sponsored the movement,

45
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:34.440
continues what black lives matter. The movement continues with DeRay McKesson,

46
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:35.670
who is a prominent activist.

47
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.650
<v 2>The cynical is there, uh,</v>

48
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.490
another reason why Amazon would support this protest,

49
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.160
that this is kind of the death of retail. I mean,

50
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:46.830
this is one of the final nails in the coffin of retail.

51
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.480
When you think about investing your money in a brick and mortar store with a

52
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.220
glass window, after all this horseshit.

53
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.570
<v 1>I, I won't cite.</v>

54
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:57.660
Who told me this was a very prominent person in the field of economics and was

55
00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:57.841
like,

56
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:02.800
my conspiracy theory is that Jeff Bezos wants 10 to 15% unemployment

57
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.800
because then what's the best job in the world, Joe, in rural place,

58
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.940
Amazon warehouse.

59
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.340
<v 2>Dropping off those bricks. Who's better at delivering than Amazon,</v>

60
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.760
Amazon prime delivery.

61
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.240
<v 1>You should, you should be more cynical because that, I mean, look,</v>

62
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.950
how else do we get to a point where like the shell gas company sponsors a 1619

63
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.660
project event with Nicole, Hannah Jones are around with, so the 16, 19 project,

64
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.350
oh man, this is a real rabbit hole. So this is like, this is the New York times.

65
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.910
But at this thing that 16, 19 projects,

66
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:36.940
the year that the first slaves were brought to America and it was about

67
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:39.910
reforming the way that we talk about race and slavery in America. And so the,

68
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.890
the very first essay which she wrote,

69
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.850
which is very controversial is when she claimed that the reason for the American

70
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:49.360
revolution was because people wanted to keep their slaves,

71
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:53.650
not because of control from England. And all that, what happened is,

72
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.890
is that a bunch of very prominent historians are in the American revolution,

73
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:59.470
the civil war, and much more pan to the essay. They said,

74
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:01.540
this thing needs to be corrected. They corrected it.

75
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.030
Even then she still won the Pulitzer prize for journalism or for commentary.

76
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:10.600
I want to say for that specific essay, which was, which was there.

77
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:12.190
And they partnered,

78
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:16.510
I think it was with the Pulitzer center in order to create curriculum that

79
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:21.100
schools are now using to teach. Now, this was attacked. The 16, 19 project,

80
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.980
not at first by conservatives, of course can serve as were off.

81
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.420
It was attacked by the inner world socialist website by Trotskyites,

82
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.280
by Marxists and socialists.

83
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.310
And the reason why is because they saw it for what I see it,

84
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.430
which is that it's a cynical attempt in order to say,

85
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:38.830
America is an irredeemably racist nation.

86
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.970
That that is the only single and most pressing problem that we have in our

87
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:45.010
society. And if you hold that frame,

88
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.940
then you don't ask questions about corporate power in America.

89
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.250
You don't ask questions. Even of leaders,

90
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.610
a friend of our show is that Jelani had a fantastic appearance on our show.

91
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:57.580
I really encouraged everybody to go watch it where he talks about,

92
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.460
if you look at the black community in America,

93
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.740
which is what had the most pressing impact on their life economically and

94
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:07.180
destroyed so much of their livelihood.

95
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:09.850
It was the foreclosures under Barack Obama.

96
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.680
And it was the wipe out of black home ownership and black wealth that the,

97
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:17.890
that the 16, 19 project and the framework of politics that, that original sin,

98
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.080
which of course is the original sin, is the,

99
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:22.690
be all end all for why we are where we are today.

100
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.250
Absolves current political leaders and recent political leaders like Barack

101
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:28.270
Obama himself,

102
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.190
or like leaders in the city of Atlanta or leaders in the city of Baltimore and

103
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:37.990
that it absolves public policy, which is non-racial. And so when I say that,

104
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:42.610
why does shale gas company feel comfortable sponsoring an event in which the

105
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:46.570
main message is that is that America is an irredeemably racist nation because

106
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:48.970
they, that is one more event,

107
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.270
which is being talked about in the political zeitgeists by the cultural elite,

108
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.020
which is not talking about their own power in the marketplace.

109
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.610
And if you look at who, what is the,

110
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.300
the predominant control in your life in America?

111
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.860
It is about capital. It's not about race. It's about class class,

112
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.940
but class disproportionately affects people of color in America.

113
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.620
And so the way I look at it as that identity politics is so cynically

114
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:18.800
grafted on by the billionaire and the corporate class.

115
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:22.670
There's a reason they're all super woke and it's because they want it to be this

116
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.180
way so that we don't talk about their power in our society.

117
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.010
And I think this was a very sin,

118
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.010
like the way this all happened is kind of a crazy,

119
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:35.960
because it started out in the sociology departments and the 1970s have all

120
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:39.770
of these crazy, you know, these from the post, uh, and the sixties era,

121
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.820
they were, you know,

122
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.820
they in the sociology departments and they started cranking out all these

123
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:48.230
absolutely crazy papers around, you know, feminism and identity politics,

124
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:51.140
racial politics, all of that. And then what happened is,

125
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.470
is that the corporate America and other cultural elites, first of all,

126
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:56.480
were being indoctrinated in the university system.

127
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.030
They were going to go work at places like McKinsey and others.

128
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:02.240
And they brought their racial politics and their identity politics with them.

129
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.640
But that there had to be recognition from the top,

130
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.890
from people like Goldman Sachs, if Goldman Sachs,

131
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:11.780
if the pressure on them is to stop the way that they trade derivatives or to

132
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:15.830
put a black person on their board while they continue to do the derivatives

133
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:18.620
trading, they're going to choose that every single time. Right?

134
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.200
So they want to direct the conversation in that direction.

135
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.530
It absolves them for the sins, both, you know,

136
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:27.230
towards the economically disenfranchised in America.

137
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.720
But it's also a very cynical tool, which is that,

138
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.890
why is it that you see all these corporations scope, you know,

139
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:37.280
tweeting out black lives matter, Instagram, blackout, all that stuff.

140
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.740
How is it that you see like Knight, you know, Nike,

141
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:42.080
isn't this the great irony that Nike, you know,

142
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:45.290
went and did the whole Colin Kaepernick thing, like ad campaign.

143
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:50.000
And they still got all their looted and this and this, mostly it should go go,

144
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.720
right? I mean, I, I think that is that's the perfect example of,

145
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:56.660
they try to cynically use identity politics in America,

146
00:07:56.661 --> 00:07:59.210
split people apart to protect their power.

147
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.500
And if we start to understand that it's a lot more about class in America than

148
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:07.100
it is about race. I'm not saying that there is not racial problems in America,

149
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.270
racism that you know, all of this, but that if you focus on these classes,

150
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:15.920
shoes, it's the best way to help people up to people who are disenfranchised,

151
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.350
who are disproportionately people of color,

152
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.390
but to help everybody that's a much more,

153
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:25.250
I just don't know how else we can live in a multifaceted multifaceted

154
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.670
nation like this, which is, you know, economically heterogeneous,

155
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.390
ethnically people, you know, so many people of different ethnicity,

156
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.250
so many people of different religions. So many, I mean,

157
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:38.180
I am the son of Indian immigrants. I feel fully and completely American.

158
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.970
That's an amazing thing that didn't just happen.

159
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:44.570
It was the product of a result of very specific political choices that we made

160
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:48.800
over time. And it's moving towards that, that we needed to go towards.

161
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:49.401
And that's what,

162
00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:53.510
but by doing so what you've talked about many times about economic,

163
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:54.980
not just distribution, but about the,

164
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.450
who has power in society working class or not,

165
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.530
which is the corporate America can use the identity politics in order to make

166
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:03.300
sure that the working class doesn't continue to have that.

167
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.110
<v 0>And so you can't separate class and race because it's not an accident of course,</v>

168
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:07.890
that, um,

169
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.760
black and brown people are disproportionally the lower income and poor and

170
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:13.830
working class in society. I mean, I,

171
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.530
I see it much more simply sort of like what you were saying. It's,

172
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.110
it's virtuous, it's this like brand a branding exercise. Right.

173
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.850
And there's this whole idea.

174
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.310
I always think it's hilarious on the right of flake,

175
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.670
Facebook and Twitter or progressive, or they're liberal companies,

176
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.730
or Amazon's a liberal coming in, like, what are you talking about?

177
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:32.550
Amazon treats their workers like. They bust you. And he's like,

178
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:34.680
this is not a left company. Right.

179
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.390
But because they use those sort of branding tools and tweet out black lives

180
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:41.670
matter, which is no threat to them. And in fact,

181
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.580
as you're pointing out may very much benefit their bottom line.

182
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.080
Ultimately they're sort of,

183
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.240
they get all the benefits of being for progress and being for this rising

184
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:54.300
coalition in America without actually having to do anything,

185
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:56.040
that's going to benefit their bottom line. Yeah.
