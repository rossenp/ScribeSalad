00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 3>Our communities, it's all over the place on YouTube.</v>

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.430
But because of this current pandemic,

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.870
they feel like there's this heightened sense of responsibility. They have to,

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.130
to control the narrative. And that's, that's very disturbing to me.

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.310
And what's even more disturbing to me is how people,

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.580
when they agree with that narrative, don't understand where this all goes.

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.970
And they're, they're agreeing with that censorship. They're like, yes,

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.900
censor those people get rid of those voices, deep platform,

10
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:33.900
people that I disagree with, and they don't understand where this goes.

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.510
It's like where people are saying the people that have, uh,

12
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.170
that have been vaccinated that want a vaccine passport. Yes,

13
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.160
we should have a vaccine passport. I've been vaccinated. That's not going to,

14
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.380
it's only going to help me. I did my part.

15
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.790
I took one for the team and I went out and got vaccinated to be a good citizen.

16
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.430
<v 0>Those people who didn't them, we should have a vaccine Pentagon,</v>

17
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.140
but here's the problem with it. The vaccine passport, it doesn't end there.

18
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.460
It's going to keep going.

19
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:02.520
And it's going to lead to some sort of a social system.

20
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.050
You're going to have a social credit system,

21
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:06.810
similar to what they have happened in our lifetime. A hundred percent,

22
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.140
you're saying a hundred percent, a hundred percent. It can happen. Or, you know,

23
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.760
100% can happen in our lifetime because people will step with it.

24
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.310
They will go as long as it benefits them.

25
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.560
And as long as it aligns with their ideology,

26
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.860
they will ignore the dangers of a social credit system.

27
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.000
And they will embrace it. Yeah. If I would never thought people would be look,

28
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.130
six months ago, the white house was saying,

29
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:32.580
there's no way we would ever use some sort of a vaccine mandate.

30
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.050
Kamala said I would never take the vaccine. So did buy it.

31
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.610
Both of them said that. Yeah, they both did. But then once they got into office,

32
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:45.000
six months ago, they said we would never use a mandate.

33
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.560
We would never try to force businesses or people to be vaccinated.

34
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.870
Now they are saying that now they want you to do that.

35
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.810
Did you see that video where they're talking about Biden is talking about the

36
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:59.310
hurricane? No, no. Have you seen that? Jamie here?

37
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.500
I'll say the one where the kids laughing here,

38
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:04.680
I'll send you this one because this is the funniest one, because these,

39
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.190
these guys were watching them say this.

40
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.560
And as these guys are watching them say this, uh, it's just funny here.

41
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.910
I'm gonna send you this. Hold on one second. It's hurricane he's.

42
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.680
He's telling them they should get vaccinated before the hurricane comes. It's a,

43
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:25.860
it's obviously a joke, right? No, it's not a joke. He's been,

44
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.130
he's being dead serious, but you got to watch this. I just said to you,

45
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.900
Jamie was watching. We'll watch it on the screen.

46
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.700
We'll have a nice laugh because it's not that you shouldn't get vaccinated.

47
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:40.320
That's not what I'm saying. It's just like the narrative is so it's so

48
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:44.850
overwhelming that it applies to everything. Now it applies to the hurricane.

49
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:45.684
Play this, give me some.

50
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.720
<v 1>Hurricanes often strikes like Florida or the Gulf coast or into</v>

51
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:53.700
Texas of vital.

52
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:58.020
Part of preparing for hurricane season is to get vaccinated. Now,

53
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.880
everything is more complicated.

54
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.020
If you're not vaccinated in a hurricane or natural disaster hits.

55
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.460
<v 2>Got a hill. Does that make any sense? Okay.</v>

56
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.800
So, so people are just stepping in line saying,

57
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:16.210
don't take the vaccine. That's not what you're saying.

58
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:17.920
I think a lot of people should take the vaccine. Okay.

59
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.700
So I got a story for you here from my personal. And my dad is 79 years old.

60
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.870
Okay. A conversation came about the vaccine. He said, are you taking it? I said,

61
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.450
I'm not taking it. I was in the army and the army,

62
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:31.600
the first day of going into the army. They give you 11 air shots.

63
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.960
When you go in and you just go through, literally,

64
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:38.770
you want 11 shots of lemon shots in one day back to back to back. And you say,

65
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.260
don't move. If you move a little bit, get a scar. I mean,

66
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.180
I'll never forget this. I was 18 years old. Sure.

67
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.580
I've had plenty of vaccine in myself. It's probably why I'm a little bit off.

68
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.150
But so my dad, okay. He says, should I get the vaccine?

69
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.970
I said that it's up to you. What do you want to do? So as pat, you know,

70
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:55.030
I'm 77 years old. I said that if you're 79, do what you want to do.

71
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:57.130
So I want to get the vaccines. They went and got the vaccine. Great.

72
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.150
I didn't get the vaccine. I got COVID. So he ends up getting the vaccine.

73
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.890
And two weeks ago, he just got his negative back from COVID.

74
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.140
He got positive and he got pneumonia.

75
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.970
My dad had 79 and he is okay, he's done. He squared away.

76
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:14.380
He has nothing to worry about today.

77
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.130
Would it have been different if he didn't have the vaccine? I don't know.

78
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.200
It's like it would have most likely it would have been.

79
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:23.200
So I would've been working made sense that he took the vaccine and the benefit

80
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.950
of a friend of mine younger than in my 20 years in great shape.

81
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.220
Didn't have to shout it. Didn't take the shot. He got vaccine,

82
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:33.490
he got COVID and had pneumonia was in a hospital for four weeks.

83
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.930
Literally he was hospitalized. Right? Uh, for myself, I didn't take the vaccine.

84
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.140
There's a few reasons why I haven't taken a vaccine yet. A smile.

85
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.530
One reason why I'm taking the vaccine yet.

86
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.960
But the biggest challenge for me is the conversation of being forced to take

87
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:48.340
the vaccine. So Nicki Minaj,

88
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.730
I'm sure you kind of following the story with what's going on with Nicki Minaj,

89
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.530
cousins, testicles, cousins, testicles, and Trinidad, and people are saying,

90
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:58.060
are you kidding me about these testicles?

91
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:01.420
So what did these testicles are just massive or something happened to them?

92
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:04.720
Or it was because of a, the vaccine let's set that aside with the testicles.

93
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.950
I've never heard of testicles swelling. I haven't, I've heard of other things,

94
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:12.940
but not because of the vaccine. Yes. So, okay. So that's that part. All right.

95
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:17.830
So she goes up, then she says, I don't want to take it on her life, Joe,

96
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:19.090
you got to listen to her life.

97
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.080
It's so funny because she puts the camera and the javelin set the ceiling.

98
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.160
You're never just talking. It's the light. Right? And she says,

99
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.750
let me get this straight because, uh,

100
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.230
she put it out on Twitter that I got a call from the white house to go and have

101
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.670
a meeting at the white house with, uh, the, the health secretary.

102
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.210
And, uh, what do you call it? What? Fowchee? Right. Meeting with Fowchee.

103
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.560
And she said, I would like to come, but I would like it to be alive. Uh,

104
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.980
instead of me traveling, I'd much rather not travelers to alive and to say,

105
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.140
yeah, we don't mind doing a live. We just don't want it to be recorded.

106
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.531
She says, no,

107
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:54.430
I want it to be recorded because I want my audience to see whether this is,

108
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.890
you know, some honest with the audience. They say, well, let us think about it.

109
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.980
She has her PR rep on it and our agent on the call.

110
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.100
So it's not like she's by herself. Then a white house comes back and says, no,

111
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:06.440
we never told you that you're going to be doing this live. Right.

112
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.830
Cause she tweeted us and I got a call from white house and she says,

113
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.370
why can't I have the choice to not do it? Why can't I not have the choice,

114
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.050
the biggest contradiction for do the vaccine. I don't want to take the vaccine.

115
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.970
They're forcing her to do it. And you know,

116
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:22.690
you heard a couple of the folks from, uh,

117
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.860
I don't know what it was when they came out. And they said,

118
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
who was the lady that we were talking about? She said,

119
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:30.410
I got 2 million followers, girl. I'm not at your level with, you know,

120
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.980
22 million followers on Twitter. You know, you, you can do better, girl.

121
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:36.530
You ought to be shamed yourself for doing this because now people are not taking

122
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:41.240
a vaccine. Who's a joy, uh, what's her name? Oh, Joanne Reed.

123
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.680
I, yeah, I, I think that's what was in. So she comes back and she says,

124
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.870
just because I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it.

125
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:48.770
So why do I have to do it?

126
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:51.230
I may end up doing it because I have to go on tour and I have to do this part.

127
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:54.050
But if you're going to a point, Joe, yourself,

128
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.130
while you're talking about 100%, this is going to happen in our generation.

129
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.080
Then I ask you, are you okay with.

130
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.110
<v 0>That? Didn't say 100%. It's going to happen. I said, 100%.</v>

131
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:07.760
It could happen that we have a social credit score in this

132
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.940
country. The same people that are accepting of a vaccine passport.

133
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.040
My position is I do not believe once the government has the ability to control

134
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.830
your movement, what you do. And when you do it,

135
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.160
if they can put limitations on your freedom. And that,

136
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.690
that is what it is that it makes it easier to control people. Once they do that.

137
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.230
I do not believe they're going to leave it at a vaccine passport.

138
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.930
I agree with you. I think they're going to expand it.

139
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:37.730
And I think the next logical move is some sort of a social credit

140
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:41.990
score. And you will look at a bunch of things. Have you paid your taxes?

141
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.820
Have you, are you in debt? Do you owe money on your credit cards?

142
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.380
Are you in default of loans? Um, have you been vaccinated?

143
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:55.850
Have you, have you voted and all those things who you voted for? Well,

144
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:56.960
that would be problematic,

145
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.490
but all those things could be designed into a

146
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:04.530
social credit program where you,

147
00:08:04.531 --> 00:08:07.550
you could see in a person who has poor social credit,

148
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:11.240
a person who's been to jail for armed robbery,

149
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.250
a person who owes taxes,

150
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.030
that person would have a lower credit score and they wouldn't be allowed into

151
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:17.870
certain buildings. Why.

152
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:18.830
<v 2>Is this a bad thing?</v>

153
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.773
<v 0>Because it's control.</v>

154
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.790
It's having the ability to tell people what they can and can't do. However,

155
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:30.650
the government, if you're a free person, I mean, you've made mistakes or you're,

156
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:32.210
you know, you're trying to do better in your life,

157
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.190
but you've had some horrible scenarios in your, in your past.

158
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.540
You're,

159
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:42.980
you're supposed to be free to try to navigate and do better in your life.

160
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.300
If you're restricted and very clearly re restricted by the,

161
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.590
a set of parameters,

162
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:52.250
that's decided by other people that doesn't have to do with the law. Like,

163
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:55.520
it's not like you need to be locked up because you're a criminal. You,

164
00:08:55.521 --> 00:08:58.890
you have a social credit score. Like they're implementing in China.

165
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.190
What it does is it keeps people scared and it keeps people in line.

166
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:04.800
And it's a fantastic way to control the population.

167
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.380
And that's what it's used for. Should we do something about it?

168
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.460
I think talking about is a good thing. I think talking about it,

169
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:14.970
like we're talking about allowing people to recognize this is something that

170
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.110
could potentially happen.

171
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.910
You think there's a vaccine passport just six months ago was conspiracy theory,

172
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:23.700
nonsense. Like people were like, what the you talking about?

173
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.680
You're not going to have a vaccine passport.

174
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.980
No one was no one was accepting the fact that this was real.

175
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.050
This was the stuff that Alex Jones talked about.

176
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.000
But now it's a real thing in New York. Yeah. It's a real it's LA now. Oh yeah.

177
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:40.230
They just announced it three days right after Newsome. Right? The next day.

178
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.610
That's right. The next thing,
