00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.200
There's a thing that keeps getting repeated and it's that we only have 60 more

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.720
seasons left in, in our top soil.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.880
This is a thing that gets repeated almost as if there's no solution to this,

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.080
that because we have to feed so many people we're, we're, we're doomed. And, uh,

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.670
what you're saying, no, we just can't do it this way.

7
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:25.270
Cuz this way is unsustainable and it's unnatural to begin with.

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.910
<v 1>That's exactly right. So we, so we have to fundamentally change. We have to, we,</v>

9
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:33.590
we have to, um, we have to use our carbon,

10
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.710
our biomass strategically, which includes food scraps by the way, use,

11
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.620
use everything strategic. You can't just throw stuff away that this is,

12
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.180
this is it. Shouldn't be, this is sunlight. That's supposed to be decomposed.

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.460
I mean the fact that landfills get,

14
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.540
get green environmental awards for poking methane methane tubes in

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:56.820
the landfill and running, running the,

16
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.930
the excavation equipment on the methane from the decomposing material in a

17
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.610
landfill &lt;laugh&gt; it's it,

18
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:08.730
it it's it's shouldn't be in there. No, no it's unconscionable. No,

19
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:11.890
what we need to do is, is hook up. We, we need hookups.

20
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.250
We need to wear the waste streams, like the, uh,

21
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:21.850
move right into the, the use streams and, and you have circles,

22
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.760
not linear, not linear thinking. And I mean,

23
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.680
just ano another one for example is, um, is ponds.

24
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:32.360
A lot of people don't realize that before the Europeans came to north America,

25
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.160
north America was 8% water today. We're less than 1%.

26
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.400
I mean, I mean, surface area. Think about the United States being 80% water,

27
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.870
including eight, 8%, right? Eight, eight, I'm sorry. 8%, 8% water. I mean,

28
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:51.390
think about that in, in Utah, Nevada, New Mexico.

29
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.950
All right. Where'd all that water come from.

30
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.510
Beavers massive, massive beaver populations. I mean,

31
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:04.500
there were 200 million beavers and we now archeologically digging up

32
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.420
skeletons. Some of them were as big as a Volkswagen, uh, car. Really?

33
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.500
These were big, big, the, the mega fauna,

34
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.100
the mega fauna is incredible. I mean, it's the same as the wombats in, uh,

35
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:20.020
Australia. You know, now these wombats are like, you know, 80 pounds or little,

36
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.380
you know, little wombats.

37
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.930
Well they know by digging up skeleton used to have nine foot wombats in

38
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:29.090
Australia, nine foot wombats. So,

39
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.530
so when we look at the megafauna that was here, you know,

40
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.050
the fact is that the planet used to have more animal weight on it

41
00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:39.890
than it does today with all the animals,

42
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.570
all the factory farms and all the people. So it's,

43
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:46.560
it's not people and animals that are messing up the planet.

44
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.800
It, it it's, it's our, it's the human management of the ecosystem.

45
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.800
It's messing up. The abundance here is, is through the roof. So, so imagine,

46
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.960
imagine if, if we,

47
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.600
and this is what we've been doing on our farm is every time we get a few extra

48
00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:07.240
dollars, we build another pond. Now we're not beavers. Um, but,

49
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.280
but we have, you know,

50
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.320
we have excavation equipment that we can go in and build ponds so that when we

51
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:16.240
have a flood and, and everything is flooding,

52
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.870
we're actually trapping a lot of that. Not all of it,

53
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.790
but trapping a lot of it up on high ground permaculture style that we can then

54
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.870
dispense for irrigation in a dry time so that

55
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.150
we never pump from an aquifer.

56
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.590
That's the comments when you pump from an aquifer,

57
00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:35.390
you're depleting the comments, but if you're,

58
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.460
if you're reducing flooding and using in a drought to keep

59
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.980
vegetation growing, when there's so much sunlight,

60
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.380
then you're actually increasing the commons.

61
00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:48.660
And we believe very strongly that as a result of our farming,

62
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.140
we should not be depleting the commons.

63
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:54.420
We should be increasing the commons as a result of our,

64
00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:57.900
there should be more soil, more water, more breathable, air, more, you know,

65
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.770
more wildlife, more pollinators, more.

66
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.530
<v 0>There's also been a false narrative that it attributes.</v>

67
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.290
Most of our greenhouse gases are a significant number, uh,

68
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.770
significant percentage of our greenhouse gases coming from cows and,

69
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.530
and cow agriculture. And one of the things that they found through using, uh,

70
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.520
satellite imaging, you, and when they, when they're trying to detect methane,

71
00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:24.400
mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, they're finding its landfills,

72
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.160
that these landfills are a huge right.

73
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.400
Huge problem in terms of greenhouse gases. Yeah. That this, the,

74
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.640
the total wrong way of approaching it,

75
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:36.960
the way you were saying bur this biological material in the ground,

76
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.030
instead of using it as compost is actually not just

77
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.190
counterproductive, but it's actually detrimental. Yes.

78
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.270
It's not the wrong way to do it because it doesn't serve the soil. Yeah.

79
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.910
It actually up the air.

80
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.830
<v 1>It, it's not a zero, it's a negative, it's a negative.</v>

81
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.030
<v 0>But the same amount of biological material,</v>

82
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.070
it's just managed incorrectly,

83
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:01.620
which is really crazy when you stop and think sure it.

84
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.740
<v 1>Is. If, if all, if all the biomas that we have,</v>

85
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.260
um, uh, what's the word non-leveraged or, or,

86
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.100
or thrown away if all the biomas we've thrown away in the last, you know,

87
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.133
a hundred years,

88
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.980
if it had instead been leveraged for soil building,

89
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.970
uh, feet, chickens, I mean, you know, whatever, um, you know,

90
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.770
today we would not have all that methane.

91
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.210
And today we would have soils that were,

92
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.570
that would be a lot richer and we would have, you know, um,

93
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.690
better earthworm populations, you know, we'd have a tremendous amount of,

94
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.200
of soil, um, maintain soil, abundant fertility.

95
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.200
And so the beautiful thing is that this,

96
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.640
this is not that difficult to bring back. Uh, I mean,

97
00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:54.960
I've been preaching this message, you know, all my life,

98
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.960
and it's exciting to now suddenly have people stepping back and realize,

99
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.200
wow, you know, we just kind of put a pause button and there are now, you know,

100
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.800
dolphins in Venice, again, there's, you know,

101
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.080
in Shanghai you can see across the street, you know, there's blue. How about LA?

102
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.150
Yeah. LA I mean, amazing pictures, amazing pictures. So, so the, the,

103
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.950
when people say let's get back to normal, look,

104
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.310
I, I, I don't, I don't want, I don't want the, the, uh, whatever,

105
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.310
the, the tragedy that we're having,

106
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.190
but I also don't want to go back to normal cuz normal was this foot on

107
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.980
nature's yeah. Neck saying, you know, we're gonna, so,

108
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.020
so that's where you start saying, well, you know, what,

109
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:43.660
what does the future look? What, what could a future look like?

110
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.620
And that's where we start talking about decentralization integration, um,

111
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.980
you know, integrating our, all of our streams and, um,

112
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.380
large scale change. Oh, really large, very large scale, very,

113
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.050
very disruptive of very disruptive,

114
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.130
but everybody has a job. Everybody has a new thing. I mean,

115
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.090
my thing about the carbon economy, uh, of course, you know,

116
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:09.490
we're there in that hardwood region of Virginia, you know,

117
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:13.330
near the blue Ridge Parkway, Chino national park, all that stuff. And the,

118
00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:17.850
and the, the, the federal, uh, forests are atrocious. I mean, dead trees,

119
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.800
the fuel buildup is fuel buildup is just ridiculous. Can,

120
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.720
you know, wouldn't it be cool if, if, uh,

121
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:28.840
mommy or daddy could come home and their six year old says, you know,

122
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.560
what did you do today? And mommy and daddy are able to say, well, we,

123
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.360
we stewarded, you know, uh,

124
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.670
five acres up on Jack mountain and, um,

125
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.310
and kept it from having a fuel load to burn and took

126
00:07:47.311 --> 00:07:51.390
that biomas so that a farmer could feed his earthworms.

127
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.990
So there'd be soil for your future.

128
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.740
There'll be abundance and soil for your future. I mean, what a affirming,

129
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.230
sacred, righteous vocation, uh,

130
00:08:04.231 --> 00:08:05.590
that would be, and,

131
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:10.350
and it would affirm people who want to work outside and have callouses and

132
00:08:10.351 --> 00:08:12.470
blisters on their hands. You know, we've spent a,

133
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:17.270
we've spent a couple generations marginalizing what we call

134
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.340
blue collar mm. People, and, and, uh,

135
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.740
one of the big issues right now, as we go to an AI, uh, you know,

136
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:29.660
a techno future is what do we do with people that like

137
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:33.380
to work outside with their hands and, and sweat, you know, the, the,

138
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.700
the Michael Rowe, you know, the, the dirty jobs,

139
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.610
I'm suggesting that a carbon economy is one of many,

140
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.330
so many pathways to actually

141
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.810
envisioning a future where thousands and thousands of people would be employed

142
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.160
in healing ministries. So that we'd be caressing, our nest,

143
00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.920
you know, so many times the,

144
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.600
the idea in agriculture and the farming community is that that nature is a

145
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.240
nature, is a, a reluctant partner that we've gotta, you know,

146
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:12.880
we gotta get 'em in our wrestling hole. We gotta dominate and conclu the door,

147
00:09:12.881 --> 00:09:14.200
and we're gonna make you, you know,

148
00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:18.390
we're push you when actually nature is a benevolent lover

149
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.070
that just wants to be caressed. And we haven't,

150
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.470
and we haven't put attention on caressing in the right places for a long time.
