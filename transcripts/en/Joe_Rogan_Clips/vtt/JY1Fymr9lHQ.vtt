1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.850
<v 0>New idea of, of, of designing. I mean, when,</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.550
when you have this idea about improving planes,

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.470
are you going to bring this to somebody and you just, Chuck.

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.580
<v 1>I have a lot on my plate.</v>

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.120
<v 0>Right? This what I'm saying? I don't know.</v>

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.300
I don't know how you do what you do now, but if you keep coming up with these,

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.050
but it's gotta be hard to pawn these off on someone else either. Hey, Hey,

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.123
go do a job,

9
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.080
a good job with this vertical takeoff and landing system that I want

10
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:29.700
to implement to regular planes.

11
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.110
<v 1>The airplane electric airplane isn't necessary right now,</v>

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.760
electric cars are important and we saw energy is important.

13
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.880
Stationary storage of energy is important.

14
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.950
These things are much more important than creating electric supersonic. Vitol

15
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.510
also, uh, the planes naturally.

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.590
You really want that gravitational energy density for an aircraft. Um,

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.840
and this is improving over time. So, you know, it's,

18
00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:59.550
it's important that we accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.

19
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.500
That's why electric cars.

20
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.940
It matters whether electric cars happen sooner or later, you know, we're,

21
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:10.890
we're really playing the crazy game here with the

22
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:12.420
atmosphere and the oceans.

23
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.880
We're taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this,

24
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.830
putting this knee in the, in the atmosphere, this is crazy.

25
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.880
We should not do this. It's very dangerous.

26
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.680
So we should, we should,

27
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.140
we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.

28
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.220
I mean, the,

29
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.730
the bizarre thing is that obviously we're going to run out of oil in

30
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.510
longterm. You know, we're going to, there's only so much oil. We can,

31
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.020
we can mine it burn it's total logical.

32
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:53.250
We must have to S sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the

33
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.710
longterm. So we know that's the end point. We know that.

34
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.440
So why run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons of carbon

35
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:04.530
from underground and put it in the atmosphere on oceans.

36
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.240
This is an insane experiment. It's the dumbest experiment in human history.

37
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.660
Why are we doing this? It's crazy.

38
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.690
<v 0>Do you think this is a product of momentum that we started off doing this when</v>

39
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:20.100
it was just a few engines,

40
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:24.780
a few hundred million gallons of fuel over the whole world,

41
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.680
not that big of a deal, and then slowly but surely over a century,

42
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.570
it got out of control. And now it, it, it's not just our fuel,

43
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.480
but it's also the, I mean,

44
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.680
if fossil fuels are involved in so many different electronics,

45
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.410
so many different items that people buy,

46
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.120
it's just this constant desire for fossil fuels, constant need for oil,

47
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.780
without consideration of the system.

48
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.250
<v 1>The ability, the things like oil, oil, coal gas, let's see easy money,</v>

49
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.200
right? It's easy money. So.

50
00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.590
<v 0>Have you about clean.</v>

51
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.880
<v 1>Coal? The president's been tweeting about it. It's gotta be real clean coal,</v>

52
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.230
all caps. Did you see used all caps, clean coal?

53
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.450
Um, well, you know,

54
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.970
it's very difficult to put that CO2 back in the ground.

55
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.610
It doesn't like being in solid form. Have you.

56
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.780
<v 0>Like that?</v>

57
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.370
Like some sort of a filter giant building sized filter sucks carbon out of the

58
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.204
atmosphere?

59
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.610
<v 1>No, no, no. He, doesn't not possible. No. Nope, Nope, no, Nope. Definitely not.</v>

60
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.033
No, we're not.

61
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.880
I mean, this is a quite a complex question, right. You know,

62
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:45.050
we're really just when the,

63
00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:49.690
the more carbon we take out of the ground and add to the atmosphere and a lot of

64
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:54.220
it gets permeated into the oceans. The more dangerous it is. Like,

65
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.260
I don't think right now,

66
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.980
I think we're okay right now we can probably even add some more,

67
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.500
but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow.

68
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.940
Like that. There's a vast base of industry,

69
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.360
vast transportation system,

70
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:18.010
like this there's two and a half billion cars and trucks in the world. So,

71
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.480
and the new car and truck production, if it was a hundred percent electric,

72
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.610
that's only about a hundred million per year. So it would take,

73
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.350
if you could snap your fingers and it's instantly turn all

74
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.260
old cars and trucks electric,

75
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.550
it would still take 25 years to change the transport base to electric.

76
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.491
Makes sense,

77
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:46.210
because how long does it truck car truck last before it goes into the junkyard

78
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:48.610
and gets crushed about 20 to 25 years.

79
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.450
<v 0>Is there a way to accelerate that process,</v>

80
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:56.070
like some sort of subsidies or some encouragement from the government

81
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:56.904
financially?

82
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.921
<v 1>Well, the,</v>

83
00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:03.780
the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherent subsidy in any

84
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.120
oil burning device. Any,

85
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.100
any power plant or car is fundamentally, uh,

86
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.750
consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere,

87
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.340
or just say atmosphere for short. Um, so like you can say, okay,

88
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:24.120
there's a certain probability of something

89
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.700
bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere.

90
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.460
And so there's some uncertain number where if we put too

91
00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:38.040
much carbon in the atmosphere, things overheat,

92
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.420
oceans, warm up ice caps,

93
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:46.260
melt ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable

94
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.740
underwater. And, and, but it's not clear what that number is,

95
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:57.120
but it's definitely a scientist would all it's really quite the scientists

96
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.610
scientific consensus is overwhelming. Um,

97
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.190
overwhelming, I mean, I don't know any serious scientists, actually zero,

98
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.400
literally zero who don't think that,

99
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.710
you know that,

100
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.240
but we have quite a serious climate risk that we're facing.

101
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.673
And so

102
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.260
that's fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every

103
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.800
fossil fuel burning thing, power plants,

104
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.370
aircraft car, frankly, even rockets. I mean, rockets use, uh,

105
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.900
you know, they burn, they burn fuel, but there's just, you know, with rockets,

106
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:42.590
there's just no other way to get to orbit, unfortunately.

107
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.560
So it's the only way, but with cars,

108
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.150
there's definitely a better way with electric cars and to

109
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.080
generate the energy do so with photovoltaics, because we've got a giant.

110
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.480
Then when you clear reactor in the sky called the sun,

111
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.010
it's great sort of shows up every day, very reliable.

112
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.780
So if you can generate energy from solar panels stored with batteries,

113
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.620
you can have energy 24 hours a day. Um,

114
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.840
and then you can, you know, consent to the polls,

115
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.760
ordinate near to the north, uh, with, uh, you know, high voltage lines.

116
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.110
Also the north Northern,

117
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:25.550
Northern PA parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well.

118
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.850
Um, but anyway, all, all fossil fuel power things have an inherent subsidy,

119
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:36.230
which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans.

120
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.970
So people tend to think of like, why,

121
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.610
why should electric vehicles have a subsidy,

122
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:45.500
but they're not taking into account.

123
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.700
That's all fossil fuel burning vehicles

124
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.180
fundamentally are subsidized by the cost,

125
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.490
the environmental cost to earth,

126
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.060
but nobody's paying for it. We are going to pay for it, obviously in the future,

127
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:05.300
we will pay for it. It's just not paid for now.

128
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:11.400
<v 0>And what is the bottleneck in regards to electric cars and trucks and things</v>

129
00:08:11.401 --> 00:08:13.200
like that? Is it battery capacity?

130
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.960
<v 1>Yeah. I've got to scale up production, got to make the car compelling,</v>

131
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.700
make it better than gasoline or diesel cars.

132
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.550
<v 0>Make it more efficient in terms of like the distance it can travel.</v>

133
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:27.660
You've got to be able to go.

134
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.780
<v 1>Far out far enough recharge fast, your Roadster.</v>

135
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.380
<v 0>You're anticipating 600 miles. Is that correct?</v>

136
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.040
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. We, what does, what does that.</v>

137
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.340
<v 0>Sound right now? Like if you driven one, 600 miles now.</v>

138
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.370
<v 1>No, we can totally make one right now. That would be 600 miles,</v>

139
00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:48.410
but the thing is too expensive. So it's like the car is better,

140
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.180
more so Well, you know,

141
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.810
it's just have a 200 kilowatt hour pack battery pack and you can go 600 miles.

142
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.723
<v 0>What do you have now?</v>

143
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.410
<v 1>330 Mile range. So that's plenty.</v>

144
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.630
<v 0>What does that in terms of kilowatts?</v>

145
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.810
<v 1>Well, that would be for a model S a hundred kilowatt hour pack.</v>

146
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.810
We'll do about 330 miles, maybe 3 35,

147
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.140
or some people have hyper milder to 500 miles.

148
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:16.890
<v 0>Hyper mild it.</v>

149
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.480
<v 1>What does it go on.</v>

150
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.520
<v 0>45 Miles an hour or something.</v>

151
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.140
<v 1>Like 30 miles an hour. So it was like an on level ground with a pump,</v>

152
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:26.430
the tires up really well.

153
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:30.750
I'd go on a smooth surface and then you can go for a long time. Um,

154
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.800
but like definitely comfortably do 300 miles zero.

155
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.810
This is fine for most people. Uh, usually 200 or 250 miles is fine.

156
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.680
300 miles is you don't even think about it.

157
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.480
<v 0>It really, is there any possibility that you could use solar power,</v>

158
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.020
solar powered one day, especially in Los Angeles. I mean,

159
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.900
as you said about that giant nuclear reactor, a million times bigger than earth,

160
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.950
just floating in the sky.

161
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.020
Is it possible that one day you'll be able to just power all these cars just on

162
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:02.610
solar power? I mean, we don't ever have cloudy days if we do this three of them.

163
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.990
<v 1>Well, the surface area of a car is</v>

164
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.320
without making the car like really blocky, um, or having some like a G wagon.

165
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.830
Yeah. Like, and just like having to look a lot of surf Sarah, where like,

166
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:19.980
maybe like solar panels fold out or something like your E-Class.

167
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.450
<v 0>That's what we needed. The type. Yeah. That the,</v>

168
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:29.370
a Jaguar E type with a giant long hood that could be a giant solar panel.

169
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.811
<v 1>What the beginning of Tesla,</v>

170
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:35.310
I did want to have this like unfolding solar panel thing. They'd press a button.

171
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:38.160
And it would just like unfold. These solar panels. I'm like charge,

172
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.390
recharge your car in the parking lot. Ah, yeah, we could do that,

173
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:46.020
but I think it's probably better to just put that on your roof. Right.

174
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.960
And then it's going to be facing the sun all the time,

175
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:51.930
because otherwise your car could be in the shade. It could be in the shade.

176
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.640
It could be in a garage or something like that. Yeah.
