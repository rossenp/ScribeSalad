00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.920
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know, what's good about that too.</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.880
If you're ever in a real altercation,

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.040
you're used to people resisting a hundred percent. Um, cause like,

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.240
if you're like a karate guy and you used to like point touching each other and

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.240
did you see that.

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.440
<v 1>Karate? I, I was about to, to bring it up. It was unbelievable.</v>

7
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.120
The guy was unbelievable basket.

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.240
<v 0>By not he wins. How do you feel? Pretty.</v>

9
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.630
<v 1>Loses. He, how do you feel PR you get knocked out. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.990
In the gold medal matchup and you win the gold and the other guy's disqualified.

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.430
He's.

12
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.390
<v 0>Disqualified for hitting you too, too hard.</v>

13
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.630
<v 1>And, and here's the thing that was up. Like,</v>

14
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.430
it's not like he was standing there. He kind of leaned in to the kick,

15
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.470
like he bent over and the dude caught him.

16
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.110
So it's kind of on you a little bit too.

17
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
<v 0>Yeah. Let's watch it. Let's watch it. Cuz it's so dumb. And uh,</v>

18
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.780
I didn't a friend of mine sent that to me and look at this. Here it is. Look.

19
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.540
<v 1>At this. Look, he, he bends over.</v>

20
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.093
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.460
<v 1>And to be honest, it's the counter. The guy throws a straight left.</v>

22
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.020
He counters with the kick. Catches him, hit him. Then he just fake sleeping. Oh,

23
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:01.020
he's outta here dude.

24
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.090
<v 0>He's sleeping.</v>

25
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.010
<v 1>Oh, he thought he won too poor guy. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.850
<v 0>Well he should have won in a real world scenario and any other rational sport.</v>

27
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:12.730
That's a combat sport. He won. That's what.

28
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.530
<v 1>The problem with like Olympic combat sports is they try to take the violence out</v>

29
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:15.610
of.

30
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.810
<v 0>It. But what doesn't make any sense is you could win by knockout and TaeKwonDo.</v>

31
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.120
Oh, I didn't know that that's in the same thing. Uh it's in the Olympics too.

32
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.920
Like why you specifically, why, what is the difference?

33
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.360
Why do you have karate and TaeKwonDo? Yeah.

34
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.280
Like the only difference is you're you're allowed to punch in the face in this.

35
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.040
And is it point karate? Is that what it is? I heard it was Kue I don't know.

36
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.880
I don't know though. Kue is the Japanese word for sparring. Okay. So yeah,

37
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.350
that doesn't make sense. I just heard someone saying it while I was watching.

38
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.310
I think that's the word for sparring? I think that's what it.

39
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.910
<v 1>Means. I mean, they got all the different types of swimming,</v>

40
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.670
so I guess you're gonna have all the different types of martial arts. You know,

41
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.270
you gotta do things to stack the metals, right?

42
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:55.750
Like if you're good at some like America, we're good at running.

43
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.710
So we're just gonna okay.

44
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.310
<v 0>45 Kilogram Kue final. Yeah. So dumb. Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.340
Ridiculous. Oh they, oh, so they have, uh,

46
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.140
individual demonstrations like kata and then they have one on one Kue.

47
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.540
<v 1>That's the most ridiculous one. I'm not trying to shoot on this guy.</v>

48
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.940
You probably kick my, but the guy won a gold medal for dancing.

49
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.060
<v 0>Getting KA. Oh yeah. For the kata.</v>

50
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.940
<v 1>For the kata. Yeah. But it was just choreography.</v>

51
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.770
<v 0>Well, you could win for gymnastics &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

52
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.570
<v 1>Yeah, but gymnastics, isn't a fight. Like I, I see martial arts as you know,</v>

53
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.410
this is fighting. Right, right, right. In order to be good at it,

54
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.010
you have to be able to do that on someone.

55
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.010
<v 0>The, the kata thing is like, you would have to learn those to get your belts.</v>

56
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.050
Like you'd have a co for one specific one that you had for blue belt,

57
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.880
a specific one you had for green belt. I remember.

58
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.680
<v 1>When I did TaeKwonDo as a kid, we had that. Yeah. You had.</v>

59
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.800
<v 0>To learn all the, yeah.</v>

60
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.400
<v 1>I hated those. What? The TaeKwonDo? This stuff.</v>

61
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.793
<v 0>Right? Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.400
The forms PO say America gold does here. It,

63
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.720
he won the first E karate metal in men's kata,

64
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.760
the first ever for America, the first ever time they handed it out, uh,

65
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.720
America. So ridiculous. His face, the intensity so serious.

66
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.920
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. The thing is like,

67
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.040
it's not a bad thing to practice.

68
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.270
Like it's almost like kind of like a form of yoga in a way,

69
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.910
like you're practicing, moving your body.

70
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.190
And if you get really good at doing those, katas,

71
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:30.070
it'll probably enhance your ability to move,

72
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:33.750
which will enhance your ability to spark. But you're not giving anybody a,

73
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.790
a medal for shadow boxing. Good point. That'd be ridiculous. Good point.

74
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.540
Grew around. I'm a boxing gold medalist,

75
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.460
a gold medal for shadow boxing or hitting the Cobra bag.

76
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.140
You know, that's a bag work gold.

77
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.740
&lt;laugh&gt; the bag where gold medal be better than this.

78
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.100
Cause we could at least see something. Land air kicks. Yeah. Like, you know,

79
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.050
this poor guy just got back to America with his gold medal. Just,

80
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.810
this is the guy he, they were going against each other though. Oh, and this guy,

81
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.490
how do you do? Oh, they, they judge it. They judge the, the karate, the,

82
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.810
the KA rather. Yeah. We used to have those tournaments in TaeKwonDo tournaments.

83
00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:16.970
They would have the, the kata version or the, I forget what they call it.

84
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.010
I think it's called PO set.

85
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:21.280
They call it Korean and then they would of the sparring part.

86
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.080
You'd have to wait around while these dumies threw air kicks and,

87
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.280
and kicks. Yeah. Yeah. Watch the entire episode for free. Only on Spotify.
