00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.420
<v 1>Do you know when I was a teenager? I was, so I was very, you know, I was young.</v>

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:09.030
I was drinking and I remember I was so anticline,

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.840
I'd read some book on the KU Klux Klan, and it was the preacher for the clan.

5
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.760
His name was in the book. So I called the information. Um,

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.850
I called the FBI and I tried to stop a Klan rally,

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.350
but I called this guy at home, this, this Klan preacher. And I started, uh,

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.800
you know, that's wrong, you're a racist, you know, it was 14. And,

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.650
and he told me like, oh, I left the Klan. I'm not in the cloud anymore.

10
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:34.470
And he actually talked to me for a few minutes. Wow. Yeah. But I was a,

11
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:35.370
before you could, you know,

12
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.430
I was just 14 and drunk and trying to make a difference. How cool.

13
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.260
<v 0>Is that though? That he talked, he did talk.</v>

14
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
<v 1>To me. Yeah. And I'll never forget it. And I, my father,</v>

15
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:44.550
I think knew I was drinking afterwards.

16
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.860
Cause he's like he heard some of the conversation,

17
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:50.880
but I think it started with me calling the FBI where the C I could you call the

18
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:53.940
FBI a few times back then you call the FBI. That's what I would do it. I drank,

19
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:57.150
yeah. It was a crazy person. I called the FBI.

20
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.350
<v 0>I remember when I met you, like, we were probably early twenties. Right? Yup.</v>

21
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.990
And I was like, why'd you quit drinking. And you're like,

22
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.870
why'd you quit doing drugs? And you're like, I had two.

23
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.000
<v 1>Yeah. I called a bomb threat into my high school.</v>

24
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.340
I remember I cleared the high school. I did that when I was,

25
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.010
I want to say I was 17 or 18. And we used to get drunk in my friend's house.

26
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:18.090
And there was a, there was a,

27
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:21.030
some number you could call for like help from nuns.

28
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.840
So I would have my friends sitting around and I would always call up and pretend

29
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:25.081
that like,

30
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:28.380
I would make up these horrible incest stories and terrible sexual things that

31
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:29.161
were happening to me.

32
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:32.580
And my friends would be laughing and the nuns would be trying to counsel me on

33
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:35.220
the phone. Oh Jesus. And then I called a bomb threat.

34
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.850
I did it a couple of times and it didn't work. And the third time I did it,

35
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:40.980
the final time I did it, uh,

36
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.950
they actually had people leave the school and go outside while they searched the

37
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:44.784
school.

38
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
<v 0>Drunk bomb threats. Didn't TJ Miller to that recently.</v>

39
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.230
<v 1>It was something with him on a train, but it wasn't a thread. He,</v>

40
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.090
I think he had something with a woman.

41
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.680
<v 0>But didn't he call a bomb threat in.</v>

42
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.960
<v 1>I don't know if it was a threat or if he thought she only had one,</v>

43
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.610
like I never got the full story.

44
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.800
<v 0>That she really had one. I bet. I don't know.</v>

45
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.290
<v 1>I remember reading it and I don't remember what the conclusion was.</v>

46
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.970
<v 0>Really up. When you think somebody might have a bomb, like paranoia, like real,</v>

47
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:12.570
like full-blown paranoid. Like I remember, um, you know, uh, Jim brewer,

48
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.490
of course it was a legendary pothead.

49
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.240
And one time he quit and he quit for quite a while. And I said, well,

50
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:21.510
why why'd you quit? He goes, dude. He goes, I started getting really paranoid,

51
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.700
like paranoid that people were listening to me.

52
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:26.730
And the people were following me and watching me, it was not healthy.

53
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.180
It was not good. And you know, I wonder about that.

54
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.380
Like when you perturb normal states of consciousness,

55
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.450
when you take like the normal way you are,

56
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.040
and you start changing a little bit with a little bit of booze,

57
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.530
a little bit of booze, a little bit of anxiety, a little bit of depression,

58
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.200
a little bit of bad things. A little bit of this,

59
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:47.310
a little bit that I'll take a little Xanax, take the edge off,

60
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.280
then I'll take a Valium so I can go to sleep. Then I'll take a, uh, an ambient,

61
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.500
if the volume doesn't work and you keep going and going and going and going,

62
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.540
you're, you're like, you know how,

63
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.630
like there's certain things you can do that can give you arthritis, right?

64
00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:00.610
There's certain things that corrode your so certain things you can do that,

65
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.540
that make you Tylee, the more chemicals you insert in your body,

66
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.740
the more things you do,

67
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.940
the more you shift from like your comfortable baseline of who you are when

68
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:14.320
you're at your, your healthiest, you change, you become a different thing.

69
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.670
And I think pot is just as likely to do that as anything.

70
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.080
If you're doing it the wrong way, if you abuse it, I think alcohol can do it.

71
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:27.130
I think pot can do pills. Speed. I think all those things can surely do it,

72
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:31.750
but it's strange to see when someone starts to slip away and they start to

73
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:36.550
go towards, it's like very strange version of themselves that,

74
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.990
you know, they don't have control anymore.

75
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.450
Is that how you felt like when you were a kid?

76
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.780
<v 1>I'm a very young age. It was a weird, but I was very addicted.</v>

77
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:46.570
It was like sexual addiction first. That was the first one. I mean,

78
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:47.404
sexual addiction was.

79
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.810
<v 0>You, you were drinking when you were 13.</v>

80
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.080
<v 1>You said? Yeah, but I mean, there was a child. I was sexually active as a kid,</v>

81
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:58.060
like, I've said 10 sexual partners before fourth grade. What?

82
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.030
I've never told you that yell. Yeah. How, how was that possible?

83
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.750
I was blown all my friends. I was a, I couldn't stop.

84
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.700
How did that get started? You know, I don't remember the first one,

85
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.250
but I remember there's a picture.

86
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.990
I can date it because I there's a picture of me when I was a kid.

87
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:21.010
When I split my head open and I was, I remember I split my head, open,

88
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:25.930
running from the boy who was a year older than me and I used to blow him,

89
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.880
but I was scared of him. He was, uh, he was terrorized me, but I would, uh,

90
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.400
I remember him trying to me with lunch too, but I was, I couldn't do it.

91
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:35.500
Like I vaguely remember I was in the hallway. My pants were down.

92
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.900
His Dick always smelled like I moth balls because dude,

93
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.200
he wore Budweiser bathing trunks.

94
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.650
They had Budweiser on them and he wore a Budweiser bait, but it wasn't anything.

95
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:48.400
Trump.

96
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.130
<v 0>Moth balls in his drawer, his dress he must have. But.</v>

97
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.350
<v 1>That smell is, is a visceral memory I have of that kid.</v>

98
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:57.220
He's the kid that in my mouth. I,

99
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.680
I was at a public pool in Edison, New Jersey. This is how young I was.

100
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:05.710
I didn't know that. So I went and he, I was blowing them under water.

101
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.060
And then he goes, I popped up cause he in my mouth. So I popped up. I'm like,

102
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:11.260
don't do that anymore. Anyway,

103
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.740
I put my foot down and then went back and he did it again.

104
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:18.820
So I stopped blowing him at that moment. He my mouth twice. The pool.

105
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.790
<v 0>Dude. That is hilarious. You're blowing them in the pool. Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.400
<v 1>I didn't think people could see the water. I was so young if I can't see them,</v>

107
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:25.234
they can't see me

108
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.510
at the photo I had with the split on my head is 1973. So I was five.

109
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.740
So I know at that age I was already involved. So I have a,

110
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.840
an absolute photo that dates. Exactly.

111
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.480
<v 0>So you were blown kids when you were five? Yeah.</v>

112
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.670
So what do you think started that off?

113
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.230
<v 1>No, it must've been, you know, just one kid, one kid opened the door,</v>

114
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.660
the rest of us ran through it. I mean, I don't know.

115
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.890
I just don't know what started. I have very vague fleeting memories.

116
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.190
<v 0>So at five years old you were all sexually active. You and your buddies.</v>

117
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.700
And then.

118
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 1>He got a little older 6, 7, 8, like, you know, it was, uh,</v>

119
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.270
I don't remember who was first. Who was second?

120
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:08.180
I remember when my one friend got erections and I didn't get him. Like,

121
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:10.090
I didn't know what they were. And then he was five.

122
00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:14.630
He was getting reminded in 66. She might've, he might've been six or seven.

123
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.010
<v 0>At six years.</v>

124
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.150
<v 1>Old. But I remember not knowing we used to count sucks. That's what it would do.</v>

125
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:23.000
Like, all right, I'll give you 10 and you give me 10. So you would have one

126
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.630
and you would count. You develop.

127
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.570
<v 0>Technique. Did you figure out like what's the best way to suck a Dick? I don't.</v>

128
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.550
<v 1>Know at that age, I don't think so.</v>

129
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.860
Cause I think it was all about getting you to do me after.

130
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.820
I think that was kind of the goal. Right? Of course. But there was a lot of it,

131
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:38.720
man. And I have it again.

132
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:41.990
I can date it because I moved Halloween of fourth grade to north Brunswick.

133
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.290
So any experience that happened with in this place?

134
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:46.550
I know what happened before then.

135
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.110
<v 0>Yeah. Wow. That's crazy. So do you think that this kid,</v>

136
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.840
did you know that if this kid was molested?

137
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.520
<v 1>Oh no. I mean, there had to be,</v>

138
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:59.780
somebody had to be getting because there's no way all of us were that

139
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.880
sexually active for no reason. I just don't remember. I have too many memories,

140
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.170
like, uh, being in a basement and then not exactly remembering,

141
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:13.880
I have weird memories possibly with adults. Like it's kind of like watching, uh,

142
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.260
it fades in and out and I wish my memory was better, but.

143
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.400
<v 0>No one's really is, you know,</v>

144
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:22.160
that's the weird thing about memories when it comes to being, you know,

145
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:26.660
a young person, no, one's memories are very good. You have like flashes.

146
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:30.740
I have like some things that I definitely remember. Cause they're like facts.

147
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.280
Like when I was seven, we drove across the country. You know, I remember those.

148
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.000
I remember we got in an accident on Lombard street in San Francisco, you know,

149
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:39.980
that's like the crooked street in the world. Right.

150
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.560
I remember that because I remember someone tried to pass us and I remember it

151
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.250
scratched the car. I remember that. But like there's little tiny things.

152
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:49.340
Like sometimes I'll talk to my sister or I'll talk to my mom. She was like,

153
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:51.110
do you remember that thing? And then all sudden it's like,

154
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:55.490
I open up a folder like, oh yeah, I remember that guy. Whatever happened to him,

155
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.960
you know, like that guy didn't exist in my brain until a couple of sex. Right.

156
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.470
And then I'm like, oh, look at this old folder,

157
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.230
let's open up my old memory of that fella. You know.

158
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.730
<v 1>Sometimes those are scary though.</v>

159
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.440
And like I'm a know I many times drive back to that area cause it's in Edison

160
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.680
and I'll drive back when I'm doing the stress factory or a gig. And I'll just,

161
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:15.680
I'll drive through that neighborhood number. Like what the happened here?

162
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.250
Something happened here and it might not just be one moment,

163
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:23.600
but something happened here that kind of shifted me because I don't know exactly

164
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:27.320
what it is. And Dr. Drew told me I was molested. I mean, maybe he's right.

165
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:28.154
I don't know.

166
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.570
<v 0>At the very least you were sexually involved with someone else who might've been</v>

167
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:33.404
molested.

168
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.810
<v 1>The odds are, it had to be.</v>

169
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.510
<v 0>One of them. That was another thing that came up.</v>

170
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.090
This article that I was saying that the origins of homosexuality that's one of

171
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:43.010
the things they were saying that I was homophobic because the origins of

172
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:46.490
sexuality, homosexuality is them people being molested when they're younger.

173
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.820
That's not what I said. And let me explain that to people. If you're gay,

174
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:51.110
if you read that you feel bad,

175
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.340
that can happen to people who would not be inclined. Homosexuality.

176
00:08:56.341 --> 00:09:00.270
If they're molested, when they're younger. Dr. Chris, Ryan,

177
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:04.230
the guy who wrote sex at Dawn was explaining it to me is that there's a, um,

178
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.640
you, you pack like what is the term? Um, not necessarily.

179
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:11.910
Pattering imprinting that when you're sexually active,

180
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.530
like if someone's sexual with you,

181
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:16.080
when you're young and that person happens to be a man,

182
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:20.610
you can imprint and you can develop sexual feelings in

183
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:24.720
response to that. Like you get your, your brain triggers,

184
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.250
sexual feelings towards men where you might not be inclined.

185
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.060
So like, even if you're not actually homosexual,

186
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.560
you're still turned on by men in a certain way, because you were molested.

187
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:38.910
It's one of the reasons why they say,

188
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.690
but they don't really know why people who get molested,

189
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:46.470
wind up molesting people, but it's really common. It's like, you know,

190
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:48.960
somebody described it best. Like it's almost like a vampire bites,

191
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:52.500
you and this thing, like you're passing it onto the next person, this,

192
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:55.010
this creepy thing. But that, you know,

193
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.780
that this is another thing where people took out of context saying that,

194
00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.940
you know, um, homophobic.

195
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.460
<v 1>Well, for me, it was all kids in my age group that I remember,</v>

196
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:04.080
I have vague adult memories,

197
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:07.530
but not anything concrete that I can say was sexually like you, I mean,

198
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:08.430
like it just kind of,

199
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.610
it's like a smoke that comes by and it leaves and that's kind of how those

200
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.790
memories are. But with the, with the kids, they were all kids in my age,

201
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:17.430
within a year or two of each other. So it wasn't like,

202
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.220
I that's why I don't like being a victim. So I feel like, you know,

203
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.110
I volunteered, man. I showed up,

204
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.940
there was a lot of times I wanted to play the game.

205
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:29.130
<v 0>Well, you were five, you know? I mean, I have so few memories when I was five.</v>

206
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.090
I mean, I bet you probably don't know why you are doing or what,

207
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.640
what happened before that, that started it and caused it.

208
00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:38.250
I bet the person who you're doing it with, they'll make, you know,

209
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.050
when people get molested, when they were really young,

210
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:44.210
one of the big issues is they block it out. They don't remember a thing. They,

211
00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:46.830
they, their brain protects them from all the.

212
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.700
<v 1>Yeah, I think so. And I've heard that enough. So I'm almost like,</v>

213
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:54.090
I always try to find something to explain, but maybe it wasn't that bad.

214
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:57.630
Maybe it was just me and my friends and then it just kind of developed into

215
00:10:57.631 --> 00:11:01.470
something that was fun and it felt good. I mean, again, I can't,

216
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.090
I can't say there was any ominous force behind that. I just don't.

217
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.870
<v 0>But it's weird because it's like, most kids don't blow their friends.</v>

218
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.270
<v 1>By the way. That's a great name for that. Most kids don't plot their friends,</v>

219
00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:16.800
folks. That should be your next company.

220
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.753
<v 0>Now my new tour.</v>

221
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.570
But it's also something we assume something happened, but it's not necessary.

222
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:28.350
Right. Because the first kid, the blue, his friends, I mean,

223
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.940
there had to be one guy somewhere in history. That was like,

224
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:33.990
I got an idea. Yeah.

225
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.720
<v 1>Yeah. That looks like a valve.</v>

226
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.010
<v 0>Put everyone's Dick in my mouth and see how they feel about it.</v>

227
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.020
Like people look, who's the first guy to Pierce his septum, right? Yeah.

228
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.420
Who's the first guy to tattoo his face. Who's the guy, who's the first guy to,

229
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.273
but.

230
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.660
<v 1>We have her first. Well,</v>

231
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:54.450
that one might've come simultaneously at two places at once.

232
00:11:54.451 --> 00:11:56.730
You never know that might've been a couple of thoughts at the same time.
