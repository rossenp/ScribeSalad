00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know, my favorite,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.640
I don't wanna call it a conspiracy theory, but my,

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.650
one of my favorite stories is humanity emerged on Venus and that

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.990
we destroyed the planet with a greenhouse effect.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.250
So we created the arc project and took the DNA of two of every animal and loaded

6
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.730
up on us on the last vessel, the arc, and went to Terraform earth.

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.560
And then that's.

8
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.770
<v 1>The dumbest idea ever. It's hilarious. DNA of two of each animal.</v>

9
00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:27.530
And then how many copies of those things do you make before they eat each.

10
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.150
<v 0>Other? They got, they got, they got anti-graft tech. They, they, they,</v>

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.470
they just started seeding the planet and the what, what,

12
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:36.560
what people do I've again, I'm not saying it's, I think it's a fun story.

13
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.660
They argue that the Bible was like the stories being told and

14
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:45.260
retranslated over hundreds of years to a loss civilization that had only one

15
00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:48.650
ship escape, the destruction of their planet. And I'm not saying it's true.

16
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.150
I'm saying it's a fun story. I love that story.

17
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.400
<v 1>Yeah, that's fun. Yeah. It would be a fun Saifai.</v>

18
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.510
<v 0>Movie. And then you end up with lost tech being discovered, thousands of years.</v>

19
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.480
<v 1>Say we have to get off of earth. You know,</v>

20
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:02.210
there's so many people that say we have to escape earth. We have to,

21
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.560
we have to sort of colonize the solar system or colonize the gap. I.

22
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.130
<v 0>Agree.</v>

23
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.540
And I think if we don't discover a better propulsion than hard chemical energy,

24
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.403
we're not going to do it.

25
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.260
<v 1>So, yeah. Well, that's why this is so compelling.</v>

26
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:19.730
This idea that they're using some element that apparently is impossible to

27
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.500
find here. You can only create it with a particle Collider,

28
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.480
but maybe in whatever solar system they are coming from,

29
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.290
you have a very different environment and maybe this element was the primary

30
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:37.490
source for fuel. Maybe they figured that out a long time ago. Okay. I wonder.

31
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.980
<v 0>If, uh, I'd, I'd love to talk to an actual physicist about this.</v>

32
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:43.280
Is there something with negative density? What's that mean? So like, you know,

33
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:46.100
things with density create an attraction through gravity because they, they,

34
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.790
the, the pressure that like their, their influence on space time,

35
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.020
I'm not an astrophysicist. So I can't explain it to you perfectly, but you know,

36
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:57.050
the, the larger, the more dense the object, the more pull it has, you know,

37
00:01:57.051 --> 00:02:00.140
so like a very dense black hole for instance sucks you in then, you know,

38
00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:02.300
Mars has slightly as gravity of the NASCA, it's less dense.

39
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.790
I wonder if there's something again, this probably, you know,

40
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.680
I'm sure that some scientists laughing right now what a moron,

41
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.731
but negative density,

42
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.810
something that would actually have a re push effect in terms of gravity,

43
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.250
in which case you could have some kind of object with where you can control,

44
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.280
expand, and contract density so that you're pushing and pulling. I.

45
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.020
<v 1>Dunno, Bob, but Bob Lazard's perspective is if we showed a</v>

46
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.180
nuclear reactor to a civilization from the 14 hundreds,

47
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.960
they would think we're doing witchcraft. The covenant. Yeah.

48
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.310
They would think it is absolutely the craziest thing that anyone has ever seen

49
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:38.930
or heard. They would try to tamper with it.

50
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:40.820
They'd all get radiation poisoning and die.

51
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.160
They'd never be able to figure it out in a million years.

52
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.780
If you just left it with them.

53
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.740
If you left some sort of a nuclear reactor with them, and he said,

54
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:52.790
this is really how far advanced,

55
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:53.810
he believes these,

56
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.430
these aliens or whatever you want to call them are that they're their

57
00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:02.500
science technology is indistinguishable from magic because they're so far ahead

58
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:03.060
of us.

59
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.850
<v 0>Do you think they'd want to be involved with us beyond just testing?</v>

60
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.720
<v 1>Why wouldn't you? We studied butterflies. We studied mice, we studied,</v>

61
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.490
we studied bugs. And the other side of the planet,

62
00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:15.660
we send people unscientific journeys to go and look at frogs,

63
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.730
or they're not even sure are real anymore.

64
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.980
<v 0>Are we giving guns to gyms? Are we,</v>

65
00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:23.040
are we building forts for them and teaching them to use stone? And I mean,

66
00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:24.450
we we've seen now, uh,

67
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.330
there's more videos coming out showing I can't remember what you primate

68
00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:28.500
species, but using more tools.

69
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.420
<v 1>On that stuff, they believe that primates chimps have entered the stone age.</v>

70
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.520
Yeah. They're using them on a regular basis.

71
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.240
<v 0>Are we going to go and teach them agriculture? I mean, do we do dude? We,</v>

72
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:41.430
we teach chimps.

73
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.000
<v 1>Things all the time, but teach chimps has. Yeah. But environments,</v>

74
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:47.730
because that's the only way you can study them. Yeah. We teach. I mean, if we,

75
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.570
they had a civilization you can go to,

76
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.080
he knew they lived in an apartment and you could study them that way,

77
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.070
but you don't think that they would study if they've found a planet.

78
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.560
Like let's imagine if we found a planet, okay.

79
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.260
We found a planet and it's all just filled with octopus.

80
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.800
And these octopus are changing colors and just Jack and fish and eating

81
00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:09.420
lobsters, we would be totally, totally be fascinated. Absolutely. Well,

82
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.280
all innovation happens because people are trying to improve on initial

83
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:17.730
designs. Now, why do they try to prove improve on initial designs?

84
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.240
They try to make things that are better, make things that are more efficient,

85
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.450
make things that it can do, tasks that they can't do without these tools.

86
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.320
And then they,

87
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.820
their curiosity and their creativity causes them to expand upon these ideas.

88
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.480
Well, of course, if something's going to be so far advanced,

89
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.960
they didn't accept their current place in the universe.

90
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.720
They don't even accept the fact they want to stay on this planet.

91
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:43.470
They want to travel to other places. Do you know, insanely curious,

92
00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:47.220
you'd have to be to lock you and three of your other three-foot buddies in a

93
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:51.570
giant flying saucer and propel yourself through space.

94
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.490
Oh yeah. You would have to be incredibly curious and incredibly

95
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.640
not just curious but innovative. They would have to be thinking about things.

96
00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:05.520
They would have to be exploring things.

97
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.650
And of course you would want to come to a planet that is filled with people

98
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.860
who have hundreds of different languages. They're all full of.

99
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.220
They lie to each other, constantly send videos through the air.

100
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:20.460
They have weapons that they could blow each other up with. Yeah. I mean,

101
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.170
of course you would be fascinated by that.

102
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:25.350
I think that's the least compelling argument that anybody ever says,

103
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.790
why would they mess with us? Why would they care about us? Of course,

104
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:32.790
they would care about us. We are interesting.

105
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.080
<v 0>Well, I, I I'll put it this way.</v>

106
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:38.280
I think if we saw like a group of chimps standing near like a water water bed

107
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.040
and then one Chimp fashioned, some kind of bag and pulls it over,

108
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:44.520
its head jumps in the water and tries to go as low as he can for as long as he

109
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.860
can. But before coming back out, we would look at that,

110
00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:50.460
like that is the stupidest attempt at scuba diving I've ever seen,

111
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:52.740
but oh my God, a Chimp just tried to scuba dive.

112
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.460
So if there are aliens and they're in these amazing technological advanced ships

113
00:05:56.461 --> 00:05:58.820
that can jump Lightspeed, manipulate gravity,

114
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.870
they just watched us strap ourselves to an explosive and fire us off of our

115
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:04.670
atmosphere where we're likely to die. And they're like,

116
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.240
this is the stupidest attempt that actually go into space.

117
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.270
He's got to try and go to space. No.

118
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.700
<v 1>I wouldn't think about that way at all. I would think about, look,</v>

119
00:06:12.701 --> 00:06:15.490
there's a space station. It's up there. And people live on it.

120
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.180
They shoot themselves is that they have a very crude form of propulsion. Right.

121
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.600
But they've figured it out because they don't have element one 15 in their

122
00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:23.620
environment naturally.

123
00:06:23.621 --> 00:06:27.520
So these dummies have to light things on fire and use the push off the back of

124
00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:29.650
it to shove themselves through normal air.

125
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.140
<v 0>And you know why they're not going to give us that tech right now. Why would.</v>

126
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.060
<v 1>They give us 10? Why, why did they give us tax? Why they wouldn't?</v>

127
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.390
Why would they give us tech? Why would any,

128
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.080
th th that's the weirdest argument ever that they're giving us things?

129
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:42.550
I don't think they're giving a. No, I don't.

130
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.150
<v 0>Think so either.</v>

131
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.150
I think they're specifically not doing it and they wouldn't do it even if we

132
00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:51.130
wanted them to. I think, I think it's, it's an inverse. You, you people,

133
00:06:51.131 --> 00:06:51.964
a lot of,

134
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.280
maybe a lot of people talk about how they're like sharing technology with us or

135
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:58.210
something. Right. You see that stuff in the, those conspiracies there,

136
00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:01.570
the reason they won't just because we're, we're trusted. We're territorial. We,

137
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.200
we fight each other for sure. So look, if, if,

138
00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:08.110
if they came down and went to Russia and said, here's, anti-graft propulsion,

139
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.730
what do you think Russia is going to do? All right.

140
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:12.840
Our planet now they're going to immediately expand rapidly. Their,

141
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.860
their population is going to grow exponentially.

142
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.310
And it's going to cause massive turmoil between nuclear powers,

143
00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:19.240
which could destroy themselves.

144
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.340
<v 1>For sure. Use it as a weapon.</v>

145
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.960
<v 0>The smartest thing is to not share at all until we're at one world, you know,</v>

146
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.800
society. Well.

147
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.740
<v 1>Also like look at what they look like, what the aliens look like.</v>

148
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.540
And if you look at the iconic shape of an alien,

149
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.520
they have giant heads and genderless bodies,

150
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.360
like maybe that's the key to stopping war.

151
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.490
There's no incentive whatsoever for people to

152
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.870
be, uh, sexual or attractive. Everybody looks exactly the same.

153
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.780
We get over this idea of biological mating.

154
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.600
They reproduce through genetic engineering.

155
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.140
<v 0>Why not just be robots or maybe they are like robots.</v>

156
00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:58.900
Maybe that is like a robot, mean artificial bodies where, you know,

157
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.540
have you seen all altered carbon? I haven't,

158
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.000
but I keep hearing good things about it. I just finished season two,

159
00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:06.550
season one was awesome. But basically they have a thing called a stack.

160
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.850
<v 1>We finished season two, season one is awesome. That means season two sucks.</v>

161
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.330
Season two.

162
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:15.070
<v 0>Is a C plus season. One's like an A-plus. Yeah, like it's fun.</v>

163
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.100
But, uh, they have, I think all the stack in the base of their, in their,

164
00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:20.170
in their spinal column, right below their head,

165
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.950
that stores their consciousness and they call their bodies sleeves.

166
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.240
And they kind of don't care when they die, because they just get, you know,

167
00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:31.570
it's, if you're poor, you get really crappy sleeves. Right. But if you're,

168
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.910
if you're rich, you get premium access military upgrade.

169
00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:37.720
Like high-tech very strong, but their body has just become separate.

170
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.560
And you can also transport your consciousness, interstellar,

171
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.320
like to other planets. And then you wake up in a body in a different planet.

172
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.130
That's how you go places now. Oh, your consciousness travels. So yeah.

173
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.720
I mean maybe aliens do that. Maybe there's there's not, you know,

174
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:57.180
I I'm I'm I find the, the idea of the various alien life, like bodies curious.

175
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.490
One of the, one of the things I've read about is that it's,

176
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.750
it could be humans from the future.

177
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.870
<v 1>Yeah. I've heard that too. That makes sense.</v>

178
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.520
If you think about what we look like,

179
00:09:04.521 --> 00:09:06.440
as opposed to like what a champ looks like. Yeah.

180
00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:09.200
And then you keep going further with that, like, oh, the head will get bigger.

181
00:09:09.201 --> 00:09:11.480
The bodies will get weaker. Yep. And then look,

182
00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:16.340
there's a sort of a trend in this society today to be less masculine,

183
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.840
less feminine, more gender neutral, and these well,

184
00:09:20.841 --> 00:09:24.560
so they, them pronouns, maybe that's all just part of the programming. This.

185
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.530
<v 0>Falls into another one of these conspiracy theories that the goal of the</v>

186
00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:30.170
globalists is that in order to get access to alien tech,

187
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.650
we have to be a unified planet aliens. Aren't going to give aliens.

188
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.620
You've heard that one. Oh yeah. It's all over the internet.

189
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.010
The that's why they're.

190
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.510
<v 1>Doing this. So they're going with a one world order in order to get alien tech.</v>

191
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.020
<v 0>Do you think the galactic Federation is going to get a lot of planet in which</v>

192
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:48.240
has got numerous governing bodies and nuclear weapons?

193
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.450
I don't think there's a galactic Federation. I'm just, I'm just kidding. Right?

194
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.580
The point I'm making is there are people in line who believe this.

195
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:57.840
They believe that if there is some kind of galactic Federation or at least some

196
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:00.180
kind of recognizable, you know,

197
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:02.760
different cultures that have some kind of set rule base, right?

198
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:07.410
Who do they negotiate with us Russia or China. And so the argument, well,

199
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.520
one of the theories is that

200
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.600
interest on the United States who have access to the aliens,

201
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.420
know that they have to do everything in their power to unify the entire planet

202
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:20.160
under one authority so that we can be entered into whatever alien, you know,

203
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:24.630
access would exist. But so long as we are nuclear powered, competing terror,

204
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.430
territorial factions, they can't do it.

205
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.070
<v 1>Well, that makes sense if that was the.</v>

206
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.510
<v 0>Case, but you add in what you,</v>

207
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.800
what you were saying about masculinity and gender. And one of the things that,

208
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.070
uh, I find interesting is that when it comes to this argument about removing

209
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:42.210
masculinity, there's, there's kind of a overlap with this idea of domestication.

210
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.600
You think about wolves, pro dogs and dogs,

211
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.790
dogs are effectively Wolf Cubs, perpetually. So wolves are aggressive,

212
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:54.180
territorial, independent. I mean, independent in the sense that like,

213
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.600
you're not going to tame them. They're like teach wolves. Yeah. Yeah.

214
00:10:57.601 --> 00:11:01.320
Like you're willing to listen to you. I mean, you, you can, but it's like,

215
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.620
it's it's they agree with you or they don't you're you're you're falling,

216
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:08.370
you know? So an adult masculine, tough human is going to be like,

217
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.300
I'm independent, I'm in charge. They've got to remove that and domesticate us.

218
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:13.950
So you get a bunch of weak,

219
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.460
feminine genderless humans who are going to be passive docile and agreeable,

220
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:18.870
right?

221
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.380
<v 1>Yeah. I do.</v>

222
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.300
I have a whole bit about what wolves are and what dogs are and what

223
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:26.460
men used to be and what men are now.

224
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.121
<v 0>Dude, I,</v>

225
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:30.870
I was thinking of this really cool idea for a scifi film where aliens come to

226
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:35.610
earth and most humanity accepts domestication. And then 300,

227
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:37.950
400 years from now, you've got regular looking,

228
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:41.430
21st century kind of men and women. But then you have these five foot tall,

229
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:46.290
super armored jet pack with plasma rifles that love and

230
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:47.550
serve the aliens.

231
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.600
And we view them as freakish genetic defects.

232
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.990
So have you like oblivion with Tom cruise? Yes.

233
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.050
The aliens basically genetically engineered a whole bunch of Tom cruises.

234
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.750
I was thinking of that kind of idea, but also with domestication,

235
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.020
that's an underrated movie, by the way. That's cool. I love it. Yeah.

236
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.370
Very good movie. If it came to earth and most humans agreed.

237
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.930
And then over time that the humans that got access to lifesaving technology,

238
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.310
a special armor were the ones that were agreeable and less likely to be

239
00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:17.880
aggressive.

240
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.850
<v 1>Yeah. They would out just like the wolves bitched out and became a poodle.</v>

241
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.850
<v 0>And then you'd have wolves. Well, I did, for a story,</v>

242
00:12:23.851 --> 00:12:27.000
you basically have humans like writing a chicken coop and the aliens are like,

243
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.050
ah, and they call their attack.

244
00:12:28.051 --> 00:12:31.800
Humans who jump out with like armor and crazy feature tack from the aliens.

245
00:12:31.801 --> 00:12:35.340
But they're like these small dog, like versions of humans, you know,

246
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.450
like desperately in love with the aliens, you know? Right.

247
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.780
Just crying and logs and walls aren't like that.

248
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.980
But I wonder if the people would.

249
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:48.090
<v 1>Eat those dog-like people the way wolves eat dogs.</v>

250
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:53.850
<v 0>Well, for the sake of, uh, of a fiction, no, we wouldn't have them do that,</v>

251
00:12:53.851 --> 00:12:55.200
but what would of be.

252
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.650
<v 1>Okay. It was, you'd be like this sneaky smaller.</v>

253
00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.890
<v 0>But [inaudible], aren't I weren't</v>

254
00:12:59.890 --> 00:12:59.890
 the product of domestication. I mean, they're just a separate Kane, uh,

255
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:00.723
 canine breed, I guess, or species. Right, right.

256
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.180
<v 1>I'm saying like, they, they, they really never got domesticated. Yeah. That's,</v>

257
00:13:09.181 --> 00:13:11.820
what's interesting. It's like there, I mean,

258
00:13:11.821 --> 00:13:13.380
is there a coyote version of humans?

259
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.560
<v 0>Yeah. The north Sentinel island. Right. You know,</v>

260
00:13:16.561 --> 00:13:19.260
north Sentinel is the people who have never had contact with other humans.

261
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.250
<v 1>They've had several bad experiences with other people,</v>

262
00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:25.080
which are the arrows of helicopters and stuff. Well,

263
00:13:25.081 --> 00:13:27.240
that's why they killed that guy. They killed,

264
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:32.310
they killed the missionary because they were invaded in the 18 hundreds,

265
00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.380
by a guy named Maurice Vadal Portman,

266
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.610
who was a pervert slash Explorer who, uh, you know,

267
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.540
would measure and take detailed descriptions of peoples in that.

268
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.740
<v 0>Wow. I mean, was it for legitimate research purposes? No.</v>

269
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.840
<v 1>Way. Go. Just find people and run tests on them. Yeah.</v>

270
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.720
But that would be what we'd worried about with aliens too. Right.

271
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.880
If what comments came here, maybe that's why,

272
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.550
that's why people are worried about them touching their. Well,

273
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.440
some of it's only the pervert. Yeah. Somebody.

274
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.930
<v 0>Posted this tweet, they said something about like,</v>

275
00:14:03.931 --> 00:14:05.850
you need to realize the aliens who would come to earth.

276
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.010
Aren't the cool nerds who want to like talk science.

277
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.750
It's the rich who rat their planet are dipping out the myth.

278
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.920
<v 1>That's a silly way to live. Well, I mean, it's one possibility. I understand,</v>

279
00:14:16.921 --> 00:14:17.790
but that's us

280
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.950
look at things through like a human centric filter. Exactly.

281
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.640
But if they're genderless things from, uh, from the future,

282
00:14:26.641 --> 00:14:30.270
like what benefit would it be to get richer? You know, these,

283
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.690
they have their giant heads and they could travel the speed of light. Like.

284
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.370
<v 0>This is, this is what, well, I really don't like,</v>

285
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.770
I think it's Hawking's argument that we shouldn't,

286
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.100
we shouldn't be excited about aliens because whenever a more powerful

287
00:14:41.101 --> 00:14:44.370
civilization approaches a weaker one, they dominate it. And it's like, yeah,

288
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.031
I don't, I don't,

289
00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:47.550
I don't buy that for two seconds in terms of aliens coming to earth.

290
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.290
That makes no sense. What,

291
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.120
so the argument I buy Hawking's argument. Oh,

292
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:54.590
you don't that if aliens came to earth,

293
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:56.600
they would enslave us to S to steal our resources.

294
00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.890
<v 1>I don't necessarily think they would enslave us to steal our resources.</v>

295
00:14:59.891 --> 00:15:02.800
But if we were aware of them, they would become space daddy.

296
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.130
<v 0>Well, what he's, what he's saying is like, you know, when,</v>

297
00:15:06.131 --> 00:15:09.760
when the Europeans came to north America and spread disease and then stole land,

298
00:15:09.761 --> 00:15:11.400
started wiping everybody out. Like when, when,

299
00:15:11.401 --> 00:15:14.020
when a more advanced civilization meets, uh, you know, you know,

300
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.430
I don't think aliens would do that at all. It's like, why not? The way I,

301
00:15:18.431 --> 00:15:20.050
the way I would view the most, uh,

302
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.760
devastating approach would be more like a gigantic vessel coming down

303
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.450
and just slicing a skyscraper in half and stripping out all the copper and

304
00:15:28.451 --> 00:15:33.250
elements while ignoring the people. And when we go to a habitat for animals,

305
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.860
we're not going to like, ha we'll kill all the squirrels.

306
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.140
We're like when we're taking the lumber squirrels be damned.

307
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.220
So we go into habitats where other creatures live, take what we want.

308
00:15:42.221 --> 00:15:44.500
And we don't care about the animals. We know when we farm,

309
00:15:44.501 --> 00:15:46.510
we kill all the mice and our little critters in there. We don't care.

310
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:47.890
So I don't like the,

311
00:15:47.891 --> 00:15:50.200
I don't think the argument makes sense that a more advanced civilization would

312
00:15:50.201 --> 00:15:52.780
come to earth and be like, ha ha, humans. Now you will serve us.

313
00:15:52.781 --> 00:15:53.471
And it's our land.

314
00:15:53.471 --> 00:15:56.920
Now they would completely ignore us and just start taking stuff and crushing us

315
00:15:56.921 --> 00:15:59.110
and ignoring us. They wouldn't be, but I don't,

316
00:15:59.111 --> 00:16:02.710
I don't think that's the most likely scenario either. I think any,

317
00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:05.770
any race sufficiently advanced enough to travel,

318
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.880
the massive size of the universe would have little need for the primitive

319
00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:10.780
elements on our planet.

320
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.720
And it would actually be substantially easier for them to go to any other empty

321
00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:14.170
rock.

322
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.950
<v 1>No, it's not true. You have no idea. No, we have no idea what they need. Like,</v>

323
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:22.090
wow, this might be an incredibly rare place. It's an incredibly rare,

324
00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:23.830
as far as everything we've been able to observe,

325
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.820
they might come here because they found this Goldilocks plant that has liquid

326
00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:32.410
water and incredible biodiversity and more life than any other place on earth or

327
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.820
any other place in the source system.

328
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.330
<v 0>In the known galaxy, you know, the era's planet theory, right? What is that?</v>

329
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.070
That's, uh, alien,

330
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.850
there's an elliptical orbit for a planet that every 300 years comes in con comes

331
00:16:42.851 --> 00:16:44.890
in close orbit to earth. Cause elliptical around our sun,

332
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.420
the planet and the bureau, the bureau. That's what it is. Yeah. Yeah.

333
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.070
And that they, they used human slave labor for mining gold. Yes.

334
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.460
<v 1>That's all Zechariah. Cichon Zacharias is.</v>

335
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.770
<v 0>I've heard the name. I've read the stuff. He wrote.</v>

336
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.180
<v 1>A book called the 12th planet.</v>

337
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:02.980
That's a fascinating take on the ancient Sumerian texts.

338
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:07.540
And he's widely been criticized by other

339
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.480
scholars who understand ancient Sumerian. Yeah.

340
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.380
And there's actually a website called Cichon is wrong. See if you can go to,

341
00:17:14.381 --> 00:17:19.180
it sits in his wrong.com because all the whack jobs like me who

342
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.680
love the idea of, you know, oh, that's why we're so into gold man. Right?

343
00:17:23.681 --> 00:17:27.460
Because the aliens use these suspended gold particles in their atmosphere and is

344
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.450
fair. And to protect their atmosphere from the interior ration, by their,

345
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.410
you know,

346
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.820
in industrial use of chemicals and toxins has destroyed their environment.

347
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:41.080
So such Ascension is wrong. Dot com is an interesting website.

348
00:17:41.081 --> 00:17:42.760
And I don't know who's right or who's wrong.

349
00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:47.230
And I think if you want to go over the Annunaki and the ancient,

350
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.640
what what's really interesting and not just about Cichon,

351
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.470
but about Sumir in general is one thing is

352
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.720
they had these tablets,

353
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.160
these clay tablets that had a depiction of the galaxy or the depiction of the

354
00:18:02.161 --> 00:18:06.180
solar system. Now you're talking about 6,000 BC.

355
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.470
They have this depiction of the solar system that shows the sun in the center.

356
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.150
And it shows all of the planets in our known galaxy or a known solar system

357
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.830
with a proper perspective in terms of the size of the planet and the proper

358
00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:21.720
distance. Like they're in the right places.

359
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.360
It's not like there's a big one really close to the sun.

360
00:18:24.361 --> 00:18:26.400
And there's a little one, three planets out, like,

361
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:30.210
see if you can find that it's a weird image. See, that's the image. Yeah,

362
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.100
right there.

363
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.840
The take that Zacharias Hitchin had was that they were

364
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:40.260
trying to tell us that they have come from this other planet.

365
00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:43.830
And they were trying to explain to us what our solar system is,

366
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.800
but just the fact that they have this sun in the center,

367
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.540
and then they have all the planets that we know of circling this sun.

368
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.270
And this has been criticized like, oh no, they didn't do it. Right.

369
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:59.310
And they didn't do it. First of all, they did it in clay. Okay. So relax there.

370
00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:03.210
So it's so clothes that you would have to say, man,

371
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:06.900
that might be what that is. And if that is what that is,

372
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:10.770
what are they trying to say with this thing? Because there's also an image, uh,

373
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.570
from a clay tablet of a very large being that has a very

374
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:18.990
small human, like being with a monkey tail on its lap.

375
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.240
And this is what Cichon points to as some sort of a depiction of the

376
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:29.130
genetic engineering that took place to turn primitive primates

377
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.210
into human beings.

378
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:35.400
This is the reason why we are so different from every other animal on this

379
00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:39.750
planet. And the real thing that when,

380
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:43.890
when people talk about aliens and alien, Cali, what would aliens be doing here?

381
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:44.723
Why would they do,

382
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.410
what if human beings are the product of accelerated evolution?

383
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.630
Like what if they came down here,

384
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:56.310
they found this incredibly rich planet that's filled with biodiversity and all

385
00:19:56.311 --> 00:19:59.540
these different life forms. And then they found these primates and like, oh,

386
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.260
we know where these are going. Like,

387
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:04.470
this is us 10 billion years ago or whatever the it is.

388
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.750
Let's accelerate this little party.

389
00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.820
Let's inject some of our super advanced DNA into these primates and

390
00:20:11.821 --> 00:20:15.300
let's see, let's see where it takes itself. So what do you think you think?

391
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:18.420
Yeah, that's a fun story. That's, that's the story that, um,

392
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.730
they told bomb Bazaar, but Bibles are said,

393
00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:23.910
I don't know if they told me that to throw us off the trail,

394
00:20:23.911 --> 00:20:28.590
if it's disinformation or if it's just some wacky thing that they came up with

395
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.360
to just to like have a crazy story that the scientists couldn't tell

396
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:36.180
anybody. So if you do tell people, like, what are you working on?

397
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.960
I'm working on reverse engineering or propulsion system from an aircraft that

398
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:41.460
came from another planet. And by the way,

399
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.730
we are a product product of accelerated evolution.

400
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.380
They came to us and they inject in our DNA. And.

401
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.240
<v 0>You know, we'll think about, uh,</v>

402
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.950
that story in the context of ancient religions and a lot of the commonalities,

403
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.400
notably like Abrahamic, this idea that we were created,

404
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.860
that we were told we shouldn't shouldn't do certain things.

405
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.280
So I think those are all fun stories, but yeah,

406
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.170
you could look at the idea of someone being the son of God,

407
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.420
you know, a hybrid, right? Yeah.

408
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.500
You could look at the stories of regular old Genesis taking the rib of, of, uh,

409
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.590
Adam's creative. Well, yeah, the, the genetic matter. Sure.

410
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.300
And then manipulating it. So, you know, I get it,

411
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:24.200
I get a lot of heat from my more religious friends for,

412
00:21:24.201 --> 00:21:28.840
for pointing that out that I believe the Bible is more likely than an odd space

413
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.600
to be about aliens and about the actual creator of the universe.

414
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.170
And I'm talking to astronomical odds like ridiculously astronomical,

415
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.070
but I think we actually know some things exist. Genetic manipulation,

416
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.820
cargo cults. We know how primitive life form reacts to more advanced technology.

417
00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:46.180
They don't understand. And that would, would make more sense to me than,

418
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.780
you know, believing in a hard religion about the creator and, you know,

419
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:50.740
carpenters and things like that.

420
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.840
<v 1>Yeah. Well, it's also, we're dealing with translations, right.</v>

421
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.460
That have gone on for thousands and thousands of years that are a story that was

422
00:21:59.461 --> 00:22:04.380
told as an oral tradition for a thousand years before that it's like, boy, the,

423
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.810
the saying hard and fast exactly what they meant in the Bible and

424
00:22:09.811 --> 00:22:14.250
what this means and what must have happened for them to write that down to me,

425
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.940
it's just bonkers. I mean, who, who knows,

426
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.860
but what we do know is that the older, the stories get the weirder,

427
00:22:22.861 --> 00:22:24.360
they get, like,

428
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.260
that's one of the weird things about the ancient Sumerian taxes that you're

429
00:22:28.261 --> 00:22:31.740
dealing now you're in like the 6,000 years ago range,

430
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.210
which is really weird. Like that's a long time. Well, I.
