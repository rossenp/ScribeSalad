WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 1>Hmm. Performer story, well.</v>

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.870
<v 0>Being, but that also speaks to like what, the kind of stuff that you do. I mean,</v>

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.880
people like things that are crafted by artisans. Yeah.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.893
You know what I mean.

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.620
<v 1>Me too,</v>

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.220
seeing that revival right in the last 10 years is just growing and growing and

8
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:21.054
growing and stuff.

9
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.910
<v 0>I feel like as the world becomes more digital and people become more</v>

10
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.700
disconnected with each other. There's something about like,

11
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.630
when I drive your Bronco, first of all, I really like you.

12
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.440
So I love the fact that I'm driving your truck. And then two,

13
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:37.950
I feel like it's a piece of art. Yeah. I feel like it's a functional.

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.140
<v 1>Piece of art, highly functioning called.</v>

15
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.580
<v 0>I smile when I'm in it. It makes me feel different when I'm in my Tesla.</v>

16
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:48.720
I'm like, this is a bad piece of invention, but you're still in your own head.

17
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.060
<v 1>It's a piece of plastic.</v>

18
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.850
<v 0>It's, there's, you know, it's plastic and glass and metal and it's beautiful.</v>

19
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:58.560
It's amazing. It's spectacular innovate, but it will never be art.

20
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.390
<v 1>Are you in a, what? Do you have an S I have.</v>

21
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.550
<v 0>The, yeah, the P 100 D yeah.</v>

22
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.830
<v 1>Sat in the back seat. No,</v>

23
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.750
don't why the noise coming out of that third point shoulder seatbelt

24
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.480
retractor is so unacceptable. The modern car standards,

25
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.340
like literally the coming up through the plastic wheel. Well,

26
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:22.320
in like a noise and a cold breeze is hitting your outboard ear. And I'm like,

27
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.660
okay, breathe. How did this happen?

28
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.200
If there's a draft that comes up through there and you're hearing road noise

29
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:29.190
through it. It's, you're.

30
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.160
<v 0>Hearing road noise through the seatbelt, through.</v>

31
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.030
<v 1>The cavity, the whole row, which really the retractors pulls.</v>

32
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:39.510
This air gets in there next time. You're too stoned to drive.

33
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.620
You sit in the back seat, let mom and drive and report back. You send.

34
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.030
<v 0>Me a text. It's that annoying? Huh?</v>

35
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.210
<v 1>For, for guys like us, dare I go out on a limb and say us, yes.</v>

36
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.210
It'll annoy the out.

37
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.130
<v 0>Of you and interesting that car.</v>

38
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.840
<v 1>So you didn't have a call in number when Elan was here. I would have to.</v>

39
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.000
<v 0>His about that widget. That one thing you know, who the is this.</v>

40
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.930
<v 1>He already knows who this has all these years ago.</v>

41
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:06.960
I developed a concept that I called the Helios.

42
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.890
I don't know if you ever saw that. So I love like design challenges.

43
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:12.930
I like framing things, right. So I was like, all right,

44
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.160
let's do a revisionist history approach to car design.

45
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:21.720
So what if electric cars had remained predominant in the

46
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.300
late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds?

47
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.670
What if we had taken inspiration from aircraft design a couple of decades

48
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.250
prior to when the industry actually did.

49
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.080
And then what if after he did the experimental

50
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.750
plane, the H two, I think it was,

51
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.750
what if Howard Hughes had sat in down and like,

52
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.880
he couldn't get that last starlet to,

53
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.300
to go out with him right before he lost his mind completely.

54
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.970
What if he Buckminster fuller and Gordon pure rig sat down and did a napkin

55
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:57.000
sketch after too many martinis? What would that car look like?

56
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.140
So that was my stupid pile of around which I framed my design

57
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.450
and I designed it to work on the, at the time and pad five platform.

58
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.730
And basically I received a copy of a letter that's

59
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:16.480
titled like peanut butter and chocolate that was written by Elan's core

60
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:21.280
engineering team, begging him to Lao them,

61
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.660
to support me, to do the built. And like since day one, like my launch was,

62
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.920
I don't need your money. I'll go to the dealership. I'll buy the car.

63
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.140
I need y'all's back in support on the software because they're super about

64
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.970
any repurposed or I'm sure cried Tesla's and Ilan never addressed. It was like.

65
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.510
<v 0>That gentleman right there with the glasses, the larger bobblehead that's rich.</v>

66
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.490
<v 1>Yeah. I know. Rich. We just did a speaking panel together in Texas recently.</v>

67
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:48.760
Yeah.

68
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.470
<v 0>That's his major beef with Tesla.</v>

69
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.440
He he's bought a couple of them and piece them back.

70
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.490
<v 1>Together and block.</v>

71
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.220
<v 0>Them. Yeah. They block and left and right. Let them supercharge. Yep.</v>

72
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.960
<v 1>But it's six a about in the last two or three quarters,</v>

73
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.890
there've been major gains thing, honestly,

74
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:10.420
I think due to rich and due to the community that rose up around him,

75
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.650
that been hacked now. So yeah. Now people can open source,

76
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.330
hack the can data chain and people are repurposing Tesla

77
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:21.190
components. Like I use Tesla batteries,

78
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.920
but I haven't been using their motors or planetary. Is there anything else?

79
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.760
Cause again,

80
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.510
what do I tell my client when the client needs an update or a part you go to the

81
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:30.610
dealer, they're like, what's your VIN and

82
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.080
crude you come outside. But yeah, like, um,

83
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.120
stealth stealthy V in fact has this new setup that they just started marketing

84
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:44.530
where you literally take that IRS apart where the electric motor is built in.

85
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:47.290
There's a little access to our, you pull out a little circuit board,

86
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.090
you put in another one and voila.

87
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.020
<v 0>Is there a setup like crate engines where, you know,</v>

88
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:56.620
or do you envision a setup where, because you know, you know that, um,

89
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.830
the new Hummer is now going to be an electric vehicle,

90
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:01.090
which is really interesting. Yeah.

91
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.690
And there's going to be a bunch of other electric vehicles that are coming out

92
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.020
for Volkswagen that are really cheap and a bunch of different companies are

93
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:08.854
jumping in.

94
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.120
Do you envision there being some sort of a crate engine option for people that

95
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.080
want to like.

96
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.950
<v 1>I do. I do.</v>

97
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:19.720
And I think there should be now proof in the pudding to this point is that

98
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:22.690
everyone's focusing on the, do it yourself market,

99
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.710
therefore also on the cheapest possible equation, which leaves a lot of,

100
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.640
in my opinion,

101
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.500
a lot of safety issues completely unaddressed and they can get

102
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:33.334
downright nutty.

103
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.810
So the other issue is they're all for ease of installation and conversion.

104
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:40.840
Everyone's thinking about doing kits that literally are a,

105
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.910
a Spud plate in a short shaft to go where the engine used to be put an electric

106
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:49.120
motor to a bell housing adapter to the stock transmission,

107
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.830
which is stupid because electric cars going through manual transmissions.

108
00:05:53.831 --> 00:05:55.840
There's a lot of scavenging of energy.

109
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:59.360
It's bad enough to go through a ring and pinion doing a right angle gear,

110
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:02.450
displacement of power. You lose so much efficiency.

111
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.760
And the best EVs in my opinion are transmission lists are, go through planning.

112
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.050
Terry's said, you know, for gear reduction like that, the Merck is the,

113
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.890
to my knowledge, the first sort of retrofit Evie that, you know,

114
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.280
I being the goober that I am like, I was like, okay,

115
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:22.250
we've done a couple of UV builds, but if we're going to keep doing them, like,

116
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.430
I want to do them our way, like I want to, I want more safety.

117
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:27.440
I want more performance. I want more range.

118
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.730
I want dedicated thermal management networks for the batteries, the controllers,

119
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:33.770
the motors, and all that. And none of it existed.

120
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.960
<v 0>How long did that build take? Oh God.</v>

121
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.130
<v 1>For, yeah, just a little bit over four years.</v>

122
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.380
And that the scale of technology changing so quickly in the space

123
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.270
that as we were building it,

124
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:52.160
suppliers of key components came out with another generation that's infinitely

125
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.160
better than the V1 or V3 already had.

126
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.290
So even before we could finish that car,

127
00:06:57.291 --> 00:07:01.250
we were backing up and updating and updating and updating, which really,

128
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:03.560
if you put sort of a market tier hat on,

129
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.160
I'm so proud of the value retention in my vehicles.

130
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.510
And I'm proud of our foundation of taking something that in essence,

131
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:15.470
a lot of people would think is at the end of its already usable life cycle and

132
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.520
upcycling it and breathing new life. So it's good to go for decades again,

133
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.680
but now with Evy stuff is moving so quickly. That am I,

134
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.900
am I like making iPhones all of a sudden.

135
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:31.220
So two years it's totally worthless because the tech is outdated.

136
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.200
<v 0>The weird thing about tech, right,</v>

137
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.390
is that the exponential growth and improvement,

138
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:39.230
it just makes them like no one wants an iPhone one right there.

139
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.580
<v 1>Useless. So look at, you know, internal combustion engine development cycles.</v>

140
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:48.560
What I put in today is still relevant in a decade, but with, with electric,

141
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:53.480
it's a whole new space to consider. So AEM is like well-known in,

142
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:57.170
in, in racing and aftermarket for engine management, electronics,

143
00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.810
they just had PRI and it seem, uh,

144
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.520
made a fair bit of noise about coming out with a full

145
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:08.050
array of Evie retrofit conversion systems.

146
00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:12.530
So these seem to be the first ones entering the field that are going to offer a

147
00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:17.090
comprehensive suite of products and solutions. But then again,

148
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:19.010
being that it's part of this industry, you know,

149
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:23.720
I go grill the dudes at their trade show booth and they're like, uh, well,

150
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.680
it's, um, something we're, um, working on, you know,

151
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.330
just all these press releases and all that. I'm like sell me some, uh,

152
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.373
hello.

153
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.400
<v 0>They can't sell.</v>

154
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.890
<v 1>To you. I think I, I trust it will come out.</v>

155
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.200
<v 0>But when you see Ilan coming out with, um,</v>

156
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.710
like that new Roadster is going to have a 600 mile range,

157
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.720
that that is when things get real.

158
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.440
<v 1>In Volkswagen claimed with that vehicle that you noted earlier,</v>

159
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:50.900
that they were going to make the platform shareable,

160
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.380
and they're going to make it available to many different manufacturers,

161
00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:55.290
large and small,

162
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.090
but I've heard stories like that over the years from you name it from Farah day

163
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:04.620
was claiming the same thing. And so much of it's. Cause now it's, it's like,

164
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.250
I don't want to say vaporware, but it's, it's so much of that.

165
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.370
Like VC money, don't worry,

166
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:15.930
we'll be profitable one day and we're worth a billion multiple of nothing today.

167
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:20.550
So buy in and then it's like so many of these Evie startups and

168
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:25.350
retrofit companies come to the scene looking for that elusive FedEx fleet

169
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:28.980
contract that everyone thinks is going to be easy to get and none of them get

170
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:31.110
it. And then they all go belly up. Yeah.

171
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.640
So I just think we're at that point in history where not only is the tech moving

172
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.670
forward so quickly and not only that,

173
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:42.660
but the likes of predominantly only due to Tesla,

174
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.790
it's proven the viability in the market.

175
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.110
Now there's purists and traditionalist and everyone's starting to poke at it and

176
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:53.100
I see exponential more interest. So I think, you know,

177
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:56.130
for the next five years or so, it's going to be a bit tumultuous,

178
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.470
but I definitely think it's the future of hot rodding. I, I,

179
00:09:59.471 --> 00:10:02.070
I imagine within five years,

180
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:06.210
I imagine probably half of my client builds will be electric. Wow.

181
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.770
<v 0>That's a big, that's a big statement.</v>

182
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.500
<v 1>Well, and I'm totally pulling it out of booty,</v>

183
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.440
but that's the vibe that I get.

184
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.370
<v 0>Have you seen, there's a 68 Porsche nine 11.</v>

185
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.680
That has a Tesla engine in it.

186
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.560
<v 1>Yeah. Is that the one Evie west?</v>

187
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:28.020
<v 0>I don't know who built it scamming through a scanning through Instagram the</v>

188
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:32.760
other day. And I saw it a green 68. Yeah. Uh, that's,

189
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:35.490
that's very interesting when they do stuff like that to old car.

190
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.220
<v 1>And there's so many guys springing up out of the woodwork,</v>

191
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.740
like nationwide to various levels of price, expectation, range, expectation,

192
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:47.910
et cetera. But I think that's a really, it's a lovely community too.

193
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:52.470
I've noticed it's much more open than the conventional automotive

194
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.480
community is about sharing information and suppliers and knowledge and helping

195
00:10:57.481 --> 00:11:01.530
one another. And it's, there's a really nice comradery within that community.

196
00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:05.580
There's like movement motors and Austin's doing really nice retrofits and oh

197
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:07.860
yeah. Evie west has been around forever.

198
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.200
They were really the granddaddies on the scene and.

199
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.850
<v 0>And Austin did they, they're the ones that did that Mustang. Okay.</v>

200
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.050
<v 1>Um, I think they've done a staying, they just finished doing a 2002 BMW.</v>

201
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:23.940
They did an early GTV alpha. They've done all sorts of different,

202
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.870
like pretty cool diverse range of platforms. And then of course, um,

203
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.240
um, uh,

204
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.600
XE electric down in orange county that started out doing just the bugs now,

205
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:37.050
the bugs and the buses and now nine 11. And it's like,

206
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.700
there's such a large and welcoming kind of cool community of people in that

207
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:42.720
space. Now, when you.

208
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.190
<v 0>Charge a Tesla, it's easy. You know, you look for the Tesla superchargers,</v>

209
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:48.090
they're all over the place.

210
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:50.850
You press a button on your screen and it shows you where they are.

211
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:53.950
It'll navigate you to them. When you try to get one of those,

212
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.430
you can't charge a regular car to Tesla, super station.

213
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.420
<v 1>Can, you know, and there's different. So there's this standard.</v>

214
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:04.780
I forget the INAC room. We could call rich, uh, the J blah, blah,

215
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.810
blah connector, but there's a standard municipal connector.

216
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:10.060
And then there's also the new fast charge network,

217
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.840
but it depends on where you live. But for example, around here, it's a joke.

218
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:17.440
They're everywhere. So like I have an app when I'm driving that 49 merch.

219
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:18.790
And you know, I was, uh,

220
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.380
speaking at bear Jackson and had it there in town for while I was visiting.

221
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.870
And they're your network, the apps, and you find it.

222
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:28.690
But when we made that one supercharger compatible,

223
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.020
because the client's going to install one in his house and punk the system,

224
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.770
otherwise you try and go to a public Tesla charger. It has to do a handshake.

225
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:39.670
And it says, no, you may not charge here.

226
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.610
<v 0>So you can have it supercharger compatible for like,</v>

227
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:45.490
I have one in the wall back there for my car. So it would work. Yeah.

228
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.960
<v 1>Yes. That's my understanding, but not a public installation.</v>

229
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.160
Those have to go through a whole handshake protocol set back and forth.

230
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.680
<v 0>Yeah. It's interesting that you decided to do it that way.</v>

231
00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.000
<v 1>Yeah. Well, it was fun. We put one, um, behind the front license plate.</v>

232
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.860
So we did one of those old school articulating plates. Like,

233
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.560
remember when the gas phones run the play.

234
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.060
So that has the one interface connector. And then the other one,

235
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.190
I machine this unnecessarily groovy sort of gas cap under the original

236
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:19.660
fuel door on the merch. And then that's for the other style charger.

237
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.920
<v 0>Do you, oh, so you could charge it with different ones with the supercharger.</v>

238
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.070
<v 1>Depending on do to increase the versatility of it.</v>

239
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.220
You had a supercharger fast charge compatibility,

240
00:13:30.221 --> 00:13:33.670
and then you had the more widely distributed municipal format charger.

241
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.260
And then there's just two different pigtail adapters. So you can go either way.

242
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.150
<v 0>Do you anticipate upping the range on that thing?</v>

243
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.160
Do you think that someday you'll swap the batteries?

244
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.270
<v 1>Definitely. I think the reality is any Evie project I built. I have to,</v>

245
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.220
not only do I anticipate, but like I've lost many clients because I'll be super

246
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.530
blunt about making, managing their expectations. That look,

247
00:13:56.531 --> 00:14:00.190
you're going to spend a lot of money to have me do this and trust.

248
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:04.090
I will geek out and do the best of the state of the art that is available to us.

249
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.370
But in a year that might all be garbage.

250
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.750
So you have to understand either you're cool with this moment in time and the

251
00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:13.780
range and the performance, and it is what it is. Or you're a tech geek,

252
00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:15.670
like most guys that are engaging in that,

253
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.970
and you're going to be hemorrhaging money then coming back every couple of years

254
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:22.660
for us to upgrade and evolve as the sciences evolve. Oh, you know,

255
00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:26.470
we build on the sub modular, even like your Broncos sub-modules built.

256
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.120
So your power train,

257
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.280
the electrical network for your power train goes to a two single Deutsche tech

258
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.580
26 pin connectors, aerospace connectors.

259
00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:39.550
So one day when that powertrain is no longer relevant,

260
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:42.850
but your truck still has good platform value, unplugged that,

261
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.070
yank it out and put in the hydrogen or the micro capacitor or whatever the hell

262
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.040
is working at the time.
