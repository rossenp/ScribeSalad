00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.410
My worry about this Biden thing is that people

3
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:09.690
voted for Biden because they hate Trump.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.780
They didn't vote for Biden because he's a leader that they respect and they

5
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:15.660
want, and they admire. And that he's going to lead us out of it.

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.910
Like if Obama was calling for unity,

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.570
if he was the guy that was the president and he was calling for unity,

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.540
we've got to abandon all these ideas, you know,

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.770
about division we're all together. And he brought everybody together. Again,

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.540
that might work, that might work.

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.550
People might recognize that this really intelligent guy with this message of

12
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:37.500
unity should be listened to well.

13
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.130
<v 1>But that did happen, right? I mean, that happened in 2008.</v>

14
00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:43.310
That's what Obama said when he won. And there was some,

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.350
a decent amount of unity.

16
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:48.950
I'm thinking how to over 70% approval rating when he first came in. I mean,

17
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:51.620
it wasn't certainly anything like the country is now, right?

18
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.800
But at the end of eight years of Obama, you had a Republican house,

19
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:58.640
a Republican Senate and Donald Trump elected president.

20
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.350
So we had that,

21
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.000
but it didn't matter because even with such a

22
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:05.781
charismatic guy,

23
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:08.630
like Obama calling for unity and sang a lot of the right things,

24
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:13.370
at least at first the policies and what was actually happening in the

25
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:17.450
country were really over huge numbers of people.

26
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.080
And then also things that might've been somewhat out of Obama's control,

27
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.700
but not completely out, um, is that the era of it was like,

28
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.990
like the, the Obama recovery, which was the most like cronyism,

29
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.460
corrupt recovery ever.

30
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.380
And the woke lecturing all rose up at the same time in the Obama years.

31
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:37.400
Not all of it, his fault.

32
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.740
<v 0>Did you see the Camila Harris has her gender pronouns in her bio now? Oh yeah.</v>

33
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.690
<v 2>She's I saw her say that, uh.</v>

34
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.750
<v 1>In a CNN town hall, when she was still running for president,</v>

35
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.350
she came out and just, no one even asked her, she just went I'm Kamala Harris,

36
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:52.730
my genders. Are she her?

37
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.040
<v 3>Oh, what the is going on? No.</v>

38
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.600
<v 0>Did you see what John Papas wrote? No, he wrote, uh, uh, my,</v>

39
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.740
my gender is he ha he's like, I'm going to start a trend here.

40
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:11.150
I recognize is he okay? That's great. I'm like take that on too.

41
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.900
I might, I might that he all, I like.

42
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.140
<v 1>It. Very strange. Strange says.</v>

43
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.613
<v 3>It's in his bio.</v>

44
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.300
He has science scientists and journalists. He wrote

45
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.040
great. It's hilarious.

46
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.260
<v 1>I think though, people like, uh, they, if,</v>

47
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:39.540
if you really did care about the unity or whatever,

48
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:42.360
which I think is like something that maybe we should care about a little bit.

49
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.170
I mean, not that we all have to like agree on everything. I don't like this,

50
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.900
that we don't have to all be one and all have the same, you know,

51
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.010
attitude about everything.

52
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.370
But when you see what's going on in the country over this year,

53
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:55.980
the culture where is really scary. And like,

54
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:59.530
people should be appropriately concerned about that.

55
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.100
When you see what's going on in like, uh, what's going on in Portland this year,

56
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.810
where you had like the, you know, like,

57
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.600
like militias facing off against each other,

58
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.470
you have like the Antifa versus the proud boys type. It's like, we're,

59
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.890
it's like a, they're playing pretend civil war, you know,

60
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.090
like it's kind of a game. Right. But it's kind of not that far off,

61
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.280
you know what I mean? Got shot and killed. Yeah.

62
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.150
And there are people on guns staring at each other down. And for everybody,

63
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.220
for every same person, she'd be like,

64
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:30.130
you do not want to see a civil war in this country.

65
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:33.340
I don't care how much fun you think this is right now in the moment you don't

66
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:35.380
want this to actually come to you,

67
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:39.190
holding your buddy's head while he bleeds out and screams for his mom.

68
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:43.720
Like you don't want that. So the idea of toning that down is, is a good idea.

69
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.770
But I think the only way to do that is to understand

70
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.410
why Donald Trump was president to begin with. And that, like,

71
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:53.711
to me,

72
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:57.580
the big story of all of this isn't that Joe Biden looks like he's going to be

73
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.520
the president. That's kind of boring to me. It's like, yeah, Joe,

74
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.550
Joe Biden got elected. He's been getting elected for almost 50 years. Like,

75
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.620
okay,

76
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.420
the story is still that Donald Trump won the presidency.

77
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.800
And then it,

78
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:16.210
four years later got like millions more votes than he got the first time.

79
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.440
And almost by the, by a hair, almost one at again. I mean,

80
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:22.810
that's like pretty crazy. Did you see, uh,

81
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:27.580
when he was in Pennsylvania and he drew 53,000 people to Israeli in

82
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:30.640
central Pennsylvania and they start off the first,

83
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:34.900
like four minutes of it are a chant. We love you.

84
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.030
We love you. I mean like,

85
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.340
what the is that what's going on here? And to just kind of dismiss it,

86
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:45.760
like the corporate press attitude is like, well, it's racism. I think,

87
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:46.150
I think there's.

88
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.550
<v 2>A little bit more failure. The education system.</v>

89
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.020
<v 4>I mean, I, I always, I always agree with failure.</v>

90
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.270
<v 1>Of the education system that is always an acceptable answer,</v>

91
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.120
but I think it's a rejection.

92
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.940
<v 0>Of looting. It's a rejection of the woke culture.</v>

93
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.770
It's a rejection of being called a racist and being called a fascist.

94
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.240
<v 1>Big parts. It's a.</v>

95
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.640
<v 0>Lot of the, what this,</v>

96
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.380
this call for a radical shift in the identity of

97
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:14.214
America.

98
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.690
<v 1>I think that's a huge part of it. I also think that if you're the,</v>

99
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.870
the woke lecturing is almost like just the insult on top.

100
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.590
Like if you're one of these people who, who lives in these towns, uh,

101
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.910
you you've seen for, for decades now, like factories disappear,

102
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.930
jobs get outsourced. The, the, the life expectancy has gone down.

103
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:36.420
Suicides have gone up. You know, you're one of these, the,

104
00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:40.480
the some guy in central Pennsylvania, or all over the country and what,

105
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.010
you know, you probably lost your job. Now, you're working a shittier job. Uh,

106
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:47.670
you never really came back from where you are after 2008. Uh, you,

107
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.660
maybe you got a son who's addicted to opioids. You got another son who like,

108
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.231
you know,

109
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:55.560
has never been the same since he got back from one of these stupid wars. Um,

110
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.260
and then after all that,

111
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.730
the people who sent you there are now lecturing you about your white privilege.

112
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.170
And then Donald Trump, all it really took was Donald Trump came in and said,

113
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.770
you know what, I'm for you, I'm for you.

114
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:13.160
I'm not for the Mexicans or the Muslims. I'm not for this world. I'm for you.

115
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.300
And I want you to win the plastic.

116
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.300
<v 0>Message. Sure. And that's one of the things that he got across,</v>

117
00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:23.170
he boiled down the whole thing to like, make America great. Again,

118
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.820
like that's a simplistic message. And to people that want a sort of like,

119
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.440
they really, you know, some, some country music songs, I, by the way,

120
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:34.810
I'm a fan of country music. I like a lot of country music,

121
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.650
but a lot of country music. I don't like, because I know what you're doing.

122
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.190
You're just trying to box everything into this real simple.

123
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.330
<v 3>We're going to go down to the lake. We're going to have ourselves a drink,</v>

124
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.480
you know, like, you know what I'm saying? We're going to take my truck.

125
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.750
Everything's going to be great. You know, I miss my grandma.

126
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.201
<v 0>Like,</v>

127
00:06:53.201 --> 00:06:58.060
there's like this simplistic really boiled down

128
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.890
worldview. And it comforts people because people are scared of nuance.

129
00:07:02.891 --> 00:07:06.730
And they're scared of, they're scared of the complexity of life. Yes.

130
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.050
<v 1>And Donald Trump was a master at that boiling things down to a real simple,</v>

131
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.680
slow slogan, a real, you know, simple phrase that,

132
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.870
that people can wrap their heads around and get behind.

133
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.350
But there's also that on the opposition to Trump side,

134
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.920
where they try to boil things down to like, well, uh,

135
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.640
it was racism or it was white supremacy or something like that. And you're like,

136
00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:29.970
there's a lot more going on here. And I,

137
00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:34.620
I really think that if like there,

138
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.400
these people on some level recognize that they've been screwed over by the

139
00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:43.840
establishment, forgotten by them and that they, they are hated by,

140
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.780
by the establishment, which is true, like they're right about that.

141
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.180
And so they wanted someone to fight for them.

142
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.280
And I think Trump represents that to them. I don't think he really was that, uh,

143
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.830
from my perspective, I think it's kind of a con artist,

144
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.660
but I do think that he tapped into something that's really powerful

145
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.820
and that actually could get a lot worse if there's not some kind of like

146
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.810
reconciling with.

147
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.710
<v 0>It. Yeah. Yeah. How does it get better now? That's the real question? Like,</v>

148
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.470
because what, like,

149
00:08:14.471 --> 00:08:18.490
w how does it get better with Biden and Kamala Harris? I mean,

150
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.530
unless people start rejecting,

151
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:23.200
unless people realize that things aren't going to change for the better with

152
00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:24.040
them in office.

153
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.790
<v 1>Well, that's, I think that is that realization is going to come.</v>

154
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.640
<v 0>About a year and a half sooner now. Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.910
<v 1>Maybe something like that. Maybe, maybe even sooner, because things go,</v>

156
00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:36.400
you know, things move fast these days. Um,

157
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.300
but I do think that w one of the things that's interesting with Biden and Kamala

158
00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:41.950
Harris is that a lot of these,

159
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.390
like SU super progressive people are celebrating right now because Trump

160
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.980
was out, you know?

161
00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:51.760
And so Trump was defeated and they feel like they helped get Biden and Kamala

162
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:54.490
Harrison, which is, they were certainly a portion of helping them.

163
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.170
And Trump also is the one who is saying like, well, you know, Joe Biden,

164
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:02.040
he's just a Trojan horse for AOC and Ilhan Omar. He's,

165
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.300
he's a Trojan horse for socialism, which is actually complete. Uh, Joe Biden,

166
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:08.430
if anything is a Trojan horse for Dick Cheney,

167
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.590
D Joe Biden is a Trojan horse for the establishment. Warhawks big banks,

168
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:15.330
corporate elite tech, Johnny.

169
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.100
<v 5>Yeah. It's going to be them. He's filling his cabinet with Republic.</v>

170
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.520
<v 1>But those Republicans, but those Republicans,</v>

171
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.300
the ones who basically caused this whole mess to begin with one of the things.

172
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.120
<v 0>That Trump said during his campaign, he's saying,</v>

173
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.940
talking about how much money that Joe Biden raised. He said,

174
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.420
I could raise that money too, but I'd have to make those deals.

175
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.920
And then I'd have to be compromised. And when he was saying that, I was like,

176
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:40.160
he's.

177
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.410
<v 1>Right. He's not wrong about that. Well, not wrong about.</v>

178
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.950
<v 0>That, because if he decided to play ball with all those guys,</v>

179
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.330
like they would've got behind him and then the narrative would have switched.

180
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:50.690
Yeah.

181
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.940
<v 1>That's for sure. And, and, and it's interesting.</v>

182
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.290
It's a really important question that people might want to like ponder even

183
00:09:57.291 --> 00:10:00.260
people who really hate Donald Trump. And you can really hate Donald Trump.

184
00:10:00.261 --> 00:10:01.094
That's fine.

185
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.780
But you might wonder why it is that the establishment hates him so

186
00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:08.480
much. And I have, like my, uh,

187
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.930
guess is that it's not for the same reasons that your left wing friend hates

188
00:10:11.931 --> 00:10:16.160
Donald Trump. Like, I don't buy for a second that the, uh,

189
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.840
the CIA and the Republican establishment hated Donald Trump,

190
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.030
because he said mean things about Mexicans. Like,

191
00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:24.770
I just don't buy that for a second.

192
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.250
These are people who will slaughter brown people in third world countries and

193
00:10:28.251 --> 00:10:31.280
lose no sleep over it. Like I don't buy. That's why they hated him.

194
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:36.260
I think what they hated about Donald Trump was that he was a wild man

195
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.740
who would blurt out things. And he blurred out a lot of crazy,

196
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.750
but then you'd also blurt out the truth.

197
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.370
And that was something that nobody you're not supposed to say that like,

198
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.580
you're when Donald Trump was running in 2016, you know,

199
00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:54.140
he stood at the Republican primary debate stage in

200
00:10:54.141 --> 00:10:59.060
South Carolina Republicans in South Carolina and looked at Jeb Bush in the

201
00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:03.020
eyes and said, your brother lied us into war in Iraq.

202
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:04.880
And everyone was like, what the?

203
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.130
Like you can't say that at the Republican, South Carolina and all the pundits,

204
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.280
all the media class, they were like, Trump's finished now. Cause you can't.

205
00:11:13.281 --> 00:11:15.020
These are the people who fought the war in Iraq.

206
00:11:15.021 --> 00:11:18.530
And these are the most pro military people around. And the next day at the,

207
00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:21.980
at the primary Donald Trump took 60% and all the other Republicans,

208
00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:23.990
all 12 of them split the other 40%.

209
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:29.570
<v 6>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

210
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.690
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:35.120
they're going to be available everywhere. But after December 1st,

212
00:11:35.121 --> 00:11:38.840
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.830
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

214
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.660
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
