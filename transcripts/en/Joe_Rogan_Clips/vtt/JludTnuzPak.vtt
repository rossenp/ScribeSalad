00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 2>Yeah, I did all that.</v>

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.640
I went outside and I started taking it and I lost weight.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.320
I didn't want to, and, and I haven't gotten it.

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.400
<v 1>Good. Aren't you happy? They lost weight. Don't you feel like lighter?</v>

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.120
<v 0>I feel lighter. That's exactly how I feel moving around. Yeah, dude. Well,</v>

7
00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:24.070
it's like, it's the equivalent of like eight bags of potatoes.

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.550
And if I think about what it would be like to carry that around in a backpack,

9
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.510
like through an airport and then get to set it down, take.

10
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.870
<v 1>One of those. Take one of those 45 pound plates. That's a heavy weight. Like a,</v>

11
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.230
you put on a, like a barbell, one of those big ones. That's.

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.020
<v 0>What you lost my ankle weights. And my hand weights together are 20 pounds.</v>

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.620
And if I think about carrying that times two, yeah.

14
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.860
Even across a room annoying, I would be tired.

15
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.060
And that's what you were doing. And I feel so much better. I mean,

16
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.340
I had had back pain from the time that I was a teenager.

17
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.570
I'd had joint pain and I thought that I was just gonna have it for my whole

18
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:05.130
life,

19
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.650
cuz I didn't think I was heavy enough that it was affecting my joints and that

20
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.570
pain is all gone. And um, and it makes sense to me, cuz again,

21
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:16.570
if I carry around a heavy bag through an airport,

22
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.970
like my back will hurt at the end of the day. If I do that right now. Yeah.

23
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.160
And to have to carry that weight around everywhere I go,

24
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:27.280
everything I do even just sitting, having that extra weight,

25
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.800
like I just don't want it back.

26
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.800
And I think part of it might be cuz I stopped eating flour and sugar,

27
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:36.440
which I've heard are inflammatory as well. So I think part of it might be that,

28
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.120
but the other thing is just getting to set down the weight. I feel awesome.

29
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.600
I think.

30
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.040
<v 1>Both are factors. Yeah, for sure.</v>

31
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.030
I mean that definitely the it's just logical that the weights a factor,

32
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.830
but for sure sugar and,

33
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.710
and flour and any processed foods like that cause inflammation.

34
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.670
So what did you do for exercise?

35
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.510
<v 0>Um, I played tennis and swim and I do workouts.</v>

36
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.190
Um, that Stasia pat well created. She was a comic.

37
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.020
She ran a show at the store and she's a trainer and she started doing

38
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:10.220
these classes on zoom for female comics.

39
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.860
And a bunch of us have had before and after transformations

40
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.820
were like a bunch of fat comics have gotten hot because of her workouts.

41
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.420
&lt;laugh&gt; she's onto something, dude. She's so funny. And she,

42
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.170
you can like work you out for an hour where I'm just like laughing.

43
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.250
I feel like I'm hanging out with a friend and she has this specific brand of

44
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:35.370
tough love where she'll like, she'll call she'll call me a.

45
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.570
Like right before I'm about to drop out of a plank and she'll be like,

46
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:42.970
the world has enough. Don't be a. Don't out. What is her name again?

47
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.080
Sta pat will L S T a S I a P a T w does she have an Instagram? Yeah.

48
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:51.680
And her Instagram is just that it's all one word. Jamie will find it.

49
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.480
She's a monster. And she called her thing. School of thought. T H O T.

50
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.373
Oh the H O.

51
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.273
<v 1>T. That's hilarious.</v>

52
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.280
<v 0>School of thought a beast dude. Is that right there? Yeah.</v>

53
00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.240
She has the transformations in her highlights.

54
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.440
<v 1>All right. She's so funny, dude.</v>

55
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.400
She's nostalgic for Boston in the nineties.

56
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.920
<v 0>Right now. Yeah. She'll yell at you in her like movies yesterday,</v>

57
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.640
long island accent. I'm like and something about it.

58
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.910
I wouldn't tolerate half the she says to me from an east.

59
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.510
<v 1>Course in the nineties. I'm telling you some of that. Wasn't funny. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

60
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.230
<v 0>Oh, there I am. Look at that. Oopsie doopy bits. He's in a bra.</v>

61
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.630
<v 1>Uhoh go to the far right. Look at her dude. You lost so much. Wait,</v>

62
00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:30.464
that's crazy.

63
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.590
<v 0>You got my little cats in the background that I adopted,</v>

64
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.510
so I wouldn't open my wrist in a bathtub. There we go. There she is.

65
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.940
I did not know I was that fat boy. Do I have egg on my face?

66
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.420
<v 1>What, what did you think? &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

67
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.220
<v 0>You just didn't check. I thought I had 25 pounds to lose.</v>

68
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.500
And so I set, I mean I'm comfortable talking about numbers.

69
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.820
So my top weight was 180.

70
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.940
I set my goal weight at 1 55 and now I'm 1 42 0.5. Wow.

71
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.490
And I'm not, I'm in a healthy weight range.

72
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.530
So if my body stops like easily losing weight, then I'll be like, okay,

73
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:08.730
this is the weight that my body wants to be, but it's still,

74
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.010
I'm still losing weight and it's not protesting.

75
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.570
I'm certainly not starving myself. That's.

76
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.310
<v 1>Awesome. Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.490
So it was just a matter of eating the right food and just forcing yourself to do

78
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.400
rigorous at.

79
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.360
<v 0>Exercise. Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.520
I joined a support group for Overeaters and I weigh measure and

81
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:31.120
write down every single thing I put in my body and eat balanced

82
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.400
portions that were given to me by a dietician.

83
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.240
So I measure out like protein, grains, fruits, and vegetables fats.

84
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.070
And then my goal that I, uh,

85
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.430
that I try for is to be in a caloric deficit of about 250 calories a day,

86
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:51.470
which averages out to, uh, about a half a pound, a week of weight loss.

87
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.350
And I don't do it perfectly,

88
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.910
but like that's enough where I'm not starving all the time. I'm satiated,

89
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.660
but so it's sustainable, but I'm also like steadily losing weight.

90
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.940
And it's been, I mean, I haven't had pizza in a year.

91
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.300
Like I haven't had any added flour, any added sugar. Wow. And um,

92
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.860
like 10 months.

93
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.180
<v 1>Well you're a disciplined person, you know, I really admire your work ethic.</v>

94
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.980
And I,

95
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.660
I know I've told you this before you had come to the store with your notebooks.

96
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.330
I'm like, look at you're notebook is like, you're like meticulous.

97
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.650
Like all your would be like super written out.

98
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.170
And so many comics are so impulsive and sort of

99
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.170
scatterbrained and they don't focus. And I really admire that. You're focused.

100
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.010
I, I always admired that. I thought it was.

101
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.570
<v 0>Cool. Thank you so much. I admire that about you too.</v>

102
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.400
So that means so much coming from you. I admire your work ethic. Yeah.

103
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.200
I pretty much like took the energy that I had been putting in to stand up and

104
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:53.680
just applied that same thing to this cuz it's like,

105
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:58.160
if you really wanna do something, why around. Why waste the effort? Yeah.

106
00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:59.240
Like what would be the point?

107
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.920
And I spent so long trying to like diet without weighing and

108
00:06:04.921 --> 00:06:07.200
measuring and having like an intention that it's like,

109
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.640
I just put up a shitload of boundaries to where it was unfuckable because I

110
00:06:11.641 --> 00:06:16.200
believe in taking like little actions in the direction of the thing that you,

111
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.630
but it doesn't help me if I'm like, I'm gonna try to just eat better,

112
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.070
which is such a general concept.

113
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.630
And then if I'm stepping on the scale once a week,

114
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.830
then what happens when my weight is up. I, because as it stands now,

115
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.110
I'll step on the scale. My weight could be up three pounds and that's fine.

116
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.710
And I don't trip because I wrote everything down.

117
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.260
I know that I'm in a caloric deficit and I know it's water or salt, whatever.

118
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.700
I don't understand that stuff.

119
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.300
But then I step on the scale the next week and it'll be down, you know,

120
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.701
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

121
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:50.580
And so I thought that like a weight loss chart went like that,

122
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.540
but it really goes like that. And I think, especially for women, I mean,

123
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.970
mine's just been up, down, up, down up, but the general trend is, you know,

124
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.250
38.

125
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.970
<v 1>Months later, if you could take the energy that you like,</v>

126
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.730
the good that you feel from losing weight and getting healthy and just somehow

127
00:07:08.731 --> 00:07:11.770
or another, like put it in a VR, like put it in someone's head,

128
00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:15.290
like feel just feel this, just feel this ready, put it on like, oh my God,

129
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.890
I feel so good. Like you can get there. You can get there.

130
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.600
Like you can get there. But the problem is,

131
00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:22.640
everybody wants to get there so quick. They want to get there immediately.

132
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:24.920
They wanna take a pill. They wanna listen to Dr. Oz.

133
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.920
They want to get there quick. You can't get there quick. Yeah. Doesn't work.

134
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.840
And that the crazy thing is like,

135
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.360
you gotta get sick the same way or you gotta get better the same way you got

136
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:39.510
sick. Like it takes time to get overweight and it takes time to lose weight.

137
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.070
Like you, if you're not gonna just starve yourself and lose it all,

138
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.710
cuz your body's gonna go a deficit, you're gonna freak out.

139
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.510
Your metabolism's gonna crash. Then when you eat, you're gonna pack it on quick.

140
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.710
Cuz your body's gonna like, oh my God, we, we, we might starve to death.

141
00:07:52.711 --> 00:07:54.390
Like I have to slow my metabolism down.

142
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.780
<v 0>Yeah. I think a huge part of it too is like the action has to be eat the reward.</v>

143
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.380
So like I love doing my workouts because she makes me laugh.

144
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.620
It's built right into my routine. I eat my oatmeal. I meditate.

145
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.540
And then I do one of her workouts and it, it feels good.

146
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.620
It feels good for my body. And um, and the same thing with food.

147
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:21.050
Like I don't eat most of my favorite foods from before

148
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.490
anymore, but I love everything I do eat. Cuz I've learned how to cook stuff.

149
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.850
Brown rice, vegetables, proteins.

150
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.690
I've learned how to cook food the way that it tastes good to me.

151
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.970
And so I'm not doing workouts. I hate, I'm not eating food that I hate.

152
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.730
And so it's sustainable. That's awesome.

153
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.560
<v 1>Throw this off the deck. Same CRA you got crazy.</v>

154
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.320
<v 0>Got a little crazy. It's sustainable.</v>

155
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.160
<v 1>Everybody eats electrocuted. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. It's uh, it's good to see.</v>

156
