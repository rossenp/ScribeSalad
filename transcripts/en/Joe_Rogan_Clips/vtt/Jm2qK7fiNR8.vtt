1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.200
<v 2>We were getting like major athletes, like major athletes. And, uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.920
I remember I interviewed, um, uh,

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.040
Chris Wideman and he was fighting, um, uh,

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.160
he wasn't fighting the other guy, uh, Anderson Silva.

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.880
<v 1>No, yo Maita. I can't remember who Rockhold.</v>

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.830
<v 0>It might have been when he was fighting Luke Rockwell. I can't remember. Um,</v>

8
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.590
what year? This was about.

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.870
<v 1>2015. Was he the champ? He was the champ.</v>

10
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.310
So the odds are it's either VTO, Lito, Machi.

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.230
<v 0>Vido. It was Vidar. He was fighting VOR. Oh. And, uh,</v>

12
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:38.230
it was the first time I had like sat down with like, you know,

13
00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:41.860
guys who were trained fighters and the calm,

14
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.020
it's just like a calm and a piece that like, I was trying to put my finger on,

15
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:49.300
like, what is that calm? And then I realized like, if like I'm in,

16
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.900
I get insecure, you know, but you know, I'm, I'm like got nervousness.

17
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:56.220
And a lot of that is because I always in a situation, no,

18
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:59.260
there's prob a probability that I could get up. Yeah.

19
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.130
Where if I walked around and I knew that 99 pull 0.7% of the people I could

20
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.050
up, I'd.

21
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.330
<v 1>Be calm. Well, Chris Wideman is calm.</v>

22
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.290
Like I would be calm if I was hanging out with 10 year old girls and they were

23
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:13.370
trying to tell me how the world works and I'd be like, that's cute.

24
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.530
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Let me tell you how the world really works. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

25
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.763
<v 0>That's like that. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.360
<v 1>Especially when he was the champ. Yeah. I mean, when he was the champ of all,</v>

27
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.880
when Chris Wideman was coming up and the limitations of Chris Wideman

28
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:29.120
legitimately are the limitations of the human body,

29
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.440
because his body started to break. He started to,

30
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.520
he had knee problems and neck problems and back problems.

31
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.960
But the limitations of his mind were limitless.

32
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.680
It was there's a lot of these guys like,

33
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.910
and a lot of 'em are wrestlers because I think were wrestlers of the strongest

34
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:46.630
brains because the strongest minds, the strongest determination,

35
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:48.110
because that sport is so brutal,

36
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.110
but these great wrestlers who get into fighting like Chris Wideman and Kane

37
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.250
Velazquez was another one.

38
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.070
The limitations of Kalas were the limitations of his body.

39
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.790
Cuz he started getting so shoulder surgery and back surgery and knee surgery.

40
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.460
And then it all started falling apart. But when he was at his peak,

41
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.740
Chris Mo Wideman was a man. Strong J not just,

42
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.140
but just the mind too. It's not, it's not just the body.

43
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.820
His body was surely strong, but his mind was just unbreakable. Right.

44
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:21.060
He would break guys, you know, and, and Kane was the same way.

45
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.570
Kane was a guy who broke guys. He break because I,

46
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.410
I really firmly believe this to this day, that wrestlers, because there's no,

47
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.570
like I had Jordan burrow was on the other day. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

48
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.410
he's a wrestler, right? Olympic gold medalist, four time world champion,

49
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.250
stud of a human being. And when you talk to him,

50
00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:39.890
you realize like he's just so exceptional in every way.

51
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.010
And one of the reasons why he's so exceptional is because wrestling has no goal

52
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.320
glory. Like the people that get into wrestling,

53
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:51.240
they do it because it's the pursuit. It's not, it's not like,

54
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.360
uh, Bentley and, uh, mansion and watches and rings and all that. Like the,

55
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.520
the, the, the glory is in victory. It's in the pursuit. And also in victory,

56
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.640
in the most difficult of circumstances,

57
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.480
which is like amateur high level world, class wrestling.

58
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.200
Like those it's so hard. So the guys like Chris Wideman,

59
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.680
the guys like Jordan burrows,

60
00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:17.000
the guys like king Velasquez guys who Excel in wrestling, they there's a,

61
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.710
a mindset that they have have. That's, uh,

62
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.150
it's so interesting to be around them because they're,

63
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:26.110
they're because they are that calm. Right? They have that, that, there's a,

64
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:30.390
there's a level that they've reached that very few human beings outside of

65
00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:31.230
wrestlers ever reached.

66
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.911
<v 0>That's fascinating.</v>

67
00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:34.670
You think that's changing now because they do have an outlet with MMA,

68
00:03:34.671 --> 00:03:35.151
which is great.

69
00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:38.910
Like they can go pro and become rich and kind of famous some of 'em.

70
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.660
<v 1>But you know, like Jordan burrows doesn't have any interest in, in fighting,</v>

71
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.620
especially his wife doesn't want him to fight. Cause he,

72
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.900
he does make good money. Wrestling just has an ambassador to wrestling,

73
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.260
but I don't think,

74
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.620
I don't think they go fall into the same pitfalls that a lot of the other, uh,

75
00:03:55.621 --> 00:04:00.050
fighters fall into, you know, like a lot of 'em they just, uh, uh, they,

76
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.170
they get into fame and glory and all that.

77
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.690
And Wideman never really got into that. He was just in a smashing people.

78
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.930
<v 0>Yeah. Smashing yeah. Cobe. Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.963
<v 1>Just smashing people like.</v>

80
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.730
<v 0>Cobe. I'm going smash. Your boy. &lt;laugh&gt; he's the perfect.</v>

81
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.090
<v 1>Example. Cobes the perfect example. The guy drives a Toyota. Yeah. Okay.</v>

82
00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:16.850
He's worth millions of dollars.

83
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.890
He's the most dominant fighter in any weight class, in the history of,

84
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.360
and he is as calm and as humble as can be while also being incredibly

85
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:29.840
confident. Yeah. Yeah. And super religious. Yeah. Doesn't drink. Doesn't smoke.

86
00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:33.960
Doesn't party. Doesn't do anything. He's just dedicated to smashing people.

87
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.720
I'm gonna smash your boy.

88
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.800
<v 0>Right. I'm gonna smash your boy. &lt;laugh&gt; when he said that I come.</v>

89
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.470
<v 1>I'm gonna smash your voice.</v>

90
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.350
<v 0>Somebody said to me, that's like Samuel Jackson and pole fiction. You're like,</v>

91
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.343
ah. It's.

92
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.950
<v 1>Greater because it's not fake. Right. And he did it. Yeah. He,</v>

93
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:50.190
and he did smash him and he, you know, one of the, the best,

94
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.710
the scariest thing that he ever said, he goes, I want to change his face. Yeah,

95
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:56.510
yeah, yeah. I want to change his face. Yeah.

96
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.270
<v 0>Who, how much is the mental bat? Did like Connor when he fought Connor,</v>

97
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:02.940
it was like opposites going against each other.

98
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.540
Mm-hmm like that ultra ultra humility versus that like, you know,

99
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.420
absolute boastful. Like, do you think Connor knew before? Mm-hmm just no,

100
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.340
like you think he.

101
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.380
<v 1>Went in, he was gonna win and look, he, he, he won round with KIB.</v>

102
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.700
He won the third round and that's probably the only round that KIB lost in his

103
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:19.221
entire career.

104
00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:22.650
Like there's an argument that maybe he lost one or two rounds earlier that are

105
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:26.290
real close, but I mean, he's, he's 29 and oh,

106
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.850
you have to understand how insane that is.

107
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:29.770
And then you have to understand the weight class he's in,

108
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.770
he's in the 155 pound weight class,

109
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:34.450
which is arguably the most competitive in the history of the sport. Right.

110
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.970
Cause like the arguments are like 45,

111
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.320
55 and maybe 70 or the most competitive, uh, weight classes I ever.

112
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.200
And he's the, the most dominant guy ever in the most competitive weight class.

113
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.960
Yeah. I mean, he's a monster, he's a beast, man.

114
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.240
You're in that weight class and you know, you gotta fight him. You're like,

115
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.160
yeah. Do you question everything about yourself? Yeah. Do you think.

116
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.120
<v 0>Wrestler is on to that level? Are, have an advantage in.</v>

117
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.080
<v 1>MMA a cuz you're just eventually gonna get your hands on a guy. Yeah.</v>

118
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.480
Well that's what he has an advantage in. Yeah. I mean he, when he wrestles guys,

119
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.960
when he grabs them, you could see the look in their face. Like, oh my God,

120
00:06:09.961 --> 00:06:11.120
this is different. It's like a.

121
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.960
<v 0>Anaconda. Got you.</v>

122
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.880
<v 1>Just different. Well, look,</v>

123
00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:16.440
look at his last guy that he fought is just engaging. Who's a killer. Right?

124
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.270
Smashes Tony Ferguson, smashes, Etson. Barboza I mean,

125
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:23.230
he's a beast and a really good wrestler too.

126
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.750
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but when Kabe got a hold of him yeah.

127
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.270
Every time just drags him to the ground and almost submitted him at the end of

128
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.190
the first round and then submitted him in the second round. Well, he.

129
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.710
<v 0>Said he wanted it submit, he didn't wanna hurt him. Do you think that was true?</v>

130
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.630
That yeah. He said like, I didn't want do it that way.

131
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.300
Cuz his parents were there. &lt;laugh&gt; well,

132
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:41.820
not just that's some ill to say like I'll just wait to next round.

133
00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:43.740
Do it a little softer. Well, they were friends.

134
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.360
<v 1>Um,</v>

135
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.900
Justin actually they have the same manager and Justin actually helped him cut

136
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.060
weight earlier in his career. Cuz cutting weight is uh,

137
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.900
I don't know if you ever spent some time in the sauna.

138
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.420
<v 0>I have. I went, I did some shows in Sweden. Yeah. Yeah. There's.</v>

139
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.410
<v 1>A, there's a moment in the sauna that comes around like minute, 13,</v>

140
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.850
14, especially if it's like a hot minute. It's a three for me. Yeah.

141
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.130
When you start looking around, you're like,

142
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:10.010
you look at your wash and you're like, like how do I do this?

143
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.170
I want to get out now. And you don't, you, you don't get out. You stay in.

144
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.450
And so it's like, you need support. And like a lot of times,

145
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.720
like I guys will have guys cut weight with them and they'll come and sit with

146
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:25.680
you and give you support. Cuz like as much as, uh, as KIB is like his mind is a,

147
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.440
a, a, a, a vault, a, a bank vault.

148
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.600
I mean his mind is impenetrable. Even a man like him will,

149
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.960
will use encouragement from other people and you support and love and friendship

150
00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:41.470
from other people. And Justin helped him cut weight. Wow. And I think they were,

151
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.230
he was, they had a bond because of that.

152
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.590
<v 0>So when he fought Connor, he wanted, uh, change his face.</v>

153
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.070
He wanted to smash to smash your.

154
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:48.923
<v 1>Boy.</v>

155
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.150
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; with Gaji. He's just like,</v>

156
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.830
I'm gonna beat him and I'm gonna beat him the way I would beat a friend.

157
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:57.870
It's like, you're beating up your brother. Yeah. Like you go like, you know,

158
00:07:57.871 --> 00:08:00.700
I'm gonna hurt you, but not my brother. So it's gonna like, I'm gonna do it.

159
00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:01.580
So you can, he.

160
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.180
<v 1>He went to submissions faster than he has in any other fight he's ever had.</v>

161
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.380
Right. God he's that good? He's not good. He almost caught,

162
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.220
he fought with a broken toe too, by the way. Wow. Snapped. Like he took a,

163
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.860
they showed an x-ray of his toe after the fight. He broke his toe in training.

164
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.380
Right. And a lot of guys would've pulled out of that fight.

165
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.810
If you looked at the fight, I watched it yesterday. I actually,

166
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:23.130
while I was working out, he had his toes taped together. Right. That's it.

167
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.490
That's the brace. Right? That's the cast. Right.

168
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.490
A little piece of tape connecting his toes. Cause when you.

169
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.330
<v 0>Break your to that's, all you can do right. Is really just tape it.</v>

170
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.250
<v 1>Up. He's a extraordinary human being and uh, it's his mind. It's his, I mean,</v>

171
00:08:35.251 --> 00:08:37.890
his body obviously is uh, ridiculous too.

172
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.920
But his body is ridiculous because of his yeah. You.

173
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.120
<v 0>Know, and he just comes from a place that like, you know,</v>

174
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:47.000
what did Joe DiMaggio say? Like, uh, and so rich,

175
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:48.440
rich guys can't make the big leagues.

176
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:52.480
He comes from a place that probably like getting in the octagon is like the

177
00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:54.760
easiest thing he's done in his entire life. I mean there,

178
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.800
those videos of him as a kid, wrestling bears, I mean,

179
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.760
it's like you got, if you gotta get in the rig with him, you're going, like,

180
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.040
how can I grapple better than a bear.
