00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.760
<v 1>You know, I think to really be a good game warden,</v>

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.000
you gotta cut your teeth on all the traditional stuff.

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.360
That's critical of just having to, having to check guys with guns all the time.

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.440
You know, most cops look at that and go, that's crazy. I mean,

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.960
everybody you check has a knife or a firearm. Yeah. Well,

7
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:22.630
fortunately 99% of 'em are gonna like Q and me that wanna see a game warden and

8
00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:25.110
game warden wants to see us. But for that one felon,

9
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:28.630
that's on parole and he's in the woods hiding out and we run across that a lot.

10
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.350
And I, I ran across a ton of that down here in SoCal,

11
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.830
really at the start of my career.

12
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.630
And I've got some interesting stories about that, but so guys who are like,

13
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.070
they skip bail and then they go and hide. Yep.

14
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.740
And they've got like a no bail warrant wanted on some warrant somewhere.

15
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.220
And so they're off fishing. They have an illegal firearm.

16
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.940
Maybe they're a felon in possession of a firearm. They can't even have.

17
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.580
And now they're out in a remote area where no cop gonna find me here.

18
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.380
And then I'm the new game warden in Riverside county, you know,

19
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.580
all fricking motivated, really green. I don't know totally what I'm doing yet.

20
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.160
Right.

21
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.330
And I'm in that truck cruising in something I got into down on here that was

22
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:06.010
just crazy. But I will say this, it was a heck of a learning curve and, um,

23
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.770
I'm really blessed. It went out the way it did and it was, I was safe in it,

24
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:11.890
but, um, we would get gang bangers from, from LA here.

25
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.890
And they would go over into Riverside county and get into my kind of rural,

26
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.050
you know, foothills and on the edge of the national forest.

27
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.810
And they'd have AK 47 S and they'd have, you know,

28
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.040
automatic pistols and they would spotlight through these canyons gunning for

29
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:29.640
everything. They'd kill rabbits, they'd kill coyotes, they'd kill deer.

30
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.880
They'd get to the end of like a canyon that has like a, an outlet of a dam,

31
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.680
throw a Gill net out and spend all night.

32
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:39.160
They're just gillnet and fish and hunt freely and shooting,

33
00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:42.120
killing everything with their spotlights, grab their gillnet,

34
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:45.790
grab hundreds of fish pack up and then head back, you know,

35
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:48.710
back to the LA basin, gang bangers. I'm not kidding.

36
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.550
And the craziest part of fishing, gang bangers. Yeah.

37
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:54.750
Commercial almost commercial fishing does it does. It sounds nuts. Right.

38
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:56.550
So strange. And what would they do with the fish? Oh,

39
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:58.590
they'd eat 'em maybe they'd sell 'em. You know, who knows?

40
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:00.710
Usually with quantities that big, they were getting sold.

41
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.260
But the thing that was crazy is I would be, you know, alone, I'd be in my truck.

42
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.180
I didn't have a canine yet, you know? And now I just, uh, I just retired with,

43
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:12.260
well, like you're a Marshall, I have Apollo yellow lab, English lab.

44
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:14.540
She's amazing. Never gonna bite a bad guy,

45
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:17.820
but she's gonna lick him to death and try to try to, you know, uh,

46
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:19.260
turn 'em all away. Um,

47
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.660
but I didn't even have a companion dog at the time and I would go and run into

48
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:25.410
these guys and go, okay, this is what I learned in the academy that you know,

49
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.290
that, that head on spotlighting stop that you never want to have,

50
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.690
or getting behind him, blacked out and tracking 'em down. Um,

51
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.490
and next thing I know I got AKs and I got all these freaking prohibit,

52
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.330
exotic weapons, and I'm going, this is crazy. I'm pulling these guys out alone.

53
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.970
I don't have a lot of back. It was just you. It was just me.

54
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.640
How many guys did you run into? So times would be two, one night.

55
00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:49.640
I pulled like eight people out of a van. Oh. And I was alone. Oh.

56
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.920
And they were all armed and it was one of my heaviest, most intense cases.

57
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.040
And I had been on one year, like say, if you are,

58
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.880
if you're preparing for a fight, how many days a week do you do.

59
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.830
<v 2>Strength and conditioning.</v>

60
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.440
<v 3>When I'm, I'm preparing for a fight? Uh, every day, every day,</v>

61
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.480
every day. It's not, of course it's not the same training,

62
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.120
but every day I see Valenti and uh, we train together. Yeah.

63
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.440
Every day I train more conditioning and strange, more than kickboxing.

64
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:19.910
Really? Yeah. I, I don't have a trainer in.

65
00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:24.670
Cubboxing what &lt;laugh&gt; that's right. Yeah. Really people,

66
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.630
people don't believe doesn't believe in when I say that, but I,

67
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.563
you train yourself.

68
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.423
<v 2>I train myself.</v>

69
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.430
<v 3>That's insane. I have, of course my friend in, uh, in friends who hold,</v>

70
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.190
hold meats for me, for sure. I can, I can hold meat for my, myself.

71
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.180
He all me for me. And we just talk together. We just plan, uh,

72
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.860
a game plan together for a fight. We just talk I'm my own coach. You know,

73
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.780
that is crazy.

74
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.620
<v 2>I never a coach to be at your level. Yeah. To be your own coach.</v>

75
00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:54.460
You've never had a coach. No, of.

76
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.220
<v 3>Course I have. I had a first got you. Teach you, teach me after that.</v>

77
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.210
He couldn't teach me any more because, because of his job, you know, when I,

78
00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:06.090
when I was young and then I just move from, uh,

79
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.890
to country and countries and countries to learn, to learn, to learn,

80
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.650
and then came back in France, Paris, and I just trained myself. That.

81
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.210
<v 2>Is insane. Yeah. How many world champions just train themselves?</v>

82
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.370
<v 3>I think nobody &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

83
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.240
<v 2>How do you do that? That's sounds CRA, but why didn't you get a, another coach?</v>

84
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.880
<v 3>I don't know, because I didn't find a coach who can,</v>

85
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.960
I don't know who can just teach me. I really don't know. That's a good question.

86
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.160
I don't, I don't. Why did I, what, I didn't found a new coach.

87
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.680
I don't know, because, you know, have you.

88
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.320
<v 2>Thought about making any trips to Holland or to Thailand.</v>

89
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.910
<v 3>You know, you know, BDO in France? Sure. Yeah. So I,</v>

90
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.350
I was raised there. That's where I started, uh, kickboxing.

91
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.750
I started with full contact, you know, full contact. Sure.

92
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.470
Rick rooferss was my first. I had really? Yeah. Oh wow.

93
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.630
I was watching Rick Ru roof. His brother.

94
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.710
<v 2>Duke is one of the big coaches in yeah. His.</v>

95
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.660
<v 3>Name is, um, he, his brother to duke. Duke Rufus. Yeah, yeah.</v>

96
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.740
<v 2>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a friend of mine. He's great. Oh, nice. Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.420
He's uh, outta Milwaukee. He has a Rufus.

98
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.860
<v 4>Sport. Yeah. Yeah. Buddy of mine.</v>

99
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:14.140
Who's a biologist with the forest service guy named Carl Malcolm.

100
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.940
He might have heard on our, our show. Uh, he just sent me a,

101
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.250
a paper that was about kids at huge to wildlife.

102
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.010
And it was comparing rural people's attitude and knowledge of wildlife

103
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.690
kids with urban and, and suburban attitudes about wildlife.

104
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.010
And you, you can see the input of media when you look at this thing, because

105
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.520
people who live in a urban or suburban environment,

106
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.160
when they tell you the top of mind,

107
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.400
wildlife that they know about it's non-native stuff like lions.

108
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.360
Yeah. They're likely to know, like, what's, what's an animal, right.

109
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.840
And an animal will be like, oh, it'd be like a draft. Right.

110
00:05:57.841 --> 00:06:02.000
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And, and, and people who have a more, um,

111
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.600
rural or remote viewpoint would be, are,

112
00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:10.320
are much more likely to when they think of wildlife to think of things that they

113
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.800
interact with, you know, and not like the things that are on your mobile,

114
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.790
above your crib, &lt;laugh&gt; when little baby. Right. And it sort of points. And,

115
00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:22.510
and also there, there's a slight tendency. I gotta look at this more carefully,

116
00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:25.510
but there's a slight tendency to have, uh,

117
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.510
negative feelings or think things are dangerous or bad.

118
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.790
The more urban you are in terms of native wildlife to

119
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.830
more recognize it as like a negative or bad thing.

120
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.420
&lt;affirmative&gt; and what they're pointing to is, um, again,

121
00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:43.380
I wanna look at this much more careful and pardon me to the authors of authors.

122
00:06:43.381 --> 00:06:45.740
If I'm messing this up, I was just looking at it this morning. Um,

123
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.940
what they're pointing to is the, the,

124
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.180
the stirrings of there being a, a greater acceptance of decreased biodiversity.

125
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.370
Hmm. Meaning that you're kind of like, okay,

126
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.690
with the bad things having gone and we're focused on like, what are animals?

127
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:06.330
Well, animals would be like a draft and hippotommus, and the things that,

128
00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:11.050
that Disney tells me about, and not like posums and raccoons,

129
00:07:11.051 --> 00:07:13.450
which are kind of gross. Hmm. You know?

130
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.770
<v 5>Mm. And I was like, you know, I don't like that.</v>

131
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.320
And so I wound to up kind of calling around to all the different shops in

132
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:24.280
Dallas, where it's like, okay, I've got a Ferrari 3 28.

133
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.240
I wanna make it a little faster.

134
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.000
And I had done all this stuff on my MGB back in the day.

135
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:28.960
So I know the things that,

136
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.440
that you wind up doing with intake and exhaust and cam timings and, uh,

137
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:36.640
the options there, but they were all basically horrified. Like,

138
00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:38.440
you just don't do this to a Ferrari.

139
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.190
And like the only suggestion that came out was, oh,

140
00:07:41.191 --> 00:07:43.990
we can put an Italian to be exhaust on it. And that'll, you know,

141
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.150
it'll make it sound better.

142
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.390
And maybe it's good for a couple horsepower or something.

143
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.350
Those are things that people largely do for the aesthetics, uh, you know,

144
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:54.910
whether it's oral or visual with it. Uh, and that's not a big move.

145
00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:00.340
And write about that time. John Romero at the office had, I picked up,

146
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:02.980
there was a copy of turbo magazine, uh, back in the day.

147
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.140
And there was an article about an old replica, um,

148
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.700
kind of race car done by a local company in Dallas called, uh,

149
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:14.900
Norwood Autosport or Norwood autocraft. And I thought, well, he's right here.

150
00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:16.820
I'll call him up. And so I call him up,

151
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.010
I get Bob Norwood on the phone and I start going a pitch, I've got a 3 28.

152
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.330
I'd like it to be a little faster. What do you think we can?

153
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.850
And before I could even finish, he said, we'll put a turbo on it. Like, yeah,

154
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.570
now we're talking &lt;laugh&gt;. And that was the beginning of,

155
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.330
I kind of all the science project experiments.

156
00:08:33.331 --> 00:08:37.890
Mm-hmm what does the 3 28 have standard horsepower? I think in the, the best,

157
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.890
probably the European trim, you know,

158
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:43.040
it probably around 300 horsepower and what'd you get it up to with a turbo

159
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:46.520
charger? So we went through a number of steps of this, and this is all, uh,

160
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:50.840
swapping out, uh, all the computer electronics, um, different turbos.

161
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.080
And eventually I melted the engine in it when it was at, uh,

162
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:58.240
like 500 or so. And I went through a long history of melting,

163
00:08:58.241 --> 00:09:01.600
many pistons in the different devices, in different, uh, cars,

164
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.680
but that wound up being this decade long set of interesting experiments there.

165
00:09:06.681 --> 00:09:10.240
That was my gateway drug into working on this. And we're like, okay,

166
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.120
we've made all this power in this system. Uh,

167
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.790
we know it's kind of at the limits of a lot of things in the chassis after we

168
00:09:16.791 --> 00:09:19.430
melted the engine there, we tuned it back down a little bit.

169
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.910
That's the way so many engineering things wind up going,

170
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.230
you go it until it breaks,

171
00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:25.590
then you dial it back a little bit and you stay there.

172
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.870
It must have been radically.

173
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.310
<v 2>Fast for 3 28. It's very light, right? Yes. It's a curb.</v>

174
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.310
<v 5>Weight. Uh, well, it's not super light. I think it was like 3,200 pounds. And,</v>

175
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.260
uh, yeah, it, it, you could really feel it rear back when you went into it.

176
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.220
And I, at high speed,

177
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.780
it is a little bit dartdy if you start getting up in one 50 plus miles an hour

178
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.780
of that. So we thought, well, what's the next level? Where do we go from here?

179
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.140
So I, he had done, uh, a twin turbo job on a testosa before,

180
00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:56.490
which is a much wider car. I, you know, stock, they would go, oh, 180,

181
00:09:56.491 --> 00:10:00.330
190 miles an hour, uh, with the normal Ferrari trim. And,

182
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.090
and it was a bigger five liter flat 12.

183
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.650
So there's a lot more possibility for doing things there. So I got,

184
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.770
I got a test, a rosaosa and we said, all right,

185
00:10:09.771 --> 00:10:13.570
we're gonna do the twin turbo job with inter coolers with the new, uh, you know,

186
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.370
the new engine management systems.

187
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.400
And we went through this long string of upgrades through this,

188
00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:23.040
which generally was like, okay, we melted the pistons. We, you know,

189
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:28.120
broke the input shaft all these times, but at its top form in peak, uh,

190
00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:29.360
I still have the Dino sheet for,

191
00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:31.960
it was like 1,009 horsepower at the rear wheels.

192
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.480
None of this crank horsepower talk. This was, uh, you know,

193
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.790
over a thousand horse power at the real reals. And it was amazing.

194
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.990
<v 6>Uh, I thought, and I, I wanna say this very clearly. Um,</v>

195
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.590
I thought he was wonderful at his job. You know,

196
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:51.590
if you had someone who was actually a business person, um, on that show,

197
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:56.150
it would be the worst show in the world because bill gates would make proper

198
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.020
decisions, right. And there'd be no surprises.

199
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.860
You want someone capricious and crazy with no filter. That's what you want.

200
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.300
Right. And that's what we got. So he makes arbitrary decisions that you try,

201
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:10.900
you know, the human brain tries desperately to make those make sense,

202
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.620
and that ends up being some kind of entertainment. And, um, so I actually,

203
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.610
uh, actually, uh, Donald Trump Jr said to me, you know,

204
00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:21.090
of all the people we've had on the show,

205
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.170
you seem like the only person who's ever liked my father &lt;laugh&gt;.

206
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.770
He said, you actually seem to like him. And I said, you know,

207
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:34.010
I have a fascination and a respect and a, um,

208
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.840
affection for people who are able to get out of their filters.

209
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.840
And I said, some people do that with pure genius. Like Bob dylanman,

210
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.920
some people do it with bravery, like Lenny, Bruce,

211
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:52.400
some people do it with drugs, you know, Neil young, perhaps, uh,

212
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.880
Jimmy Hendrix, perhaps. And most people do it with a mixture of stuff.

213
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.080
But I said, um, thonius monk said,

214
00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:05.040
the genius is the one who is most like himself. And I said with some sort of,

215
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.400
um, mental problems coupled with, um,

216
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.150
read and a lack of compassion,

217
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.430
your father has somehow found a way to throw off the filters.

218
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:24.030
And I will listen to tiny Tim talk on tape for hours

219
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.110
because I like that little bit of Aspergers and all that other stuff. Well, I'm,

220
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.750
I'm not, so I'm not qualified to right to, but I'm saying that'ss pot. He, yeah,

221
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:36.180
he's all sure. I can hear him talk forever. I can listen to Lenny Bruce,

222
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.640
you know,

223
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.940
Hal Wilner has those hundreds hours of him just ranting under his tape. I,

224
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.620
I think I don't like people on drugs that much, but boy, I do. And I listen to,

225
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.260
uh, uh, Lenny Bruce talk forever. And, uh,

226
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.100
Donald Trump had the dark side of that. You know,

227
00:12:53.101 --> 00:12:56.650
it was almost was like when I was hitchhiking around the country and, you know,

228
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.970
homeless and, and you'd end up at a biker place and, you know,

229
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.330
some clubhouse and some guys just holding court and ranting,

230
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.330
I've always been interested in the people who were out on the margins, you know,

231
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.810
and what, what Donald junior,

232
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.960
um, &lt;affirmative&gt; took as affection. I, I guess, was a bit of affection,

233
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.880
but it's also that if you have thrown off some filters, I'll listen to you talk.

234
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.160
And, um, so that was that it was very, very strange. And then, um,

235
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.440
I really did spend a lot of time kind of sticking up for Donald Trump saying,

236
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.830
yeah, there's inter interesting stuff there and yeah, he's, he's crazy.

237
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.510
And he's veennal and, um, he's empty, uh, you know,

238
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.750
really weird stuff that you've never seen before.

239
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:50.150
You have never seen someone who has never laughed sincerely and never made a

240
00:13:50.151 --> 00:13:51.110
joke. Never.

241
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.950
<v 2>Laugh. Sincerely.</v>

242
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:56.580
<v 6>No, he, he will laugh in a bully way. Ha you look kind a fat Joe.</v>

243
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.580
Really? Yeah.

244
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.300
<v 2>He'll do that, but he won't laugh at himself.</v>

245
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.380
<v 6>Oh, oh no. And also, but never a, even a joke even, but.</v>

246
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.780
<v 2>He says funny things on Twitter.</v>

247
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.580
Did you see the thing he did on Twitter the other day where you put a picture of

248
00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:12.140
Trump tower in Greenland and he said, ipromised not to do this. Yeah. Yeah.

249
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.740
I mean, I laughed. Mmhmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that was funny.

250
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.050
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; just giant Trump tower in the middle of Greenland.

251
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.410
<v 6>I never saw it. I mean, I saw that, but you never saw him in person.</v>

252
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.490
I never saw him in person.

253
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.810
I also never saw him show any enjoyment or understanding of music.
