1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.553
<v 1>Experience.</v>

3
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.560
So you had this plan to turn this into some sort of a series from the time you

4
00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:07.440
released the very first.

5
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.720
<v 0>Book yeah. From before that. And so what's crazy is that as I'm writing this,</v>

6
00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:10.921
now,

7
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.200
they tell you not to think of someone playing your character as you're writing,

8
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.640
but as a child of the eighties,

9
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.840
that's almost impossible not to do so as I'm writing, the crazy part is like,

10
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:19.880
usually you think of like, mark,

11
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:22.950
Walberg you think of somebody that had done these sort of things kind of before,

12
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.430
but I thought of Chris Pratt and he had just done, you know,

13
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:30.470
all he'd done is parks and rec and he'd done, uh, he had a small role in zero,

14
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:33.670
dark 30, where he plays the seal. He has like a couple lines in there.

15
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.590
And for some reason I'm like, that's the guy really? I had no connection to him.

16
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.500
Um, and no, it wouldn't have been the obvious choice back is 20.

17
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.140
So I start writing in December of 2014, I think, or early 2015, somewhere there.

18
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:47.060
So, so he wasn't.

19
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.860
<v 1>His giant movies.</v>

20
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.220
<v 0>Star then either. Nope, hadn't done any of that, that stuff yet. And I thought,</v>

21
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:53.740
you know what? This is a likable guy. Uh, and he seems like an awesome dude.

22
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.620
I'm getting a good feeling from him. And I thought, you know,

23
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.340
growing up in the eighties, I love Magnum. Uh, you know,

24
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:01.890
he started off as a Naval intelligence officer and then they found out about

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.610
seals, the writers, they turned him into a seal, a couple seasons into it.

26
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.210
I'm like everybody loved Magnum in the eighties. Women liked him.

27
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:09.650
The guys liked him, you know, nothing not to like about Magnum.

28
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.450
And he also does the first,

29
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:17.450
essentially what you would call a murder on national television with the other

30
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:21.170
person, not having a firearm or a weapon. And it's the end of, uh,

31
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:24.000
I think it season see he is in three. Um, but the guy,

32
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.840
a guy that had him as a pow in Vietnam comes to Hawaii.

33
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.400
There's a little conspiracy thing involved.

34
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.280
And at the end he thinks he's walking away and then Magnum asks him if he's seen

35
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:35.360
the sun rise that morning, cuz that morning when his friend,

36
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.920
his friend gets killed, there's a sun. And the guy turns around. He's like, yes,

37
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.000
why? And the Magnum turns around and boom.

38
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.590
And they stop it right there with his fireball coming outta the end of his 1911.

39
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.590
And they freeze it right there. And it was the first time on, uh,

40
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.750
on television in that prime time hour where someone had killed somebody else,

41
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.030
the hero had killed someone else who wasn't armed. I forgotten about.

42
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.190
<v 1>That, but I'm remembering it now. Very cool. That was very controversial.</v>

43
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.150
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. And it's it's so I thought that's who I need.</v>

44
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.620
I need somebody who's likable guy. Uh, who's gonna invest in this. And I,

45
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.500
I heard he was like pro-military and that sort of thing. And, and uh, Chris,

46
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.620
PRTs the guy and that's all, that's all I thought I gave to it.

47
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.860
He couldn't have picked a better guy, so awesome. And yeah,

48
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.260
who knew what he was gonna turn into at jurasic park and all he hadn't been

49
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:20.980
passengers. He hadn't done anything serious yet, but I also thought about,

50
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.980
cause I've been studying this since up my whole life.

51
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.970
And I thought about in the eighties, look what Tom Hanks did in the eighties.

52
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:30.770
You know, he's in boo and buddies, he's in, uh, Dragnet, he's in the burbs,

53
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:32.090
he's in Joe versus the volcano.

54
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.330
And then he does something called Philadelphia in the early nineties and he

55
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:39.730
takes out risk. And since then he's be able to write his own ticket.

56
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:42.570
He's one of the greatest actors of his generation. Uh,

57
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.400
and I thought who's that in this generation that needs to stretch a little bit,

58
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.360
that needs to do something different. Uh, and I'm like, that's,

59
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:50.880
that's Chris Pratt. He can do this.

60
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.400
And so I thought of it and then even crazier before the first book came out,

61
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.040
I met thunder ranch training, doing some shooting stuff up there in Oregon.

62
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.440
And I get this call from, uh, a guy that I knew in the seal teams.

63
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.760
And he's like, Hey bro, do you remember me? And you know him, you know Jared.

64
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.640
And, uh, he, uh, he was out there in Utah with us and he's like, Hey bro,

65
00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:12.480
you remember me? I'm like, yeah, of course. I remember you. How's it going?

66
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.880
I didn't talk to him in five years or something.

67
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.680
And we catch up a little bit and he's like, Hey, you know,

68
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:20.550
I was wanted to thank you for a couple. I was leaving the seal teams.

69
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.230
I don't know if you remember, but you had me into your office. You sat me down,

70
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.310
you talked about transition.

71
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.350
You introduced me some people in the private sector and I've never forgotten it.

72
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.910
I was like, oh wow, Hey, of course, I'm gonna do that for you, cuz I mean,

73
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:33.310
he's an awesome dude, total stud great operator and wants to get outta the team.

74
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:36.790
So I'm gonna try to help him as best I can. Uh, but he really remembered it.

75
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.950
And he said, Hey, I heard you wrote a book. And I said, yeah, it's come,

76
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.940
went out in a couple months here.

77
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.900
There are these galley copy things which are early copies of a novel.

78
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.380
I can send one to you. I'd love to send it. And he said, yeah, I'd,

79
00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:48.300
that'd be great. But I'd like to give one to a friend of mine. And I said, yeah,

80
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:53.020
no problem. Who's that? He said Chris Pratt. I was like, no way. Wow.

81
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.780
Yeah. So he gives it to Chris, Chris reads it and uh, next thing you know,

82
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.460
he's optioned it before it even, uh, comes out. I,

83
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.690
are you a guy who believes in fate, do you believe in destiny?

84
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.130
So when I was in Ramma in 2005, 2006,

85
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.570
that's where I got to think about this a little bit because every time you left

86
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:10.404
the wire,

87
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.210
anything could have been an I E D and you could have either spent that time on

88
00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:17.530
the way to target and coming back from target, worried about, oh, is that,

89
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.890
is that dead donkey on the side? Is that, is that gonna blow,

90
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.360
kill and kill me or kill that hit that, uh, Hume in front of me, uh,

91
00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:27.040
that piece of trash right there is that covering something else. Is that a,

92
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.840
is there a wire there you could spend every single mission,

93
00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:33.680
especially going to and from target and even on target, worried about that,

94
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.920
or you could focus on the mission, focus on the job, get there, do the job,

95
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.990
get back. And at that time I was like, you, you know,

96
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.270
I think I have to resign myself to fate here in a lot of these things.

97
00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:48.310
Otherwise my mind is gonna be focused, not where it needs to be,

98
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.950
but on is that naive D is that naive D and so I thought, all right, you know,

99
00:04:51.951 --> 00:04:55.430
what, if, if I get blown up today, that's just, that's just how it was,

100
00:04:55.431 --> 00:04:58.110
you know, do everything. We're everything we possibly can to mitigate that. But,

101
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.711
uh, you know,

102
00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:03.020
it could happen and I'm not gonna spend or amount of bandwidth worried about

103
00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:05.420
that other than trying to mitigate it as best we possibly can,

104
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.820
but that's not gonna be the focus of my E everything that I'm thinking about.

105
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.540
It can't be, I need to be focused on this mission.

106
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.940
I need to focus on contingencies. Uh, there's a fire fight.

107
00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:14.980
I need to figure out, uh,

108
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.780
what assets are available that come in here for QRF or whatever else,

109
00:05:17.781 --> 00:05:20.700
what air we have overhead, how do we, how do we, uh, maneuver here,

110
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.570
all those things. Like, that's what I need to worry about. What's as a leader,

111
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.610
a quick reaction force.

112
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.290
So you have those set up at different places in case you get hit.

113
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.930
So they can come on in, usually in like Bradley's or, uh, Abrams, sometimes, uh,

114
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.730
uh, different vehicles that have a little more firepower than you do as you're

115
00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:37.010
sneaking through the streets. So,

116
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.770
so I kind of resign myself to fate and there's a book called, um, uh, bridge,

117
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.200
uh, at San Lu Ray. And there's like, I forget how many people,

118
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:50.480
but let's say five or six people that are on this bridge and it collapses.

119
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.200
And the story is how each one of them got to be on that bridge.

120
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.480
Why were those six people, the ones that were on that bridge, uh,

121
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.720
at that time and it's fate. So, so I guess,

122
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.160
and I haven't really thought of it too much since then. Uh,

123
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:07.240
other than that experience in Iraq and just having to,

124
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.360
or feeling like I had resign myself to it. Um.

125
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.600
<v 1>The Chris Pratt thing is eerie though. It's crazy. It's a little eerie. I mean,</v>

126
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.790
wonderfully eerie, no eerie made, be the worst word for it. &lt;laugh&gt; cause, uh,

127
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.710
pretty amazing. I feel very fortunate.

128
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.550
<v 0>Yeah. And, uh, yeah, it's one of those things that.</v>

129
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.550
<v 1>You kind of maybe made that happen.</v>

130
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.830
Like maybe you kind of put that out there as you were writing it,

131
00:06:28.831 --> 00:06:31.430
thinking about him, maybe. I mean, I don't know.

132
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.710
I say that and I say shut up hippie &lt;laugh&gt; like, but he's like, oh,

133
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:38.860
what do you got a crystal up your too? You know, it's like.

134
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.580
<v 0>That. I hadn't, uh, if I hadn't, if I was like not, I don't know. I mean, I was,</v>

135
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:46.340
you know, whatever an average seal or whatever, but if I, uh, you know,

136
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.860
hadn't taken the time to sit down with Jared and like maybe Chris doesn't even

137
00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:52.740
know this exists today. Right. Uh, and other crazy part of this,

138
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.940
I thought of Anton F would directing it really he's directing it. Yeah.

139
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.610
<v 1>Why, why him? Because I, I love shooter.</v>

140
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.050
<v 0>Training day. He did training day, got to Oscar for, uh, for training day,</v>

141
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.850
loved that, uh, magnificent seven. I knew he'd worked with Chris on,

142
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.210
on magnificent seven. Mm. Um, I actually did know someone who knew him. Um, but,

143
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.170
uh, so I, so I did have that connection through someone, someone else. Um,

144
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.331
but I loved shooter,

145
00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:19.000
which is based on the book point of impact by Stephen Hunter with Walberg, uh,

146
00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:21.680
love that movie, cuz I, I love the book so much. Um,

147
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.440
they made it more modern for today's time, but it's a Vietnam. Sniper is, uh,

148
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.880
Boby swagger is who it originally is. But uh, I just thought, he's the guy,

149
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.880
he's the guy to direct this thing and now they're both doing it. Wow.

150
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.680
<v 1>Which is crazy. That is crazy. Crazy. Yeah. That's so weird, man,</v>

151
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:40.750
that you had those two people in your head, like that's what makes me think.

152
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.590
I don't, I don't not believe that it's possible to manifest something,

153
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.430
but I think most of the people that talk about that stuff are full of. Yeah.

154
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.430
That's where it's a problem. Like most of the people that talk about that stuff,

155
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:54.830
they're trying to sell you something that, well, you know,

156
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.110
you can make your life happen and you just need a dream board and write all

157
00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:00.580
those things down. There's a lot of that stuff is horses,

158
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.420
because you gotta do the work. Right. That's it.

159
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.500
But part of me thinks that if you do do the work and you do have that focus and

160
00:08:08.501 --> 00:08:09.334
that intensity,

161
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.540
I feel like there might be some sort of frequency that you can tap in where you

162
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:19.340
make things more likely to happen or possibly you can make things happen.

163
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.690
But the thing is, you know,

164
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:23.770
like you only hear those stories from the people that are successful.

165
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.690
Like how many people, like I wrote a book,

166
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.370
I had Chris Pratt in my head and I ran him and I said, Chris, yeah.

167
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.450
And he's like, get the away from me. No.

168
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.410
<v 0>It's, it's totally crazy. How all that, uh,</v>

169
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.210
how all that stuff kind of comes to comes.

170
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.210
<v 1>Together. You couldn't have picked it better than guy than CRA.</v>

171
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:42.240
He is such a good guy. He's such a great guy. He's almost weird. Weirdly. Nice.

172
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.960
Yeah. No.

173
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.720
<v 0>He's so nice. He gets just different for around here. Maybe. I don't.</v>

174
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.280
<v 1>Know. Well, it's, he's very different in terms of like Hollywood actors.</v>

175
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.280
Like there's a few like him, like, you know, it's like,

176
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.200
people love to say that actors are full of and they're gross and they're,

177
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.400
self-centered narcissist and yeah, it's true.

178
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.600
A lot of the time &lt;laugh&gt; is it really? But it's not true all the time. Yeah.

179
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.320
And Chris is a great example of a guy who's like, he's a very religious guy.

180
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.280
Very, pro-military very, he's a really positive guy. Very, very,

181
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.080
very friendly guy. He's not your typical actor.

182
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.160
<v 0>Yeah. No, he's, he's been so great to me also.</v>

183
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.070
<v 1>A huge movie star. So it's weird. It's like, he's not that, you know,</v>

184
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.310
guy who does Coke and goes to parties and he's a different, different animal.

185
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.230
Yeah. He's they do exist.

186
00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.030
Male and female there's there are actresses that are great people. They just,

187
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.190
they just really genuinely enjoy acting. But for the most part,

188
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:34.950
the people that get into it are people that need a disproportion,

189
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.740
an amount of attention. Yeah. And for the most part,

190
00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:38.820
the people that need a disproportionate amount of attention are

191
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:40.980
disproportionately annoying &lt;laugh&gt; you.

192
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.720
<v 0>Know? Yeah.</v>

193
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.100
And usually they like to get rid of the author right away when you auction

194
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:45.980
something, cuz they're like, I wanna get rid of that guy,

195
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.740
cuz he's gonna be on set and he's gonna be like, that's not my vision.

196
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:50.980
You're ruining my book or whatever. So they'd like to get rid of you,

197
00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:54.100
but Chris wanted be involved. So I got to help out on the, uh,

198
00:09:54.101 --> 00:09:56.250
on the pilot script. That's that's awesome.

199
00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.010
<v 1>And it is so good. Now is this a Netflix thing? Is that what you're doing? It's.</v>

200
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.010
<v 0>Uh, it's still classified. I think they're doing some,</v>

201
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.450
some announcement at some point, but it's uh, yeah. Streaming service and oh,

202
00:10:05.451 --> 00:10:05.770
that's right.

203
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.690
<v 1>Okay. I know what it is. I forgot. Yeah. So.</v>

204
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.690
<v 0>It's uh, eight to 10 fart series. Maybe something like that. Eight to 10 parts.</v>

205
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.770
So I think they'll know exactly that's.

206
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.400
<v 1>Per yeah. Cause if they tried to jam that you, I don't think it work, go tried.</v>

207
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:20.400
Do a movie. Well you don't have to anymore. Yeah. It's great. People like.

208
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.400
<v 0>Show and now he looks genius, right? Yes. Especially now &lt;laugh&gt; yes.</v>

209
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.960
So it looks like such.

210
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.120
<v 1>A good move. Another crazy fate thing is because when you were doing that, like,</v>

211
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.120
Ooh, when you were writing that in 2016, the, the streaming thing,

212
00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:34.720
wasn't what it is today. Right? And.

213
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.950
<v 0>Well, even when we did the deal, it was like, oh movie, it was kinda like that,</v>

214
00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.230
that it was early 20, 20 18. Uh,

215
00:10:41.231 --> 00:10:45.150
when we did the deal and it's like, well you a series or movie. So it's both,

216
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.110
it could be both in the, in the contract and now,

217
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.710
and then they decided to do the series, you know, earlier on,

218
00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:54.830
before COVID even was on the radar. But now it looks like, yeah, genius move.
