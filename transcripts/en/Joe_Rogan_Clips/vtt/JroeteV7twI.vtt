00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So, uh, over the weekend I got into your book.</v>

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.163
Woo.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.520
<v 1>Yes. Yes.</v>

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.360
<v 0>It's great. Thank you. I mean, I really appreciate someone like you,</v>

5
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:17.040
who's trying to break down quantum mechanics and quantum physics for someone

6
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:17.580
like me,

7
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.560
it's very hard to follow and there was a lot of backing up and trying it again

8
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:26.250
and backing up and trying it again and like going over paragraphs and trying to

9
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:30.180
figure out exactly what it means. But, uh, it's,

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.110
it's really excellent and really perplexing at the same time.

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.280
<v 1>Well, thank you. And you know,</v>

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.230
there are different styles when it comes to writing popular books.

13
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.620
I think there should be different styles. And my particular style is, look,

14
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:47.280
it's not going to be a breezy page Turner. Uh,

15
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.670
but if you read it carefully, like there's not prerequisites,

16
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:53.430
you don't have to come into it as an expert. What do you have to come into?

17
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:57.600
It is someone who's willing to sit and think about every paragraph and then

18
00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:00.600
hopefully it will be rewarding and you'll truly understand what's going on after

19
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:01.230
doing that.

20
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.080
<v 0>Well, it is rewarding because it is fascinating.</v>

21
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.980
And the history of quantum physics is also pretty fascinating because I've

22
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:08.814
always wondered,

23
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.110
like how did anybody even want to come up with this stuff like this?

24
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.840
And the fact that it was so long ago,

25
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:18.480
it was what the beginnings of it were in the 19th century.

26
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.600
<v 1>Well, 1900 is the typical, literally that year,</v>

27
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:25.440
the turn of the century when Alex plunk first, uh, got the first hints of it.

28
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:28.800
And then yeah, it was took another 27 years to put it into final shape.

29
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.080
<v 0>Now for regular people that don't have a background of</v>

30
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:35.190
physics or that don't,

31
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.320
this is like the whole idea behind it is so bizarre. It's like,

32
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.300
why would anybody try to figure out something

33
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:50.130
that one of the things that you said that's really interesting is that you,

34
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.120
quantum physics is used all the time.

35
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.330
It's used with exact calculations,

36
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.290
but yet we don't really understand it.

37
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.260
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, no, that's the main message of the book really,</v>

38
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:08.400
because physicists of course do quantum mechanics every day, whether it's,

39
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:11.040
you know, straightforward quantum mechanics, quantum field theory,

40
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:13.980
quantum information, quantum computing, clearly, we're pretty good at it.

41
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.490
You know, like transistors and lasers depend on quantum mechanics,

42
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.650
the sun shining, figuring that out,

43
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:22.200
depends on quantum mechanics that Higgs bows on, et cetera.

44
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.190
So to claim that we don't understand, quantum mechanics is a little bit weird,

45
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:29.430
but then we have quotes from people like Richard Fineman saying nobody

46
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:32.340
understands quantum mechanics, right? And so if he says that,

47
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.840
then there's some authority behind it.

48
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.150
And the reason is what we have is sort of a black box, right?

49
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.470
We say, you know what?

50
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:44.490
I think what I said in a New York times article I wrote recently is physicists

51
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:48.030
understand quantum mechanics in the same way that someone who owns a smartphone

52
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:50.970
understands the smartphone. Like they know how to use the apps.

53
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.120
They can call people, they can make phone calls, they can take pictures.

54
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.460
They don't know what's going on inside.

55
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.420
And that's physicists with quantum mechanics. They use it. They can make very,

56
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:05.290
very precise predictions. But if you ask them what is really going on,

57
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:08.140
like what is actually happening? What are all the details they're like, yeah,

58
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.970
no, that's not our job. Let's just stick to prediction.

59
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.020
<v 0>So someone like me, that's so terrifying because like the,</v>

60
00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:17.260
the very nature of reality is being examined by people.

61
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.220
Like if, if it is us of smartphone,

62
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.350
it's being examined by people like me who don't really understand the

63
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.460
smartphone. I have no idea what what's going on inside a smartphone. I've know.

64
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.810
I know some words that you use to describe Ram and

65
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.913
process.

66
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.610
<v 1>Trans moving around in there. Right. But, uh, yeah. And I think,</v>

67
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.010
and in some sense that's fine.

68
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:46.420
Like most of us don't need to know what's going on inside the smartphone to use

69
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:48.970
it, but somebody should know. Right.

70
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.480
And my argument in the book is look the,

71
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.820
if 500 years from now,

72
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:57.430
when historians write the history of 20th century physics,

73
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:01.210
they will say two things. Uh, one is my God.

74
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:05.200
These people were so brilliant and creative to invent quantum mechanics.

75
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.150
And then they were so afraid to really take it

76
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.250
seriously and try to understand it. Like they said,

77
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.940
like stop asking questions about the meaning of reality and what the world is

78
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:18.420
doing in my mind,

79
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.030
what physics is all about is understanding reality and what the world is doing.

80
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:25.060
It's not just about making predictions, making predictions is good,

81
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.700
but we do that. Uh, you know,

82
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.920
mostly because we're curious about what the world is doing.

83
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.130
<v 0>Well for people outside the world of academia.</v>

84
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:37.720
When I read someone like you saying that you were discouraged

85
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.240
from pursuing this,

86
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.280
and you literally told that you should be pursuing your

87
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:49.570
work in cosmology and gravitation is that's where it's at. That's serious work.

88
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:52.840
Yeah. That, that seems to me is be so crazy. It's like,

89
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.770
if anybody should be pursuing it, it should be people like.

90
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.990
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I want to be fair.</v>

91
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:02.740
So of course 20th century physics was incredibly successful and,

92
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.500
and there was part of the attitude was, look,

93
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:09.520
we have to understand nuclear physics and particle physics. And you know,

94
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:13.630
a lot of it was the center of physics shifted from Europe to the U S and Europe

95
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:15.730
is much more philosophical.

96
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:18.790
And you're willing to think about the deep ideas and Americans are pretty

97
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:21.730
pragmatic and want to build things right. In particular,

98
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:24.070
at the time they wanted to build nuclear weapons.

99
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.690
And so the idea of just really putting aside deep philosophical issues and

100
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:32.950
putting stuff to work was attractive. And, and the other issue is, you know,

101
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:36.400
okay, let's say we do demand that we understand quantum mechanics better.

102
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.990
How do you do it? Like,

103
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.710
what experiment is it there that you can do is as far as we know the cookbook

104
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:44.950
that we have, even though we don't understand, it works pretty well. Like what,

105
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.340
what could you type into your smartphone that would help you understand what's

106
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:50.380
going on inside? It's kind of hard to figure out.

107
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:53.350
So I think those attitudes were wrong, but at least, you know,

108
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:55.960
they're not completely crazy. It's not just that they, uh,

109
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.860
were afraid of the truth or anything like that.

110
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.580
And I also think that it is finally changing now. I think that there's slowly,

111
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:01.971
slowly,

112
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.420
slowly more people are appreciating the understanding quantum mechanics is

113
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:06.340
important. What.

114
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.370
<v 0>Do you attribute that to?</v>

115
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.340
<v 1>Um, a couple of things. One is, I mean, there's good news and bad news.</v>

116
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.440
That part of the good news is technology has gotten better.

117
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:20.240
So we're trying to build quantum computers, for example, and guess what,

118
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.481
you know,

119
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:25.100
some of the ad hoc rules that we had for doing quantum mechanics might not be up

120
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:29.060
to the task. We need to understand the details a little bit better. Um,

121
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.920
the other sad thing is that so much of fundamental physics is kind of

122
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:36.110
stuck right now, right? We haven't,

123
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.450
we literally have not been surprised by a new experimental result in

124
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:45.350
fundamental physics since the 1970s. Uh,

125
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.760
the one there's one exception to that,

126
00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:51.200
which is the universe accelerating in 1998, which was the dark energy. Um,

127
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.880
we've had amazing accomplishments in experimental and observational

128
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.580
physics. We've found the expos on. We found the top quark.

129
00:06:58.581 --> 00:07:02.840
We found gravitational waves, the microwave background, many, many things,

130
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.390
but they were all predicted decades ago. Right?

131
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.140
So progress is driven by being surprised.

132
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:10.850
And it's been a long time since we've been surprised.

133
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:12.830
So some people including myself say, well,

134
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.120
one of the things to do in that situation is to take a step back and reexamined

135
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:18.440
the foundations. Maybe,

136
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.220
maybe we can take a broader look and think that we were walking down the wrong

137
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:23.054
path.

138
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.840
<v 0>Now for people that don't have any background in physics,</v>

139
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.490
there there's a bit of an issue with the public perception.

140
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.310
And one of the things about public perception is films.

141
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:35.510
Like what the bleep yeah.

142
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.700
That sort of throw this sort of cultish monkey wrench into the,

143
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.870
you know,

144
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.730
w quantum physics is weird enough as it is without adding,

145
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.350
let that movie was literally created by a channeler, right?

146
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.860
<v 1>Uh, David Albert, who is one of the leading philosophers of physics.</v>

147
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:57.500
And I should also give credit to philosophers here because they haven't taken

148
00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:01.550
quantum mechanics seriously longer than the physicists have to be honest. Um,

149
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.970
so David is one of many people who got a PhD in physics and then switched to

150
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:08.270
philosophy because he cared about the foundations of quantum mechanics and no

151
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:11.330
physics department would ever hire him. Right. It's hilarious. And, uh, yeah.

152
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:14.000
I tell the story went through the back door. Yeah. I tell the story in the book,

153
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:17.540
like he wrote a bunch of influential papers as a graduate student,

154
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:21.380
and then he went and said, uh, I would like to, you know, make these papers,

155
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:24.380
my PhD thesis. And they said, no, that's not really serious physics.

156
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:28.820
And they punished him by making him write this incredibly technical mathematical

157
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:32.150
paper on quantum field theory, just to prove he could do it.

158
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.040
And then he's like this, I, I don't want to take this anymore.

159
00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:37.070
I'm switching fields. But anyway, he was in that film,

160
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:41.090
he was in what the bleep and they lied to him.

161
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.950
They misrepresented themselves. They said,

162
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:44.870
we're doing a documentary about quantum mechanics.

163
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:49.190
And they sat him down for three hours and asked him all these questions.

164
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:50.300
You're leading questions. Like,

165
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:53.780
doesn't this mean that we're bringing reality into existence by looking at it?

166
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:57.210
And he's like, no, not what it means. Let me explain to you.

167
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.920
But then in the final film, there's like 32nd clips of him going, yes,

168
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.990
that is a really important question. Right.

169
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.450
But like completely misrepresenting what he said.

170
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:10.860
And so he went public after that and, uh, and complained about,

171
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.210
and about the film. And he did in a hilarious story.

172
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.000
There was a, uh, event,

173
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:22.920
some sort of convention put on in Santa Monica by supporters of the film

174
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.620
that they thought it would be fun to get all of the people who were in the

175
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:28.800
movie, what the bleep do we know and get them, you know,

176
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.930
and talk to them and charge people money to listen to them.

177
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.840
But these people were not affiliated with the filmmakers.

178
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.530
So they didn't know the David Albert had been completely misrepresented in the

179
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:37.750
film.

180
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:42.660
So they invited him and he goes to this event in Santa Monica and he gave a

181
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:44.610
talk. You know, he, he decided, you know, he wondered like,

182
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:48.210
should I just go at all, but okay, why not? Let's reach a different audience.

183
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:49.860
And he, he gave a talk and he said, look,

184
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.570
there's two things you can do when you are faced with fundamental puzzles of

185
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:59.520
reality. One is you can face up to what the world is trying to tell you,

186
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:03.090
and you can accept it and take it as what it is. No matter what you like.

187
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:08.070
The other is, you can choose to tell a flattering story about yourself.

188
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.270
And the people who made this movie have decided that the mysteries of quantum

189
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:16.320
mechanics are really stories about how they are powerful and have influence over

190
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:18.630
reality and so forth. But it's all nonsense.

191
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.080
And the punchline is the audience loved it.

192
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.070
They went nuts because what they wanted was a guru of some sort. And like,

193
00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:29.340
he was just as good as good as anybody else. So, you know,

194
00:10:29.341 --> 00:10:33.180
he had a better story to tell reality-based guilty guru. Yeah. Yeah.

195
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.110
So I think you're right. I mean,

196
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:36.510
I think that quantum mechanics I've said before is, um,

197
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.330
of all the theories in the history of science,

198
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.680
the most easily distorted and misrepresented in the popular mind.
