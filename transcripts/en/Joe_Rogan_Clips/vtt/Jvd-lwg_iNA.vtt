00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Isn't it history. Great though.</v>

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.520
Like to have all this stuff and go through all the different theories and well

3
00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:07.641
what's,

4
00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:11.080
what's crazy with history is now we can see it before people just told it.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.680
It wasn't until like the 20th century that really people saw it. Yeah.

6
00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.000
Before that it was just people telling stories about stuff.

7
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.080
<v 1>Who knows what's real. Yeah. Like from the 17 hundreds.</v>

8
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.630
<v 0>And the you to piece it together from multiple accounts, but it's really hard.</v>

9
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.070
That' that's the Bible, isn't it? Oh, the Bible's even worse. The Bible's,

10
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.590
I mean, it's a bunch of stories of,

11
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.630
it's not just that a bunch of stories translated.

12
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.430
That's what I' I'm saying from, so from the bunch of shitload of people.

13
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.470
<v 1>For sure it got translated and all that with the Bible, but for sure, I I'm a,</v>

14
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.350
in my heart I'm a hundred. I,

15
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.580
I believe that a hundred percent that there is some stuff in the Bible.

16
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.780
That's the real. There is the, it comes from the real.

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.980
It got distorted and translated and all that's. What do you mean by the real?

18
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020
Like a, like, it's a manual on how to live your life, right?

19
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:55.780
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. You know what I mean? If you, these are rules,

20
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.180
like maybe God is the idea. Maybe God is the,

21
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.810
and Jesus is the frequency you wanna get in that frequency of life.

22
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.650
Don't deceive anybody don't kill, kill each other, each other up.

23
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.130
Then youll be in that zone. Don' that's what God is. Like. Maybe the book is a,

24
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.050
a manual it's gotta be, because there's one thing, like I said,

25
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.210
I'm balls deep and, and, uh, try to find the truth. Sometimes I'm wrong,

26
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.730
whatever truth. But a lot of guys, a lot of guys, uh,

27
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.520
three different guys that I looked up to and looked and asked for information,

28
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:29.400
cuz they were so into a certain area that I wasn't into. I'm like, tell me more,

29
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:33.520
tell me more. And they are like, my mentors at the end did all of 'em.

30
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.320
They're starting to look into the Bible.

31
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.560
And I remember the first guy back in like 2005 when I was like full blown,

32
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:42.830
like the, you know, against religion and all that. Um, I would say, dude,

33
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:45.110
what are you doing, dude? You showed me the wagon.

34
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.030
And now you're looking in the Bible that goes, I know it sounds crazy,

35
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.750
but you gotta, you gotta, you gotta look into it too.

36
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:54.230
There's this isn't just a book with crazy fairy tales. This is some real.

37
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.950
<v 0>What it is. And I was a historical account of the times.</v>

38
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.550
So the people that lived back then as best they could tell it translated down

39
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:05.260
over thousands of years, the still there's some absolute truths in the Bible.

40
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:07.660
Yeah. And there's some great guides to live your life,

41
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.860
but there's also some nonsense for sure. Walking on water, all that stuff.

42
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.480
Not just that.

43
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.460
<v 1>You maybe ignore the nonsense.</v>

44
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.820
<v 0>God sicked, uh,</v>

45
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.860
two bears on these kids that were making fun of those dude for being.

46
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.940
<v 1>Bald, that the Jack and Jill stories. For sure. For sure. Definit.</v>

47
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.180
<v 0>For sure. If that's in there,</v>

48
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.210
you have to wonder how much of any of the original men, me, uh, stories.

49
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.610
Well, if.

50
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.010
<v 1>You look at the mainstream history of like Catholicism,</v>

51
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.850
I grew up Catholic who didteriorat right? Yeah. Catholic Christian, Christian.

52
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.370
Well, um, the branch, the mainstream story, you know the.

53
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.370
<v 0>Name of branch Lutheran. Uh, is that a branch? No, what's what's the,</v>

54
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:44.920
what's the normal one. Protestant Baptist Protestant. Uh you'.

55
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.000
<v 1>Are not, not the Baptist. I'm.</v>

56
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.600
<v 0>Not the i'mitarian no, I'm, I'm a dentist.</v>

57
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.760
<v 1>You're agnostic, right? You're not sure. Deist.</v>

58
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.840
<v 0>What if I believe there's a God, but I don't believe in like Jesus or okay.</v>

59
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.200
You think when you think about there's a God, like what,

60
00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:59.000
what's the thought that comes through your head? Like what do you,

61
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.400
you thinking when you, when you say, I think there's a God.

62
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.120
<v 2>I think there there's a higher being, do you know a thing? I don't know. I,</v>

63
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.360
I don't know. I think, I think that's, I think there's,

64
00:03:08.361 --> 00:03:12.040
there's the energy in our body goes somewhere. There's something that makes us,

65
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.360
you know, like I can, I can feel certain things like love or intuition,

66
00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:18.080
stuff like that. That, that has to be something, you know,

67
00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:19.830
Mmhmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I think that goes somewhere.

68
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.310
I don't think there's a heaven in hell. Jordan Peterson.

69
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.390
<v 0>Has some really good advice on that.</v>

70
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.030
He said whether or not you believe in a God,

71
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.990
he goes live as if God is real and this real benefits.

72
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.110
I believe that. I think it, it really,

73
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.270
if you really do have that kind of gratitude and humility that you're,

74
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:39.580
you're being watched over by a loving God. Yeah.

75
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.020
I don't think there's a benefit to thinking.

76
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.740
<v 1>Like that. That it's just about doing the right thing. Yep.</v>

77
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.620
It's all about how do we get the people to do the right thing?

78
00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:49.980
And I believe there's a God because, um, a couple things, you know, when,

79
00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:54.060
when I, I did DMT, uh, I went into, I thought, okay, there's more,

80
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.540
there's way more to this reality, this dimension that, um,

81
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.050
that's out there seeing all the time for sure. And then the more, um,

82
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.290
the more I get into, uh, you know, trying to find out what we're on and what,

83
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.930
what this is all about. And then you look at the mainstream.

84
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.010
I think someone created what we're in, whatever you wanna,

85
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.210
whatever you think this is thinks of simulation.

86
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.530
I think this is something I don't, I don't believe in simulationion either.

87
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.730
Why don'tt you believe in simulation?

88
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.410
<v 0>There's.</v>

89
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.280
<v 2>Just me out. When you think about your kids and that bugs me.</v>

90
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.040
<v 1>Out. There's no evidence Mm-m but um, uh, but it could be true. It could be,</v>

91
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:27.120
but there there's, but.

92
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.440
<v 0>You know, serial evidence, really smart people. Don't just say I don't go.</v>

93
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:33.600
Byonsensus not only is there not only is there evidence,

94
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.840
but if you look at probability theory, what was that guy's name? Um, the was,

95
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.070
uh, the, the, the guy Nick Bolstrom. We talked about it in depth.

96
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.350
And he said, according to probability theory, it's more likely that we're in a,

97
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.830
in a simulation. Maybe, maybe,

98
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:50.310
maybe that's true because the fact that simulat simulat's, but that's, I,

99
00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:52.350
you measure't believe I' almost inevitable if,

100
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:54.150
unless we get disrupted by nature,

101
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.910
unless we get hit with an asteroid or start a nuclear war, it's inevitable.

102
00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:00.670
The technology reaches a point where simulation's possible. Well, if you.

103
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.660
<v 2>Watch Rick and Mor, that's.</v>

104
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.780
<v 1>What it is. Well, if, if simulation is real,</v>

105
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.340
then the simulation goes on forever in the space that everyone thinks there.

106
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.380
<v 0>Is, it could be a part, an evilinfinite of life.</v>

107
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.460
<v 1>Computer. It's.</v>

108
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.180
<v 0>Not that, no, it's not that simple. It's like,</v>

109
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.020
like it could be one of the facets of life.

110
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:21.340
Like we could be creating a simulation just through culture and society.

111
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.610
And that simulation is literally how we enter into another dimension.

112
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:27.770
We're looking at it like it's some nonsense thing. Yeah. Like it's a simulation.

113
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.930
Oh, it's just a SIM. It could literally be how dimensions are created.

114
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.410
They're created by creativity and ingenuity and, and,

115
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.130
and innovation over long periods of time with millions of people working in

116
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:40.490
conjunction, different people,

117
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.960
figuring out processing power hour and coding and all these different things.

118
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:47.120
And next thing you know, you've got these there's there's these, uh,

119
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.400
virtual reality places. Like we have an Oculus out there that you could put on.

120
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.320
Yeah. And you could do all these games. It's really fun.

121
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.880
But there's some virtual reality places.

122
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.480
Now that you go into a warehouse and you go through this whole thing, you know,

123
00:05:57.481 --> 00:06:00.160
there's a, there's a place that's in Disneyland and there's a,

124
00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:03.720
another place down the street called sandbox. And you play games. Oh, there's.

125
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.280
<v 2>A, there's an arcade. There's VR arcade at the Westfield mall on.</v>

126
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.120
<v 0>A Riverside. That's called. Uh, but there's one right here, parallel universe.</v>

127
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.640
<v 2>But don't you think if we're in a simulationion's you believe we're in a</v>

128
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:17.070
simulation. If I was right in the head,

129
00:06:17.071 --> 00:06:18.830
it be ways for me to commit suicide.

130
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:20.590
If I just thinking this is a whole simulation.

131
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.990
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, you, it get dark. There's a lot of variables.</v>

132
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:26.270
There's a lot of variables about why should I just do whatever I want?

133
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:27.670
There's just a simulation. It' a simulation.

134
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.503
<v 2>It doesn't count. Doesn't.</v>

135
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.190
<v 0>I don't think it's that simple. I think all the rules apply. I think what,</v>

136
00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:34.950
what they're trying to say is if human beings keep going,

137
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.020
we definitely will create a simulation. It's just a matter of time.

138
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.660
So if that's the case, how do we know that we're not in one already?

139
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.260
And we really don't every day we go to sleep and every day we wake up and we

140
00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:49.180
assume, and we have faith that,

141
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.220
all that stuff that we remember is really how life went on before we were awake.

142
00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:56.740
But we really don't know really you don't when you black out and then come back

143
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.450
to who, oh, knows. What's transpiring. Who knows where your consciousness goes,

144
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.170
who knows where you are. You're gone. Eight hours seems like a second.

145
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.170
All of a sudden, you're foggy a couple minutes to wake up and boom,

146
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.570
where'd that time go? Where are you? Who are you?

147
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.930
You're assuming that all of the stuff that you know,

148
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.290
and all the stuff that you experience is a hundred percent real.

149
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.640
But what if it is real? Would do you mean if the simulation is real? No.

150
00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:20.474
If the simulation.

151
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.480
<v 2>Isn't real and we are on this earth'spossible down. Forpossible you know,</v>

152
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:25.840
like when it comes, when it comes to simulation theory. No. Yeah, yeah.

153
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.080
<v 0>I thinkpossible. The odds of that are, but the,</v>

154
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.040
but the passing out is a bad example.

155
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.320
But the good example is that we are within a hundred years away

156
00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:39.430
from making something that's, indesceerible from what we experience every day.

157
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.550
And that's inevitable, it seems like just how people do it.

158
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.750
And what I'm saying is that might literally be how your consciousness

159
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.990
transforms into whatever next stage of existence there is. We might,

160
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:52.750
it might be something that human beings do.

161
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.710
Like a caterpillar makes a cocoon and becomes a butterfly human beings

162
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.660
make crazy technology.

163
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.220
And I think that's one of the reasons why we're so invested in materialism.

164
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.220
Everybody loves things. They love shiny things love, especially the new ones.

165
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.980
All of you at the newest car, it's even faster.

166
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.180
The newest computer has better graphics new. She is. And as all this stuff,

167
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.460
as we're paying for newer and better, it's fueling all this innovation,

168
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:21.610
which making crazier and crazier technology until artificial intelligence,

169
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.610
until we create something that you can't turn off or you or.

170
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.290
<v 2>You download your consciousness and you just, you just, you know,</v>

171
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.290
you can download and another body.

172
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.490
<v 0>Or another simulation is then what that might be. What a simulation is,</v>

173
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:37.410
what a simulation might be is that when we open this up with sufficient power

174
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.530
and technology and processing power,

175
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.040
whenever you are might go into this thing, that's.

176
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.480
<v 2>A bit of a bummer though, right? I don't know when you think about it,</v>

177
00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:48.760
like let's say when you're a hundred and finally technology there,

178
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:51.960
just download your consciousness into another body. You just keep going.

179
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.880
It's like, man, this is it. I don't know. This is it. We don't go on.

180
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.520
<v 0>It's that's depressing as to me. It's kind, what's kind of FA I mean, what,</v>

181
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.680
what are we, that's the thing it's like,

182
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:03.800
what the are we when we're thinking and talking,

183
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.680
when you're thinking of yourself, like you like you,

184
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.840
when you are using the word, I, I am going to do this. I'm going,

185
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:12.160
what does that mean? Like, where are you? You, you are,

186
00:09:12.161 --> 00:09:15.950
you are this strange being, that's got a, a, a finite lifespan.

187
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.910
It's not really that long. Not at all. You know what I mean?

188
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:20.990
Eddie and I are middle aged. If we're lucky, you're on the back.

189
00:09:20.991 --> 00:09:23.830
You're on the back night. We're in the back nine. Yeah. I'm homeless then. Yeah.

190
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.990
And, and then you die. So what, what is going on while you're live?

191
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.190
It's all guesswork, man. We don't know what this is.

192
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.790
And everyone is involved in the guesswork from the highest levels of government

193
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.460
down to the, the poorest people world. Everyone's guessing. It's all weird.

194
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.220
It's all real weird. And it's all we're gonna die.

195
00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:43.300
And the next generation's gonna pick up and the next generation after them's

196
00:09:43.301 --> 00:09:46.860
gonna pick up. But, but life is a because of technology and science. You're,

197
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:51.220
you know, the, the average lifespan's going like this, it is. But also you,

198
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.460
you have more information. You can look at history, you can look at how long,

199
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.410
and we've been here. The more they start,

200
00:09:57.411 --> 00:10:00.890
they just found another asteroid impact from 800,000 years ago. Jesus.

201
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.090
They knew we were a hit 800,000 years ago, but now they've located the crater.

202
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:04.810
It's.

203
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.290
<v 1>Like, whered you read that in the library?</v>

204
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.650
<v 0>Yes. I've watched it on YouTube. &lt;laugh&gt; this it's becoming this. You know,</v>

205
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:12.530
people are, are realizing like there's,

206
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.440
there's only been a short amount of time where human beings have even human.

207
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.480
We've only been human for half a million years at the most.

208
00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:22.200
Sometimes that stuff bumps you out, especially you have kids, you know,

209
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.960
it's weird. Well, if, but think about it this way, if you were a neiantal or a,

210
00:10:26.961 --> 00:10:30.080
you know, a Australia epitheus and you know,

211
00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:32.760
you were told that your species is gonna go extinct.

212
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.640
You think all the good times you had killing musksrats and cooking,

213
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.030
'em over the fire with the, your kids and, and hiding from Jaguars and.

214
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.190
You think all those good times like this is, we're not gonna be us anymore.

215
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.310
Like no, no, no. So you.

216
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.670
<v 1>Think you think of this as a computer simulation? At what point?</v>

217
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.310
Like when did it start? Like in 18 hundreds, the 16 hundreds, uh,

218
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.470
200, a D 5,000 BC. When did,

219
00:10:56.471 --> 00:10:58.340
when was beginning of this simulation?

220
00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.740
<v 0>Who knows, man, we don't know.</v>

221
00:10:59.741 --> 00:11:04.220
There's a video game where you create your own worlds. SIM city, baby. No, no,

222
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:07.140
no more crazy. There's a video game where you literally create a universe,

223
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:09.180
you create a planet, you put things on it. And like,

224
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:12.340
what is that game called you and Jamie, what is it? Odd world. No man sky.

225
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.980
No man's sky. Yeah. Um, I think that's what you're talking about.

226
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.490
That could be what the universe is. I mean, the whole thing about the big bang,

227
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.250
like the big bang means that the entire universe was smaller than the head of a

228
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.090
pin at one point in time. Somewhere that no, but hold on a second.

229
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.490
So the universe smaller than the head of a pen, boom,

230
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.170
explodes becomes everything. Well, what started that? Well,

231
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:35.810
how do we not know that? That was when somebody,

232
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.000
somebody press start on a program. ' how do we, even.

233
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.680
<v 1>That even happened? Like the,</v>

234
00:11:40.681 --> 00:11:44.200
the theory is billions of years ago out of nothing, everything exploded you.

235
00:11:44.201 --> 00:11:46.440
What do you think happened? Well, you know who came up with it?

236
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.680
You becoming religious army. Me, you know, you know who came up with it?

237
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.520
Oh dude, if.

238
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.400
<v 0>You start talking about Jesus, Eddie. No, no, no.</v>

239
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.440
<v 1>You come up with a big bang. You can look this up right now.</v>

240
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:57.520
The big bang is a priest from the Vatican. A priest came up with that. There.

241
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.280
<v 2>Was a theor sign. Yeah. Scientist didn't Nope. A priest. Are you sure?</v>

242
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.080
<v 1>A million percent.</v>

243
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.200
<v 0>So he was the first Eddie, but you know, and.</v>

244
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.080
<v 1>I know I, I have a good idea. Why, why that's gonna take like 10 minutes?</v>

245
00:12:12.081 --> 00:12:13.750
Can I have another? Yeah.

246
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.003
<v 2>Please.</v>

247
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.750
<v 0>Get someone, this ice in that thing, you.</v>

248
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.110
<v 2>Know, you, if we're in a simulation, you're talking about, you know,</v>

249
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.470
the homeless guy or the, the kid starving in Ethiopia, right? He's like,

250
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:26.110
what the dude? Or the guy grinding his way out or the,

251
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.590
the single mother of five working can at McDonald's. Oh yeah. He's like,

252
00:12:28.591 --> 00:12:32.510
what kind of, who the chose this? Right? What is going on here, man? So only,

253
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.020
I feel like only people who are higher up and people that have money say we're

254
00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:39.220
in a simulation. That's the guy at McDo I bet you, there's not one dude.

255
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:41.620
We're gonna, McDonald's going. I think he's a simulation dude. &lt;laugh&gt;.

256
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.980
<v 0>That's true. But that's just because when you're struggling to, for survival,</v>

257
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.380
everything is more important. Like you you're on the edge.

258
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.780
But the thing about a guy like Yon Musk,

259
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.330
who's one of the proponents of the simulation theory's thing about a guy like

260
00:12:54.331 --> 00:12:57.890
him is he's got enough resources to relax a little bit,

261
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.290
but also he is involved in technology every day.

262
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.530
And he's probably one of the smartest people on earth and he's financially

263
00:13:04.531 --> 00:13:08.930
stable. So he can stop and think and think about things in a way where he's not,

264
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:13.930
he he's not overburdened by like, he has stresses for sure.

265
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.760
And obligations for sure. Massive ones, three giant companies.

266
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.440
But what he doesn't have is like survival stress,

267
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.960
survival stress about be like being poor or being in danger, but Al but also.

268
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.120
<v 2>The level that, that, where his IQ is so high, right.</v>

269
00:13:27.121 --> 00:13:29.480
He's on a different frequency. He might be too smart.

270
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:33.440
There's a lot of things where, when he speaks, I go, yeah, he's smart as. I,

271
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.430
I don't agree with them. You know, I like, that's not.

272
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.670
<v 1>Once I start seeing like, um, organic matter, like, uh,</v>

273
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.990
body parts and they, they, you watch it under like some, um,

274
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.470
microscopes. Yeah. And you see some like computer numbers and stuff,

275
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.790
then I'd be like, oh. What are you talking about for me to believe,

276
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.780
to take com uh, that we live in a computer simulation. Seriously.

277
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.300
I'd have to see like, evidence like that. You know?

278
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.020
<v 0>Well, if it, if it is a computer simulation, Eddie,</v>

279
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.460
that means everything that's physical,

280
00:14:05.461 --> 00:14:08.180
you're experiencing in a simulated way.

281
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:11.060
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so it could be everything it could like if you are,

282
00:14:11.061 --> 00:14:15.850
if it's just your mind experiencing things that your mind translate as being

283
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.690
physical sensations, real, why would it have.

284
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.850
<v 1>Numbers? I, I get it. And maybe we do live in a simulation. I I'm just saying,</v>

285
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.330
I just don't say see any.

286
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.370
<v 2>Evidence of that. How about count at three 30 though?</v>

287
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.690
<v 0>Oh yeah. We knew it. I told you call. I said, we're not waiting for him.</v>

288
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.370
It's four o'clock no. Yeah. Look, I'm not saying that we're in a simulation.

289
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.170
What I'm saying is I think things are a lot weirder than anybody wants to admit.

290
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.440
<v 2>Or, or we're just overthinking it or, or,</v>

291
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.800
or there's so much information the internet and you know, there's smart people.

292
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:44.760
We're just overthinking everything and there is no stimulaion, there's that too.

293
00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:48.560
Once you live your life, it's over, man. Lights' out could be, could.

294
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.240
<v 0>Be. We wanna think there's something. We wanna think there's something next,</v>

295
00:14:51.241 --> 00:14:54.680
because we wanna hope that our contributions are permanent and that we're gonna,

296
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.720
we're gonna somehow another come back in another life.

297
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:58.960
That's where kids coming to play. Right? Yep. Your seeds.

298
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.680
And also that also the way you treat people and the things that you rub off on

299
00:15:02.681 --> 00:15:04.520
other people. Yeah. And they start to carry it on.

300
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:10.790
<v 3>Thank.</v>
