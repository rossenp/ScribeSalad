00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How are you doing, man? You're all healed up.</v>

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.570
<v 1>The bruising and swelling has gone down as you can see,</v>

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.850
but the most serious injury was to the right.

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.330
<v 2>You have a serious injury to your brain, brain hemorrhage.</v>

5
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.190
What happened from what the mob beating? So from getting hit in the head,

6
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:20.330
you got a brain hemorrhage.

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.060
<v 1>Multiple times fusions. Yes.</v>

8
00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:27.800
They were bashing me on the back of my head and to my eyes. Um.

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.580
<v 2>But so how do you know you had brain hemorrhaging and now are you able to just</v>

10
00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:33.140
walk around? Well.

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.310
<v 1>It's taken two. I started losing my balance after the beating.</v>

12
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.410
There was no police. I made it, uh, to the courthouse, sat down on the ground.

13
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.330
Ambulance was called.

14
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.200
I had to walk back to the ambulance because the streets were walked back to the

15
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:50.180
police precinct in the direction of the mall,

16
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.440
the medics that were associated with the Portland police, let me know that they,

17
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.920
um, that I needed to walk in that direction. It was quite shocking cause it was,

18
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.310
um, I had just been a victim of a small beating.

19
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.060
And then now they're telling me to walk back in direction of, uh,

20
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.710
the center precinct, where the beating had.

21
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.130
<v 2>Happened. Did they not know that you had been beaten up? Well, let's,</v>

22
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:10.701
let's let let's,

23
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:14.330
let's set this up for people who are new to this and don't understand what

24
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:15.800
happened. Um,

25
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.050
I've been aware of you because of you had written for Colette,

26
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.700
right? And, uh,

27
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.390
you had become one of these for whatever reason,

28
00:01:26.391 --> 00:01:29.870
controversial online journalists and, uh,

29
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.190
you covered Antifa quite a bit and you covered a lot of, uh,

30
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.770
the radical left. You were in Portland.

31
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.230
And what was the exact rally that was going on?

32
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.490
What was it called? Did it have a name? Uh.

33
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.380
<v 1>It was something like protect Portland.</v>

34
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.150
So it was organized by rose city on tufa and its allies

35
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.160
and by its allies are I'm referring to the local chapter of the

36
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.100
democratic socialists of America that came out to support them. Yeah.

37
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.930
And what are they protecting.

38
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.823
<v 2>Portland from?</v>

39
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.140
<v 1>They allege a fascist fascists.</v>

40
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.560
<v 2>But just in general, I mean,</v>

41
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:11.840
is there like a particular thing they're worried about?

42
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.390
<v 1>There were two right-wing events happening that day that they were counter</v>

43
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:22.250
demonstrating against. There was a, on one side in pod, one pod where downtown,

44
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:27.110
the proud boys for holding a flag waving event that was completely,

45
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.430
uh, peaceful. There was.

46
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.010
<v 2>No actually flag waving American flag waving. Correct.</v>

47
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.910
<v 1>Okay. Um, and a lot of Portland has found that provocative and, uh, uh,</v>

48
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.720
manifestation of a Fisher stick violence.

49
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.270
And in another part of downtown,

50
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:45.680
there was a men's rights activist who was holding, um, a rally,

51
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.960
uh, uh, it was titled for, for victims of domestic terrorism.

52
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:55.820
It was an anti Antifa event. So, uh,

53
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.390
uh.

54
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.370
<v 2>A men's rights activist that was doing an</v>

55
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.950
anti-fascist or anti Antifa, correct. What,

56
00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:09.370
what boy seems like a whole lot to do about nothing

57
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.820
flag-waving and anti Antifa. Okay.

58
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.980
<v 1>Yeah. Can I set the context for, for the city of Portland? It's a mess.</v>

59
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.970
You have listeners and viewers all over the world. So Portland,

60
00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:25.800
Oregon is a extremely progressive city in the Pacific Northwest

61
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.780
of the U S and um,

62
00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:32.040
I call it a political monoculture because really it's, um,

63
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.160
uh, not just, you're more likely to find socialists open socialists there.

64
00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:42.120
Then you would find like a regular, uh, Republican or conservative.

65
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.700
And within this sort of echo chamber of just left us politics,

66
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.230
there's, it's become also a hotbed for fall off militancy.

67
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.630
So rose city Antifa is you could call it like the local chapter of

68
00:03:57.631 --> 00:04:00.150
movement of Antifa is one of the oldest in the country.

69
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.290
It's very large important and they hold, um,

70
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.660
what you could call protests,

71
00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:10.320
but they're there they're protests that always devolve into riots where they

72
00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:15.300
essentially take over parts of downtown and attack people attack their

73
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.710
ideological opponents and do it frequently with impunity. I mean,

74
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.360
I wasn't the only one to talk that day.

75
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:25.620
There were two other people who were bashed on the head very ill and have very

76
00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:30.150
severe lacerations to the face on hat. Um, you may recall the footage, uh,

77
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.830
from October of last year when there was an elderly driver who was attacked on

78
00:04:34.831 --> 00:04:35.610
the street.

79
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.900
<v 2>Yeah. They were directing traffic. Exactly. And somehow or another,</v>

80
00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:43.110
the mayor thought it was a good idea to let this take place. Is that the case?

81
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:45.300
And they told the police to stand down. Is that true?

82
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.940
<v 1>So, um,</v>

83
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.220
I mean the next part of this journey for me will be the legal aspect of it.

84
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.320
And it seems like something stinks in Portland.

85
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.880
The issue is really not with the rank and file officers.

86
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.100
They're following orders to not intervene. So I,

87
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:06.060
I had been, uh,

88
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.200
assaulted and criminally harassed early before the mall beating people were

89
00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:14.760
throwing milkshakes at my face and head within eyesight of police who were

90
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:19.110
watching in downtown. And both of these were reported. And the,

91
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.810
the answer that I heard that day, as I've heard many times before,

92
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:26.250
when I've been assaulted by Antifa is we will not question

93
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.570
approach or detain the suspect because this could incite the crap.

94
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.380
<v 2>Okay. So this is why this has exacerbated,</v>

95
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:37.590
or this is why this has become such a big deal in Portland because of this

96
00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:38.011
attitude,

97
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:42.090
because Portland seems to be the hotbed right now for this kind of stuff.

98
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.780
Is that.

99
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.250
<v 1>Is that fair to say? I think it is.</v>

100
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.240
<v 2>So is this the mayor who, I mean, who is,</v>

101
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.360
who's the one who's giving the orders to the police to tell them,

102
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:53.220
to allow this stuff to take place?

103
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.310
<v 1>Well, um, I'm crowdfunding the legal fund right now,</v>

104
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.420
and we are willing, we are going to hold accountable.

105
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.460
Whoever is responsible for dereliction of duty, where the evidence leads us.

106
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:09.230
So Portland,

107
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.480
how's the odd governance system in that the mayor who is up for

108
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:19.130
reelection by the way is also the police commissioner.

109
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:20.683
So.

110
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.360
<v 0>Yeah. Um, how does that work? It.</v>

111
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.780
<v 1>It was an old system that I'd inherited and it just never changed.</v>

112
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.300
<v 2>From the wild west. Like that sounds ridiculous.</v>

113
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.620
<v 1>It is ridiculous.</v>

114
00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:37.330
You can see all the political con the conflicts and in conflicts of interest

115
00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:39.460
that that would arise, right? Yeah.

116
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.840
<v 2>Yeah. Shitload, um, how did you get involved in this? Like what,</v>

117
00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:45.730
why first of all, why were they angry you?

118
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.560
<v 1>I, uh, I work as a journalist, uh, I'll name,</v>

119
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:54.190
like places that I've been published before I write and I do video and I do

120
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:58.090
podcasts. So my written work has been published in the wall street journal,

121
00:06:58.091 --> 00:07:00.970
the national review spectator, New York post.

122
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.140
I'm also on the editorial team of Colette magazine. Um,

123
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.970
and one of my beats among salvo is about far less militancy,

124
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.880
particularly in Portland. And to me,

125
00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:17.590
what I was noticing was that the national and local media coverage,

126
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.570
how a particular blind spot,

127
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:22.840
when it came to their coverage on Antifa,

128
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.090
there was all this sensitivity to the colonoscopy fall, right?

129
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.100
And a white nationalism or white identity

130
00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:35.950
extremism, but they could not,

131
00:07:35.951 --> 00:07:39.640
or would not recognize the militancy that was on the left.

132
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.970
And Portland seemed to be one of the places for ground zero,

133
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.270
particularly after 2016,

134
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:49.270
we had very violent rioting in downtown that

135
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.820
a segment of the population could not accept the election results in November.

136
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.950
And so, uh, they did a million dollars in damage setting fires and,

137
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.610
uh, destroying properties and businesses. And now at that time,

138
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:06.460
I was a graduate student working at the student paper,

139
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.500
and I did a story on that. And I came out to witness and it, it,

140
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.900
you know, this was a major American city,

141
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:18.700
but it felt like I was in Afghanistan or Iraq,

142
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.780
just with all these fires and explosions and people running around with Botswana

143
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.650
mast up.

144
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.710
And that was the first time I really became familiar with Antifa and I took an

145
00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:27.544
interest in it.

146
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.110
And I saw over and over that the media coverage was basically

147
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.390
really sort of whitewashing them kind of like referring to them as

148
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.390
antifascist, giving them that propaganda,

149
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.290
victory and Antifa movement doubt,

150
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.280
masters of doublespeak and disinformation.

151
00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:52.570
So it starts with the name Antifa is short for anti-fascist,

152
00:08:52.571 --> 00:08:55.120
but I never referred to them as that because, um,

153
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.880
that's seeding the ground to, uh, to then,

154
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.370
uh, they, when they say that they are defending a community,

155
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:06.360
self-defense,

156
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.280
it actually is referring to meet premeditated violence and offensive violence.

157
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.770
So I started going into covering this more and more, you know,

158
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:20.970
after I left the student paper, I started writing for, um,

159
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.490
some national and international publications.

160
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.290
And there internationally, there was a, you know,

161
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:32.430
a set of readers who interested in what the hell is going on in Portland.

162
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:37.020
Why are there these continue scenes of street, brawls and anarchy over and over?

163
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:39.720
What are the variables that are causing this?

164
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:44.010
And I thought that I could try to shine a light on it.

165
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.170
And by doing so,

166
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:50.220
Antifa became enraged with my work.

167
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.900
And particularly things they've hated me since last year,

168
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.250
but they started really escalating, um,

169
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.330
on, on the 1st of May, may day. Um,

170
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:08.220
so this year was when I was physically assaulted

171
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.780
by them for the first time,

172
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.880
they were very upset that I wrote a story for the New York

173
00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:17.550
post, where there was a series of,

174
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.050
and this is one of the other beats that I work on is a hate crime hoaxes

175
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.170
and Portland earlier this year had this huge panic over serious

176
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:30.330
allegations of, uh,

177
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.100
LGBT people claiming that there were marauding right-wing gangs, driving around,

178
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.400
trying to kill people with bats, with hammers,

179
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.410
trying to kidnap them.

180
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.430
And these were all rumors that were reported on social media calls,

181
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:49.050
a huge frenzy, even the mayor, uh, had to come out and, you know,

182
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.150
issue statement about how he was concerned.

183
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:55.620
There was an emergency town hall with the local center.

184
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.480
And, um, so I started looking into all these allegations. There were 15 of them,

185
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.190
and I found that of the 15, only one was reported to police.

186
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:06.750
And what was reported to police

187
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.850
undocumented in the report was entirely different from the GoFund me where over

188
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:15.540
$10,000 was raised for this trans activist. Um,

189
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:20.400
she had alleged that one night walking home transphobic people had beat her

190
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:24.840
with the bat and knocked her unconscious police report said that she was

191
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:26.820
extremely intoxicated and unlikely fell.

192
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.540
And there was no evidence that anybody had assaulted her.

193
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.400
So when the story came out, because Antifa was really anti fund,

194
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:38.910
the democratic socialists of America in Portland were really involved in

195
00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:43.140
paddling. This hate crime fear in Portland. And I just kinda,

196
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.570
you know, threw water on this, this, uh, uh, panic that they have been,

197
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.010
um, flaming. And so on the 1st of May,

198
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:54.520
um,

199
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.450
there was a ride that I was covering and one of the mast ANSI field people went

200
00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:01.540
up and sprayed me with, I think it was bam mace,

201
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.630
some type of chemical that blinds you and burns you.

202
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.070
<v 2>Yeah. I saw that video. Yeah.</v>

203
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.110
<v 1>So there was no police that ha that was there. That, I mean,</v>

204
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:15.250
that Antifa event was publicly advertised on Facebook and all that.

205
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:16.750
So over and over,

206
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.430
like Antifa is very transparent about their calls for people to come to the

207
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:22.210
stuff in,

208
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.620
to engage in this physical confrontation that they call self-defense and the

209
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:31.510
police either stay away or on purpose or are told to

210
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:33.070
stay away. So.

211
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.780
<v 2>It's very confusing because when you watch the videos there,</v>

212
00:12:36.781 --> 00:12:39.510
there's amazing people, they're macing people who disagree with them,

213
00:12:39.511 --> 00:12:42.180
like they're yelling at each other and then someone will come along and maize

214
00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:47.040
people and for the police to not step in and do something it's

215
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:47.980
I don't,

216
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.630
I don't think there's another city in the country that would allow something

217
00:12:51.631 --> 00:12:54.330
like that. It just doesn't, it doesn't seem like it makes any sense at all,

218
00:12:54.331 --> 00:12:54.701
because you're,

219
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:57.480
you're not talking about people that are being physically attacked and that are

220
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.400
macing someone to protect themselves,

221
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.470
or even a threat of being physically attacked.

222
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.620
They're just disagreeing with each other and yelling at each other.

223
00:13:04.621 --> 00:13:06.960
And then someone will come along and start macing people.

224
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.300
And I've seen it many times.

225
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.620
And I think there's also a real problem with people wearing masks. You know,

226
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.230
whether their ideology makes sense or not.

227
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.920
When you put people in masks and then you have a bunch of people yelling and

228
00:13:19.921 --> 00:13:24.750
escalating, and then there's teams, there's team and TIVA versus team, you know,

229
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.130
anybody opposing them,

230
00:13:26.131 --> 00:13:30.180
they feel is a white supremacist or a Nazi.

231
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.390
And this is just how they've chosen to frame it to dehumanize people.

232
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.740
And then you see them attack people.

233
00:13:34.741 --> 00:13:37.830
I'm sure you're aware of the girl who got maced in the face because she had a

234
00:13:37.831 --> 00:13:39.960
hat on that said, make Bitcoin great again,

235
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.800
but it was the same color hat as the make America great again, hat.

236
00:13:43.801 --> 00:13:46.950
And she got maced in the face and she got hit with something too, right?

237
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.950
Didn't she get hit in the face with something. Anyway,

238
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.010
this kind of is really weird.

239
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.210
It's really weird and disturbing to see these young people with these ideal

240
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.940
idealistic versions of what they're doing.

241
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.640
I think a lot of the people that are involved in that really think they are

242
00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:04.770
fighting fascism. They really do.

243
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.700
They really think that Donald Trump and the proud boys and white supremacists

244
00:14:08.701 --> 00:14:11.160
from Charlottesville, carrying Tiki torches,

245
00:14:11.161 --> 00:14:13.680
that these people represent something horrible.

246
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.000
That's sweeping across the country.

247
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.870
And the young people today need to stand up and fight against this.

248
00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:22.080
And they're putting on masks and they're carrying backpacks and whacking people

249
00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:25.710
in the head with Crow bars is really weird to see.

250
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.600
And it's really weird that the city of Portland or all cities, in fact,

251
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.920
haven't made some sort of a law where you can't walk around in public with a

252
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.940
mask on, because that is one of the things that helps these people.

253
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.080
It's the same thing that you see on social media when people are anonymous and

254
00:14:43.081 --> 00:14:44.460
they say the most horrible hateful.

255
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.980
They're saying that because they're not in front of you,

256
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.390
you can't recognize them.

257
00:14:48.391 --> 00:14:50.370
They don't have to take responsibility for what they're saying.

258
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:55.070
This a lot of the same characteristics that a person has when they're wearing a

259
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:59.030
costume, you're dressed in all black with gloves on and a face mask.

260
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.570
And you're hitting people with a bike lock. Like what, what is that about? Well,

261
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:06.500
what that's about is you're getting away with being anonymous and you're getting

262
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:08.510
support from all these other people around you.

263
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.920
There's this mob mentality that takes place. It's, well-documented with humans,

264
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.030
where when you get a group of people together and there's another group and it's

265
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:19.400
like, it's a tribal warfare type situation.

266
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.350
And that's what you're seeing within teeth.

267
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:24.620
And the fact that the Portland police have,

268
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:26.300
I don't know what's going on with them where they're,

269
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.980
they've been told to not handle that,

270
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:31.310
but the fact they haven't done anything to mitigate. This is it's.

271
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.990
It's embarrassing. It's, it's a shame. It's, it's terrible. It really is.

272
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.060
And it's, it's, it's a travesty.

273
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.970
<v 1>You asked about the mayor earlier. And, and if he issued any stand down orders,</v>

274
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:47.860
there's a statement that was put out after I was attacked by the pat Darrell

275
00:15:47.861 --> 00:15:50.890
Turner, who's the president of the police union. And he said very clearly,

276
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:55.810
he called from the mayor to remove the handcuffs handcuffs of law

277
00:15:55.811 --> 00:15:57.610
enforcement so they can enforce the law.

278
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.900
And he accused the mayor of politicizing. The police department.

279
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.280
Is this mayor popular? No, he's not.

280
00:16:06.281 --> 00:16:11.200
He's hated well by moderates because of

281
00:16:11.201 --> 00:16:12.850
the things that he allows to happen in the city,

282
00:16:12.851 --> 00:16:16.360
but the fallout hate him as well. They view him as not radical enough.

283
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:27.400
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>
