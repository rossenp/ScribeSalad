00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.680
<v 1>Do you, um, do you anticipate writing with new characters?</v>

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.360
Are you gonna keep Jack Reese? Like how, how are you gonna do this?

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.240
<v 0>Yeah. So James Reese, James Reese. Yep. For this season, why is.</v>

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.800
<v 1>Jack? Jack is John.</v>

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.400
<v 0>Sometimes, sometimes John of Kennedy Jack know that sort of thing. Yeah,</v>

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.110
no, it's easy to do. And then you have Jack Reacher character.

8
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:26.390
You have Jack Ryan, you know, he's really John Ryan from the Clancy stuff. So,

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.350
so, uh, yeah, James Reese is the main character,

10
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:31.830
former Navy seal sniper background, similar to mine.

11
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.790
But right now it's so hard to, uh,

12
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.430
get an audience to connect with your character. Uh,

13
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:38.990
and I didn't even think about that as I started, but since that's happened,

14
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:42.580
since he is resonating with people in the story are resonating with people, um,

15
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.860
that I think I'm gonna continue on with the same character, the same storyline,

16
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.340
um, building on it, building along his journey,

17
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.020
cuz we're all on this journey and people can relate to that as well to

18
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:53.500
transitions and move different struggles and all that.

19
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.740
So I'm gonna continue with this character for as long as people wanna continue

20
00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:57.574
to read about him.

21
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.300
<v 1>So did you feel like you just hit gold? So you're, you're in a nice</v>

22
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.010
vein of gold in this mountain you might as well just keep running.

23
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.130
<v 0>I think so. I mean, you could, uh, I heard a story my, from my, um,</v>

24
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.410
from my editor and she has another, another author that, uh,

25
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.690
that had kinda the same thing.

26
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:15.970
Like people res his character was resonating and he said,

27
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.690
I don't think I'm gonna do something different. And she's like, what? No,

28
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:21.890
you're not. &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; no, you're how rare this is. So.

29
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.060
<v 1>Like, uh,</v>

30
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.080
JK rowings she had this amazing success with Harry Potter and then she wrote

31
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:29.480
another book and you know, I mean,

32
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.360
I'm sure it's probably pretty successful just because she's JK rowings and

33
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:35.760
everybody loves her, but I.

34
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.720
<v 0>Haven't heard about it. Yeah. Sometimes it's hard to.</v>

35
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.520
<v 1>Move over. What's the new book about &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

36
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.323
<v 0>Magic? No.</v>

37
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.470
<v 1>Maybe not. I don't know. I feel like I knew some,</v>

38
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.830
I couldn't tell you what it is. I have no idea.

39
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.270
I'm sure it sold a million copies cuz everything she does. Yeah. Yeah. She.

40
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.630
<v 0>Could, you know, she, but y'all know Harry Potter,</v>

41
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.950
like that is part of the culture now, you know, it is, it is,

42
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.790
that is a part of the culture, but uh, but yeah, I'm continue on,

43
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.110
continue on with this for a while, but I'll do other projects as well.

44
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.790
Like I learned a ton working on these scripts and I didn't know anything about

45
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:03.220
screenwriting going into it and the screen editor,

46
00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:05.660
David alio awesome guy out there in LA.

47
00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:08.420
He really just kind of mentored me along and we worked on these things together

48
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.380
and I got to advise on each of them. So I got to see how that process went,

49
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.420
got to see what it looks like when you bring a writer's room in that I knew you,

50
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.700
you have experience with now you have 15 people in that are all giving their

51
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:20.220
different ideas, uh, to how to adapt your work.

52
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:22.620
So it's really interesting while that was happening, not physically.

53
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.290
So they send me the yeah, so COVID hit pretty, pretty soon into it.

54
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.490
So they were all virtual too. So they're all doing that, that virtual,

55
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.423
the room was virtual.

56
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.050
<v 1>So you did a virtual meeting though. You were at least digitally in presence.</v>

57
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.250
So was it weird having people talk about your creation and sort of move it

58
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:45.040
around and did they keep all the main characters like Katie and morph

59
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.600
bit his wife and his daughter and all that stuff is.

60
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.320
<v 0>Yeah. So Chris wanted to keep it. So Chris optioned it right out of the gate,</v>

61
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:52.280
Chris Pratt. And so January of 2018,

62
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:55.840
before it even hits shell as Chris PRT options, it cuz a dear friend,

63
00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:58.320
Jared Shaw gives him a copy and says, this is your next project,

64
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.440
which is just by the way.

65
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.720
<v 1>Who's better than Chris.</v>

66
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.280
<v 0>PRD. I can't think of anybody. He's my favorite, Chris.</v>

67
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.800
<v 1>He's great. He's he's just such a great guy. He is. And he's so nice for him.</v>

68
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.920
Like it's, he's perfect for that role.

69
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.240
<v 0>So perfect. He's a, you know, he's done, you know, he had a small role in zero,</v>

70
00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:16.320
dark 30 where he plays the Navy seal mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

71
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.470
and very small part, but uh, you know, his other stuff hasn't been as violent.

72
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:22.310
Hasn't been as visceral, hasn't been as primal.

73
00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:23.550
And so people are gonna be surprised.

74
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.470
<v 1>How graphic is this going to be pretty graphic? Well, I,</v>

75
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.190
the books are so graphic.

76
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.310
<v 0>Yeah, we are here. We are right there. Yep. I think that was, uh, Antoine.</v>

77
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:36.230
Wasn't supposed to post that. So, so I'm so glad that he did though.

78
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.070
<v 1>Antoine, you up it's on Chris's.</v>

79
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.780
<v 0>Page actually. Yeah. Of Chris did it too. Chris reposted it, which is great. Uh,</v>

80
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.900
so Anson and Anson Fuqua right there, man. He is such an amazing guy. Um,

81
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.820
so did training day did tears of the sun magnificent seven shooter equalizer.

82
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.940
Um, and it's one of those guys like when you meet him and you're in this,

83
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.380
in his presence, like some of these different, you know, you have this,

84
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:58.660
like you meet a lot of people that come through here and uh,

85
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.770
maybe a couple of'em have had that sort of presence. Incredible,

86
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.290
such a nice guy. So having Chris and Antoine at the top of this thing,

87
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.170
so many people came up to me on set and just told me, Hey,

88
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:11.490
this feels different than other movies we've worked on. Like everybody from,

89
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.690
you know, craft services to whatever else, technical advisors, you know,

90
00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:15.970
all coming in saying this is different.

91
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.330
And plus we had like 12 seals on set guys that I knew in the teams that are

92
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:21.320
there playing seals or acting in the,

93
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.800
in it or doing stunt coordination or technical advising or whatever it is. Um,

94
00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:27.200
so we were all on. So it was like a reunion. That's awesome. So we had a blast.

95
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.040
Yeah. So all those guys there, we had, it was a,

96
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.760
it was a huge reunion for a week on set and we had a, we had a blast, but yeah,

97
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.960
it could not be. And you trust a lot of this is trust.

98
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.520
So when you hand something over to somebody to take your work and change it into

99
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:41.750
something and adapt it to film, uh, or can be anything. But, uh,

100
00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:44.750
there's a lot of trust involved cuz you're especially me when, uh,

101
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.190
if you're not JK Rowling or you're not, uh, you know,

102
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.950
Stephen King and you're not maintaining creative control, uh,

103
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.470
you hand that to somebody else and you cross your fingers and there's no better.

104
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.390
There's no two better people to be in charge of this than Chris Pratt and an won

105
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.750
Fuqua. They're incredible people catch.
