00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now, what can be done? Like what,</v>

2
00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:08.250
what can the average person do I see people walking around with masks on wearing

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:09.780
gloves? Is that nonsense.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.950
<v 1>Largely? Yes. Yeah. First of all, um, let's step back.</v>

5
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:17.160
The primary mechanism for transmission is just the respiratory route.

6
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:20.190
It's just breathing, um, in studies in Germany,

7
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.090
which just have been published literally in the last 24 hours. Um,

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.540
they actually followed a group of people who had been exposed to somebody in an

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.190
automobile manufacturing plant.

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.550
And then they had nine people that with this exposure, he said,

11
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:35.010
if you have any symptoms at all, contact us, we want to follow up with,

12
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:37.230
and they all agreed. Well, they got infected.

13
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.920
And so in the very first hours just feeling bad, sore throat,

14
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.790
they went in and sampled the throat's, their, their saliva,

15
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:48.510
their nose for virus, they did blood, they did stool, they did urine.

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.410
And they found that at that very moment, when they first got sick,

17
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.270
they had incredibly high levels of virus.

18
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.930
Sometimes 10,000 times that we saw with SARS in their throats,

19
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.000
meaning they were infectious at that point already.

20
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.880
And they hadn't even had symptoms yet of really any nature they were coughing

21
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:04.140
yet. Wow. And,

22
00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:07.520
and that's where we're concerned because that's the kind of transmission,

23
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.160
you know, I always have said trying to stop influence virus, transmission.

24
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.170
Let's try to stop the wind. You know, we,

25
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.530
we've never had anything successfully do that other than vaccine.

26
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:17.850
And we don't have a vaccine here.

27
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.530
So what's happening is that people in public spaces are getting infected and the

28
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:26.490
way you need to address that is, unfortunately if you're older,

29
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.090
over 55, you have some underlying health problems, which unfortunately,

30
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:33.900
a lot of Americans do. We have, uh, obesity then right now,

31
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:35.880
you don't want to be in large public spaces.

32
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.440
You're trying to potentially get infected.

33
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.800
So you can take care of that part as far as what can public health do.

34
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.420
We're not going to, we can talk about this.

35
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.800
We're not going to have a vaccine anytime soon. That's happy talk. Um, what we,

36
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:49.890
you know, we can close schools. One of the big challenges we have right now,

37
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:54.330
if we close schools, what do we accomplish in influenza virus when you,

38
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.010
we close schools during outbreaks,

39
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:59.010
because it turns out kids are get infected in school.

40
00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:00.870
And they're like little virus reactors, you know,

41
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:04.050
they come home and they transmit it to mom and dad and brothers and sisters.

42
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.230
And, uh, so we closed schools.

43
00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:09.870
Sometimes it's Christmas breaks are always great for kind of putting a dampening

44
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.330
effect on flu. In this case,

45
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.060
kids are not getting sick very often at all,

46
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:18.450
which is one of the really good news features of this disease in China.

47
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.010
Only 2.1% of the cases are under eight, 19 years of age. And why is that?

48
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.360
You know, we don't completely know. Uh, and,

49
00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:28.200
and I'm going to come to that in a second because they're getting infected.

50
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:31.740
It turns out one study showed that they still get infected with the virus,

51
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.200
but they don't get sick. And we have that happen.

52
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:36.990
There's a disease called infectious hepatitis, hepatitis a,

53
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.360
where we have outbreaks and daycares.

54
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.660
And the way we know we have an outbreak is cause it's transmitted through the

55
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:43.020
stool.

56
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.520
Fecal oral is mom and dad and the daycare providers all get sick and the kids

57
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.830
don't symptoms. We go in and test the kids. They're all positive.

58
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.570
So some diseases will manifest my primary when you're adult, but not as a child.

59
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.710
This one appears to be the same. So do we close schools or not?

60
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.340
If we're not really spreading the disease,

61
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:02.560
because it turns out that if we close schools,

62
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.660
a recent study done showed that 38% of nurses today in this country who are

63
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:09.880
working in the medical carrier, have kids in school.

64
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.850
And if suddenly we're closing schools for two or three months,

65
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:13.930
who's going to take care of those kids.

66
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.180
<v 2>Yeah. Not even 10 years, nine years.</v>

67
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.770
So I actually started a MMA training as just a

68
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.180
key to keep fit while I was playing rugby league. So I was, uh, you know,

69
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:28.840
that was when I was 214 pounds. So that's something that, uh, you know,

70
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:30.520
obviously, uh, when we're, when you,

71
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.580
when I'm fighting and you say 240 and it'll slow getting up.

72
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.400
<v 0>Your language, you,</v>

73
00:03:35.401 --> 00:03:38.630
you guys have that Australian language saying things different [inaudible]

74
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.190
sounds.

75
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.010
<v 2>Like two hundred forty two hundred and forty.</v>

76
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.430
<v 0>4 Cents. Yeah. But still is ridiculous.</v>

77
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.310
<v 2>A hundred percent, you know, I'm five foot, six on a good day. You know, Lena,</v>

78
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.430
give me a good stretch out, do some yoga sessions. I might make five,

79
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.180
five foot six, but you know what I mean? It's just a lot bigger.

80
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.180
And I wanted to stay fit in between, in between, uh,

81
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.400
like sort of the season preseason.

82
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:03.730
So that's why I w I went and started and just loved it ever since.

83
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:05.920
So that was about, yeah. Again, nine years ago.

84
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.450
<v 0>So, and holding now, uh, 31. Yeah. We'll get you.</v>

85
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.680
<v 2>Gorilla. Oh, you're there. You guys see, look at the.</v>

86
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.390
<v 0>Sides of you. Jesus Christ. You're 31 7 head. So you were, you know, early,</v>

87
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:19.180
early twenties and no martial arts training. You're all before that.

88
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.220
<v 2>I wrestled. So I wrestled, uh,</v>

89
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.270
before I even done rugby league or wrestled for about probably a year,

90
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.280
I can't even remember. It was a, you know, honestly I was,

91
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.040
I'd done it for about a year and, uh, you know,

92
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.950
I'd done pretty good or something that I was actually pretty good at, but,

93
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.461
you know,

94
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:36.700
I wanted to play football with my mates and I got over wearing the tights,

95
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.790
you know, wrestling and stuff like that. So, uh, you know,

96
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:41.500
it was just something that, you know,

97
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:42.760
I ended up just playing football with a mate,

98
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.740
so I sort of gave it up and I was actually pretty good at it.

99
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:47.680
So we wonder when the nationals luck, you know, obviously it's the,

100
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:51.400
wrestling's not as big in Australia as it is over here, but, you know,

101
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:54.370
I still won like Australian championship twice and stuff like that,

102
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:56.740
but then I just, I just gave it up and started. Yeah.

103
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.610
<v 0>So that's crazy. So you won the Australia nationals twice?</v>

104
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.320
<v 2>Yes. Wow. Yeah. So that was, uh, yeah, they have them every year. Just.</v>

105
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.060
<v 0>Different training for a year.</v>

106
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.010
<v 2>You don't see done it for a year. Honestly.</v>

107
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:11.530
I remember we used to have a game night. We call us at a,

108
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.070
PCY say police boys club. It's just a local club.

109
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.420
Usually they'll have like games nights and they had wrestling there. And, uh,

110
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.570
I just went there one time and the, you know, the trainer was just like, oh,

111
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:24.880
you should come and do training because I was doing all right.

112
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.120
So I just started doing it. And then I was actually pretty good. Again.

113
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:32.800
I was always like, I literally, you know, come out the mother's womb like this,

114
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:33.880
you know what I mean? So I've been, uh,

115
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.060
I've been this big since I've been this big or, you know,

116
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:39.970
this side and it looked this old luck for, you know, since I was like 12.

117
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:40.804
So I was always,

118
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.530
I was always verse and guys twice the size of me and you know what I mean?

119
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:48.430
So I was older, much older as well. And, uh, I used to do well.

120
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.740
So that's what a lot of people thought I was mad. You know,

121
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.990
when I gave that up because I was doing so good.

122
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.510
And then the same as the rugby league, when I played rugby league,

123
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.680
even people thought I was mad given that up as.

124
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.330
<v 0>Well, because there was something I was pretty good at as well.</v>

125
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.450
You want to you and Jay check who's the former strawweight champion.

126
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.450
She had a fight with this woman, uh, Zhang Wei Lee,

127
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.860
who is the strawweight champion from China is crazy epic.

128
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.770
Like one of the best fights in history at the end of it,

129
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.120
you want his head like a Frankenstein forehead.

130
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.940
Imagine me. Yeah. Look at her forehead.

131
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.680
Now imagine me with makeup on standing next to her. That would be ridiculous.

132
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:26.510
Right? I refuse. I look.

133
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.650
<v 3>At my foundation.</v>

134
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.200
<v 0>They were like, well, we're just going to cut down on the shine.</v>

135
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:35.150
Who gives a if I'm shiny. Yeah. Literally no one cares. Yeah. She's got a.

136
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.440
<v 3>Double forehead.</v>

137
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.210
<v 0>Now it's a double triple for her.</v>

138
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.960
<v 3>Everything's falling back. Is it back down? I don't know. She hasn't.</v>

139
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.460
<v 0>Followed up. She hasn't taken.</v>

140
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:46.490
That's what she looks like normally beautiful lady. She's so tough.

141
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.210
That lady is as tough as human beings can possibly be. Oh my gosh.

142
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.710
Cause she like never even flinched her foreheads twice. The size of normal.

143
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.220
She didn't even flinch kept throwing bombs. It was amazing. Yeah.

144
00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.120
<v 3>Epic. How.</v>

145
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.290
<v 0>Long did it go? Five rounds, five rounds, 25, whole minutes of chaos.</v>

146
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.450
And it was even the whole fight.

147
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.780
The whole fight was like back and forth and back and forth, back and forth.

148
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:09.614
It was amazing.

149
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.090
<v 3>Are you guys super bummed out when people like throw one punch and the person</v>

150
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:16.190
falls down? That's it? That's.

151
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.950
<v 0>Yeah. It's exciting. Yeah. The sport is crazy. You know, it can happen that way.</v>

152
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:26.420
We're like, there was a recent fight where Donald Serone, um,

153
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.150
fought Conor McGregor and Connor in the clench.

154
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.310
Conor McGregor slammed his shoulder into Donald's nose and broke his nose.

155
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.740
So they came out of clinch, like seconds into the fight.

156
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:40.820
His nose is bleeding and then he got a head kicked and he got pummeled and they

157
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:43.170
stopped the fight in 40 seconds. Oh my God.

158
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.010
And everybody was bummed out because there was this huge pay-per-view event.

159
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.680
It's a big deal. But that's part of,

160
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:52.700
what's crazy about this sport is that it's the fighting in either boxing,

161
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:55.910
kickboxing or MMA is the only sport where you can end it early. Right?

162
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.980
Like football goes the distance.

163
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.620
<v 3>Right. Three or four. Yeah.</v>

164
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.280
<v 0>Four hours. Yeah. Baseball goes all the innings. It's like,</v>

165
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:07.820
that's just how it goes. Yeah. But fighting can end in 10 seconds.

166
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:12.440
We've had fights that have ended. I think, well, who's got the record now.

167
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.580
It was Duane Ludwig. But that's what I took it, I think. Right. That's right.

168
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.580
Mom's fidelity eight seconds. But it was like, it's not really,

169
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.550
I don't even think they gave it a, I think they said it's five, but I think it.

170
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
<v 3>What do you do at the live event? Everyone's just like, all right.</v>

171
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:31.280
<v 0>Well, it is 12 fights. Gotcha. So that was just one fight out of many, many,</v>

172
00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:32.690
many, many fights in the Moscow.

173
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.783
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

174
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.160
<v 0>If you ever watched one live, not.</v>

175
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.080
<v 3>Live, but on TV, you should go.</v>

176
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.910
<v 0>I'll get you tickets, Google crazy.</v>

177
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.880
<v 4>Are you, are you not traveling because of this?</v>

178
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.013
<v 0>I'm not changing.</v>

179
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.290
<v 4>Yeah. See that's my wife asked me a lot. Like she,</v>

180
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.380
she was really concerned about me coming here and um, I was like, dude, we go,

181
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.273
we got to sell a game.

182
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.980
<v 0>I just got back from Vegas. And I was a little nervous while I was over there,</v>

183
00:08:55.981 --> 00:09:00.900
but I did everything normal. I went to work out. I, I, you know, I ate, uh,

184
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.340
went to the fights, which is, you know, 20,000 people at the T-Mobile arena,

185
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.310
all stuffed into this one area and everybody was acting normal.

186
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:11.820
Everybody was high five and a hug. And then fighters. I mean, Jesus Christ.

187
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.800
When I'm talking about people exposed, you know,

188
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:17.010
they're sweating and they're half naked Tyson. Fury's.

189
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.040
<v 4>Trying to lick that dudes blood. I mean, I don't think he's worried before.</v>

190
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.550
<v 0>That was before the big outbreak. Yeah. I I'm.</v>

191
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.330
I'm worried about old people. I'm worried about my parents. For sure.

192
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.330
I'm worried about, I'm worried about people who were overweight. You know,

193
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:34.830
I have friends that are not healthy that maybe she'd lose some weight and I'm

194
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:37.740
worried about them. I'm worried about people with respiratory problems,

195
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:38.574
you know, um,

196
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.750
a good friend of mine has a daughter who has cystic fibrosis and he canceled his

197
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:47.640
tour. Shout out to Everlast. He canceled his tour because of that. I mean,

198
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:50.010
but he's got, you know, a real concern. I mean, his,

199
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.370
his daughter has a pretty serious lung condition. That is really scary.

200
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:56.100
Horrible. Yeah. And so look, you know, he's got no choice.

201
00:09:56.101 --> 00:09:58.560
He has to stay home and play it safe.

202
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:02.250
And I think a lot of people are going to do that. You know? Um,

203
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.680
it's gonna be interesting to see how the government handles it because one of

204
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:06.210
the things about love or hate Trump,

205
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.300
he's willing to do some that's a lot of people would think it would be

206
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:12.660
unpopular, like closed down traffic. Yeah. Closed down, uh,

207
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:13.830
flights coming in from other,

208
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.490
other countries that are infected that have high rates of infection. You know?

209
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:20.970
I mean, uh, I wonder what they're going to do and something,

210
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.710
I think something really radical has to be done to try to start this slow down

211
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.460
the S this illness, but I don't know what they can do honestly.

212
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.850
<v 4>Are we waiting for it to, I got to watch your show with the sky.</v>

213
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.090
Are we waiting for it to go away? Like I read a quote that like,

214
00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:38.730
when the weather changes it'll it'll stop or something.

215
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.150
<v 0>That's horseshit. Yeah. Um, Michael Oster home, uh,</v>

216
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.430
set of straight on that that's nonsense. He's like,

217
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.540
that's not going to have any effect on it.

218
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:49.530
What happens is it just runs through the population and people develop immune

219
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:53.040
systems that can handle it. You develop an immunity once you catch it.

220
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.970
And for many people, it's just going to be like a bad cold for many people.

221
00:10:56.971 --> 00:10:59.310
It's going to be like, you're coughing and you're and you just,

222
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.540
you just try to get better, stay home, drink a lot of fluids, be healthy,

223
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.380
do your best and, uh, eat healthy and then get out.

224
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.370
You're going to have an immunity to it. And that's, what's going to happen.

225
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:16.170
On the other end, I saw one guy, um, he had it and it was fairly mild.

226
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.150
And then the quarantine and he got over it,

227
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:19.680
he was getting over it and getting better.

228
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:22.260
And then they quarantined him with a bunch of people that also had it.

229
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.200
And then he got it even worse, which interesting. Cause I was like,

230
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:26.430
wonder how he got it again.

231
00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:29.490
And I guess probably his immunity wasn't fully developed yet.

232
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.090
And then it just overwhelmed his, uh, immune system. Cause there was, you know,

233
00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:35.400
he's basically quarantined with a bunch of other people that were really,

234
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:36.234
really sick,

235
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.930
but he got through it and he was talking about it and all these poor people that

236
00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:41.730
are stuck on boats. Oh my God.

237
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.773
<v 4>It's crazy.</v>

238
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.200
<v 0>This is going to kill the cruise ship industry. Yeah. I guarantee you that.</v>
