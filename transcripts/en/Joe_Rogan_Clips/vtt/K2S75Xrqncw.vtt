00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.560
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. And then he has a good time debunking things,</v>

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.840
but he has an official story. Mentality is what I would call it.

3
00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:10.720
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; where no matter what,

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.800
like there's people that are objective and there's people that are debunkkerers

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.200
and he's a debunker and it doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong about a lot of

6
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:19.380
stuff,

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.750
but it does mean that he goes into things with the intention to debunk and the

8
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:27.510
intention to almost always gravitate towards an official store that almost.

9
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.830
<v 1>Yeah, every single he, who would wonder if there' been a times he,</v>

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.150
Lee Harvey Oswal.

11
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.310
<v 0>Acted alone. Yeah. That's a goofy, come on, man. That one's.</v>

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.610
<v 1>Goofy.</v>

13
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.470
He believes tower seven collapsed a free fall speed because of fires.

14
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.340
There's.

15
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.140
<v 0>A lot of people that believe that. Unfortunately, I'm not a engineer.</v>

16
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.780
I would like to know no whether or not it's possible to burn a building so bad

17
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.180
inside that it does collapse like that. It's impossible.

18
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.820
<v 1>I don't know if that's true. It's it's no, no. It's it's it.</v>

19
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.340
All you have to do is talk to engineers and architects. I've talked to them.

20
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.500
You could, you could, you.

21
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.380
<v 0>Could talk of them.</v>

22
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.810
<v 1>That's the thing. There's no, there's no architects that it, uh,</v>

23
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.730
outside of NT, a government agent agency,

24
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:09.370
there's no architects fighting for, uh, um,

25
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.850
to debunk the tower seven there's none and every, okay.

26
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.810
<v 0>I don't know if that's true. You do. I don't know if you know that theres like,</v>

27
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.971
but AR there's,

28
00:01:18.971 --> 00:01:21.890
there's gotta be some architects and engineers that don't think that that

29
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.920
building fell because it was demolished.

30
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.680
<v 1>Look. No. Well, if you understand how it's it,</v>

31
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.120
there's about a hundred thousand architects and engineers in the associations,

32
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:33.960
like the American association of architects.

33
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:38.480
And there's about a hundred thousand and, uh, Richard gage,

34
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.030
he's one of them and he didn't know anything about, he thought it was a,

35
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:45.110
it wasn't an inside job. It took him years.

36
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.270
And then he didn't really know about tower seven.

37
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.590
Most of them don't know about tower seven, what he does now, he discovered it.

38
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.950
And what he does now is just go from, uh, convention to convention,

39
00:01:55.951 --> 00:02:00.430
sitting 15 architects down at a time. And boom, about 99% of them,

40
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.780
they all believe it. They didn't even know there was a, a third tower.

41
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.780
It was not in the media that much. They basically.

42
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.740
<v 0>Ignore that. That's crazy. I think by this time,</v>

43
00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:11.380
everybody knows about tower seven. They still don't know. Most.

44
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.340
<v 1>People don't know. I think no, but they don't. You don't,</v>

45
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.140
they don't talk about it on, on the mainstream media. How could anybody know.

46
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.820
<v 0>People? People have talked about it enough online to the point don't think,</v>

47
00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:19.060
but now.

48
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.260
<v 1>More than ever, but still now more than ever. Yes, they go.</v>

49
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.890
They hear about that tower seven, but they don't really know the details.

50
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:26.410
They just kind of just know about it. You know?

51
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.970
<v 0>Did you ever see the video that shows the full collapse,</v>

52
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.930
which takes a lot longer? You see the, the first collapse,

53
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.210
it was the top of the thing falls into the center-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it

54
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.410
that's the elevators.

55
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.930
<v 1>It happens. Yeah. They explain architects and engineers. I've sat with them.</v>

56
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.810
I'm a know structural engineer, but you tell common, what did they say to you?

57
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.840
This is what's. It's someone told you if someone told you, uh,

58
00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:50.440
there's 85 columns that hold up tower seven mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

59
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.440
And if someone told you of a structural engineer told you,

60
00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:56.240
would you think he was crazy? Or would you believe him? If he said,

61
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.640
and it makes sense. I mean, it's common sense.

62
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.040
The only way you're gonna get a building to come down like that.

63
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.640
Any building any structure is you have to blow up all 80 columns at the same

64
00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:10.120
time. Otherwise it won't go down like that. To me,

65
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.240
that's common sense to someone who believes N the government agency said, no,

66
00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:15.940
that's not true.

67
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.590
One column went and then it spiraled out of can troll because of fires.

68
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.350
When you talk to structural engineers, I've had,

69
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:26.110
I've had Richard gauge on my podcast twice. Every time he comes back,

70
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.510
he gets more, he just piles on more. He goes, all I gotta do is sit him down.

71
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.390
They don't know. Nobody knows.

72
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.870
<v 0>That's the truth. See, has he ever debated someone?</v>

73
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.190
Who's like an opposing viewpoint? Nobody will debate.

74
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.060
<v 1>A detector, structural engineer. Nobody's this is what.</v>

75
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.100
<v 0>He people would though. It's.</v>

76
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.260
<v 1>No, because when they look into it, it's common sense.</v>

77
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.220
Anybody knows you have you.

78
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.980
<v 0>So you think that they know that it's not true. They think,</v>

79
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:51.820
they think that power tower seven was an inside job and they don't wanna debate

80
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:54.140
it. Cause they can't win. Do you really think they think that? No.

81
00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:57.380
Say that again. So you think that people that are debunking it, so like, if you,

82
00:03:57.381 --> 00:03:59.220
if he's got this opinion that there's.

83
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.890
<v 1>No AR architects and engineers Debu, it, it that's already plugged into that.</v>

84
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.930
That's already been, that's already been done and set, but there's gotta be.

85
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.970
<v 0>Architects and engineers just disagree. Mm-m come on, man.</v>

86
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.330
You don't think there's any people that.

87
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.730
<v 1>Find a video of a real, not a government, a government agency.</v>

88
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.450
<v 0>Jamie. See if you can talk doesn't that.</v>

89
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.280
<v 1>But doesn't that make sense? What a makes sense of, of, of a,</v>

90
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.360
an engineer told you a struck a dude who builds skyscrapers,

91
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.880
told you to your face, like I've been told in my face.

92
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.200
They said the only way that they, and you see it on video engineer,

93
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:33.640
after engineer, after engineer, are they all crazy?

94
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.920
The engineer engineer after engineer to go it's impossible.

95
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.030
When you look into it, it's impossible for a building to like that.

96
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.270
Unless all 80 columns are blown up at the same time.

97
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.830
<v 0>We we've covered this, but here's things mean it's common sense. I don't,</v>

98
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:48.910
I don't know anything about engineering.

99
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.110
I don't know if you have diesel fires that get outta control.

100
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.150
If it weakens the entire structure where it just collapses like that.

101
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.990
I don't know if.

102
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.230
<v 1>Possible. Well, what, what would you, if you have,</v>

103
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.700
you have guest all the time that are experts in fields that you' experts in.

104
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.700
But when you sit here.

105
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.100
<v 0>I find out sometimes they're wrong too. Unfortunately, no, sometimes I,</v>

106
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.140
I let a guy ramble about some stuff and then they find out that they're making

107
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.140
some of it up or that some of the on signs, this is like.

108
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.420
<v 1>Does happen. No, but this, but an engineer, a guy who builds,</v>

109
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.980
I understand this is right. Doesn't it make sense, Jamie?

110
00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:20.220
Doesn't that make sense? Google.

111
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.050
<v 0>Like, try to figure out like who resists architects and engineers?</v>

112
00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:25.690
Like what is it I'm reading right.

113
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.690
<v 2>Now? An article from the Boston globe that talks about truth.</v>

114
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:31.530
Theres nine 11 and Richard gauges talked about.

115
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.330
<v 1>And I think they they're gonna hold on.</v>

116
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.770
<v 2>Don't just talk. They might have interviewed him in.</v>

117
00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:36.450
Then I'm trying to figure out what they see, what they're talking about.

118
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.560
<v 0>There's gotta be some there's campaigns that have had a conversation or a debate</v>

119
00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:45.640
with someone I, someone what i'm''t couldn't possibly have fallen any other way.

120
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:45.910
Okay.

121
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.520
<v 1>Okay. Maybe they're out there. There's my.</v>

122
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.480
<v 0>Documentarys. I dunno know, here's the thing. I don't know. Like,</v>

123
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:52.520
I don't know how my computer works. I don't know. But how do you know.

124
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.440
<v 1>Anything then? Who constructs? How do you know anything? A lot of, you know,</v>

125
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:56.274
a lot of, but.

126
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.200
<v 0>Know. But if somebody wanted to argue with.</v>

127
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.360
<v 1>Me about the components and how they worked on a, a laptop,</v>

128
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.040
I would have to look, go, wow, you're probably right.

129
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.360
I'll have to talk to some computer engineer.

130
00:06:06.361 --> 00:06:08.880
Who's gonna tell me the actual reality of it. I've talked to more than one.

131
00:06:08.881 --> 00:06:10.280
I' seen to build buildings. I've.

132
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.440
<v 0>Had 'em on my pocket. I'm sure. But I just can't believe that seen,</v>

133
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.240
I seen all of the people that build buildings. Think it's an inside job.

134
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.950
If what.

135
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.070
<v 1>If 90%? Okay. What if 90%? That would be pretty impressive. If,</v>

136
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.790
if 90% that'd be pretty impressive. It was a, uh, uh, 50.

137
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.990
<v 0>That would be impressive. Exactly. It's 50% would be impressive.</v>

138
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:29.030
It's about in the nineties. I don't know if that's right.

139
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.430
So I don't know where you get in that number. I'm getting it.

140
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.670
<v 1>From Richard gauge. Who's the head of.</v>

141
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.470
<v 0>Architects and engineers for nine 11 truths. Yeah. And.</v>

142
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.940
<v 1>A year they add another couple. I understand. But you know, that keep.</v>

143
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.420
<v 0>Adding, but he might be a little biased, right? I mean,</v>

144
00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:44.860
if he's the head of architects and engineers from nine 11 truth,

145
00:06:44.861 --> 00:06:48.260
and he tells you that 90% of the architects and engineers out there think it's

146
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:50.380
an inside job. It might be a little biased.

147
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.540
I don't know if that's true and I don't think you do necessarily either.

148
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.300
I think we're, we're just guessing. I believe it.

149
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.220
<v 1>All. I would love to.</v>

150
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.450
<v 0>See. I would love to see,</v>

151
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.330
see an architect or an engineer that disagreed with him.

152
00:07:01.331 --> 00:07:04.730
Talk to him about it and go over the data. Cuz until that happens,

153
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.930
I don't know what the they're talking about. No.

154
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.810
<v 1>Nobody argues with him. Nobody.</v>

155
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.730
<v 0>De debates, but that's gotta be, there's gotta be someone who debunks that guy.</v>

156
00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:14.770
Everybody debunks everybody. No, they definitely.

157
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.330
<v 1>A smear campaign. Are you kidding?</v>

158
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.851
<v 0>Right.</v>

159
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:20.520
But is it a sear campaign pain or is it just that they're saying things that

160
00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:22.160
he's saying that aren't correct. It's not.

161
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.880
<v 1>Just him. He's just one. I understand. He's one of many it's common sense, dude.</v>

162
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:26.880
It's maybe. Okay.

163
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.720
<v 0>It's just like, right. But I don't know.</v>

164
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.440
I don't know anything about making buildings and the only anything about what it

165
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:34.800
takes for a building to collapse. I don't know. Totally.

166
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.670
<v 1>I don't know either. Maybe it got hot. I believe it. It's.</v>

167
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:40.503
<v 0>Not just hot. It's.</v>

168
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.390
<v 1>I believe diesel fires. I wanna believe all that.</v>

169
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.270
<v 0>Tanks of gas. I wanna believe in the basement.</v>

170
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.630
<v 1>I wanna believe that I wanna believe that fires made it hot and I don't wanna</v>

171
00:07:48.631 --> 00:07:51.510
believe they blew it up cuz that's, that's scary. I wonder,

172
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.910
I wanna believe the fire.

173
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.870
<v 0>If a fire is in a basement and the fire has diesel fuel and it's burning</v>

174
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.860
at some insane, but you in these, loads of diesel fuel down there.

175
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.460
&lt;laugh&gt; I wonder what effect that has. I don't know. Do you.

176
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:06.340
<v 1>Uh,</v>

177
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.100
I I'm pretty sure based on my life's experience that that's not gonna bring down

178
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.020
a building of a diesel fuel life experience based on common sense.

179
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.980
It's common sense that yeah. If a building, if,

180
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.050
if a building's gonna fall at free spot, fall speed, boom. Like that.

181
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:25.530
If a engineer after engineer, after engineer, at some point,

182
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.450
I'm gonna believe them at, at some point. I'm not.

183
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.010
<v 0>Gonna, I understand Eddie, but I don't,</v>

184
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.890
I don't know if you've necessarily looked into engineers that disagree.

185
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.250
Have you? I.

186
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.130
<v 1>Know, I know there's a smear campaign theres. Okay.</v>

187
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.210
<v 0>But have you looked into the engineers that disagree? There's.</v>

188
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.840
<v 1>None. There's none. There's no doc, there's no documentary. There's gonna be,</v>

189
00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:45.000
there's no documentary, but a documentary find a documentary. If there is,

190
00:08:45.001 --> 00:08:45.834
what about just article.

191
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.960
<v 0>There? Do they have to make a documentary for it to make sense? What was that?</v>

192
00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:51.200
What if it's an article? What if it's a peer reviewed paper?

193
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.520
What if it's some sort of a, those.

194
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.320
<v 1>Are all dude. That's a smear cam. There's that side.</v>

195
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:57.400
There's the elite that don't want this out.

196
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.600
And then there's people trying to get the truth out.

197
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.000
So the elite have the control of the media. So what, how are you going to,

198
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.200
they have paid shields on you don't think you think that they dropped,

199
00:09:08.201 --> 00:09:09.560
they would've dropped the ball big time.

200
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.440
Like Ernest bner in 1987 for the Browns. They would've dropped the ball.

201
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:18.070
If you're not. If you don't have paidhills online strategically,

202
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.830
uh, pushing the agenda. Come on. Okay. They're all are whatcha.

203
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.750
<v 0>Pull on that. Jamie, what.</v>

204
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.750
<v 1>Are we about to pull up? There's a bunch of fake on him. What.</v>

205
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.583
<v 0>Jamie I'm lost.</v>

206
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.190
<v 2>I was, I was stuck on this, uh,</v>

207
00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:29.950
Richard gauge thing that I was trying to debunk to see if anybody's debunking

208
00:09:29.951 --> 00:09:32.150
him. Uh, I'm looking at Twitter.

209
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.830
<v 1>Are the engineer that care. Hold on, dont, talk him.</v>

210
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.840
<v 2>I'm looking around.</v>

211
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.140
I'm just looking around the Boston globe article says that there's a small vocal

212
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.780
subset of people of engineers that are with this, uh, Richard gauge guy.

213
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.020
<v 0>That's what I had read. I never read that. It was like some overwhelming number.</v>

214
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.660
Just keep, keep sternm I'm digging. It's it's hard. Cause it's fun.

215
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.163
It's exciting.

216
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.490
It's excitinging to think that there's some sort of a Gigantical of super

217
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.450
geniuss that are run the world and they decided to blow up tower seven.

218
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.090
You know, what's.

219
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.370
<v 1>Funny about the moon. tower seven, Jesus. Believe it or not.</v>

220
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.250
I don't even talking about the U seven, you know, at all, you know or not,

221
00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:10.210
you know, what's crazy about the moon. What is the hardest

222
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.610
ever accomplished? The greatest by the human race?

223
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.560
The greatest accomplishment ever was landing on the moon. Right? Right.

224
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.640
So you would think holy balls. I don't think it is no what? Listen. Okay.

225
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.920
Okay. But let's just at the time, at.

226
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.960
<v 0>The time, think that internet is the.</v>

227
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.800
<v 1>Biggest. Okay. Okay. But I'm just talking about like a physical achievement,</v>

228
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:37.180
three dudes, they got shot up in a rocket.

229
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.140
They were in a,

230
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.620
like a orbiter and then the orbitter shot out the lunar,

231
00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:46.620
like the lamb. And then it lands, they played golf, went doom,

232
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:51.340
bug riding the donuts in the sand. They get take pictures. They get back in,

233
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.683
take off

234
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:59.290
dock with that orbiter and then back that's the hardest

235
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.210
ever. No one died. &lt;laugh&gt; and do, can you imagine,

236
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.770
can you imagine that second mission? Six months later, they did it again. When,

237
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.450
when they had to break the news that,

238
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.570
that they were gonna use different astronauts.

239
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.050
Cuz every mission they use different astronauts. Wouldn't you think they would.

240
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.730
<v 0>Like a show? Like have the same star over and over now? No, the.</v>

241
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.800
<v 1>Three dudes have pulled it off. Keep.</v>

242
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.240
<v 0>Doing it. They dude, are you kidding? They did it before. Yeah,</v>

243
00:11:22.241 --> 00:11:25.640
but they don't wanna keep doing it. What if it you up? What if do it? What if,

244
00:11:25.641 --> 00:11:26.410
what if, what.

245
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.600
<v 1>Think Scott? What if they were planning on using buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong,</v>

246
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.160
but they just got like egos and.

247
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.840
They started going to clubs and clocks and they were like, you know, coats.

248
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.790
They wanna renegotiate their track.

249
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.830
Cause they probably went to the moon for like, you know,

250
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:44.390
70,000 dollars&lt;laugh&gt; you know what I mean? They got that government check.

251
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.350
They go, we'll get you. They that they get you on the second album or,

252
00:11:47.351 --> 00:11:50.790
or on the second? Uh, just like the record business. You know what I mean?

253
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.920
I bet you, the first album didn't even make that much. They of course say,

254
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:54.920
listen, we'll get you on that.

255
00:11:54.921 --> 00:11:57.560
Second on the second and third landings spot &lt;laugh&gt;

256
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.160
do you know much money you're gonna make, you're gonna come back.

257
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.120
You're gonna be famous. You're gonna be doing all sorts of press.

258
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:08.400
Think about the. Think about the Coke, all that. Wow. They,

259
00:12:08.401 --> 00:12:11.760
they probably got blown out and got too cocky and wanted to renegotiate.

260
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.870
Oh my and then NASA said, we just gotta go with some new dudes &lt;laugh&gt; they.

261
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.590
<v 0>Made $8 per diem.</v>

262
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:22.910
&lt;laugh&gt; when uncle Sam you raw dog. He uses sand.

263
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.350
Uncle Sam uses broken class on his Dick when.

264
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.830
<v 1>He raw dogs. Think those guys went to the moon. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

265
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.670
<v 0>Why, why wouldn't you think they was the night? Once.</v>

266
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.660
<v 1>Come on that dude in the middle,</v>

267
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.180
the dude in the middle dude in the middle didn't actually go to the moon was,

268
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:39.100
was hovering in an orbiter.

269
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:43.140
He was hovering in an orbiter and they landed some little piece of,

270
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.100
uh, lunar, Lander, the land. Right.

271
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.500
And then they took and they show the only time ever,

272
00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:53.260
they got one shot of it taking off and whatever was filming it,

273
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:55.290
fall it all the way up. Yeah.

274
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.970
Like who was remote control on a timer. Yeah, no, no.

275
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.690
There was a live remote control.

276
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.970
That's what they said that they could control from, from earth, from Houston.

277
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.530
&lt;laugh&gt; for sure that works.

278
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.650
<v 0>Dude. I could get my cell phone to.</v>

279
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.250
<v 1>Work on Laurel moon. The moon landings are so</v>

280
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:19.360
ridiculous. Oh there's video of them.

281
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.000
Like just maybe a hundred thousand feet in the air and they're like filming it,

282
00:13:24.001 --> 00:13:27.240
making it look, you know, they're manipulating. What the. Come on.

283
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.640
That video is strange. That's the damning. I've never seen anybody.

284
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.310
<v 3>And.</v>
