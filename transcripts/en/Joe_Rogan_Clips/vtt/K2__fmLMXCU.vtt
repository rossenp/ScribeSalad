1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.240
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um, a lot of the film was reenactments as well.</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.600
You know, like, uh, when James was sitting there with the knee braces on,

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.560
that was not after his surgery. Well.

4
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.280
<v 1>I, I thought he was vegan in like 2011 or 12 or.</v>

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.080
<v 0>Something when he he's in the film, when they're filming him,</v>

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.880
he's sitting there doing his research. Well, don't,

7
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:23.910
I don't think filmed him while it was happening back.

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.910
<v 1>In 2012 after the injury. I mean,</v>

9
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:29.550
this is like one of the things that I thought was well done about the film was

10
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.630
that they took someone James on the,

11
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:36.470
kind of the journey of starting as an omnivore and then, you know, having this,

12
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.670
these realizations and turning into a vegan.

13
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.980
But the problem was that journey happened long before the film was made.

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.020
Exactly. Exactly. So that was a little disingenuous. Well.

15
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.900
<v 0>That's why I'm saying he's sitting there with those knee braces on and he's</v>

16
00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:52.780
going over his research and just happened to have a camera crew there while he

17
00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:55.220
is learning how to heal himself. And I'm like, Hey man,

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.420
I know what you're doing.

19
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.460
<v 1>I don't know. I mean, that's a narrative devices. It's good filmmaking. Well.</v>

20
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.170
<v 0>Even the rope thing, even the rope thing, I mean,</v>

21
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.730
I'm watching him do the rope thing at the end. Like, whoa, boy, I'm done,

22
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.570
you did an hour, bro. If you did an hour,

23
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.850
you'd be drenched with sweat and you'd be exhausted. You wouldn't, you, you,

24
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:14.410
they sprayed you or something like, but this is fine.

25
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.170
I believe he really did that. I don't believe he's a liar, but like.

26
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.970
<v 1>I mean, he, like you said, he's clearly he's theatrical, he's athlete. Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.600
And ripped and you know, super capable. And this was a,

28
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.360
uh, you know, an agenda driven film.

29
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.920
It was it's meant to persuade and convince people. Well.

30
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.040
<v 0>That's why it's weird because that's clearly acting,</v>

31
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.720
you're recreating these moments, but it's.

32
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.320
<v 1>Built as a it's it's marketed as a documentary.</v>

33
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.710
<v 0>Cuz he's talking about it.</v>

34
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:46.630
Having just happened right after he switched over to a vegan diet,

35
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:49.470
all of a sudden he could do an hour on the battle ropes and then they're filming

36
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:52.710
them. Yeah. I'm like, come on, man.

37
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:56.950
There's no camera crew when that happened. You're redoing this. Yeah. You think,

38
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.470
I mean, I get it. This is how you show the footage.

39
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.460
You put it out there and it makes it like a little bit better for people able to

40
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:05.900
swallow and get, you know, and I,

41
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.700
I like the scenes of him doing the self defense demonstrations cuz you get to

42
00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:13.820
see, he truly is a, a fantastic martial artist. He really does know his stuff.

43
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:16.580
Absolutely. There's a lot of great aspects to that. Like I said,

44
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.460
I like that guy a lot, but there's a lot of fuckery in this movie, man.

45
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.810
<v 1>So I mean a couple of the most for day things from the movie, um,</v>

46
00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:30.370
we can get to. We can get to. Good take. So slide,

47
00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:33.850
slide 64. Uh, you probably remember this this morning.

48
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.130
This was the guy who's like in Africa.

49
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.690
He was a former special forces sniper I think. Yes.

50
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.050
And he says this whole fantasy, we need to eat meat to get our protein.

51
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.160
It's actually. I mean, look at a gorilla. Gorilla will you up in two seconds.

52
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.040
What does a gorilla eat? Uh, I just do the same things. These big,

53
00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:55.000
great things out here that we're trying to protect elephant and rhino. Yeah.

54
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.200
Well that's just, it's a nonsensical argument. You know what will you up?

55
00:02:58.201 --> 00:02:59.440
Even faster than the gorilla,

56
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.520
a human who has a gun that eats McDonald's and KFCs &lt;laugh&gt; I'm serious.

57
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.720
And what is a gun? It's a tool. How did we develop tools?

58
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.280
Cuz we started eating meat and fish and we came down out the trees and we

59
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:14.120
weren't spending more than half of our waking hours,

60
00:03:14.121 --> 00:03:17.840
eating leaves and low calorie fruits. You know,

61
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.470
don't like comparing our digestive.

62
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.710
Like what we should eat with a gorilla is just Aine. That's a.

63
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.750
<v 0>Problem because they, they bring that up all the time.</v>

64
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:30.430
They say we have the same digestive gut tracked as an

65
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.390
herbivore. That's just not.

66
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.790
<v 1>True. Also just objectively false. Yes. You know, the, the largest,</v>

67
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.090
the for a gorilla,

68
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.980
the largest volume of adjustive tract is in their large intestine,

69
00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:43.620
which is ideal for breaking down tough foods, you know,

70
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.940
fiber seeds and those kinds of plant foods. Whereas in humans,

71
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.420
the largest volume of our digestive tract is in the small intestine,

72
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.020
which is better for absorbing nutrient dense bioavailable foods like meat and

73
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:00.330
cooked foods, cooked tubers and things like that. Yes. You know,

74
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.490
gorilla in order to get the amount of protein that gets them strong and rip,

75
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.450
they eat 40 to 60 pounds of food a day and they're eating for more than half

76
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:12.650
of their waking hours. So it's really, you know,

77
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.490
that's just not comparable at all to compare us to.

78
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.850
<v 0>We have different jeans.</v>

79
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.480
It's the same thing when they're talking about OXS like strong as an ox. Uh,

80
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.600
there's a MTA issue, right? Yes.

81
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:28.080
There's the genes are programmed to carry more muscles. So.

82
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.560
<v 1>Yeah. That's Patrick booming. He, you know, people ask me,</v>

83
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.280
how did you get strong as an ox, without eating meat.

84
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.040
And have you ever seen an ox eating meat? Well, I say,

85
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.630
have you ever seen a human with six different stomach standing in a field

86
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.190
eating, you know, grass for 14 hours a day? &lt;laugh&gt; right. That's ridiculous.

87
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.510
It is ridiculous. It's not ridiculous. It's like I, to me, those, those damage,

88
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.870
the credibility of the movie.

89
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.430
<v 0>Oh it's just sound bites. That sound cute. Like people go, yeah.</v>

90
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.830
You ever seen an Oxy that eat what a gorilla eats. That's what I do.

91
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.750
I know know, but I.

92
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.100
<v 1>Mean, I just, I right. It, it, just to me though,</v>

93
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.420
that's like the quality of the argument being made. It, it,

94
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.580
it really does just no.

95
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.940
<v 0>One there like you to dispute it, that's the problem, you know,</v>

96
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.140
that's why I bring you a board.

97
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.140
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; I mean, and then there was the anthropologist woman.</v>

98
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.140
You remember that scene in the end where she,

99
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.580
that that's where I really started roll my eyes cuz she was making the arguments

100
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:22.730
that humans have always followed a plant-based diet. Did you,

101
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.890
do you remember that part silly. Okay. So, um,

102
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.410
or to start with that. So I mean we've got, um,

103
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.610
isotope studies that show that humans have been eating meat for at least two and

104
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:34.350
a half million years.

105
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.490
And if you go back even before we are really actually human, um,

106
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.320
there's a lot of evidence now that our Chimp and ancestors were also eating

107
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:44.100
vertebrates.

108
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.480
And one of the biggest shocks for people has been the observation that chimps

109
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:53.120
hunt and they kill other an monkeys and other animals and eat them.

110
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.720
I mean, it kind of blew apart like this whole idea of primates only being,

111
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.680
um, you know, eating plants. And if that happened, if, if an, if a,

112
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.720
if an animal evolves complex behavior like hunting or tool use in order

113
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.400
to eat certain food, it means that food has a,

114
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.720
a lot of value or else that EV that behavior wouldn't have evolved.

115
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.510
Um, but then we have bone collagen studies. Um,

116
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.950
let me see if I can find this slide, Jamie.

117
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.150
So that's 47 and 48. So these are bone collagen.

118
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.750
Isotope studies are much more accurate than some of the previous methods that

119
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:37.340
were used and, um, the, the earliest hos study,

120
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.740
but these were neandertals.

121
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:42.060
So there's three studies that have been done in Neandertal groups ranging from

122
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.900
130,000 to 28,000 years ago.

123
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.180
And then they compared those isotope levels with contemporary species and they

124
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:53.620
found that neandertals were similar to top level carnivores.

125
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.650
So they all derived the vast majority of their protein from horses likely to be

126
00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:02.090
large herbivores. And then on the next slide, 48, why.

127
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.450
<v 0>Does it have, hold on a second back up?</v>

128
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.890
Why does it have a te Dal flying in the background?

129
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.050
Why are they bullshitting us?

130
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.290
&lt;laugh&gt; does those things live 60 million years before?

131
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.423
That's so stupid?

132
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.410
<v 1>You know, there's a limit to what stock photography can.</v>

133
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.960
<v 0>I know, but all you have to do is snip that aren't out. You.</v>

134
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.000
Why do you have a guy walking on two feet with a piece of meat on a stick?

135
00:07:24.001 --> 00:07:25.280
Good stick of meat. Yeah. That's.

136
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.960
<v 1>So stupid. And he's obviously not in Neander tall too. The skull.</v>

137
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.240
<v 0>Is the wrong shape. Yeah. The skulls, the wrong shape, right? Yeah.</v>

138
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.880
So that's double crazy. So that's a homo SAPN, which is only 500,000 years ago.

139
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.670
That's gold stock photo.

140
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.790
<v 1>Well, let's talk about homo SAPN. So, so there were,</v>

141
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.750
there were go on the next slide. There are two, two, uh,

142
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.350
stable isotope bone collagen studies that have been done with modern humans,

143
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.790
homo sapien sapien.

144
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.950
And the first group was 13,000 years ago in Southern England.

145
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:57.230
And the second group was 30 to 40,000 years ago on Lockette, which is in France.

146
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.580
And they also found, um, that they were predo, you know, carnivores,

147
00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:03.980
mostly larger herbivores,

148
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:08.100
but the French group consumed a more diverse mix of protein, including seafood.

149
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.140
So the fossil record clearly clearly indicates that humans were eating,

150
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.340
you know, humans and Neander, you know, homo sapiens and Neanderthals.

151
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:19.810
All of our Haid ancestors were eating a lot of meats. She.

152
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.890
<v 0>Wasn't using any evidence to cite this either.</v>

153
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.770
<v 1>Was she, she was using that lame anatomical argument that we have, you know,</v>

154
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.530
relatively flat molars like herbivores do. And we don't have claws.

155
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.370
We don't have sharp canine teeth. Right. But guess what? We've got forks,

156
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.090
we've got knives and we've got fire, we've got fire to cook our.

157
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.040
<v 0>Food. Yeah. And we have for a long time.</v>

158
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.720
<v 1>You have these adaptations that make those anatomical, uh, uh,</v>

159
00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:48.240
characteristics that a lion or, you know, or,

160
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.760
or OUS animal has unnecessary for us. I mean, that's,

161
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.600
that's just like anthropology 1 0 1. Right. So I, I don't. So.

162
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.440
<v 0>They just found someone who's vegan. Who's also an anthropologist.</v>

163
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.800
<v 1>One anthropologist. And then they rewrite the whole history of, you know,</v>

164
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.160
animal food consumption among hoed.

165
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.280
<v 0>Yeah. And the argument that human beings over 2 million years ago,</v>

166
00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:13.520
the doubling of the human brain size corresponds with the, the learning,

167
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.150
how to hunt consumer meat.

168
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.430
<v 1>Of tool marks on bones corresponded directly with the doubling of brain volume,</v>

169
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.070
the reduction in our gut volume,

170
00:09:21.071 --> 00:09:23.630
which indicates a move to a more nutrient dense diet,

171
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.550
the increase in the volume of our small intestine relative to our large interest

172
00:09:27.551 --> 00:09:31.190
intestine. And then what's called the ization of our jaw,

173
00:09:31.191 --> 00:09:34.350
which means our teeth and jaw became less robust.

174
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.100
And that's thought to be an adaptation to more digestible nutrient dense

175
00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:43.020
bioavailable food where we're not like chewing cut or yes. You know,

176
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:46.580
chewing on leaves or low calorie fruit, like a gorilla is all.

177
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.540
<v 0>Day. And this argument about nutrient density, this is why this, that,</v>

178
00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:54.180
that term is very important because people always want to use that for

179
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:56.650
plant-based food, nutrient dense plant-based foods.

180
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.930
Meat is far more nutrient dense per calorie, per ounce,

181
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.090
poor amino acid profile.

182
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.570
<v 1>With essential nutrients. Yeah.</v>

183
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:11.210
So essential meaning nutrients that we can't manufacture on our own and that we,

184
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.370
and that we absolutely need, uh,

185
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.840
organ meats are actually at the top of the list terms, you know,

186
00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:20.840
in terms of nutrient density, organ meats and shellfish take the cake. Um,

187
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.920
then you have herbs and spices are actually pretty high too.

188
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.000
And then you have other, you know, muscle meats, eggs, all of those things,

189
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:32.600
foods like grains and lagoons are tend to be towards the bottom of the list,

190
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.760
you know, with vegetables and in the middle. Right.

191
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.030
<v 0>But that sound good. Nutrient dense plant-based foods sounds good.</v>

192
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.350
It sounds like you're doing the right thing.

193
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.270
This is like where this lingo is coming from. I mean, this is.

194
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:49.270
<v 1>Where I argue that plants do belong because plants do have certain nutrients,</v>

195
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:54.110
phytonutrients, um, fibers and things that, that actually don't feed us,

196
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.630
but feed our gut floor that I do think are important, right.

197
00:10:56.631 --> 00:11:01.300
Even though they're not considered essential, like vitamin B12 or vitamin a,

198
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.020
you know, uh, vitamin D or something like that,

199
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
I do think they're still important and they play a.

200
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:06.440
<v 0>Role.</v>

201
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.460
But what I'm talking about is a difference between caveman altering its diet or

202
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.900
the modern or ancient man altering their diet and this doubling of the human

203
00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:18.730
brain size corresponding with me more nutrient dense foods.

204
00:11:18.731 --> 00:11:21.210
What that means is meat. Yeah, absolutely.

205
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.090
<v 1>Meat, fish and fish. First,</v>

206
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.850
as we saw with some of the modern humans who are living in coastal regions. Yes.

207
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:30.530
But these more bio bioavailable, nutrient dense foods. Definitely.

208
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.250
<v 0>Now what, what other silliness?</v>

209
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.600
So this is the anthropology argument that just doesn't seem to fit and of

210
00:11:38.601 --> 00:11:40.040
the state of the art science doesn't.

211
00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.080
<v 1>Fit. Yeah. It completely contradicts.</v>
