1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.560
<v 0>You know, there was a molester at my church.</v>

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.600
We had a priest that was a molester named father. Holohan shocker.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.600
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; wait a minute. Is it a Catholic church? Shocker. What the, man?</v>

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.400
You can't trust anybody? And.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.680
<v 0>The kids, we used to call him happy hands Holohan cuz HED always. Oh,</v>

6
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.360
he just Christ. Cause whenever he come up, he'd always like wanna wrestle you.

7
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:21.510
But he was the last kind of guy. He was a nerd. He was, he was like an,

8
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.710
he's not a wrestling type guy. Right. He wasn't a.

9
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.910
<v 1>Rapist was just, but.</v>

10
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.750
<v 0>He would always, he'd always come up like, Hey, I'm like,</v>

11
00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:29.230
like why are you doing it? You're just trying to grab me. Yeah.

12
00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:32.430
And so we would call him happy hands Holohan oh. And we would get in trouble.

13
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.910
If, if, if our parents heard us or don't judge disrespectful to the like,

14
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:40.550
you know, he is grabbing our. Right. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. So they finally, uh,

15
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.980
they finally caught 'em and I don't know why I started talking about this,

16
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.020
but uh, yeah. Why did I start talking about this? Um, oh, I know,

17
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:52.140
because we're talking about I George, we always had George TEI.

18
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.740
We always thought it was like, it was up to you to not get molested by him.

19
00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:59.700
Like if you got caught and we would laugh, right. It was,

20
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.650
we would laugh at kids who got caught at a kids. Yeah.

21
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.970
<v 1>So we gotta run faster &lt;laugh&gt; he would take us. That's.</v>

22
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.690
<v 0>So sad. He would take us, he had a, a summer house, right.</v>

23
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:12.930
With a boat and up in Wisconsin. Right.

24
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:15.370
So he would take us and it was like an hour and a half away.

25
00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:16.690
We'd get in his station wagon.

26
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.450
He'd take like six boys up to there and we're gonna go water skiing or whatever.

27
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.360
Right. Um, so he had the day set up.

28
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.160
Where once you got there, you had to first do cleaning.

29
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.200
So you had to change into your cleaning clothes. Yeah. Oh Jesus.

30
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.160
And so every time we had to go in the room and change,

31
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.640
he would find a reason to come in the room and wrestle one of us. Oh God.

32
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.840
And then we were like, all right, we gotta put up with it.

33
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:43.390
Cuz we wanna go in his boat. You know, we were poor &lt;laugh&gt; Oh my God.

34
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.470
We're poor. You know, we grew.

35
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.470
<v 1>Up. Isn't it funny how it's only funny if it's you like you're allowed to laugh</v>

36
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.150
about getting molested as long as it's you. Yes.

37
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.990
You know like no one could say like you like he, well, he,

38
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:57.750
Jimmy was on the Joe Rogan show and he was laughing about cha molestation.

39
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.790
Oh my God. Was that, is that true? Hate speech. Put the blanket on it.

40
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.300
Hate speech. But no, it was, he was, he was talking about him getting molested.

41
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.300
Um, well he's normalizing sexual assault.

42
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.060
<v 0>He would take us, this priest would try to teach you how to ski, you know?</v>

43
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:16.180
How do you teach them? How to water ski? You put your Dick.

44
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.180
<v 1>In their mouth. Boy, your.</v>

45
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.140
<v 0>Dick in their mouth. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

46
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.940
<v 1>Do you know how to breathe under water here?</v>

47
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.890
<v 0>It's you're we go now, hold your nose. &lt;laugh&gt; no spitting.</v>

48
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.650
&lt;laugh&gt; so he, the way you teach someone how water skis,

49
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.250
you put water skis on them and then he'd sit there on the dock and then you pull

50
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:36.850
away. Right. Uh, and that's how you learn.

51
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.050
So he would take us in shallow water and then he would go,

52
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.010
he would put the skis on you. So you couldn't run away from him. Oh God. And I,

53
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.960
and he would like put his hands. Oh my God.

54
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.520
He would put his hands underneath your crotch, like this from, to pick you up.

55
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:50.800
And then he goes, now when the boat pulls,

56
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:52.720
it's gonna pull you up like this and it's gonna, and then it's.

57
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.880
<v 1>Gonna jerk you off. And the only way to CA you gotta catch it in your mouth.</v>

58
00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.953
&lt;laugh&gt;.

59
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.560
<v 0>And so it was what the man.</v>

60
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.480
And so we looked at it like it was your job to get out of that situation. Oh no.

61
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.360
And if you got caught, we'd all laugh at you. I remember my, our friend,

62
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.400
my friend, Danny he's in the, you would laugh. We laugh he's oh my God.

63
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.000
We see he's in the shallow water and he's going now,

64
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:20.910
if the boat pulls you and he goes like this and looks at us and he goes &lt;laugh&gt;

65
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.990
he goes, oh no. And we're laughing. He in front of everybody. Yes.

66
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.470
And we're laughing and laughing.

67
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.990
<v 1>Now, did he actually molest anyone other these inappropriate touches? No.</v>

68
00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:33.470
He molested.

69
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.150
<v 0>People. Oh boy. He had to leave the church and all that stuff. Oh, did he.</v>

70
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.150
<v 1>Leave the church to he just.</v>

71
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.500
<v 0>Move them? No. Dis him. He, he went to Arizona for a sabbatical. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.660
He's got, he needs our prayers at this. They sent out a note,

73
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.340
like a letter to everybody's house who was in the, you gave money.

74
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.620
They give you a letter. Was it.

75
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.740
<v 1>Here? No evil. The documentary where they, you know, there was one priest that,</v>

76
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.780
um, Benedict who became the Pope moved,

77
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.090
who went on to molest a hundred deaf kids. Oh no.

78
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.610
Oh no. Yeah. Horrific, horrific. Ah, that, that,

79
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.050
that process of moving people was always

80
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.610
terrifying because they basically let them know, Hey,

81
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:16.090
you're not even gonna be punished to this. We're just gonna move you.

82
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.130
I'm just gonna move you. Yeah.

83
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.200
<v 0>That's all we do. That's yeah. Doesn't I know. I don't understand.</v>

84
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.280
<v 1>Terrifying, terrifying stuff. Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.200
<v 0>Why isn't the FBI infiltrate the Catholic church. Yeah. Imagine.</v>

86
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.360
<v 1>I, I did a joke about it on stage a while back, I was like,</v>

87
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:33.000
imagine if that many NASCAR drivers were kids,

88
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.720
how quick would they shut down? NASCAR. If NASCAR pulled into town, just.

89
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.960
All the kids and drove around a circle real quick. They'd be like,

90
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:43.750
we gotta shut this down. This is a crazy organization. But meanwhile,

91
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.990
way more people are getting molested by the Catholic church.

92
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.230
<v 0>I, I couldn't agree.</v>

93
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.630
<v 1>More. And it's a terrifying number.</v>

94
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:51.470
When you look at the numbers of people that have just accused them of,

95
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.430
of sexual assault and molestation, it's terrifying.

96
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.990
<v 0>Yeah. It's terrifying.</v>

97
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.950
And all the money they take that you give them on Sunday to go pay these people

98
00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.843
off is also.

99
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.580
<v 1>Yeah. I feel very fortunate that I ducked that I got lucky.</v>

100
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.100
I was outta Catholic school. Oh, you went to Catholic school. Yeah.

101
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.180
For one year only. But in first grade I was gone after first grade. And uh, I,

102
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.380
you know, I had friends that stayed and I know, I knew people that got touched,

103
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.260
you know, it's just, it was it's it's for people who outside the Catholic faith,

104
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:22.330
people who are it's, there's something that, that happened.

105
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.690
And it probably happened when they told 'em they couldn't get married anymore

106
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.170
because it used to be, the Pope could get married.

107
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.770
The Pope was allowed to have children.

108
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.970
And the priests were allowed to be married.

109
00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:34.890
Priests were allowed to have children, but they were rock stars.

110
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.730
You have to realize like back in the Lutheran days,

111
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.290
the days of Martin Luther and those, those guys were everybody,

112
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.120
they would get at you in that confession, you know,

113
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.600
in the confession would tell me what you did, Dolores.

114
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.800
And dolos out there just sucking all day. Show me how you sucked at Dolores.

115
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.400
I mean, they were banging everybody.

116
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.440
And then they came up with some sort of a reason why they should have to be

117
00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.600
celibate and from then on, well.

118
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.680
<v 0>So here's what hap here's what I heard. What happened was that.</v>

119
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:07.520
So there was two ways to become nobility. And the medieval times you could be,

120
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.400
uh, born noble or you could get in, you buy your way into the church. Oh.

121
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.760
And so you could become nobility.

122
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.440
And so what would happen is these rich who would buy their way into the church

123
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.390
would die. And then all their money would go to their kid.

124
00:06:18.391 --> 00:06:20.230
They're firstborn mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And the church is like,

125
00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:22.270
we gotta get some. We gotta get our hands on that money.

126
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.470
And so they passed the law. Hey, nobody can get married. Legally. They all did.

127
00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:29.470
They still had kids and. And they still had Myres and whatever,

128
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.390
but when they died all their money and property went to the church.

129
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.950
That makes sense. And so of course it's all about money.

130
00:06:34.951 --> 00:06:37.980
So that's the story I heard. If, if anybody heard, did I believe it's both.

131
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.780
<v 1>I bet it's.</v>

132
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.980
I bet it had something to do with sex as well and preventing those guys from

133
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.500
everybody, you know, cuz they were rock stars.

134
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:46.060
There was no rock stars back then.

135
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.820
So the guys that they were the spokespersons for God,

136
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.220
would most likely be the ones who had the most influence in the community.

137
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.740
I mean, yes. There was a kid that we went to school with who was, uh,

138
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.490
clearly gay, nice guy.

139
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.170
And he was gonna become a priest when we were on high school together.

140
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.170
So as we were like riding the bus, going to high school,

141
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.370
he was like a couple years ahead of me. And he was uh,

142
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.050
leaving school and he was already on his way. What is it?

143
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:14.770
Divinity school or seminary school. I think seminary, I think, yeah,

144
00:07:14.771 --> 00:07:16.690
he was on his way and we were all like,

145
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.400
we were all calling him father already and it was just ridiculous.

146
00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:23.880
We were all accepting. The fact this guy was gonna be a priest, but you know,

147
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.800
for him it was, he was so obviously gay that, you know,

148
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.360
I mean, I didn't give a, but I knew you could tell he's gay. He's a gay guy.

149
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:38.200
He never had any interest in girls. Never was around them. Kind of uh,

150
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.110
just an oddly feminine man and uh,

151
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:45.590
decided to take up the priesthood and we all, you know,

152
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:48.270
treated him like he was different because he was gonna become a priest.

153
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:49.950
It was very weird.

154
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.220
<v 0>Yeah. There, you know,</v>

155
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.870
priests are still treated like rock stars in the Catholic church today.

156
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.150
<v 1>I mean, you know yeah. And he was, meanwhile,</v>

157
00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:58.950
I was just another 16 year old kid just like us, you know,

158
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.340
maybe he was 17 at the time. And I think I was 15, but it was just,

159
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.700
he wasn't any different than us,

160
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.740
but we were calling him father and stuff and it was just so strange.

161
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.820
<v 0>I had two uncles that went to the seminary who one of 'em became a priest.</v>

162
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.620
And the other one, uh, over the summer, uh,

163
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.500
had a friend who got pregnant and he had to stop being, get dropped outta some.

164
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.490
Wow. But when you went to my grandmother's house,

165
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.330
as you walked up the steps into their living room, the two pictures,

166
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:30.370
she would have greeting you was a picture of both her sons and their priest

167
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:33.090
outfit. So one was actually a priest and one had to cook another,

168
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.210
but they that's the picture. She kept up.

169
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.130
The guy's bringing over his four kids to her house.

170
00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:39.690
There's the picture of him and daddy. Why are you in the priest outfit?

171
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.613
<v 1>One point in time.</v>

172
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.280
<v 0>So, so yeah. That's um, are you, are you still religious?</v>

173
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:50.320
Do you still go to church? No. Okay. No, I, I go because my,

174
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.960
I go to church for a Baptist church in Pasadena because my,

175
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.240
my mother-in-law goes and she wanted, she asked me to go, oh well that's,

176
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.640
it's probably fun. And I said, okay, I'll go. I'm being.

177
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.920
<v 1>Protested by the Westboro Baptist church tomorrow. Are you? Yes.</v>

178
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.320
Where in Kansas city? Oh, I'm very.

179
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.120
<v 0>Excited. Oh, that is, ah, I've always wanted to be protested. Very excited.</v>

180
00:09:07.121 --> 00:09:07.400
Good.

181
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.560
<v 1>For you. Put out a press release and they even responded to, uh, my, my, uh,</v>

182
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.950
I put out a post and they had a tweet, someone who has idea,

183
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.830
but what God wants is speak and for God. Ah, cause I, I said that if God,

184
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:22.710
you know, if there is a God, they said I was an atheist, which I I'm really not.

185
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:27.790
I mean, I don't consider myself anything. I don't consider myself religious.

186
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.510
I'm not an atheist. I'm just a person who doesn't know. And I, I don't,

187
00:09:31.511 --> 00:09:34.510
that's called agnostic, I think. Right. I'm more agnostic than anything,

188
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.380
but I don't don't even want to put a label on it.

189
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.620
Why should I have to be on someone's camp? You know? Right. This I, my,

190
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.260
my opinions are allowed to evolve and I'm allowed to,

191
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.300
and I've done a lot of drugs. I've seen some that I can't explain, you know?

192
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.580
And psychedelics man will, they'll get you,

193
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.580
whatever confidence you have that there's no, God,

194
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.380
you go through a DMT trip and you come out in the other end. You're like, okay,

195
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.410
maybe I don't know what the I'm talking about. Maybe I don't know anything.

196
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.690
And that that's, I'm in the, maybe I don't know anything camp.

197
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.530
So I said that if there was a God, I don't know if there's God,

198
00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:08.370
but if there was a, a God, he or she would probably be very disappointed.

199
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:11.890
These hateful tots, pretending they speak for him, putting up signs to say,

200
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.370
God hates Fs. Like you really think this is what God would want.

201
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.480
That's out ages.

202
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.240
<v 0>And so that's what they're upset about that you said, said that I.</v>

203
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.720
<v 1>Speak for God. Oh, but they could speak for God. Yeah. They see God hates facts.</v>

204
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.960
I'm see. They're written anywhere. &lt;laugh&gt; look to the Bible.

205
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:29.240
Never says God hates facts. That's their website is God hates fags.com.

206
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.760
Just stop and think about that. I think.

207
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.880
<v 0>They should take their Facebook page.</v>

208
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.520
<v 1>Away. Do they have a YouTube channel?</v>

209
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.910
I west pro Baptist church have YouTube channel.

210
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.310
<v 0>But yeah, but don't, don't you, I mean, don't speed speech.</v>
