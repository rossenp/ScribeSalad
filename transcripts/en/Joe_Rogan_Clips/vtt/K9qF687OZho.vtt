00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.800
<v 2>And then that brings us to Lazard depiction of how these</v>

3
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:10.920
things worked, that they somehow, or another Ben gravity,

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:14.490
these things that he worked on, which is the model that's on the desk.

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.930
There that's a supposedly a detailed model of what that thing looked like,

6
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:21.120
that he worked on the sport model. I think they called it.

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.200
That's where he called it. Yeah.

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.180
When you watch him talk and you hear him give his description of his time

9
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:30.300
working there and what he saw and what he thinks those things are,

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.620
what was your take on that?

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.280
<v 0>I thought it was curious and interesting. I mean, I've been to area 51.</v>

12
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.600
I didn't see any flying saucers or any thing like that.

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.450
I saw, uh, defense department, uh, uh,

14
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.740
experiments being performed and training activities and that sort of thing,

15
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.020
nothing that the taxpayer would, uh, uh, object to. But,

16
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.050
uh, but it's a big range. There's a lot of stuff going on out there.

17
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:03.270
And there's a lot of adjacent ranges. Uh,

18
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.960
if you look at the mass action where he was, that's what he said. Yeah.

19
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.590
I found his explanations curious. Um,

20
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.550
how so the complexity of it, uh,

21
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
and the fact that he talked about Laurenti M for example,

22
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:21.900
and then decades later, it turns out that, um,

23
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.770
apparently there is a more stable form of that then element.

24
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.603
<v 1>One 15.</v>

25
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.100
<v 0>Sounds right. I couldn't tell you for sure.</v>

26
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.020
<v 1>That sounds like something for Battlestar Galactica. You know, we need.</v>

27
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.610
<v 0>All this stuff, you should do that. Right. Right. So, uh,</v>

28
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.020
now I I'm a little skeptical about his claims. I have to say, um,

29
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.870
friend of mine, uh,

30
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.660
claims to know that the gal who was his supervisor when he worked out there and

31
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:56.610
knows what he was, was actually doing and where he was located, uh,

32
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.810
and claims that, uh, that he was a guy who checked radiation on badges.

33
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.650
<v 1>That's it? Yeah. And so, uh, all the rest is fiction.</v>

34
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.040
<v 0>According to that story, and.</v>

35
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.770
<v 1>This is a person that, you know, yeah. Maybe that person's full of.</v>

36
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.100
<v 0>Maybe I don't have the ground truth on this,</v>

37
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.810
but he did falsify as educational records and

38
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.280
he's been involved in some other things. And, uh, and it just, doesn't.

39
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.030
<v 1>You talking about that MIT records? Yeah. He explained that to me.</v>

40
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.680
He said that he was working on something for the government at,

41
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.510
and they sent him to MIT to learn

42
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.940
something. And he, I can't say too much,

43
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.640
I'll tell you off air because he told me not to talk about it,

44
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.430
but it makes more sense when you hear his description of it.

45
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.290
That essentially it wasn't documented that he was studying there

46
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.610
because what he was doing was really a terrible thing,

47
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.720
a terrible experiment they were working on. When I explained to you,

48
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.100
maybe it'll make sense. Okay. Maybe not though. Maybe he's full of.

49
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.440
Maybe he lied about that. What's interesting though,

50
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:10.060
is he's told the same exact story since the late eighties

51
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.940
and he doesn't seem full of. Now.

52
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.510
Some people are really good at lying and, uh, you know,

53
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:18.250
I've been tricked before and I'm sure you have to,

54
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:20.770
there's some people that are just sociopaths are really good.

55
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.410
<v 0>Yeah. They don't even like, know their line.</v>

56
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.320
They're like convinced in their own head while they're spinning. He's.

57
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.460
<v 1>Honestly, though,</v>

58
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.270
he's obviously very intelligent and he obviously knows a lot about science.

59
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.010
He knows a lot about propulsion systems and,

60
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.090
and he really did work at Los Alamos,

61
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.480
which is interesting because he's actually on the employee roster.

62
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.230
And they tried to say that he didn't, he knew people that were there.

63
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:47.200
He knew the layout of the building. When he went there with George Knapp,

64
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.310
they went through the building.

65
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:51.460
He knew exactly where everything was and he knew the people that worked there.

66
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.590
So he really did work there,

67
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.540
apparently allegedly his story what's interesting to me

68
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.750
is that again, it's the same story over and over and over again.

69
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.850
And then what's also interesting to me is that he knew and took

70
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:11.740
friends to a place where they were testing these things out and he knew

71
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.130
where it was and he knew when they were doing it.

72
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:18.340
And he brought his friends out there and that's when they got arrested. Yeah.

73
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.830
<v 0>It's a very, uh,</v>

74
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.520
I think there's some consistency there that is hard to explain.

75
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:27.640
How would he know where to go and what was going on? Um,

76
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.240
there are some possible answers to that. I've poked into this a bit. Um,

77
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.250
supposedly there was a bar off base where the scientists and a lot

78
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:38.200
of the aviators and people go and hang out,

79
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:42.940
he was a frequent frequent at that place and picked up information. So,

80
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.860
you know, I, I hear stories on both sides of this. Um, I don't know what the,

81
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.210
what the ground truth is. And, um, uh, I I'm,

82
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.750
I remained skeptical, but you know, Hey, there's a lot of crazy.

83
00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.580
<v 1>I enjoyed his company. I went to dinner with him and Jeremy and, uh,</v>

84
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.640
I talked to him for several hours, uh,

85
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.720
on the podcast and off the podcast. I, uh, I don't know, you know,

86
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.860
I don't, but it's, it's a weird one. Cause he never made any money doing that.

87
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.840
Never made any money telling that story.

88
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.140
<v 0>I'll tell you another story offline. We can exchange stories offline.</v>

89
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.210
<v 1>I'm excited. I can't wait for this to be over now.</v>
