00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's like, did you see that in India?</v>

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:08.370
The monkey stole the Corona virus samples from the left? Yes.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.080
<v 1>It's only a gang of monkeys that were like, give me that. And it gave it to him.</v>

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.980
But the funny thing is they didn't get into it. So they actually were to keep,

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.910
they were able to keep the specimens and tax, which is kind of crazy. Yeah.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.800
<v 0>Oh, what is it? I wonder what the monkeys thought it.</v>

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.280
<v 1>Was. I don't know. They were probably just like, well, the way they're holding,</v>

8
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:27.210
it looks important.

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.490
<v 0>Yeah. Well they do that apparently.</v>

10
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.180
And then you can give them food and they'll give it back to you to make deals.

11
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.930
Yeah. Oh yeah. They make deals depending on the monkeys,

12
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:37.860
depending on the territory,

13
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:41.820
but it you're used to deals with people that's so yeah. Are they're so smart,

14
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:45.210
man. They're like really dumb people. Yeah. Yeah.

15
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.580
<v 1>Which is saying a lot. It's crazy. I'm like.</v>

16
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.270
<v 0>Dumpy because they'll, did you see the one where the monkey ran? Uh,</v>

17
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.430
use the motorcycle and rode up to the baby and stole the baby? What?

18
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.230
Oh my goodness. Jamie, this must pull this one up, bro.

19
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.710
It is the crate. I don't, I think it was, I don't want,

20
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:05.520
I want to say Indonesia on a leash.

21
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.350
I don't know if you noticed that he was on a leash.

22
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470
Somebody had a like by that's how I came back so fast.

23
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.090
<v 1>Oh, but it was odd. It was traveling though. It was like.</v>

24
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.130
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.690
The monkey rode a motorcycle down this alley to these people that were sitting

26
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:26.100
there, grabs a baby and starts dragging the baby away. Watch this here. It goes.

27
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.360
See here's the monkey on the motorcycle. Hold on. Do it from the beginning.

28
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.520
<v 1>He did rode up on.</v>

29
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.100
<v 0>A motorcycle, but do it from the beginning so he could see it.</v>

30
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.740
Watch that seat on the motorcycle pulls up, jumps off,

31
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.270
grabs that baby just grabs him and pulling the baby away. I mean, first of all,

32
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.010
how strong are monkeys?

33
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.910
<v 1>Uh, yeah, they're really smart. I like how casual the dude is though.</v>

34
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:54.870
The guy is like, Hey, try not to have your monkey. Take my baby away.

35
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.340
<v 0>Jimmy. Where do you see this leash? I don't see it dragged away. No,</v>

36
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:00.390
the monkeys getting dragged away. It's not walking away.

37
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.500
<v 1>Oh.</v>

38
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.570
<v 0>Oh the monkey it's getting drugged.</v>

39
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.501
<v 1>Oh,</v>

40
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:08.070
it's just holding its he's holding on to the baby and he's being tried a hundred

41
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:08.430
percent.

42
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.910
<v 0>Sure. I it's not walking away with the baby.</v>

43
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.940
<v 1>Yeah. Because he's being yanked and he's trying to go for the kids.</v>

44
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:18.870
So the guy is trying to probably get them away from the kid. That's insane.

45
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.420
And that's probably why the guy is so casual too. I mean,

46
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.550
they still don't know why it's being casual about that, but wow. That what the.

47
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.900
<v 0>That.</v>

48
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.480
<v 1>Is so terrifying. And you know that kid's going to grow up and go like, yeah,</v>

49
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:32.310
that happened. You know, a lot of stuff happens.

50
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.520
<v 0>Because otherwise how the would a monkey know how to ride a motorcycle?</v>

51
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.160
If somebody had to teach to get mocked? Definitely.

52
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.210
<v 1>It's not like monkeys going like, gosh,</v>

53
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.900
someday I can't wait to ride a motorcycle. And maybe.

54
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.700
<v 0>The monkey saw it's a small motorcycle too. Right?</v>

55
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.670
It's like a little kid's motorcycle. Like probably electric.

56
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.810
If someone saw like a monkey saw person do something,

57
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.200
monkey could probably copy it. Like they sure, sure. There's a photo.

58
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:57.450
I don't know if you've ever seen it, but you can see monkey do that's.

59
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.830
<v 1>Stuff's good, right? Yeah. This stuff was really yeah. Kill clips.</v>

60
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.090
<v 0>The. Yeah. 25 milligrams of CBD and it's delicious. Um,</v>

61
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.850
there's a photograph of a famous photograph of, uh, of a rang,

62
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:08.860
a tan that is spear fishing.

63
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.000
And it learned how to do it by watching people look at this monkey.

64
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.850
Whoa, he's getting after it. Oh.

65
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.460
<v 1>Oh my gosh. That's so cool. Wow. That's so rad.</v>

66
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.870
<v 0>Um, it's an Asia and Indonesia. So it is Indonesia where I think that's what,</v>

67
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.660
what they were saying. The other one was, um,

68
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.130
see if you can find the photo of the orangutan that's uh, spear fishing.

69
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.140
So it's hanging from a branch with a spear and sticking it into

70
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.310
the water, stab a fish,

71
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.060
just like it seen humans do because that's how the people fish there. Right.

72
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.500
So they rang times like, huh, thank God that I think I got it. Wild orangutan,

73
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.610
spear fishing.

74
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.560
<v 1>That's so crazy to me. Well, they've.</v>

75
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.950
<v 0>Said that they believe that primates, particularly some,</v>

76
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.160
some monkeys are and some chimps are in the stone age.

77
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.230
<v 1>Now. I see. I see. I see. They're.</v>

78
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.350
<v 0>Starting to use tools like they're entering into the stone age. See,</v>

79
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.640
look at that photo. Wow. How dope is that? Whoa,

80
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.860
that's crazy. Oh, that's amazing.

81
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:12.200
Look how he's hanging with his feet and his hands. Yeah, man.

82
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.690
Just stabbing into the water.

83
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.390
<v 1>The fish plant of the apes man. is happening.</v>

84
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.130
<v 0>Well look, we got to think, I mean, if you believe in Evolut evolution and I do,</v>

85
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.130
I do too. We were that.

86
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.570
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. We were some, we were some form of that. Some form of that,</v>

87
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:31.660
something happened, something happened that caused us to divert.

88
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.340
<v 0>If they start talking to us.</v>

89
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.140
<v 1>I don't know. But you know,</v>

90
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.020
some day we're going to figure out some kind of a computer that's able to like

91
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:42.310
read every tiny micro-movement and interpret it into words,

92
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.240
you know? And there'll be like mood and then like words and like, oh,

93
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.690
I think it's saying this and it's just going to get better and better and

94
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:50.200
better.

95
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.830
<v 0>Well, what was that gorilla that they taught sign language. What's her name.</v>

96
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.980
<v 1>Is that Jane? Jane Goodall. But she, the one,</v>

97
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.220
she was the one that she is sign language with a primates.

98
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.590
<v 0>But there was one that was really good at it. And.</v>

99
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.500
<v 1>That this, oh, in the, in the zoo.</v>

100
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.790
<v 0>I don't know because in the zoo, if it was in some sort of a research center,</v>

101
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.600
but there was one gorilla that could really talk up a storm,

102
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.070
like had like pretty profound Coco that's right. Oh yeah.

103
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400
Coco had conversations with sign language.

104
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.860
<v 1>That's so heavy. I know.</v>

105
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.310
<v 0>Yeah. Look at this. Oh, Robin Williams hung out with her Rogers.</v>

106
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.050
Mr. Rogers. Imagine. Wow. Look at her. Look at the head.

107
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.610
<v 1>I mean, imagine if you're mad at me.</v>

108
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.960
<v 0>We're seeing the humanity. No. Oh, I'm going to blow you away.</v>

109
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.970
There was this one weird champ that they were really confused about it.

110
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.300
They actually thought it might be a hybrid between a human and a champ,

111
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.660
because I want to say this was like the fifties or the sixties.

112
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.140
It was really freaky and this lady kept it.

113
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.830
And I think they eventually had to bring it to some sort of a rescue center

114
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:04.130
because it developed like a very unhealthy sexual relationship.

115
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.140
But this lady wanted a and was real jealous of other people coming by.

116
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.230
Which is yeah. That's what happens with crazy. Of course.

117
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.090
<v 1>Territorial. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

118
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.420
<v 0>They say that's what happened to that lady that had that big champ in</v>

119
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.720
Connecticut. Remember that when it bit, her friend's face off,

120
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.380
her friend was blocking. Whoa.

121
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.980
And she might actually that Chimp because she used to sleep in the bed with it.

122
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.380
And she gave that Chimp Xanax and red wine,

123
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.530
which probably not.

124
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.040
<v 2>Humana. I can't find accuracy of it.</v>

125
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:42.740
It says there's an unsuccessful. Excuse me. Unsuccessful. Attempt to.

126
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.300
<v 0>Create such a thing. No, no, no. It's it is not. It's just a Chimp.</v>

127
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.770
It's just a weird look and chat.

128
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.790
But one of the weird parts about it is that it liked to walk on two feet.

129
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.260
You like to walk on two feet and it looked like a person.

130
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.110
It looked like a person a Chimp. Yeah. Look at him. Oh, wow. Dude. It's creepy.

131
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.510
Yeah. Get a look.

132
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.650
<v 1>Oh yeah. I have seen a picture. It's creepy of this.</v>

133
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.820
<v 0>Person. Go to that one on the far to go to the far, the second row.</v>

134
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.630
Second to the far left. That's a black and white one. Oh, this one. Yeah.

135
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:20.960
That one. Look at that one. What in the man? Wow.

136
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:23.420
That is one of the things he say his name was Oliver. Yeah.

137
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.230
That's what it's saying. Yeah. So it's name was Oliver, but look at a weird,

138
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:31.010
the weird facial expression, particularly in that one image. Now,

139
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.730
as he got older, he looked more and more just like a Chimp,

140
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.440
but one of the weird things about him,

141
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.040
see if you can find a video of it all over the humanity. Um,

142
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.940
he used to walk on his back feet, so it was real creepy.

143
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.970
And so that's part of the reason why there was all the speculation that maybe it

144
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:48.080
was like some sort of a hyper.

145
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.280
<v 1>Oh, it makes sense that there would be like definitely a, um,</v>

146
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.060
there's gotta be outliers, you know, because so much genetic information is,

147
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.690
is shared between like all of the animals on the planet, including us.

148
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:04.580
And we have bits and pieces of all of it. So, oh my gosh. Interesting.

149
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.210
Weird. Yeah. It could be an outlier. Yeah.

150
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.750
<v 0>Yeah. Well they did a DNA test on it because it had a very, um,</v>

151
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.040
bald face as well,

152
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.430
which is one of the other reasons why I think they had some speculation,

153
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.760
there were some human in it, but uh, they found out I was just a Chimp,

154
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:20.863
just a weird champ.

155
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.670
<v 1>It's just, yeah, just like a, yeah, just a unique self. So bizarre.</v>

156
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.510
Yeah.

157
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.620
<v 0>Super strange. But I mean, you got to think if human beings,</v>

158
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.390
they think in this form that we're at,

159
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.430
we've only been around in this form for somewhere in the neighborhood of 200,

160
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:41.690
50,000 to 450,000 years or something like that. They don't really know.

161
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.840
But I think on the short end it's like quarter million years.

162
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.620
<v 1>Oh no. I mean, it's weird. If you look at the evolutionary,</v>

163
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:53.150
like the lines we just go, yeah. It's just a departure. Something,

164
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:57.120
something happened. I know I personally, you know, favorite thing,

165
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.800
it's my 90%. I always go to the 90%. I'm 10% wrong,

166
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.350
but I'm also 90% pop probably.

167
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.390
<v 0>I mean I'm high, I'm a hundred percent.</v>

168
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.470
<v 1>Yeah. Something, some may Liam, I mean mushrooms or aliens, you know,</v>

169
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.790
I think so. You know, they're,

170
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.010
they've probably came from other places in the universe.

171
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:16.560
There's probably a bunch of life lichens, you know,

172
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.760
they're like hybrid fungus and molds, you know, that,

173
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.400
that work synergistically, whatever who knows. I mean.

174
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.380
<v 0>Well psilocybin can survive.</v>

175
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:29.220
The spores can survive in a vacuum so they can survive in the vacuum of space.

176
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.080
Oh man. They can survive in extreme temperatures and extreme, cold.

177
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.720
Interesting. So the idea of panspermia, you know,

178
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:40.470
that idea that building blocks of life came from asteroidal impacts, right?

179
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.480
They think that it's really possible that some sort of fungus

180
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.660
could exist on an asteroid hell.

181
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.620
We have chunks of the moon in Antarctica and other parts of the world where a,

182
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:56.370
some big asteroid hits or a meteor hits the moon,

183
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.360
a big chunk flies off it gets sucked into our gravity and slams into earth.

184
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.040
Yeah. And if that can happen and you can get some fungus on that, some sort of,

185
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:05.820
yeah. Some.

186
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.150
<v 1>Sort of spores. Yeah.</v>
