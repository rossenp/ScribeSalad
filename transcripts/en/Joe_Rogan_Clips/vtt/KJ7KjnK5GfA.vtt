00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.300
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, maybe not, maybe not. Um,</v>

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.410
hypnosis is powerful and I think stage hypnosis has done a great

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.843
disservice,

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.170
no disrespect to the stage hypnosis out there to detract from the power of

5
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:17.600
hypnosis as a medical tool and a high-performance tool.

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.050
<v 1>I, yeah, I, my own personal experiences that, uh,</v>

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.870
I didn't understand what hypnosis was. Um,

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.560
my first experiences with hypnosis were there was a guy named Frank Santos.

9
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:32.510
It's a famous in the Boston area. Who's a very famous comedy hypnotist.

10
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.450
And he was an actual hypnotist who would hypnotize people,

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.610
get them to quit smoking and things along those lines,

12
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:42.380
but then would do this comedy hypnotism show where he would get people on stage.

13
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.790
And man,

14
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.900
like we would walk me and a bunch of other comedians would go and watch it every

15
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:50.750
week because it was crazy. He would put them under,

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.300
they would definitely be under and they would think they were having sex.

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.160
They would think there'd be in a boat. They think they be in the water. They,

18
00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.360
it was weird. It was really weird to watch.

19
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:02.750
And I always just thought it was like really weak minded people.

20
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.320
My thought was an obviously 21 at the time. I didn't know anything,

21
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.060
but my thought at the time was okay.

22
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:11.600
There's certain people that are just have nine volt brains and you can trick

23
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:12.321
them into doing anything.

24
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:16.730
And that explains cults and a lot of other and tell evangelists and all sorts of

25
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.750
nonsense that you should be like really obviously fake to people,

26
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:23.390
but they fall into it anyway. And so that's what I thought.

27
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:26.180
I thought it was just really dumb people that he was tricking. People.

28
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.670
<v 0>Are more easily hypnotized than others and it's,</v>

29
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.050
it's actually pretty predictable.

30
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:32.600
There's actually a test that we could do right now. That will tell you. Yeah.

31
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.070
So can do it to me. Uh, yeah. I can use the one that, that Spiegel taught me,

32
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:37.431
which is,

33
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:41.030
so you look up at the ceiling and you're gonna look and now try and now close

34
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:43.670
your eyelids. Uh, you're not very hypnotizable.

35
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.620
<v 2>How's that? I look up one more.</v>

36
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.300
<v 0>Time and then close. Yeah. So probably not as hypnotizable. Um,</v>

37
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.710
so for people that are very hypnotizable, is that a word? Uh, yes it is.

38
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:59.270
Hypnotizable at least if it's not, then I, I I'm stamping it in nowadays.

39
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:02.120
I just I'll put a Wikipedia entry. It'll be there, but no, I don't know.

40
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.000
I I've heard Spiegel uses is affordable to hypnosis,

41
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.850
susceptible to hypno hypnosis. Um,

42
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.010
I asked Spiegel how you measure this kind of back of the envelope, you know,

43
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.570
curbside consult as they call it.

44
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.430
And people who are more hypnotizable their eyelids will flutter in an attempt to

45
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.264
go down.

46
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.830
The reason is that a lot of hypnosis is

47
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.490
anchored on the ability to go into these deep really relaxed states.

48
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.170
And some people's autonomic nervous system gets locked in a state of

49
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.940
more, excuse me,

50
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.300
of a more attention and kind of higher levels of alertness or levels of

51
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:45.710
sleepiness. So think about like a Seesaw. So you can either be really stressed.

52
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:48.020
So when you're really stressed, like you're analyzing time,

53
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:50.540
you're analyzing space differently, duration path, outcome,

54
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:53.090
what's going to happen. When's it going to happen? Real emergency.

55
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.860
The other state would be sleep, right?

56
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:58.190
That's the other extreme duration path and outcome are essentially nonexistent

57
00:02:58.191 --> 00:02:59.230
space and time are fluid.

58
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.480
Whatever that hinge in the middle of that Seesaw for some people is

59
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.600
very tight. They get locked over here or locked over there.

60
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:12.490
They can't get the energy or they can't distress hypnosis involves

61
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.450
taking somebody from a state of alertness like you and I are in now and bringing

62
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:20.650
them into a, almost sleep like state now for some people,

63
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.070
their autonomic nervous system, isn't that willing to do that.

64
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:27.850
It's almost like the hinge on that Seesaw is locked. It doesn't want to budge.

65
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.860
And this fluttering of the eyelids is reflective of a peripheral nerve.

66
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.980
Believe it or not, that's re that or originates in the brainstem.

67
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.820
That's a central part of the autonomic nervous system.

68
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.120
The other thing that they'll do you ever see on these stage hypnosis where

69
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:46.270
they'll have people look up at the ceiling and then they'll sometimes shine a

70
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:48.610
light in their eyes, or they'll like, have them look at a light.

71
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.030
I haven't seen that. They're looking at how, how we call it lay bile,

72
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:55.390
but how rigid or lay bile,

73
00:03:55.391 --> 00:04:00.310
how willing to move the pupils are because autonomic arousal impacts the

74
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.400
pupils of the eyes. So it's an external read of what's going on in the brain.

75
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.150
A lot of people don't know this, but your eyes are not connected to your brain.

76
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:12.070
Your eyes are brain that they are central nervous system and their brain,

77
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:17.050
your neural retinas that you use for seeing things around you are part

78
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.140
of the central nervous system. They are the way that, you know,

79
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:21.640
when to be alert and to be asleep.

80
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.480
And they are two pieces of brain that during development got squeezed out of the

81
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:28.270
skull and placed outside of the skull. Whoa. Yeah.

82
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.060
They're the only two pieces of your brain that are outside your skull,

83
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.490
assuming that you don't have some sort of damage that is crazy.

84
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.350
<v 3>Because eyes are a part of your brain.</v>

85
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.810
<v 0>Yeah. And that's why when people tell me, oh, you know,</v>

86
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:41.700
the eyes are the window to the soul. I'm my, well,

87
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.420
like I don't know about souls, but they are definitely your brain.

88
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.270
So when I look at you and now it's weird, cause I'm looking at, you know,

89
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:52.050
we're not looking at each other's pupils, right. But when the hypnotist,

90
00:04:52.051 --> 00:04:54.630
I should say, looks at the pupils, they're saying, you know,

91
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.230
the pupil size is a direct readout of, of that,

92
00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.940
of how loose that hinges.

93
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.220
So when they shine light in someone's eyes and they take it away and they go,

94
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.330
Hmm, that.

95
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.760
<v 1>Is so weird that you can look in someone's eyes.</v>

96
00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:07.260
And there's something about like,

97
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.860
you can kind of tell what kind of a person they are in some ways,

98
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:13.380
or at least tell how they're thinking. Like,

99
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:15.030
if someone's uncomfortable being around you,

100
00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:19.620
like you could see it in their eyes. If you tried to write that down, like,

101
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:22.770
what are you seeing? You try to explain it to someone with good luck,

102
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.530
good luck writing that down. I don't know what that is like,

103
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.330
but I know when someone's full of, right?

104
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.990
Like if someone's lying to me or bullshitting me, I'm not always aware,

105
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.120
but I'm aware a lot, you know? Well.

106
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.490
<v 0>Well, and it's not just their individualized,</v>

107
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:40.050
but it's also the way that they focus their eyes. So, um, you know,

108
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:42.690
the myth of the Cyclops, right? One eye in the middle of the head,

109
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.490
that myth has origins in the fact that the psych clop was one dimensional anger.

110
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.960
And it turns out that when we are experienced an increase in autonomic arousal.

111
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:54.270
So let's say, we decide, we're going to fight. We decide we're going to learn.

112
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:56.760
Or maybe even just, we're going to write something important.

113
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.990
Something's our eyes, the pupils change shape.

114
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.890
But because our eyes don't really move in our skull, they actually do.

115
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:05.660
What's called [inaudible] in a little bit.

116
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.780
They there's an eye musculature reflex that gets triggered in.

117
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.710
And so you can see that sometimes in people that are getting ready to fight,

118
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.110
their eyes are actually brought inward.

119
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.000
That triggers another neural circuit to increase levels of autonomic arousal and

120
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:23.780
starts deploying resources, internally fuel resources,

121
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:27.110
fuel for, you know, bouts of, of intense stuff.

122
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.320
Whatever that intense thing is going to be when we're relaxed,

123
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.980
like we view a horizon or we're just walking or we're in,

124
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:36.470
what's called optic flow and things are flowing past us.

125
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.800
We go into panoramic vision. So in panoramic vision,

126
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.320
you'd go out of that soda straw view of the world.

127
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:45.860
And you start being able to see the corners of the room, the ceiling, the floor,

128
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.900
and what's, and that's a relaxed state.

129
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.500
So sometimes we're even subconsciously perceiving how stressed or relaxed

130
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:54.830
somebody is not by necessarily their pupils, although that might play into it.

131
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.210
It certainly has a role,

132
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.500
but whether or not based on your prior kind of intuitive knowledge about that

133
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:00.950
person,

134
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.460
whether or not they're like Cyclops or whether or not they're in panoramic

135
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:05.450
vision. Wow.

136
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.130
And this is important because it changes the way we perceive time

137
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.750
if we are in Cyclops division. So to straw view that high intensity,

138
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.490
we tend to do two things.

139
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:20.180
One is we tend to be more in tune with what's going on inside us. We start,

140
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.090
you know, that the brain does this other thing, which is called interoception.

141
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:26.930
It's like paying attention to what's going on inside us versus outside us.

142
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.670
And when we're stressed time outside of seems to go really

143
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:32.720
slowly. It's like,

144
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:36.620
you're in the security line at the airport and you need to get your flight to

145
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:39.530
very different perception of the person in front of you and what they're doing

146
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:42.680
then when you're relaxed and you got plenty of time and that's because outside

147
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:46.250
events start to feel slower. This is why after a car crash,

148
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.650
people will say, you know, oh,

149
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.790
that everything was in slow motion or I've never actually looked at fighters.

150
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.630
But, um, I visited, uh, the UFC training center, Duncan, French. Uh,

151
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.020
I went out there and talked to him about this. He out to Dunkin. Yeah. He's,

152
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:00.800
he's done some bureau.

153
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.060
His graduate thesis is like this beautiful work related to this. Um,

154
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.880
although not directly, uh, has important implications for this,

155
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:10.220
which is when you're in these high adrenaline states,

156
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.990
you parse time differently. And when I hear about fighters, you know,

157
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:18.920
say like being able to time the fight or they it's almost like they can see

158
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:19.880
things coming in,

159
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:23.980
slow motion that's because their internal level is really,

160
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.600
really high, but it feels, feels like relaxation. So there's like sleepy,

161
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:31.810
not feeling so good. Everything feels like it's going on really fast.

162
00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:32.830
I can't deal with life.

163
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.340
Then you ramp up your level of intensity and everything outside you feels like

164
00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:38.620
it's going a little slower or maybe you're matched that. Like,

165
00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:41.440
I'm a pretty high intensity guy when I'm in New York. I feel great.

166
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.320
At least before the COVID thing, people walking down the street,

167
00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:47.860
I finally feel like the tempo is kind of matched between internal and external.

168
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:48.820
<v 1>Oh,</v>

169
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.740
is that why like those high functioning people enjoy Manhattan wide

170
00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:56.310
neurotic people. Like you take.

171
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.250
<v 0>A neurotic person, you put them in Manhattan. They're like, oh.</v>

172
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.880
<v 2>Yeah, yeah. They love it. Yeah. A lot of my friends that are neurotic,</v>

173
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.930
they love it there. Yeah.

174
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.580
<v 0>I come from neurotic lineage.</v>

175
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:09.660
I'm constantly trying to get to the other part of the Seesaw, but, but I get it.

176
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:09.811
You know,

177
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:13.710
I get out of the subway in New York and I'm like the walking speed that the

178
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:18.330
speed of everything, it just, I finally feel like internal to external match.

179
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.600
<v 1>Does this thing that the connects the fluttering of the eyelids to being</v>

180
00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:25.430
able to be hypnotized more easily.

181
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.300
Does that coincide with a personality variable?

182
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.610
<v 0>Not that I'm aware of. I'd have to ask David.</v>

183
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.590
I don't want to throw something out there. That's wrong.

184
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.520
I'd have to ask him there.

185
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.090
There's a whole set of personality traits and coping traits that relate to

186
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.250
hypnotizability. Um,

187
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.310
there's a small subset of people that just cannot be hypnotized. You can't,

188
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.540
you can't really force hypnotism on people visit.

189
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.840
<v 1>But they cannot,</v>

190
00:09:47.841 --> 00:09:51.890
or they are not willing to let themselves be because I've been hypnotized.

191
00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:56.240
My friend, Vinny Shoreman, he works with fighters. He's a, he hypnotized,

192
00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.110
he calls it a mental coaching, but he in, and I was like,

193
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.660
I want to know what you're doing. Like he's been on my podcast before. I'm like,

194
00:10:02.661 --> 00:10:06.440
do it to me. Let's see what's up. It was very weird. Very it beneficial.

195
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.250
I think I did. I only did it once, but, uh, I was, uh,

196
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.590
I was kinda stunned by it. I'm like, oh,

197
00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:16.520
this is a weird state where you're kind of there, but not there. Like,

198
00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:19.850
it's not like you don't know what's going on. You do know what's going on,

199
00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:23.960
but you're in this weird sort of quasi relaxed,

200
00:10:23.961 --> 00:10:25.400
sleepy thing.

201
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.240
<v 0>Very unusual state. This match of high focus,</v>

202
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.590
deep relaxation is not a brain state that we can

203
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.720
access very easily without a hypnotist. I mean, there are other ways to do it,

204
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:39.160
but.

205
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:39.380
<v 1>That's it,</v>

206
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.270
that state would be super beneficial for free for people wanting

207
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:49.160
to learn something because it would relax them much more deeply than it

208
00:10:49.161 --> 00:10:52.880
would just, or ordinarily everyday life while you're talking.

209
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.680
<v 0>That's right. It's,</v>

210
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.310
it's taking the two pieces of the plasticity puzzle and putting them in a same

211
00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:02.630
event. So I don't think it should be the only way to learn new things,

212
00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:06.350
because there are things you can't do in hypnosis, like, like roll jujitsu.

213
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.330
I mean, for instance,

214
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.800
but as a tool for accessing faster learning,

215
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.350
it's quite powerful. Just like sleep. I mean,

216
00:11:15.351 --> 00:11:18.830
I think the work of Matt Walker and bill Dement at Stanford and others had just

217
00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:20.900
shown, like, if you want to pull someone apart,

218
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.220
you want to just make them insane and UN unable to do these duration path,

219
00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:29.660
outcome, you know, mental operations, you sleep the them. Okay.
