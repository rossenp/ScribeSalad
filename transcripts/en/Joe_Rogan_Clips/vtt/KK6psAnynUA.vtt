00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.320
<v 1>When you were talking about going to the doctor when you were a</v>

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:12.240
child, and that this is a very disturbing story,

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.790
but I want you to try to explain it to people, how

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.760
people were dying in these hospitals and rats

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.710
would eat the eyeballs of the people who are dying and children who are starving

7
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:27.060
would eat the rats.

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.120
And then the children would die and the rats would eat the children.

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.730
Explain what this was like, that you w w how, how did you see this?

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.080
<v 0>Well, I mean, seeing that the body is under stress, like everyday thing,</v>

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.040
it was numb.

12
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.770
<v 1>Where were the bodies? Like, just laying around on the.</v>

13
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.320
<v 0>Streets. They are floating in the rivers.</v>

14
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.290
And then they also train station.

15
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:53.130
Somehow had a lot of dead bodies because no, excuse a very cold.

16
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.140
And there's a train waiting area.

17
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:59.520
And North Korea has one train go to one distance, like a once a month.

18
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.380
And like here,

19
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:05.040
it would take like one hour to go the other place in order to take a month,

20
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.410
at least to go, because there's no electricity.

21
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.860
And sometimes people have to push the train. They have to push.

22
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.693
<v 1>The train. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.160
<v 0>Yeah. Traveling in North Korea.</v>

24
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.140
So unbelievably difficult thing within North Korea. So,

25
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.900
uh, I mean, anyway, so in train stations,

26
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.990
that's when people die mostly and in North Korea,

27
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:29.130
the hardest thing as a child for me is that when my mum goes away to find food,

28
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.820
like, we don't have a car. Like we don't have phones. We don't have letters.

29
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.870
If I say goodbye to her, I don't know when I'm going to see her again.

30
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.730
Or if I'm ever going to see her again,

31
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.950
because she could have cared and like raped and starved.

32
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.570
You never know how to find people. So in the, you know, in the morning,

33
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:50.400
when you go to like walk in the train station,

34
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.230
they just put the piles of the antibodies and they're all like, become rigid,

35
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.120
right? They're almost like, like woot paradon alum and taking away.

36
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:04.110
And one, but the thing is, for me, I didn't even know the word, compassion.

37
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.340
Like nobody told me you have to feel bad for it. Because for me, it's like,

38
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.040
like fish in the water don't notice the water, right?

39
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:14.430
Like that was like something everyday I saw as a child.

40
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.430
<v 1>You never went days where you didn't see,</v>

41
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:19.500
this is a normal thing to see dead bodies.

42
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.520
<v 0>As, as, as like normal, as like breathing the air. Why now?</v>

43
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.950
And one thing that I remember his sister, my,

44
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.920
my sister and I was walking by, by the word, like in North Korea,

45
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:33.990
we don't have a sewage. We don't have one in water.

46
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:38.040
Obviously we have to go to a river to bring the drinking water.

47
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.650
And there's a young teenage boy,

48
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.150
I think lying down and his intestines coming out of his

49
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.250
back when you're really mad, nourished, that thing all opens up. You got zeros,

50
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:54.300
you know, fats, every hole all up and, and,

51
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.290
and you see dog, like dogs looking at his Oregon's coming out.

52
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.590
And he was there somehow conscious, begging for food at the time he.

53
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.590
<v 1>Was begging for food while his organs were hanging out of his body. Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.310
<v 0>And I don't know why he was like, pants were off.</v>

55
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.800
And I found nothing. That's still haunts me to this day. Like,

56
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.770
I don't know how I feel nothing at that point.

57
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.780
And that just looked horrible because you just,

58
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:26.350
the fact that she's alive and so much flies flying by,

59
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.850
on his origins and how he's somehow consciously begging for food.

60
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.880
And I, I didn't feel anything.

61
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.210
<v 1>You felt no compassion. No, it was just normal.</v>

62
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.840
<v 0>Yeah. It's yeah. So that's,</v>

63
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.840
that was like daily life thing. And then in the hospital,

64
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.290
when I was 13 years old, I, my,

65
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:49.330
my parents took me to hospital because I was a bad stomach ache.

66
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.530
And then we don't have like x-ray machines. We don't have none of that.

67
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.360
Dr. Webster belly. And then he says, oh, we need to operate on her.

68
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.220
I think her like appendix bursting or something. So that afternoon they,

69
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.860
they cut me off, put me without any anesthesia.

70
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.080
And by it's normal thing that people in North Korea operation without

71
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.350
anesthesia.

72
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.790
But the chances of you going to surgery is a lot higher for getting infected,

73
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.710
because we don't have penicillin.

74
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.960
The nurses using a one Nader to inject every single patient.

75
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.980
So who do you know? Well, you have,

76
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.080
the person has you get from actually more sick by being in the hospital.

77
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.360
And this is where we don't of course have indoor bathroom for the patient.

78
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:35.620
We have to go outside.

79
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.070
And in between there there's a pirates of dead human bodies.

80
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.410
And that's when I was seeing this, uh,

81
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.190
some are rats, eating human eyes first, for some reason.

82
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.973
<v 1>Um.</v>

83
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.460
<v 0>And this women, I don't know, in my age,</v>

84
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.090
probably short hair wearing his flower pens.

85
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.650
And when they did all,

86
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.760
like their math is somehow open and they're all eyes hollow.

87
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.220
And you see children like looking at the rats and laughing and chasing them and

88
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.250
our doors telling them I don't need those. You're going to get sick from it.

89
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.940
But of course, kids don't care. Like even finding a rat is delicacy.

90
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.840
Because even finding a snake is a, it's a, it's a big prize.

91
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.330
You don't find those like often.

92
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.450
<v 1>So there were finding the rats and then just trying to eat them,</v>

93
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.190
whether eating them raw.

94
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.370
<v 0>Sometimes if you find a skin, you do,</v>

95
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:33.520
but they do find some like fire and roast them.

96
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.990
<v 1>So they were excited to find a rat, catching them with.</v>

97
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.770
<v 0>Yeah. Oh yeah. Of course they do catch them around with their hands and,</v>

98
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.790
and there's pirates of human bodies. Like the, she was on top.

99
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.870
That's why I was able to see her reading this flower pants till this.

100
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.200
And then I go, oh, I just saw hello. It's like,

101
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.140
we need to look at the human body. Like nothing is left. I think that's what,

102
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.300
it's not just death. It's that? It's just like how it becomes nothing.

103
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.040
So inside, she does not know the shame or pain, just,

104
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.480
she was lying there like that.

105
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.980
And you see children just chasing them and laughing and try to catch the rats.

106
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.700
<v 1>And the children didn't feel anything being around the dead bodies.</v>

107
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.190
<v 0>It's our daily normal thing, seeing a death. It's like our daily life.</v>

108
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.880
<v 1>And they would eat the rats and then they would get sick and some of them would</v>

109
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:29.180
die. And then the rats.

110
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.420
<v 0>Yeah. So the cycle we talk about, it's like,</v>

111
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.660
that's a spring is for Nordisk as a season of death.

112
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.600
<v 1>And so the diseases that they would get from the rats,</v>

113
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.210
they were willing to risk those diseases just because of hunger.

114
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.620
<v 0>When you are, there is a, uh, north Korean proverb.</v>

115
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.020
There's no wish for the person who died after their stomach is full.

116
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.540
So even the image of the earthquake, the North Korea is not try to run.

117
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.050
So my mom was talking about the Tara when she was in the university,

118
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.730
there's earthquake happening.

119
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.360
And do you know what the student's doing is not one out of the building and

120
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.660
tried to survive. They go to kitchen. So before they die,

121
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.390
they eat at least so they can die.

122
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.410
So if you have the promise of eating a one year,

123
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.510
they're going to risk everything for that.

124
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.130
<v 1>So it's just, uh, an entire country in a perpetual state of starvation.</v>

125
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.940
<v 0>Yeah. It's I remember praying with this game with my sister,</v>

126
00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:28.700
because as a young girl, I never ate till I felt full.

127
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.420
So I would compare myself. Like I tell her,

128
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:34.640
like I can eat a hundred breath and she's like, I can,

129
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:38.840
in the mountains of bread, I can eat like 10,000 more than what you just said.

130
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.240
Cause I don't know the limits of my stomach because I never tested it. So you.

131
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.020
<v 1>Always were.</v>

132
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.600
<v 0>Hungry, always hungry, never felt full.</v>
