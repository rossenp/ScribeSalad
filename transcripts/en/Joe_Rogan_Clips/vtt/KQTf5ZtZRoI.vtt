WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.480
<v 0>The other aspect of the conspiracy theories is cognitive dissonance. That is,</v>

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:08.370
we want the size of the event to be matched by a cause that's equally

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.660
of that size. So the analogy I use is, you know, the Holocaust,

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.580
the worst genocide in human history caused by the Nazis, the worst regime,

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.760
political regime in human history. There's a match there, right.

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.220
But if you say something like, uh, you know, JFK,

7
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:27.030
the leader of the free world brought down by who Lee Harvey also,

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.300
we'll just some, nobody, you know, there's this mismatch or nine 11,

9
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.020
this huge thing by 19 guys with box cutters. Do.

10
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.030
<v 1>You think that it does it Harvey, Oswald acted alone? Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.650
Do you feel what makes you think that.

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.390
<v 0>All of the evidence and none of the evidence against anybody else and all of the</v>

13
00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:45.470
evidence against particularly him, uh, Gerald Posner's book, case closed,

14
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:49.730
and then, um, the attorney, what's his name? That was the, uh, uh,

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.060
Mattson attorney. Yeah. Uh, he, his,

16
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.530
he has a massive book where he lines up every single one of the, uh,

17
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.080
arguments by the JFK conspiracy. For example,

18
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.420
conspiracists make a big deal about how Oswald got a job at the book depository

19
00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:05.900
building,

20
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.620
which just happened to be where the parade just happened to be where the parade

21
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:11.660
route was going. So he could have a clear shot.

22
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.830
So it was Posner that tracked down when the white house determined,

23
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.190
even when Kennedy was going to Dallas, let alone what the parade route would be.

24
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.790
An Oswell already had the job there that's just chance.

25
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.960
So he knew it advanced bro. He knew that he needed it. Do you.

26
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.060
<v 1>Think it's possible that Oswald was in cahoots? No. No. No.</v>

27
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.640
Why do you think that? What about the magic bullet theory?

28
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.751
<v 0>Uh, well,</v>

29
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:39.710
that's been settled by the fact that the way it showed in the videos is that the

30
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:43.490
two seats are like this and at the bullet has to do this well. In fact,

31
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:47.220
the seats were like that and that Connolly was, well, you're explaining this.

32
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.530
<v 1>In audio form, just when you're saying it's like stadium seating, right?</v>

33
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.603
One's elevator.

34
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.210
<v 0>That's right. So the bullet actually does, when it passes through the neck,</v>

35
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.980
through Kennedy's neck and then hits Connolly's shoulder,

36
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.240
it is already moving down here. It hit his.

37
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.610
<v 1>Wrist, it fractured his wrist. Right. Um.</v>

38
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.370
<v 0>This has been tested and tested and tested.</v>

39
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.720
<v 1>Here's here's my issue with it. There's a couple issues. One, uh, on the,</v>

40
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.370
on the pro side, uh,

41
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.130
the idea that bullets will take a straight path is ridiculous. I've I've,

42
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.720
I've talked to hunters that have shot animals, uh,

43
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.920
in the front and had a bullet come out the same side. They shot it.

44
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.490
It ricocheted off bones and came out like the front of the animal,

45
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.690
like bullets take weird paths. Yeah. When they hit things in particular. Uh,

46
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:33.650
so to arrows,

47
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.870
they'd take an as a person who's well versed in firearms and

48
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.680
shot animals and hunted this. You don't,

49
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.360
sometimes the bullet goes straight through and sometimes it hits bones and wacky

50
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:51.590
things happen, things deflect. But on the negative side,

51
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.400
they always distort bullets, always distort, particularly when they hit bone.

52
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.770
But bothered me was that they found that bullet in Connolly's gurney,

53
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.700
when they brought him to the hospital, they just conveniently found this bullet.

54
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.710
Aha. We have it. This is the bullet. It matches the same rifle. Yeah. And,

55
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:12.940
but it wasn't pristine. It was flattened. Barely. If you look at that bullet,

56
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:17.050
that bullet, it's nothing like a bullet that's hit bone. When bullets hit bone,

57
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.500
they, they mushroom, they balloon, they bend, they distort wildly.

58
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.630
They don't come out, looking like that. They come out,

59
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:25.630
looking like that when you shoot them into water or when you shoot them into

60
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:26.920
like feathers,

61
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.640
they don't come out looking like that under normal circumstances when they

62
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.240
shattered the bone of two different people. Well, do you know that for sure? No,

63
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:36.160
I do not know that for sure. But, um,

64
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.140
one thing I do know a lot about is I D I know quite a bit about

65
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:42.820
what bullets look like when they hit things.

66
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:46.180
I've looked into this pretty extensively and I've talked to a lot of people in

67
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:48.970
law enforcement, military hunters,

68
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.890
and none of them believed that that bullet hit bones, shattered bones came out,

69
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:54.670
looking like that.

70
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.300
Is it possible that that bullet was the only bullet ever in the history of the

71
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:00.610
world that did do that? Yeah, it might be.

72
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.650
<v 0>Okay. So we're getting kind of caught up in the weeds of the anomalies.</v>

73
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:06.540
What about this? Just a bullet, uh,

74
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.460
Oswald himself had attempted to assassinate a general name Walker six

75
00:04:11.461 --> 00:04:16.020
months before with his rifle and a handgun. And he went over to the house.

76
00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:19.440
He took a shot through the guys. When Whitney saw him at the desk, took a shot,

77
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:23.760
missed him. Uh, he told his wife about it. I'm a revolutionary.

78
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:25.470
I'm trying to start. Don't get me. Don't get me.

79
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.890
<v 1>Wrong. I'm not saying that Oswell was innocent. I'm not. I mean,</v>

80
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.580
and I think it's very possible that Oswald did shoot at the president.

81
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.960
He might've even hit the president.

82
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.890
It's also very possibly that some other people were involved as well. Who,

83
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.980
I don't know, say this is the problem, but wait a minute. Why is it a problem?

84
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:42.120
If you don't know who they are,

85
00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:45.080
just because you don't know who they are doesn't mean it didn't. Okay. But.

86
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.430
<v 0>Why do we need to postulate extra people?</v>

87
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.190
<v 1>All the gunshots that happened in the short amount of time,</v>

88
00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:53.580
the fact that the reason why they came up with the theory of the magic bullet in

89
00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:54.414
the first place,

90
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.510
because they had to account for a bullet that hit a curb underneath the

91
00:04:57.511 --> 00:04:59.340
overpass. Do you know that right? Yeah.

92
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.240
<v 0>Okay. There's three there's there's w okay. Yeah. If.</v>

93
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.320
<v 1>If you know why they came out with them. Yeah. I've been there.</v>

94
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.340
Do you know why they came up.

95
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.230
<v 0>With that? It's short. I mean, it's right there. You can.</v>

96
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.400
<v 1>Not miss the point. Well, that's, that's sort of true. Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.780
It's not a far shot. And.

98
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.810
<v 0>He was a pretty good marksman, Posner track down his talking.</v>

99
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.200
<v 1>About that.</v>

100
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.750
We're talking about the reason why they came up with the magic bullet there in

101
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.280
the first place. Do you know what? Well.

102
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.580
<v 0>I thought it was because, uh, of the, the alignment of the seats.</v>

103
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.560
<v 1>No. Cause they had to attribute three shots. They had to figure out.</v>

104
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.810
And one of them, they were, they were thinking, well, the,

105
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:32.640
all these wounds came from three bullets,

106
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.060
but then they found a bullet that it hit the curb on the underside.

107
00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:38.370
And he got checked into a hospital cause he was hit with a ricochet.

108
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.780
So there's a curb that they proved was hit with a bullet.

109
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.980
There was a bullet hole in the granite or whatever the the curbs made out of it

110
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:51.000
hit this guy. He went to the hospital. So he was hit with a ricochet.

111
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.410
So they knew that one bullet had not hit the president.

112
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.510
And so they had to attribute all of these wounds to one bullet.

113
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:01.850
Now they had one bullet that landed into his neck,

114
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.920
another bullet that hit him in the head. Right.

115
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:08.300
And so how do these three bullets cause a wound tonally as well.

116
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.850
Then they came up with the mat. There's a, there's the bullet.

117
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.200
<v 0>Look at that bullet. Look at the S at the end, it's flattened.</v>

118
00:06:14.201 --> 00:06:15.820
If you look at it from the end, uh.

119
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.580
<v 1>No, it's not look at this under no circumstances.</v>

120
00:06:18.581 --> 00:06:21.460
Do I feel that this bullet could hit a wrist and still not be deformed?

121
00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:25.630
We proved that by experiments as a chief consultant in wound ballistics for the

122
00:06:25.631 --> 00:06:29.950
U S army who supervise test for the Warren commission, here's the thing I don't,

123
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.220
I don't necessarily think that, uh,

124
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.380
there was some grand conspiracy,

125
00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:39.850
but I do think it's entirely possible that someone took that posthumously took

126
00:06:39.851 --> 00:06:44.170
that rifle and wanted to pin it on Lee Harvey, Oswald, definitively look,

127
00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:47.230
there's people that do things when they know someone's guilty and they plant

128
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.800
evidence. Mark Furhman did that with OJ Simpson. They found his glove. They,

129
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:52.180
they, they planted evidence.

130
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.510
And there was one of the reasons why OJ got off because there was some sort of

131
00:06:55.511 --> 00:06:59.050
conspiring to make it look like he was, you know, it was,

132
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.830
the evidence was a clear path. They could have just taken that rifle.

133
00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:06.730
And look could have been that our Oswald did it alone. It's possible,

134
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.430
but it also could have been this. Some other people were shooting at them too.

135
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.270
It could have been that they had decided to have Oswald be a part of this.

136
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:15.220
And when Jack Ruby ran in and shot him,

137
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.090
that doesn't look a little suspicious at some guy with ties to the mob gets

138
00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:23.170
right up to this guy who just shot the president and shoots him like why he's

139
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.010
never shot anybody.

140
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.510
<v 0>Before do it publicly.</v>

141
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.430
Posner talks about Ruby's character and who he was major Kennedy supporter,

142
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.020
uh, running with some bad dudes, some bread, bad own Brays there in Texas.

143
00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:39.850
And he was a gun owner. Uh, security wasn't anything like it is now. It,

144
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.670
he really could just walk right in like he did.

145
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.500
<v 1>Possible, but it's also possible that that guy owed something to the mob.</v>

146
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:49.540
And this is what they told him to do. He going to get rid of that guy? No,

147
00:07:49.541 --> 00:07:50.830
one's going to care. They're going to be happy.

148
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.740
That guy just shot the president. No, so there's this,

149
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.720
it seems so it seems like people want it to be one

150
00:07:58.721 --> 00:08:02.830
way or the other and they want, they want this case closed.

151
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:03.821
<v 0>See that way. I mean,</v>

152
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:07.270
Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy and that was evident pretty quickly

153
00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:10.480
afterwards. And they rounded them up. Uh, you know,

154
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:13.870
world war one was launched by a conspiracy with the assassination of Franz

155
00:08:13.871 --> 00:08:17.120
Ferdinand by a Serbian group of, uh, called the black hand.

156
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.510
Their group of nationalists talked about the.

157
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.780
<v 1>Vietnam war to the Gulf of Tonkin incident, a false flag.</v>

158
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.180
<v 0>So these things do happen. They're all false legs.</v>

159
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:28.930
There are conspiracies to assassinate foreign leaders, uh, you know,

160
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:33.310
hitch wrote this book on Kissinger as a war criminal, uh, that, you know,

161
00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:36.700
all the shenanigans we were doing in south America with dictators,

162
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:39.040
there were back in this take tater, cause he's the son of a,

163
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.700
but he's our son of a versus this guy. And we're gonna, you know,

164
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.811
sassy Nate Castro,

165
00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:48.750
all the stuff that came out that Johnson tried to cover up that came out and

166
00:08:48.751 --> 00:08:53.140
the Pentagon papers about Kennedy plotting to have Castro

167
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:57.720
assassinated. That's a kind of, so this does absolutely. This does happen,

168
00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:58.471
but the question is,

169
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:02.910
did it happen in that particular case or this one or a year? And the evidence,

170
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.680
in my opinion, after reading, particularly Gerald Posner, his book, uh,

171
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.790
case closed it's,

172
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.810
there's a funny internet meme that went around last week of a guy who dies.

173
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.020
It goes to heaven, and God says, you you've been such a good fellow.

174
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:19.410
Your whole life I'll grant you. One wish you can ask me anything. He said,

175
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.070
all right, who killed Kennedy? And God said it was Lee Harvey,

176
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:26.580
Oswald acting alone, using his own on a rifle. And the guy goes,

177
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.320
this goes higher up than I thought.

178
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.720
<v 1>That's funny, man. Did you ever read David Lifton's novel or, um, um,</v>

179
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:36.790
a book about it rather?

180
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.120
<v 0>Yeah. Uh, best evidence, best evidence. I, I didn't read the whole book. Uh,</v>

181
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.860
you know, when I was researching this, uh, back in the nineties w after the, uh,

182
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.400
uh, Oliver stone film came out, because after that, when that came out,

183
00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:52.100
I thought, man, if only half of this or 10% of this is true,

184
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.020
it's definitely a conspiracy.

185
00:09:54.021 --> 00:09:57.650
But then there are websites dedicated to everything he got wrong there and why

186
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:57.770
he.

187
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.010
<v 1>Made it up, like the general Donald Sutherland character,</v>

188
00:10:01.011 --> 00:10:05.300
that guy doesn't even exist. He just used him as a theatrical tool.

189
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.000
<v 0>Yeah. Very distorting film. And that film is such a powerful medium.</v>

190
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.330
It's hard to overcome that. The movie in.

191
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.850
<v 1>Particular, I mean, you got Kevin Costner. Who's the good guy.</v>

192
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.520
Everybody loves it. Yeah. I mean,

193
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.690
that is Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau crazy movie.

194
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.780
And it really has you believing that there's some sort of a consideration.

195
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.820
<v 0>To the lip back and to the left people.</v>

196
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.830
<v 1>Love. Well, here's the thing about that though.</v>

197
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.300
I've looked at that over and over again. Yes, it is back into the left,

198
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:37.040
but the spray kind of comes out the front. Yeah, it does. Yeah. Yeah.

199
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.270
It kind of comes out the front.

200
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:43.250
And one thing that does happen when people or things get shot is you

201
00:10:43.251 --> 00:10:47.930
have nerves and nerves react and, and things, things do weird,

202
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.240
weird results in your body. When, if you get hit by something, it doesn't mean,

203
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.620
well, I get hit on the chest,

204
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.410
your hands come up like that while he's grabbing his neck.

205
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.590
Apparently that was the other thing was there was a difference in the autopsy

206
00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:04.010
results from Bethesda, Maryland versus in Dallas, Texas, Dallas, Texas.

207
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.440
They attributed the, uh,

208
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:11.240
throat wound to a frontal shot that something hit him in the front.

209
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:16.340
And then the Bethesda, Maryland. They said that it was a trake wound. Uh, they,

210
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.740
uh, they opened them up to clear his breathing pathway.

211
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:20.480
And then the conspiracy theorists would say,

212
00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:23.700
why would you clear the breathing pathway of a guy who doesn't have a brain it's

213
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.830
brain was shot out of his head?

214
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.660
<v 2>Right. Because a lot of [inaudible], I.</v>

215
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.390
<v 1>Just don't like when people say they know one way or another,</v>

216
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.300
we Harvey Oswald acted alone. Huh? could, you know,

217
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.800
there was a bunch of bullets,

218
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.610
there was also bullet fragments in Connolly's wrist that weren't missing from

219
00:11:37.611 --> 00:11:41.540
the bullet itself, the bullet itself, whether you think it's pristine or not,

220
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.300
it's still, it's not missing a lot of fragments.

221
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.420
And there's fragments in Connolly's body that they,

222
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.120
you could detect an x-ray there's x-rays of his wrist.

223
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:54.460
<v 0>And you could see the little pieces. I don't know what the, for that. Exactly.</v>

224
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.520
But the fact that I don't know, I'm not the world's expert on this stuff.

225
00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.680
People want to clean.

226
00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.850
<v 1>It up. That's what I don't like.</v>

227
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.860
They want to clean it up or they want to muddy it up.

228
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.950
Instead of like looking at it a hundred percent of objectively,

229
00:12:04.951 --> 00:12:06.240
they want one thing or another,

230
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:10.890
I think it's entirely possible that Lee Harvey Oswald it's either to me, they,

231
00:12:10.891 --> 00:12:12.480
they want to say, this is the,

232
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.450
these are the two narratives Lee Harvey Oswald was a Patsy.

233
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.560
He had nothing to do with the government, set him up or he acted alone. But why,

234
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.990
why couldn't he have been evolved in it? You know,

235
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:24.480
he obviously was involved in some shady characters.

236
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.830
The guy spent a ton of time in Russia, came back over here very easily,

237
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:31.290
even though the cold war was going on. There's a lot of weird stuff.

238
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.700
He might've very well been some sort of a government informant or working in

239
00:12:35.701 --> 00:12:38.580
cahoots with the government, if that's the case.

240
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.170
And he did shoot Kennedy or shoot at Kennedy who's to say that he wasn't with

241
00:12:43.171 --> 00:12:46.640
other people and they killed him because this guy was going to go to jail and

242
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.130
he's going to start talking when they arrested him. He said, I'm a Patsy.

243
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.550
I'm just a Patsy. And then blam, he's dead. Oh, we got him.

244
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.840
And that's it wrap it up tight.

245
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.600
It wasn't until there's approved or film that people really started to question.

246
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.490
And I think that was it might've been 10 years later. Right?

247
00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:05.310
We've talked about it. You know, the whole history of this uproot or film,

248
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:10.110
how it was released, the Geraldo Rivera show. Right. Crazy. Right.

249
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:15.000
Dick Gregory comedian brought the film footage to the Geraldo

250
00:13:15.001 --> 00:13:18.690
Rivera show and showed it on television for the first time magazine bought the

251
00:13:18.691 --> 00:13:21.570
rights to life magazine, had the rights and didn't do anything with it.

252
00:13:21.571 --> 00:13:23.970
They kept it for more than a decade.

253
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.470
And Dick Gregory got ahold of the actual film footage and premiered it on the

254
00:13:28.471 --> 00:13:30.180
Geraldo Rivera show.

255
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:35.520
I want to say it was like 1971 or 72 or something like

256
00:13:35.521 --> 00:13:40.050
that. So it was way way after the assassination that the American, what was it?

257
00:13:40.051 --> 00:13:43.170
75 is 12 years old. That's crazy. 75.

258
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:47.340
So all those years later, and then people got a chance to see the footage.

259
00:13:47.341 --> 00:13:50.010
And they were like, wow, this is not how it was described to us at all.

260
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.390
And it made people skeptical.

261
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.190
<v 0>There's a good Nova show on the ballistics, in the head and testing the rifle.</v>

262
00:13:56.191 --> 00:13:59.130
And could you shoot that many times in that many seconds and so on?

263
00:13:59.131 --> 00:14:01.200
And it's pretty cool to me. It's pretty convincing.

264
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.920
<v 1>The problem with me is I know too much about what happens when bullets hit</v>

265
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.130
bones. I don't buy that. That was the bullet I do. Look,

266
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.410
I think they could have just dropped that bullet off.

267
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.080
Doesn't mean that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't do it.

268
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.640
Thing about that bullet though.

269
00:14:14.641 --> 00:14:18.750
Is it like there might be some fuckery involved and the David liftin book was,

270
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.190
that was the book that got me into conspiracies. That book got.

271
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.180
If I could go back and not read it, I bombed on stage because of that book.

272
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:32.430
You did. Yeah. Well, it was my fault, but I've read that book the day. Uh,

273
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.990
I was performing and I was freaking out cause I was like 24 or something like

274
00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:39.720
that. I was like, oh, this is crazy. They killed the president.

275
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.760
And I was so naive and I was like really bummed out when I went on stage.

276
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.270
And then I realized like, oh, you can't like, I didn't know any better.

277
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.920
I'd only been doing comedy for three years. I'm like, oh,

278
00:14:49.921 --> 00:14:52.880
you can't call on stage, bombed out. If you got to get your head together,

279
00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:55.850
you can't just say the jokes and not have some emotional attachment to them.

280
00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:00.110
But that book highlights, what it was, was a lifting was, um,

281
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.680
a bookkeeper and, or an accountant I believe. And, uh,

282
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.600
he was hired to do something with the Warren commission report. And,

283
00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:12.140
and because he found some contradictions and he went over the entire Warren

284
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:15.320
commission report, which is an enormous, enormous publication.

285
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.320
And he found all of these problems,

286
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.470
all of these problems in the Warren commission report and all these

287
00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:22.430
contradictions.

288
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.140
And it was his determination after reading everything and writing his book,

289
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.330
he thought that the conclusion they made, they made before the fact,

290
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:37.040
and that they wrote all this stuff to sort of ver the backup, their conclusion,

291
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.750
that it wasn't based entirely on an objective version of the facts and of the

292
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:45.080
event itself. Um, and his, his take was, there was a conspiracy.

293
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.260
<v 0>Well, it's launched a mini industry of books. Jasmine,</v>

294
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.040
think about all the money.

295
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.620
<v 1>That's been made off of the Kennedy assassin. If you go down.</v>

296
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.330
<v 0>The rabbit hole with this stuff.</v>

297
00:15:55.690 --> 00:16:00.040
<v 1>You see the, um, Jesse Ventura version of it. Uh, he believes.</v>

298
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.290
<v 0>Every Sainsbury's the best. He's the best I was on his computer Spears,</v>

299
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.150
the show he's yeah, he's out there.

300
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.560
<v 1>He believes it. Yeah. He was like, no one could have made that shot.</v>

301
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.790
They definitely could've made that shot. It's a rifle. It's not that far.

302
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.060
And just because someone gets lucky doesn't mean they can't get lucky.

303
00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.890
Like people get lucky all the time.

304
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.030
People flip a coin and it lands on heads a mile away. I mean, you know,

305
00:16:25.031 --> 00:16:29.380
you could throw a coin. You could, you could throw a coin out of a helicopter.

306
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.543
You know,

307
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:35.380
you could say this is going to be heads when it lands and it can be heads.

308
00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.660
You can get lucky, right. It really is possible.

309
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.381
<v 0>Well,</v>

310
00:16:38.381 --> 00:16:41.860
this assassination of Franz Ferdinand that triggered the first world war this,

311
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.340
yes. Okay. They, they messed up. I mean,

312
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.550
they had like seven of them and they met in secret and they got their weapons

313
00:16:48.551 --> 00:16:51.280
that morning and so on. And a couple of them, chicken dad,

314
00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:55.300
somebody else got lost, like three of them there. Somebody threw a hand grenade,

315
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.990
mist rolled into the car, behind the friends for none. And,

316
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.160
and they got hurt and went to the hospital and he's like, oh this.

317
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.830
I'm not giving my speech. Let's go to the hospital and visit,

318
00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:09.400
see how he's doing. So they double back like half an hour later,

319
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.880
they double back and come back down the same route. And the guy who had missed,

320
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.940
he was just sitting there on the curb is like, oh. Here they are. Bam.

321
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:20.420
<v 1>Yeah. Pure luck. Pure luck. Yeah. Yeah. That doesn't happen. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

322
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.800
<v 0>I mean that, that history turns more on that kind of thing.</v>

323
00:17:23.801 --> 00:17:27.820
Then on carefully orchestrated perfectly executed plot.

324
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:32.490
<v 1>Sure. It certainly can. But you know, the, the idea that, um, uh, I'm,</v>

325
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.180
I've always found it offensive.

326
00:17:34.181 --> 00:17:37.090
The idea that there's no way Oswald could have hit him like that.

327
00:17:37.091 --> 00:17:39.790
People say that like, there's no way. There's no way, like you're out of your,

328
00:17:39.791 --> 00:17:42.100
you never shot anything. Right. That's crazy.

329
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.850
I can make that shot a hundred percent. Yep. I will. Look,

330
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.610
if you have a rifle with a scope and a guy is a hundred away,

331
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.520
you tell him you can't shoot him. Right. That's crazy time. That's crazy talk.

332
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.160
Oh, the rifle was out of LA. That was the other thing they said, this,

333
00:17:56.161 --> 00:17:59.550
the scope wasn't lined up correctly. Here's the thing, folks,

334
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.770
if you have a rifle, okay.

335
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.680
And this has happened to me before and you drop the rifle,

336
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.520
the scope gets damaged. It gets moved. It's a very sensitive thing.

337
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.920
Like when you're talking about something that goes,

338
00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.360
it was faster than the speed of sound, a bullet, boom, firing out of a rifle.

339
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.050
You have that, that is going incredibly fast.

340
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.530
And to be able to get that reticle exactly on where you think that bullet's

341
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.530
going to hit requires a lot of adjustments. When you go to the range,

342
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.980
they set up a lead sled. You put your rifle down on this sled.

343
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:32.130
So you're not holding the rifle. And by the way, Oz ball,

344
00:18:32.131 --> 00:18:35.160
wasn't holding it either. The idea was that he had it rested, right?

345
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.490
Which makes it much more steady and much more easier to make an accurate shot.

346
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.690
So you set up this rifle on the lead sled and it's usually a hundred yards or

347
00:18:42.691 --> 00:18:47.340
200 yards, whatever. However far the distances to the target, you squeeze,

348
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:51.540
squeeze, squeeze, boom. The trigger goes off and you see that the bullet is low.

349
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.870
And to the left, by a couple of inches, you make an adjustment on the scope.

350
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.310
If you drop that rifle, that scope gets knocked the adjustments out the window.

351
00:18:59.370 --> 00:18:59.671
Right?

352
00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:02.730
So the idea that there's like a perfect chain of command between Lee Harvey,

353
00:19:02.731 --> 00:19:06.870
Oswald pulling that trigger and that scope never got rattled at all. No,

354
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:10.980
but the conspiracy theorists want you to think there's no way he could have made

355
00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:14.700
that shot. That scope wasn't even lined up. Good. How the do you know?

356
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:15.751
How do you know?

357
00:19:15.751 --> 00:19:18.390
You don't know like anybody who knows anything about rifles knows.

358
00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:22.290
There's no way you could know. Cause if all you'd have to do is whack it here.

359
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.830
I'm going to bring you the rifle and just bump it with your elbow. Funny,

360
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.920
knock it into a wall when you're handing it to someone and that scope's going to

361
00:19:28.921 --> 00:19:31.290
be off. Right? So then you take it to a range.

362
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:33.690
We're going to prove definitively that he could have never made this shot

363
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.830
because this scope is off. Boom, look, it's six inches to the left. Right? Wow.

364
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.740
Case closed right now. It's,

365
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.080
there's no way people know whether or not that scope was on when he was pulling

366
00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:48.140
that trigger. There's no way. You know, when I went.

367
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.250
<v 0>To Dealey Plaza, it's so big in our public imagination. It's not,</v>

368
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.670
it's not you go there. I was like, this is it. It's tiny. It's so small.

369
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.400
And then you go up to the museum and you're on the sixth floor, positive,

370
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.830
the book depository. And you look down and they have an X,

371
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.610
the two Xs in the street. And you think that that's just right there.

372
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.800
<v 1>Dude. I can shoot that with an arrow. I bet you could. I can. I guarantee you,</v>

373
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.530
if you give me some time, you give me some times you put a sh a target, right?

374
00:20:12.531 --> 00:20:15.170
Where that thing was, right. Where that, uh, Lincoln was.

375
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.550
And you put me in that window, I guarantee you, I hit that target with a bow,

376
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.690
right? With the idea that you couldn't, I'm holding it. No rest. Right?

377
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.080
The idea that you couldn't do that with a, with a rifle, right?

378
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.260
You certainly could. Lee Harvey, Oswald certainly could have done it.

379
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.830
He certainly couldn't have shot at Kennedy. He was a crazy.

380
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.560
Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in a lot of shady.

381
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.350
It wasn't like he was just some dentists.

382
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.870
<v 0>And he scored the second. According to Posner,</v>

383
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.600
he said he scored the second highest marksmanship. There it is. Right.

384
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:45.800
Right here to here. Right? Yeah, dude.

385
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.220
<v 1>That's so smart. That's a short distance.</v>

386
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.700
<v 0>Then the other question I had when you're coming up Houston street and going</v>

387
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:55.360
left, I always wondered why he didn't shoot him there. When Kenny,

388
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.250
the cars coming right at him.

389
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.900
<v 1>They are the window. He was in the window. On the left-hand side.</v>

390
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.830
He was over there. Yeah. No, no, no, no. It's uh, it's over here. Yeah,

391
00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:08.340
it's right there. That's where he shot him from that window there. Yep. So.

392
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.100
<v 0>I always wondered why he didn't shoot him when the car was coming right at him.</v>

393
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.560
Because that would have been a cleaner shot. It seems to me head.

394
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.120
<v 1>On you mean? Yeah. Yeah. Um, maybe we want to shoot him in the back of the head.</v>

395
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.110
Does it have a.

396
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.600
<v 0>Like a sniper? It maybe panic. It's that upper, right? Yeah. Look at that one.</v>

397
00:21:23.601 --> 00:21:25.050
Yeah. Wow.

398
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.220
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. When we drove through it, when, uh, last time, not last time,</v>

399
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.990
I was in Dallas a couple of times ago, but when we drove through it, it's like,

400
00:21:30.991 --> 00:21:33.900
it's eerie. You're like, wow. Yeah, this is it. I'm right.

401
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.950
<v 0>Here. I've been twice there.</v>

402
00:21:34.951 --> 00:21:37.860
And there's always a conspiracy people walking around that.

403
00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:40.110
They're looking for a tip. So I gave this guy 10 bucks ago.

404
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.590
Give me the whole story. Oh, he was very entertaining. Here's the grassy Knoll,

405
00:21:43.591 --> 00:21:45.960
the Pickety fence. And he got another one about this.

406
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.640
May he took the manhole cover off. He goes,

407
00:21:47.641 --> 00:21:51.150
there was somebody down here in the manhole. Oh, popped up. Bam. Shot him.

408
00:21:51.151 --> 00:21:52.020
Went back down to the mantle.

409
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.100
<v 1>Dumb conspiracy is they believe that the driver turned around and shot.</v>

410
00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.610
<v 0>Right. That's the best one, right? Yeah. Those are the fake spaces.</v>

411
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.480
<v 1>Fake people. Right.</v>

412
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.830
You're always going to get a bunch of really wacky conspiracies whenever

413
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:05.910
anything happens.
