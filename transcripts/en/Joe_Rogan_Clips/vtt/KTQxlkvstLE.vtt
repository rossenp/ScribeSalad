00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.520
<v 1>Experience. Uh, no. I'm 34 this year. Yeah. Well,</v>

3
00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:07.440
you look great. Thank.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.920
<v 0>You. &lt;laugh&gt; when did you start training?</v>

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.280
<v 1>Um, I, I did my first Mo class when I turned 24. Wow. Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.240
So I called it my.

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.680
<v 0>Maybe that's a thing, right?</v>

8
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.680
Like you don't have the wear and tear of like a lot of people start when they're

9
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.270
10 and you know, by the time they get to 24,

10
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:26.590
they already got they're all NCL up and back a mess and neck. And it.

11
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.150
<v 1>Probably stunts your growth too a little bit. I don't know. I,</v>

12
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.470
I feel like some something happens if you cut.

13
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.750
<v 0>Weight. It certainly does. Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.110
<v 1>So, yeah, I didn't, I didn't really do any sports after, I guess,</v>

15
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.940
middle school from middle school

16
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.860
through high school to college. And then after college, I didn't do. Like I was,

17
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:52.500
did you do anything? Nah, I was skinny fat, so I didn't have to &lt;laugh&gt;.

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.660
<v 0>But you didn't work out or nothing? Nah.</v>

19
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.340
<v 1>It didn't work out. That's crazy. It's weird.</v>

20
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.900
If you see a picture of me from like right after college it's I look like this

21
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:03.850
little, any like stick figure,

22
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.170
like just soft girl. It's really weird.

23
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.610
So like when people see me now they're like, holy. Like.

24
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.770
<v 0>Of people from back then. Yeah. Yeah. Well they must be freaking out now.</v>

25
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:18.690
Like she's a what? Yeah, she's in the what? She's a UFC contender. I know. Get.

26
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.970
<v 1>The outta here. No, Angela funny. Yeah, exactly. Like,</v>

27
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.440
and that was so different. Well, not different, but I was like super quiet,

28
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.800
like all my life, like in high school, especially college,

29
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.920
like I was always just like really shy and really like soft spoken. That's.

30
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.840
<v 0>Surprising cuz you're very funny on Twitter. Oh, thank you. On.</v>

31
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.640
<v 1>Twitter. You're hilarious. I was always funny. &lt;laugh&gt; you.</v>

32
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.550
<v 0>Always funny to just nobody knew it.</v>

33
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.030
<v 1>Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; I kept it to myself. I cracked myself up all day, but um,</v>

34
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.590
but yeah, like I'm, I'm just super shy.

35
00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:54.110
Like always awkward around like new people, new settings.

36
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.030
And like I had my tightknit group of friends,

37
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.910
but like I was never like the popular kid by any means. So what.

38
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.990
<v 0>Brought you into Mo Thai class?</v>

39
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.540
<v 1>A workout? You just needed something to do. It's just fat. Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.500
&lt;laugh&gt; I just got married and um, and I also had an office job.

41
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.580
I was working at an animation studio and uh, before that I had been bartending,

42
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.060
so I was like moving around and doing stuff and I never really felt like

43
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.770
inactive, but once I at the bar job and was just doing that full time,

44
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.730
I just felt like fat and lazy and greasy. And &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

45
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:33.410
everything that happens from like sitting down all day. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean,

46
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.610
you know, you like, you do all sorts of outside of this just to like, you know,

47
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.210
stay happy. So.

48
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.043
<v 0>Yeah. Right.</v>

49
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.920
The fear of death and the attitude of the finite life being

50
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.680
insignificant that like what is the point? Yeah.

51
00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:51.160
This sort of existential angst that many of us struggle with, right? Yeah.

52
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:54.280
Right. That's something that you, you touch upon really early on that this,

53
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.600
this thing that makes us unique is that we know that we're.

54
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.320
<v 2>Gonna die. Yeah, yeah. That,</v>

55
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.160
that to me is the vital distinguishing feature of our

56
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:09.280
species. You know, we can reflect on the past,

57
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.920
we can think about the future and recognize that we're not gonna be here in the

58
00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.880
future at least for some period of time. And it's, um,

59
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.190
it's an idea and it's powerful.

60
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.830
Motivating influence is one that has been explored throughout the ages.

61
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.700
Uh,

62
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.430
Aran who's one of the early disciples of Freud who ultimately broke with Freud,

63
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.910
uh, developed this thesis that our awareness of our own mortality as

64
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.620
one of the driving factors in what we did. And then when I was,

65
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.340
I don't know it was in my twenties or thirties.

66
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.620
I read a book by a guy named Ernest Becker called denial of death.

67
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.260
I dunno if you've ever heard of this book. No, it was,

68
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.740
it was big in the seventies and one actually the Pultz prize in the seventies.

69
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.220
And it's a wonderful distillation of this way of thinking about

70
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.770
why we humans do what we do. And in many ways in my own book,

71
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.850
the one that's coming out actually today until the end of time, it's, um,

72
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.330
it's extending this notion that Becker developed in denial

73
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:10.830
of death.

74
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.810
But now seeing it in a cosmological setting because it's not just we that are

75
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.653
going to die,

76
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.960
it's every structure in the universe is going to disintegrate in

77
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.280
time. Our,

78
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.280
our best theory suggests to us that even protons the very heart of matter,

79
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.040
there are quantum processes that in the far future will ensure that every

80
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:37.240
proton, disintegrates falls apart into its constituent particles.

81
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.430
And at that point there's no complex matter at all. What, what,

82
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.670
what timeline are we talking about here? Well, pretty, pretty big,

83
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.070
long timeline. In fact,

84
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.070
I'd like to use a metaphor to try to give you a feel for the times involved. Um,

85
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.950
I like to use the empire state building and imagine that every floor of the

86
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:58.710
empire state building represents a duration 10 times out of the previous floor.

87
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.020
So like on the ground floor, it's like one year, first floor, 10 year,

88
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:03.340
second floor, a hundred and so forth.

89
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.660
So you're going exponentially far in time as you climb up the empire state

90
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.180
building. And uh, in that scheme of things,

91
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:13.740
everything from the big bang until today, you're about at the 10th floor,

92
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.340
10 to the 10 years, 10 billion years. And, uh, as you go forward,

93
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.260
you are looking at things very far in the future. And to answer your question,

94
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.743
we think,

95
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.290
and I underscore think because we are now at the speculative end of our

96
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:28.330
theoretical ideas,

97
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.610
protons will decay roughly and say by the 38th floor,

98
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.610
so 10 to the 38 years.

99
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.970
<v 3>And, uh, I get a phone call via buddy of mine from college connects me to this,</v>

100
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.890
uh, this guy, uh,

101
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.800
this Icelandic guy I've never met him before his name's fi Paul don't know his

102
00:05:45.801 --> 00:05:49.200
story. I do now he's an absolute legend. Um, and he says, Hey man,

103
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:51.600
you were just in Antarctica. Right. And I was like, yeah. And he's like,

104
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.120
I think we should go back to Antarctica. And I was like, all right, well,

105
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.160
what are you thinking? He's like in a rowboat,

106
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.840
I think we should row a boat from the Southern tip of south America to the

107
00:06:01.841 --> 00:06:06.600
peninsula of Antarctica across Drake passage. How far is that? About 700 miles.

108
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.280
Can I see what that.

109
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.113
<v 0>Looks like on a map?</v>

110
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.600
<v 3>Um, and I said, please delete my phone number. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

111
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.960
<v 0>700 Miles row your boat.</v>

112
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.750
<v 3>Uh, yes. So Drake passage is known to be, um, you know, in seafaring,</v>

113
00:06:19.751 --> 00:06:20.630
one of the most Treacher,

114
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:23.630
if not the most treacherous kind of passage way in the world, you know,

115
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:24.470
you've gotten, you know,

116
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:27.030
the Atlantic and the Pacific and the Southern ocean kind of all converging

117
00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:29.310
between the Antarctica peninsula and the Southern tip of south America.

118
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.990
So you got 40 foot swells, you got, you know,

119
00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:36.110
crazy waves icebergs as you get close to Antarctica. Um, and the, uh,

120
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.180
the mission or the go goal was to see if we could, uh, there it is. Right.

121
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:42.460
There's that's it? That whole area, that whole area. Yeah, there, there,

122
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.940
from there to there, um, all the way down. Yeah, the main,

123
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.700
the main peninsula there. How long did this take? So ultimately, uh, it took us,

124
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.460
uh, just less than two weeks to do the entire row, but it was a,

125
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.380
a long journey in the planning from that phone call all the way through to that

126
00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:59.090
year. But it was a, it was a two week or 12 day crossing. So in.

127
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.370
<v 0>The two weeks you had to have two weeks worth of food,</v>

128
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.050
two weeks worth of drinking water on.

129
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.570
<v 3>The boat. Yeah. So, well water, actually, we have a desalinated so off of, um,</v>

130
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:12.090
really off of, uh, solar panels, everything's, you know, solar there's no,

131
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:13.970
you know, engine, no sale, nothing like that.

132
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:15.410
It's just completely human powered rowing.

133
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.440
<v 0>We have a portable desalinated yeah. Help big. Is.</v>

134
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.800
<v 3>It, um, it fits inside one of the tiny, so the boat's tiny, the boat's like 20,</v>

135
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.720
25 feet long, three guys row at a time.

136
00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:27.960
So six of us total and the team ultimately, um, you know,

137
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.200
barely anywhere to sleep in this tiny little compartments,

138
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:32.400
like the size of like, you know, sleeping in the back of a, you know,

139
00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:36.840
hatchback of a Honda civic or something like that. Um, but, uh,

140
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.521
but yeah,

141
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:40.150
so you've got this desal that's basically kind of in one of the central

142
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:41.670
compartments. So it's probably like, I don't know,

143
00:07:41.671 --> 00:07:46.310
maybe two feet by two feet square, something like that. Um, and I mean, doesn't,

144
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:49.550
doesn't make water real fast. You can make 10 liters of water in like, you know,

145
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:52.430
an hour or two, depending on this. How, how hot the sun good is good,

146
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.230
but I mean, it gets it done. Yeah. It gets it done. Does it taste like.

147
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.910
<v 0>Whale? What, what.</v>

148
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.100
<v 3>Does the water taste like? It would was weird as we got closer to Antarctica,</v>

149
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.500
I think it started messing up because it got real salty.

150
00:08:04.501 --> 00:08:06.540
Like it wasn't doing quite as good of a job. The water, oh,

151
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.420
near Antarctica was like one degree Celia.

152
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.740
So 33 FHE me practically frozen cold water.

153
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.100
And I think that was kind of starting to tweak out the system. They don't.

154
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.980
<v 4>Want my money. They don't want anything. I have to offer them.</v>

155
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.930
I want what they have.

156
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.890
That was sort of a game changer moment for me.

157
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.410
I wanna figure out how to be connected with nothing.

158
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.730
<v 0>What did these guys do all day? &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

159
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.050
<v 4>I don't know. They all did different stuff. I think. Yeah, everybody does.</v>

160
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:41.560
And every Aros got their own thing. You know what I mean? Did.

161
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.520
<v 0>You have chores that you had to do to, to earn your food? Like yeah.</v>

162
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.440
<v 4>Everybo, you know, every ashram is gonna be different and every, uh,</v>

163
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.280
spiritual path there's Christian monks and, you know,

164
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.200
monks from different traditions around the world,

165
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.400
I'm sure they all got their thing, different things.

166
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.040
But later I started doing my next band because the interesting thing about the

167
00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:04.920
Vaga Vada Vaga vadas,

168
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.360
you're familiar with it's one chapter of the biggest epic in the world,

169
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.680
the Maha Bart, and it's a,

170
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:15.670
it's the most studied and disgusted and it on by all the saints

171
00:09:15.671 --> 00:09:19.070
of ancient India, um, people even bringing it to politics and stuff,

172
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.430
but it's a real conversation between the spirit

173
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.390
and dev divinity. It's a conversation about, uh,

174
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.870
just about, it's just, it's just considered ancient wisdom for all people.

175
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:34.950
So the one of the ideas,

176
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.860
so the GDA is you don't give up what you're born to do.

177
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.900
You do what you do, but in a spiritual way,

178
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.740
you don't try to like wipe out your desires. It's not gonna happen.

179
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.220
You take what you do and you do it in a way that is gonna assist you

180
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.170
in your liberation. And is it gonna assist everybody else? So, um,

181
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.130
even I'll say I love comedy,

182
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:04.010
but I want comedy that uplifts me and not doesn't degrade me.

183
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.210
I like entertainment that when I walk away from it, I learn something.

184
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.610
I feel like I'm growing. I feel connected. I don't want stuff.

185
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.650
That's gonna just give me darker thoughts.

186
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.793
<v 0>Like the joker.</v>

187
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.680
<v 4>I I'm never seen it. You didn't see it. I didn't I'm.</v>

188
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.640
I wanna say that I live on a farm &lt;laugh&gt; I live on a farm.

189
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.880
We rare, I rarely watch anything except comedy. I love comedy. Um,

190
00:10:27.881 --> 00:10:31.400
cause I think laughing's important. Um, but I don't watch so much TV.

191
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.200
Um, so I'm, I'm, I'm pretty, if I do go to the movie movies,

192
00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:39.510
it's out of like with my wife, let's just, we wanna get away from the kids.

193
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:43.470
We wanna do something. Right. Um, but there's no plan on what to watch,

194
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.990
but I'm open to good ideas.

195
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.790
<v 0>The jokers, a really good movie, but it's really dark. It's really dark.</v>

196
00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:52.030
Like you walk outta there feeling really confused. Like you're like,

197
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.870
did I like that? I don't know if I like that. I know it was awesome.

198
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.060
I know it was really well done, but did I like that?
