1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.120
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Okay. So for, for those people first off,</v>

2
00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:10.000
who have no idea who the hell I am? Um, I'm the guy who was behind,

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.800
uh, the revelations of global mass surveillance in 2013. Um,

4
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.840
I worked for the CIA.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.560
I worked for the NSA as a contractor at the NSA staff officer,

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.470
the CIA undercover working at emsies. Um, but,

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.950
uh, and I talk about the difference between this in a book and contractor and

8
00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:31.950
government official and how it it's all sort of lost its meaning. Uh,

9
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.950
but I saw something wrong. Um,

10
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:36.750
and I saw basically the government was violating the law, um,

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.470
and what I believed to be the constitution to the United States and more broadly

12
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.580
human, uh, for everyone in the United States and around the world,

13
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:45.220
there were domestic surveillance programs.

14
00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:48.660
There were mass surveillance programs, uh, that worked internationally, um,

15
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.220
basically everything that they could monitor, uh, they were monitoring. Um,

16
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.100
and this is actually like people go, well, isn't that obvious?

17
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.260
Isn't that what they're supposed to? And this is weird,

18
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.570
but the answer actually is no. Um, under the framework of our constitution,

19
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.050
the government is only supposed to be monitoring people that it has an

20
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.970
individualized particularized, uh, suspicion of wrongdoing for,

21
00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.930
right. Uh, this is, we think about this in the investigative means, right?

22
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.850
Like all those TV shows where they're like go and get a warrant,

23
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.730
the reason they have to do that, like we fought a, a revolution O over this,

24
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.560
uh, you know, a couple hundred years back, um, is the idea that when we had,

25
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.800
you know, Kings, when we had governments of absolute power, uh,

26
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:34.320
they could simply go in your home and go, you know, is this guy a pot smoker,

27
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:36.720
get his diary, you know, whatever it is. And just like,

28
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:40.040
if you find evidence of a crime, you March him off to prison and it's all good.

29
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.150
You found evidence they're criminal, or you didn't find a evidence. Well,

30
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.750
no harm, no foul. You're just doing what government does. Um,

31
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.110
we were trying to build a better system where it went, yes,

32
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.830
the government has extraordinary capabilities,

33
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.790
but it only uses them where they're they're necessary. Right. Uh, where they're,

34
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.980
uh, proportionate to the threat that is presented by person. You know, like we,

35
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:08.100
we shouldn't be afraid of the person who's got like a baggy of weed, uh,

36
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.140
in their dresser or, or something like that.

37
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:11.780
That is not a threat to national security.

38
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:16.660
That is not a threat to public safety. Um, but what happened in,

39
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:18.740
in the wake of nine 11 was a whole bunch of, uh,

40
00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:21.420
government officials got together behind closed doors. Uh,

41
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:23.930
and this was actually led interestingly enough,

42
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:26.570
by the vice president of the United statescheney, uh,

43
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:30.570
everybody remembers that name or hopefully &lt;laugh&gt;, uh, can look that name up.

44
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.810
Um, dickcheney uh, and his personal attorney, uh, sort of the,

45
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.570
the Giuliani of dickcheney, um, uh,

46
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:42.690
a guy named David addingington and this lawyer,

47
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:47.480
David addingddingington wrote a secret legal interpretation, uh,

48
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.760
that no one else was allowed to see, uh,

49
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:53.200
it was kept in the vice president's safe at the white house. Um, they,

50
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:55.120
they weren't giving this even when they told people.

51
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.280
And it was just a couple people in Congress. Um, uh,

52
00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:02.480
Nancy Pelosi was one of 'em and a couple of these other folks, um,

53
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.960
when they talked, uh,

54
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.600
to the heads of the agency at the NSA and the CIA and the FBI and all this

55
00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:12.800
stuff, uh, they told them the white house and the office of legal counsel, and,

56
00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:15.360
you know, this, this, uh, the president's attorneys, uh,

57
00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:18.670
all of these guys had decided this would be legal to do &lt;affirmative&gt;,

58
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.110
but we can't tell you why &lt;laugh&gt; we can't show you the legal authorization for

59
00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:27.350
it. You just gotta take our word for it. Um, and so they did this,

60
00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:30.110
and this became a mass surveillance program called stellar wind,

61
00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:33.750
which they said, was supposed to monitor the phone calls, uh,

62
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:36.870
and internet communications emails and things like that,

63
00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:40.100
of everybody in the United States and around the world who they could get access

64
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.940
to for links to Alqaeda. Because if you remember in the, the wake of,

65
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.820
uh, the September 11th attacks, they were singing, um,

66
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.900
we thought there could be sleeper cells of Al Qaeda that was just, you know,

67
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:55.940
peppered all throughout the country.

68
00:03:55.941 --> 00:03:57.580
And they were gonna spring up at any moment, of course,

69
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.490
like weapons of mass destruction. It just didn't exist. It was all a power grab.

70
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.690
Um, but on that basis,

71
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.330
they started doing this in secret and it was completely unconstitutional.

72
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:08.290
It was completely illegal,

73
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.130
even under the very loose requirements of the Patriot act. Um,

74
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.290
but they did it for so long that they got comfortable with it. And they thought,

75
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.650
this is, you know, this is a really powerful capability.

76
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:23.000
What have we started using this for stuff that was other than terrorism,

77
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:27.440
cuz it wasn't finding any terrorists because there weren't any terroristss uh,

78
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.360
in this context that they were looking for them, uh, and the ones who, uh,

79
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:32.480
where there were terrorists,

80
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.000
the program wasn't affected because these were guys in Pakistan that,

81
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:39.040
that weren't using, you know, email and phone calls. They were getting on a,

82
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:39.450
you know,

83
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.470
moped with their cousin was a courier who was bringing a letter to his guy,

84
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.390
you know, who runs the, the food stand or whatever. Um, but,

85
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.110
uh, bit by bit over time, this grew and grew and grew and there were scandals.

86
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:54.510
And if you want to drill down on these later, I'll, I'll go into 'em.

87
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.350
But what happened was step by step by step. Um,

88
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.700
our constitutional rights were changed. Um, and we weren't allowed to know it.

89
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.500
We were never granted a vote on it. And even the many members of Congress,

90
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:11.860
right? 535 in the United States, uh,

91
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.100
they were prohibited from knowing this. Uh,

92
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.580
and instead they told only a few select people, uh, in the original case,

93
00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:23.050
there were only eight members of Congress called the hang of eight who knew

94
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:26.130
about this. Um, then there were, uh,

95
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.930
the people on the intelligence committees, uh,

96
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:31.730
both in the Senate and the house who were told about this. Uh,

97
00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:33.410
but they were only told partially about it.

98
00:05:33.411 --> 00:05:35.450
They weren't told the full scope of it. Uh,

99
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.730
and now that they had been told about it because they had security clearances

100
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:41.290
and things like that, they weren't allowed to tell anybody else, uh,

101
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:45.960
even if they objected to it. And we had one Senator, uh, Ron wideden, um,

102
00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:46.521
and another one,

103
00:05:46.521 --> 00:05:49.720
I believe Tom UDAL was the name of him who did object to this and who wanted

104
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:52.760
something to happen, but because they couldn't tell anybody that was havinging,

105
00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:56.120
they were sort of doing these weird lasy barks, uh,

106
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.400
to the press where they were like,

107
00:05:57.401 --> 00:06:00.120
we have grave concerns about the way these programs are being carried out,

108
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.560
but nobody knew what they were talking about. And so journalists were like,

109
00:06:04.561 --> 00:06:06.400
you know, they've got concerns. What is that? Lastly,

110
00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:09.040
what are you trying to say? Tim's them well, but they were getting it wrong.

111
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.080
They couldn't tell what was happening. And so what had happened was that we,

112
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:17.310
the American people and sort of lost our seat at the table of government.

113
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.910
Uh, we were no longer partner to government.

114
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:23.230
We had simply become subject to government. And I think everybody, uh,

115
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.590
who's in the world today, uh, who is aware of what's going on,

116
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.550
whether it's under this administration, the last administration,

117
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.550
the one before that, right. Uh,

118
00:06:32.551 --> 00:06:37.380
they have seen a constant kind of shift where

119
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.140
we have, we, the public have less say and less influence over the policy,

120
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.900
uh, of government, uh, with each passing year, there's kind of a,

121
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.340
a new class that's being created a government class. And, and then the, the,

122
00:06:50.341 --> 00:06:54.060
the public, uh, civil class that are held to different standards of behavior.

123
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.220
And when we start talking about leaking and whistlelowing,

124
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.090
this becomes even more clear. And so, uh,

125
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:03.890
what I did was I wanted to clarify that kind of Lassy mark, right? Uh,

126
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.770
I just wanted everybody to know what was going on. Uh, I didn't wanna say, uh,

127
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.850
the government can't do this. I didn't wanna say, uh,

128
00:07:11.851 --> 00:07:15.250
this is how you guys have to live because that's not for me to say. Uh,

129
00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:18.680
but I do believe that everybody in the United States and more oddly people in

130
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:21.920
the world who are having the rights violated by a government, uh,

131
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:24.760
should have at least an understanding of how that is happening,

132
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.520
what the authorities, uh,

133
00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:31.160
sort of the policies and programs that are enabling that are so that they can

134
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.480
protest them so that they can cast a vote about them, who, so that they can say,

135
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:40.190
you know what you guys say, this is okay, but I disagree that this is not okay.

136
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.710
I object and I want things to change.

137
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.310
And so I gathered evidence of what I believe to be, uh,

138
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.990
criminal or unconstitutional, uh, activity on the part of the government. Um,

139
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.510
and I gave this to journalists right now. I gave this to journalists,

140
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.950
uh, under a very strict condition here,

141
00:07:55.951 --> 00:08:00.020
which was that they published no story in this arc type of information,

142
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.860
simply because it was interesting, right? No click bait,

143
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.980
not anything just because, uh, they thought it would make news.

144
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:07.860
It would get them awards. Uh,

145
00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:11.380
they would only publish stories that they were willing to make an institutional

146
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.660
judgment and stand behind. Uh, and this was three different newspapers, um,

147
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.530
that it was in the public interest to know. Um,

148
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.330
and so then beyond that, there was additional cuz &lt;laugh&gt;,

149
00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:26.930
if you could see sort of what I was doing here, what had happened,

150
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:31.930
what had led us into this, uh, pitfall was that, um,

151
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.460
the system of checks and balances that supposed to self-regulate,

152
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.490
our government had failed. Uh, the courts had, uh,

153
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:45.090
abdicated their role in policing the executive in the Congress because terrorism

154
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.850
was such a, uh, hot argument at the time,

155
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.250
they were worried about being criticized and blamed. If something went wrong,

156
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.440
an attack did go through and they didn't have access to the information that the

157
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:56.480
programs were ineffective.

158
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.400
So they were just taking the government's word for it and they didn't wanna wait

159
00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.360
in, uh, Congress. Most of them didn't even know. Right. Um, and,

160
00:09:04.361 --> 00:09:06.800
and the ones who did know it was the same thing. Uh,

161
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.880
they were getting their pockets stuffed with money by the defense contractors

162
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.200
that were getting rich for building these systems that were violating the rights

163
00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:17.550
of each of us. Uh, so they benefited by just saying nothing.

164
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.350
And then the executive themselves, uh, whether we're talking about Bush, right?

165
00:09:21.351 --> 00:09:24.750
Whether we're talking about Obama or whether we're talking about Trump now, uh,

166
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:28.910
all these guys were okay with a constantly growing surveillance state because

167
00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:32.430
they're the ones whose hands were on the lever at the time they got to aim it.

168
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:36.140
They got to use it. Uh, if you had a little search box in front of you,

169
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.100
they would give you the email history and you know,

170
00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:41.300
of everybody in the United States, anybody you want,

171
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.900
if you could pull up their text messages, anybody you want,

172
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.060
if you could see anything they've ever typed into that Google search box, right.

173
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.940
Joe, what is the worst thing you've ever typed into that search box that

174
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.290
lasts forever, right? And they have a record of that they can get from Google.

175
00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.610
Uh, and, and so this was, this was the whole thing. Um,

176
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.730
how do we correct for that? So when you have somebody, uh,

177
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.490
who wants to inform the public of something, uh,

178
00:10:07.491 --> 00:10:10.370
and we'll get into the proper channels arguments later, um,

179
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.410
but you can't go through the institution to get these corrected because the

180
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.000
institu knows it's wrong and is doing it anyway. Right. That's the whole, uh,

181
00:10:20.001 --> 00:10:23.800
origin of the program is they want to do something that they're not allowed to

182
00:10:23.801 --> 00:10:26.840
do. Uh, what do you do? Right.

183
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.240
And so I didn't wanna say I'm the president of secrets.

184
00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:31.840
I didn't want to just put this stuff on the internet and I could have I'm a

185
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:36.360
technologist. Right. Um, I worked with the journalists and then, uh,

186
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:39.550
to create an adversarial step, right. Uh,

187
00:10:39.551 --> 00:10:42.910
someone who would argue against what I believed and hopefully what the

188
00:10:42.911 --> 00:10:45.990
journalists believed once they consulted the documents and, uh,

189
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.550
basically authenticated them, um,

190
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.710
can we get the government to play that role? Right. Um,

191
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.020
and so before the journalists published any story, and this is, uh,

192
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.580
a controversial thing, people still criticize me for this.

193
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.620
Actually they say I was too accommodated in government. They,

194
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:04.580
they could be right. Um,

195
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.900
is that the journalists would go to the government and give them warning, say,

196
00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:12.580
we're about to run this story about this secret program that says you did X, Y,

197
00:11:12.581 --> 00:11:17.460
and Z bad thing. One is that right. And the government will always go,

198
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:21.130
oh, no comment, right? Uh, two, is this gonna cause harm?

199
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.850
Is anybody gonna get hurt? Is this program effective?

200
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.210
Is there something we don't understand? Right. Uh,

201
00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:28.370
is there something snowed and doesn't understand,

202
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.370
is this guy just not get it right? Are these documents fake, whatever you want.

203
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.210
Say, we shouldn't run this story. And,

204
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.400
and every case I'm aware of that process was followed. And that's why, right.

205
00:11:39.401 --> 00:11:41.520
Because there's a lot of people out there who don't like me, who,

206
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.280
who criticized me, who go, this was unsafe,

207
00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:45.240
this caused harm to people or whatever.

208
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.760
We're in 2019 now, uh, I came forward, uh,

209
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:54.280
and these stories won the putz prize for public service journalism, uh,

210
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:58.320
starting way back in June of 2013. Uh,

211
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.680
we've had six years to show bodies. We've had six years to show harm and,

212
00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.680
you know, as well as I do, uh,

213
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:09.080
the government's happy to leak things when it's in, in their interest. Uh,

214
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.590
nobody has been hurt as a result of these disclosures as everyone who was

215
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.230
involved in them was so careful.

216
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:20.470
We wanted to maximize the public benefit while mitigating the potential risks.

217
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.950
Uh, and I think we did a pretty good job of it, but just to get back to the,

218
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.670
the, the main thing, the original thing that got us off, uh, on that trail,

219
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.910
when I came forward in June of 2013, I,

220
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:36.900
I gave one interview to the people who were in the room, uh, with the documents,

221
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.020
uh, Laura POS, Glen Greenwell, you and MCC mccaski. And I said, who I was,

222
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.980
I said, why I was doing this? I said, what? This was about why it matters. Um,

223
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.900
and that we were constructing a system of turnkey tyranny. Uh,

224
00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:50.180
and even if you trust that to Obama,

225
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.090
you never know whose hand is gonna be on that key next and only to do is turn

226
00:12:54.091 --> 00:12:57.090
it. And there's nothing we can do to stop it. Uh,

227
00:12:57.091 --> 00:12:59.370
the only thing that's restraining these programs really is,

228
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.930
is policy more so than the law and the president at any time can sign a

229
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.850
napkin and those policies change. Uh, well, after that,

230
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.570
I went six months, uh, without giving any interviews, uh,

231
00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:13.930
because I didn't want people to talk about me.

232
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.200
I wanted them to talk about what actually mattered.

233
00:13:16.201 --> 00:13:17.020
And the government of course,

234
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.320
was trying very hard to change the conversation as they always do to be about

235
00:13:21.321 --> 00:13:24.080
who is this guy? What have they done, right. What's wrong with him?

236
00:13:24.081 --> 00:13:27.640
What are their problems? Who is this, this loony guy? Uh, so they can,

237
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.480
controversialize the source of a story rather than having to confront the,

238
00:13:32.481 --> 00:13:37.310
the story itself. Uh, and, and th that's why I said, it's, I,

239
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.950
I, I really kind of appreciate &lt;laugh&gt;, uh,

240
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.430
your, your take on the media and everything like that, because, uh,

241
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.430
when you don't tell your story, you know, other people will tell it for you. Uh,

242
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:54.670
they'll say so many things about you and they'll have these MIS impressions like

243
00:13:54.671 --> 00:13:56.620
I did, because if something is stupid as,

244
00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:59.020
as the avatar that you were using on Twitter, right.

245
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.220
Where I think it's a certain kind of show with a certain kind of guy,

246
00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:05.340
and it's this crazy stuff. But when I actually listen to you,

247
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.820
when I actually look at the facts, right, and when I hear you just speak,

248
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.340
I go, actually, this is a thoughtful guy. Uh,

249
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.140
actually this is somebody who does care,

250
00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:18.690
who does my wanna look at these things deeply, uh, and appearances, uh,

251
00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:21.130
and our first impressions, uh, can be very misleading.

252
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.010
<v 1>Uh, I work hard on that. I try to mislead people. It's good.</v>

253
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.970
&lt;laugh&gt; works to my advantage. You're doing a good job, man. Thank you.

254
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:38.720
<v 2>I.</v>
