00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 2>And here's a good Testament to how,</v>

3
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.040
if you see past the of what divides us and labeling people,

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.440
this and that, you can always cuz we had a lot Jason flam and I,

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.960
you know, who's a board member at the innocence project.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.560
We were overwhelmed by the outreach,

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.950
just from being on your show and talking to people. How can I help?

8
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.270
One thing you can do to help is always keep an open mind with regardless of who

9
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:31.750
you're dealing with. That's an easy way to help watch this.

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.630
I represent the chairman of Marvel entertainment.

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.510
His name is Ike Perlmutter billionaire.

12
00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:42.340
Many times over he's happens to be closest friends with

13
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:44.380
Donald Trump way before he was president.

14
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.580
I could have used that as a way to separate myself from him, um,

15
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.780
to dismiss him. And I represented him.

16
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.380
I still do in this wild case where his DNA was stolen and he was accused of

17
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:00.300
something he didn't do.

18
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.010
<v 0>And I Perlmutter at,</v>

19
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.690
at one point said you're not paying enough attention to my case.

20
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.170
And it was because I was working on an exoneration case in Florida Clemente's

21
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:14.810
case actually. And he, he started following the case in the press.

22
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.170
And this isn't a guy that was like some criminal justice reform advocate.

23
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.850
He said it struck him that if I,

24
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.800
he didn't have you and Roy Black,

25
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.120
who's a famous criminal defense lawyer that was handling this civil case.

26
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.120
If I didn't have you and the resources to fight this,

27
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.920
I would've been accused of a crime. I didn't commit.

28
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.240
And it struck him that he had the resources to make a difference.

29
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:42.160
So he started making gifts in my honor to the innocence project,

30
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.470
substantial gifts. And I could have everybody around me said,

31
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:49.830
you're friends with this guy. You've become friends with him.

32
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.510
And he got enlightened to the point where in December,

33
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.630
I'm in Florida a week before the capital riot,

34
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.830
he called me and said, Josh, look

35
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.460
on to help get somebody executive clemency, if I can.

36
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.620
And I want you to figure out one person that you think is, you know, the most,

37
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.300
um, deserving candidate for it. And let's try to get it before the president.

38
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.420
I was in Florida, he was in Florida. He said,

39
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:24.970
you're gonna meet with the president and look,

40
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.130
a lot of people would've said to me, crazy, how could you meet with him? I said,

41
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.330
I don't care about any of that. I'm trying to save a life. So there's a,

42
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.890
a retired judge,

43
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.890
federal judge named John Gleason who started this project called the Holloway

44
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:41.130
project where his, he,

45
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.040
he started to realize exactly what you were about people on nonviolent

46
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:49.640
drug offenses, where there were just disproportionate sentences.

47
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.440
He had a list of people where, you know, to come up with one was difficult,

48
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.880
but I asked him Barry, she, um,

49
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.840
who's the one of the founders of the innocence project and various others.

50
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.160
Who do you think is if you had to gimme a list of 10?

51
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.920
So I got li and judge Gleason's client was this guy named Juad

52
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.480
MUA, who was in Baltimore,

53
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.960
the worst possible circumstances.

54
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.630
He gets a rested on this reverse dry sting.

55
00:03:21.631 --> 00:03:25.630
They call it where he's asked to cobble together $20,000

56
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.390
and make a heroin purchase in New York and no drugs

57
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.430
ever existed. It was all a scheme. It was a setup by an informant.

58
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.860
He cobbles together. Five of the 20,000 and dollars goes to New York,

59
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.940
gets arrested on the spot and sentenced to life in prison. Jesus.

60
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.420
So I read about him. He's in jail for over 30 years. Oh Jesus. He has,

61
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.900
he has 52 degrees certificates.

62
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.530
Um, by all account, judge Gleason said, look,

63
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:05.130
he pointed out areas in the law that I had never considered. So I,

64
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.810
I could not get this guy off my mind. So I,

65
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.250
I finally put him forward as the person. So I,

66
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.290
I thought that I would submit paperwork and that it would go away.

67
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.560
So one week before the capital riots, I called me and said,

68
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.600
you're gonna come to dinner tonight with your wife

69
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.720
and you're gonna present the case to various people in the white house. Um,

70
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.800
at Mar Lago.

71
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.480
Now there are some Democrats left leaning or otherwise you're gonna go to Mar

72
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.680
Lago. And I would always say, hell yes, I'm going there.

73
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.240
I'm gonna try to save someone's life.

74
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.150
I with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner,

75
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.150
and just explained to them the case. And I gotta tell you,

76
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.790
she said, look, I really admire your work at the innocence project. Um,

77
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.830
think this is really noble. We, we think that this is a,

78
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.550
a great candidate for executive clemency. And it was like throughout the dinner,

79
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.020
it was on to the next person onto the next person.

80
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.780
So at one point there's a table like we're sitting at a table and

81
00:05:08.781 --> 00:05:12.860
literally the distance you and I are from each other. There's two empty seats.

82
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.300
And it dawns on me that we're gonna be having dinner with the president and his

83
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:17.134
wife.

84
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.010
So at some point he walks out and everybody stands at Marla and clap.

85
00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:26.650
When he comes out like Kim, Jon UN &lt;laugh&gt; was worse than that.

86
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.610
I have you ever seen the Kim Jon UN I, I saw you see the most recent one.

87
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.010
I saw the videos of it. Yeah. You see the recent one? No,

88
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.890
the recent one is mind blowing. He walks in, but we'll get to that in a minute.

89
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.010
Go ahead. So, so, so I said to Ike, do I have to stand and clap? And he goes,

90
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:44.280
if you want your part in and you do. So I stood and clapped.

91
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.040
So dinner is progressing and we're not talking. And fi you know,

92
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:53.160
we're not talking about this. So finally Ike says to me, look,

93
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.960
he wants to talk to you about this case now.

94
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.720
And he asked me a bunch of very pointed questions. So all of a sudden,

95
00:06:00.721 --> 00:06:04.560
then I find myself at a table, my wife, myself, the president,

96
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.120
the first lady, Ike Perlmutter, and his wife. And he says, look, I hear,

97
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.240
I hear great things about you from, I tell me about the case. Tremendous,

98
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.190
tremendous things. I mean, it was so, oh, loony.

99
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.070
I remember him saying, I want ice cream, ice cream, two scoops.

100
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.230
I want two scoops, two scoops. He kept saying,

101
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.190
I don't know why that stuck with me. But he said, he told me this story.

102
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:32.910
He said, you know, do you, uh, do you think he's innocent?

103
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.190
I said, no, I don't think he's innocent. I'm executive clemency.

104
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.260
&lt;laugh&gt; I we're asking you to pardon in him. It was a non-violent drug offense.

105
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.540
I explained the whole case to him. And he said, I can't.

106
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.540
I had Jim brown come to me, the famous running back. And the guy was a murderer.

107
00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:49.860
I couldn't do that. I only want non-violent drug offenses. And he said,

108
00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:53.100
where is he gonna work? When he gets out? And I said, I've offered him a job.

109
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.900
He has this paralegal certificate that he got in jail. And he said,

110
00:06:56.901 --> 00:07:00.610
you'll employ him. I'll employ him a week later.

111
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.370
So I meet with him. He tells me, call white house council.

112
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.570
And then a week later, the capital ride happens.

113
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.890
So everybody involved in this potential presidential part

114
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.530
is like, well, this is a rap. This isn't happening.

115
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.960
The last day of his presidency.

116
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.520
The last day I was at Ike's apartment with my wife and kids

117
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.560
and the phone rang. And he goes, it's the white house. Um,

118
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.440
he said, don't go anywhere.

119
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.360
Cuz we were walking out and he walked out and he said, the partum was just side.

120
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.750
And the, the, I don't know this man. I never met him.

121
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.270
My immediate release of, I started to weep openly. Um,

122
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.830
you know, it,

123
00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:54.390
there's just no feeling that you can ever put into words

124
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.580
when you help restore another human being in that way. Now ju MOA.

125
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.980
Uh, and I met for the first time over FaceTime, you know,

126
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:09.140
four days later I flew his brother to meet him. He was in Colorado,

127
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.300
some awful facility in Colorado. I flew his brother out there.

128
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.220
He got out like that. The pardon happens. And then you're out.

129
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.410
He was flown back to Baltimore.

130
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:26.610
We met in the airport on FaceTime and we were immediately felt like bonded

131
00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:27.444
like brothers.

132
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.210
He now works for me and his insights in the

133
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.170
five months, four or five months that he's been out his insights on cases,

134
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.000
a man that's spent 30, some odd year working on it became like a jail lawyer.

135
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.440
You realize that there are people,

136
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.880
human beings that have been forgotten that have so much potential.

137
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.360
If someone just cares. So now he's, you know,

138
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.200
it's not without problems.

139
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:58.120
He's working on getting his official out of jail paralegal certificate.

140
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.600
But you realize that if you just create connections and,

141
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.880
and allow, I don't wanna sound like some silly infomercial,

142
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:10.560
but I easily could have found reasons why not to try to enlighten someone whose

143
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.430
politics were different than mine and Ike prom was likely person.

144
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.230
But he's now I've found that if I, if you tap into it and,

145
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.150
and turn his mind on to the human suffering,

146
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.470
he now wants to start a criminal justice reform center that we're working on

147
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:28.543
together. That's amazing.

148
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:32.310
So I just feel like sometimes in a world where our politics are so divided,

149
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.860
it was one of the more bizarre meals I've ever had. I oops.

150
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.133
<v 1>Scoops.</v>

151
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.660
