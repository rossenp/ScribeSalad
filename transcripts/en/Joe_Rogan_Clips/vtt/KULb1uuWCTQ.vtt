<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.560
<v 1>Experience. Vito fight fights on fights on here we go.</v>

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.240
<v 0>Oh. Oh, you're crazy. Don't think Vito taking all the yai AAI, by the way, AAI.</v>

<v 1>A, you could take whatever you want because Amazonian Amazonian,</v>

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.160
hers were really, that's one of the interesting things.

6
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:20.400
When you look at other organizations outside of the UFC, that's tested by,

7
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.910
you saw as soon as you see someone who, you know,

8
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.990
for sure used to do testosterone, but then wasn't allowed to,

9
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.070
you see a subsequent performance dip and then you see them reengage after

10
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:34.710
they leave the organization. It's fantastic. It doesn't take,

11
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.710
inspect your Kau to your figure out that way. No, you don't. It doesn't,

12
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.660
you don't have to call in Colombo.

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.140
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; and you know what, you know, what's weird, you know,</v>

14
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:47.740
what's weird about having no audience there. It reminds me of when I used to,

15
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.740
uh, DJ had strip clubs on Saturday afternoons and they'd be nobody there,

16
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.620
the same thing. It was the.

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.140
<v 0>Same thing. And what I did.</v>

18
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.460
<v 2>What I did, I swear to God, I would take,</v>

19
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.530
I would have like a sampler in the DJ booth where I could I sampled kiss alive.

20
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:06.610
Like just the audience. So I, I got tired of.

21
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.993
<v 0>Massive.</v>

22
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.010
<v 1>Men's just cracked him over rooms in big trouble. Oh. Only dinged.</v>

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.730
<v 2>Them again. The biggest trouble it's over. Not yet. It's.</v>

24
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.370
<v 0>Over. It's back. Oh, he's getting still alive.</v>

25
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.250

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.920
<v 2>Lot of time, dude. That's a lot of.</v>

53
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.520
<v 1>Time. And over him has been in trouble so many times and come through, you know,</v>

54
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:55.360

55
00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:58.360
you wanna talk about a guy who's been through the trenches. We talk.

56
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.840
<v 0>About every time we get together, when.</v>

57
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.120
<v 2>Wolverine fought Brock,</v>

58
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.200
Leer might have been the scariest heavy of all time of all time of all time of

59
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.040
all time. I was fine. That time I peak.

60
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.320
Was he still eating horseman at the time?

61
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.600
<v 1>Yes. The horse meat. He was all the horse meat. But my, my belief is,</v>

62
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.040
if you go deep into the history, you're gonna go into horse meat. Okay.

63
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.790
But if you look at all the results of horse meat, that one guy who fought,

64
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.150
Lesner fantastic with, with,

65
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.270
with some sort of blind deaf guy who was doing the drug test.

66
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.910
&lt;laugh&gt; some dude who couldn't read, like how the?

67
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.430
What of tests do you have.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.220
<v 2>I hung out with them in Amsterdam back in 2001.</v>

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.010
<v 0>Oh yeah. Great time, dude. He wanted to fight. Everybody was, it was the glory.</v>

80
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.050
hosted this big MMA show with a terrible.

81
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.250
So I met them in pride when I worked for pride. Ouch. Oh.

82
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.050
I'll tell you the story later. No, no.

83
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.040
<v 0>I'm listening. We gotta watch.</v>

84
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.400
<v 1>One story. We definitely wanna hear, we gotta watch. This.</v>

85
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.200
<v 0>Is gonna go to the second round. Keep going this.</v>

86
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.480
<v 1>Watch the fight. This might not go to the second round. Oh it, well, there's.</v>

87
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.920
<v 0>30 Seconds. Left fell. Wallace.</v>

88
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.040
<v 1>Took big deep breaths, big, deep breaths and OV HIMS moving to Mount. Uh,</v>

89
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.080
he just looked at the clock. Mount's fine, dude. He could stop him right here.

90
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.550
This is possible. Ovums been around forever son, but it's 20.

91
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.383
<v 2>Seconds. Its.</v>

92
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.343
<v 0>1990.</v>

93
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.470
<v 1>He could still stop him. Here's very possible right.</v>

94
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.110
<v 2>Here. I dunno. Why's it's too.</v>

95
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.750
<v 1>Dude. happened. Look at the, look at that body. Come on, man. Dude.</v>

96
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.190
I'm telling you he's nasty. He's some of the

97
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.060
Nale come on, Wal. Those are big knees, man.

98
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.620
His knees are the best in the heavyweight division. The best, the best,

99
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.480
the best.

100
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.380
<v 0>Him and doom.</v>

101
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.020
<v 1>Have great knees. K Mark Hunt, KD, but basically K broccoli. Well, you know,</v>

102
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.100
Brocker combination. It kicks to the body. The kick knows the body is what did.

103
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.180
<v 0>It knew. He had a weak body.</v>

104
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.100
<v 1>You also always, I don't wanna make excuses for anybody,</v>

105
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.890
but you always have to take any consideration that I was a guy who had just had

106
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.730
dive diverticulitis surgery and had something like 12 to 14 inches of his

107
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:30.450
colon removed and over intestines. Right? Yeah. And over.

108
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.410
<v 0>Oh your intestines removed, check this out. He do that's.</v>

109
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.330
<v 1>Right in the gut. And.</v>

110
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
<v 0>You see, you see Leslie girl like this and that's when he finished him. Yeah.</v>

111
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.280
<v 1>He had so I, I, I believe it was like somewhere around go Google,</v>

112
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.000
find out how much Brock Lesner had removed from his intestine.

113
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.080
He had a really serious disease and they think he had it for a long time. Man.

114
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:50.740
Brock was.

115
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.120
<v 0>So good. Yeah. And people didn't realize how good he was.</v>

116
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.880
He got catapulted in the stardom man. He didn't have much experience.

117
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.760
Beat knocked out. Randy couture, beat Shane Carwin. Yeah.

118
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.520
<v 1>Knocked out. Randy. Kotor Shane.</v>

119
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.280
<v 0>Carwin submitted him. Yes. After taking a beating. How about the Frank mirror?</v>

120
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.240
Rematch.

121
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.073
<v 1>Go.</v>

122
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.680
<v 2>You see the power. I don't, if you saw that transition, but that transition,</v>

123
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.680
they just replayed uh, uh,

124
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.710
a Walt came at him with a front kick and over him just pushed him and just

125
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.710
threw my level, my superhero to the side. Did you see that?

126
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.510
There's like some serious power going on here.

127
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.390
<v 1>It's interesting because like who would wat Harris be? If they let him juice,</v>

128
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.870
you know this I'm and I'm not saying these guys juice, I'm just joking around.

129
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:35.070
When I say that, let him juice, but also let them juice,

130
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.740
but also let them juice. But, but the thing is when I,

131
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:40.860
when I'm just as a curious person, I'm like,

132
00:06:40.861 --> 00:06:44.660
what would happen if you gave him all the chemicals that we know that make your

133
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:45.660
body perform better? Because.

134
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.540
<v 0>Remember what was gonna want to go to the NBA?</v>

135
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.060
What was a serious basketball player? Really? His footwork's ridiculous. Wow.

136
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.620
<v 1>Well these guys, when,</v>

137
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:58.170
when you take these guys that have experience high level experience in, uh,

138
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.850
major league sports where the competition is fierce from childhood on,

139
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.570
you know, these guys, they develop a, a,

140
00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:08.890
they have a different kind of work ethic. You know,

141
00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:12.210
that's why Hersha Walker was ever able to fight MMA. When is it?

142
00:07:12.211 --> 00:07:15.530
His late forties? True nuts. Different kinda work ethic, man.

143
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.850
<v 0>But it doesn't always work. Cuz remember Johnny Morton was like,</v>

144
00:07:17.851 --> 00:07:22.040
oh I wanna try that cut. And he was knocked out too well forever.

145
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.760
<v 2>What happened with Johnny Morton? What happened with Johnny Morton was the,</v>

146
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.160
the worst, the worst case scenario. Oh Jesus Christ.

147
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.720
A fighting MMA is getting knocked down,

148
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.480
put on a stretcher and taking out that's the worst race on decide.

149
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.910
He's like Johnny Mor. Why receiv aour he goes, let's do it.

150
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.470
Let's avoid worst case scenario. Worst, worst case scenario.

151
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.870
He got the Coliseum in LA. He gets taken out of a stretcher. Oh, show.

152
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.030
<v 1>My over.</v>

153
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.950

165
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:31.564

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:32.330

169
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.800
You and I were there and I sat next to crazy horse. I, me and Charles Ben.

170
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.000
<v 2>Got drunk and hid together. Wow. What a great night. That was that.</v>

171
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.680
Did you say? Uh Hoak Robert too. Did.

172
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.480
<v 1>You mention that? No. No. That was on the car though. You forget about.</v>

173
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.040
<v 0>That. This was on show.</v>

174
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.440
<v 1>Fight. You're stop. Stop this fight. He stop it up.</v>

175
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.400
It's over. It's over. There's no way he's gonna survive that. Yeah.

176
00:09:03.401 --> 00:09:05.720
He's just gonna keep beating him unless he submits him.

177
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.520
You can't stop it over this. Who's the who the, you can, if he,

178
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.680
if he picks up there's tempo, Martin just got knocked out.

179
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.040
If he picks up the tempo, he could, he could stop it.

180
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:17.070
Morgan got knocked up by stop them right there. Stopped it. Ah. Listen, man.

181
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:18.550
You, you just, you make the,

182
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.790
the educated decision that a guy's in a position that he's not gonna be able to

183
00:09:21.791 --> 00:09:24.750
improve. Are you aware of that by a decision poor Walt Harris.

184
00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.470
It's a good decision. Cause that fight it's tough because he like over,

185
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.510
you wanna give him a chance, but the reality is can't defend.

186
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.620
Can't defend that spot. He's kind of made there. You know what?

187
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:38.440
That, that whole,

188
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.700
the whole debate about whether or not it's a good idea to stop a fight.

189
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.100
It's real tricky, man. You know,

190
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:46.300
Dominic Cruz said to the referee before the fight, he said,

191
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.740
don't stop it unless I'm dead. Especially in a championship fight.

192
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.780
Don't stop late on dude. Well move, watch this move. But the guy is,

193
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.970
he didn't know what's gonna happen. Oh my God. Amazing.

194
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.290
That was a great combo over him, over him. He still,

195
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.450
he's still one of the best man.

196
00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:06.810
Watch his he's the greatest heavyweight striker of all time in new hands. Boom.

197
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.330
And then watched his body shot. Watch his body shot. Boom.

198
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.850
That's why it's so terrifying that Francis sent him to the dark lens.

199
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.880
What's probably the best I, out of all time,

200
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.400
that uppercut who's be Francis the howling in between the world that's happened,

201
00:10:21.401 --> 00:10:24.160
John, John Jones. Right. That was like, you know it's gonna happen, right? No,

202
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.520
I don't know, man. They're just talking right now happens. We gotta go find,

203
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.320
and that that's right. That was like, when, uh,

204
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.480
when Billbo Bains puts on the ring, you,

205
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.230
he goes to the dimension in the Hobbit dude, you know, I'm talking about yeah,

206
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.630
that's what it was like. That was one of the worst knockouts I've ever seen.

207
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.230
And remember the swinging it's like go yeah, you see.
