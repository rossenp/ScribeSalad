<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 2>You know, that knee you landed on. Frankie was crazy.</v>

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.120
I was by myself watching TV and I screamed out loud. &lt;laugh&gt; you know,

4
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:12.800
it was one of those. Oh yeah.

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.600
And that's a common thing in my house where people like, are you okay?

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.880
I'm like watching the.

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.870
<v 0>Fights. Yeah. That nasty one do. It was.</v>

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.710
<v 1>So perfect. Yeah. It was you timed it. So perfect.</v>

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.430
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, he wasn't doing any of the hitting the brakes, you know,</v>

10
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.270
everything he was doing was just forward, forward, forward. He threw, you know,

11
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:37.030
he threw a kick forward, he threw a combination forward and I was like, oh,

12
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:41.580
this guy's not hitting the brakes at all. You know? Uh, and I was like,

13
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.580
you know, just throw something into that space that he was gonna step into. And,

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.780
you know, he couldn't have been more.

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.620
<v 1>Perfect. Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.580
<v 0>Yeah. It was like right before he threw a punch everything. Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.540
<v 1>So two wicked Kos in a row. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like that over two top guys,</v>

18
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.050
like you must be feeling right now that you're on like a whole new level.

19
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.930
<v 0>Yeah. I'm trying not to feel too good. &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, cause that demon,</v>

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.570
you know, that demon will tell you, Hey, you're you're good enough, man.

21
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.490
You know, you're good enough. Ride it out. Yeah. Um, yeah,

22
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.370
I do feel good though, man. I, I feel like, uh, I think it's been noticeable,

23
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.970
the demeanor that I go into the cage with it's, it's noticeable in my,

24
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.080
my brain too. Like when I'm walking into the cage, uh, I'm ready, you know,

25
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:30.960
to hurt someone. Uh, and I'm ready to, uh, I'm ready to, you know,

26
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.760
snap and get the, get that 10 weeks of thinking about it out of me. Uh,

27
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.680
but yeah man, I, I I'm super happy with it, man. I feel like, you know, uh,

28
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.350
it's, it's,

29
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.270
it's own ability to figure out where you best perform and like you, you,

30
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.710
you don't learn that unless you have, you know, a loss or, or,

31
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.070
or you get lucky and you, you get a win, a fight, but you know,

32
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.950
I had to lose and, um, that's how you learn that stuff. And I,

33
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.470
I really feel man, like when I'm in the back in that space,

34
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.300
I feel 100% completely untouchable, you know? And, uh,

35
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:12.620
that's something that is very, very different than when I was fighting before.

36
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.220
Like I'm walking into the cage now feeling 100% untouchable.

37
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.140
<v 1>And do you attribute this to the work with the mental coach as well as just you</v>

38
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.850
realizing that you were flat in the Germaine fight? Yep.

39
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.650
<v 0>Yep. And, and just realizing where I do best, you know,</v>

40
00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:28.450
just realizing where I do best. Like, uh,

41
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.090
I would love because I'm a calm dude. Like I'm a relaxed guy.

42
00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:37.690
Like I don't get too high or too low about anything. Like, it'd be nice if that,

43
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.930
if I could perform at that level, you know, but that's not the case for me.

44
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.410
So I need to really,

45
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.920
and that's why I do it before barn is I'll make sure no matter how tired I am,

46
00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:50.720
regardless of what's going on, you know, if I'm injured, if I'm, you know,

47
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:53.040
overtrained, whatever it is, when it's sparring day,

48
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.560
I'm making sure that I get myself to that same place. Um,

49
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.720
obviously not intense enough to where I'm gonna hurt my training partners,

50
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:04.480
but I'm making sure that I can replicate that head space regardless of the

51
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:05.314
situation.

52
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.480
<v 1>Yeah. You said something after the fight, when you were talking to,</v>

53
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.120
you were talking to Laura Sanko, is that what you were talking to? Uh.

54
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.440
<v 0>No. It was, uh, Andrew.</v>

55
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.280
<v 1>Whoever it was. Yep. &lt;laugh&gt; that person. Um, you were,</v>

56
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.430
you said some people go in there and they're looking to compete.

57
00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:24.910
They like to compete and that's what they're doing. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you,

58
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.390
you go there, you're trying to hurt people. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

59
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.510
<v 0>That's that's, you know what I'm doing now? You know, uh,</v>

60
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.110
it, it was really uncomfortable for me because like, we are kind of, you know,

61
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.780
I like Hinduism, I like Eastern philosophy. I like the idea of like, you know,

62
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.980
Buddhism and, you know, being really peaceful and having a Zen mind and, uh,

63
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.300
and not wanting anything and, and,

64
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.020
and being really free from all the suffering of the world and,

65
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.900
and trying to get there. Uh, and that was kind of my philosophy, you know,

66
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.660
up until I was choked out by Sterling and opened up my eyes and I hear him

67
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:02.570
running around and celebrating, and I was like, that, you know,

68
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.650
that everyone that I go into a fight now with, I'm really trying to hurt,

69
00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:06.931
you know,

70
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:09.850
like I want to be the guy that's running around the cage and they're opening up

71
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:14.250
their eyes, you know? And, and I didn't, you know, uh, it's, it's a,

72
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.450
it's a different type of space to be in. And it takes a lot of prac practice,

73
00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:22.560
especially for someone like me who is isn't, you know, naturally like that. Uh,

74
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.200
but you know, that's,

75
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.000
that's the game that we're in and that's what I'm trying to do now.

76
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.920
<v 1>How important is a law sometimes super.</v>

77
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.240
<v 0>Important? It's, it's a reminder, you know, uh, and like you said, you know,</v>

78
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.440
I was just too comfortable. I was too laid back.

79
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.910
Like I needed to remember how dangerous sport is. Uh,

80
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.990
and that's one of the main things that I took from that loss is that like,

81
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.910
we're not playing soccer. Like don't walk into that fight, not ready to go.

82
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.110
<v 1>It's also a lesson, right? It's like,</v>

83
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.310
failure is so good for you because when you fail,

84
00:04:56.311 --> 00:05:00.910
it sucks and it feels terrible. But if you needed motivation,

85
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.060
well, there it is like, that's the best form of motivation. Like,

86
00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:10.020
people would love to get motivation in a, a totally positive, uh,

87
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.380
like a way where it's elective, like I've decided to be motivated. Yeah.

88
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.100
I'm going to be positive and that's wonderful. But my goodness,

89
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.130
the injection you get from a loss or from just straight up failure where you're

90
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:28.490
like, oh my God, I'm a loser. Yeah. You're like, oh,

91
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.650
the feeling it's so bad. Yeah.

92
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.210
You're literally the same person you were before that moment.

93
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.650
But now you hate yourself. You hate everything. You're you feel terrible.

94
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.840
You can't sleep. You get up to take a and you can't stop about you're like,

95
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.560
&lt;laugh&gt; you just feel so bad. You nailed it.

96
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.720
But that feeling is worth a billion dollars. It's so valuable.

97
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.080
<v 0>I wish,</v>

98
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.880
I wish I could win fights and feel like I lost every single time. Ooh.

99
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.440
I wish I had that. Like that type of superpower. I wish I could do that.

100
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.320
<v 1>Do you think you could talk yourself into that feeling?</v>

101
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.200
Is it like the feeling that you got after the algae fight?

102
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.760
Can you think you can like bring yourself back to that state? Yeah.

103
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.320
<v 0>Yeah. Um, yeah. If I sit and think about it long enough,</v>

104
00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:18.110
which I sometimes, you know, like, and not, not because of that fight,

105
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.990
but just all of the things, like you said, that happened after a loss man,

106
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.430
like all the conversations you have to have with people. Oh my God.

107
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.590
Like the looks you get, what do you think went wrong? Yeah. Hey man. Uh,

108
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.110
you'll get it next time. It's like, no, man, like this is my existence, bro.

109
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.110
<v 1>You'll get it next time. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

110
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.220
Non-com competitors that wanna talk to you about your losses? No, I hate it.

111
00:06:38.221 --> 00:06:42.380
Look on the bright side. Yeah. You got your health. Yeah. In that moment,

112
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.220
there's no bright side. And that's something that every athlete I think,

113
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.460
has to come to grips with the during losses.

114
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.420
There's there's no upside. It's just, this is your look.

115
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.780
Sometimes you're the hammer.

116
00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:57.460
Sometimes you're the nail and you don't get the good without the bad.

117
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.050
The reason why the good is so amazing is cuz you felt the bad. Yep.

118
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.770
If you're just this guy just stormed your way to the top with no adversity

119
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:08.810
whatsoever, you probably wouldn't enjoy it as much. No. And.

120
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.890
<v 0>And that, uh, that emotional pain I think is worse than physical pain. And uh,</v>

121
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.640
I remember after the first time I lost, I had like my own crisis,

122
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.280
a little bit where I had to, you know,

123
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.960
venture off and really question like who I was as a person where I,

124
00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:28.800
where I was putting a lot of my identity, just because that hurts so bad, man.

125
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.960
And uh, I remember like if I keep doing this,

126
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.640
it might happen again. You know? And I had to,

127
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.310
I had to like sit with that a little bit. And I was like,

128
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.310
and you might not even get what you want out of this. And then I was like.

129
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.030
And then I had to sit with that. And then I was like, and then I,

130
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.750
but I'm really grateful for that because that was the real moment in my life

131
00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:54.550
where I was like, martial arts is, is my path. You know,

132
00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:57.310
like that's what I'm doing, that's what I'm doing. Uh,

133
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.020
I remember having the very Lou said, thought of like,

134
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.700
when I was having those feelings of like, uh, this could happen again.

135
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.140
You might not ever get into the UFC. You could be doing this and win some,

136
00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:11.620
lose some and be a loser until you're 35 40, you know?

137
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.660
And in my head I was like, okay, you know, I'll sleep in a box, I'll be a loser.

138
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.370
You know, as long as I get to do this with my life, like, I'll be that loser.

139
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.890
And, and kind of since then, that's when I was like, oh, I actually love this.

140
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.570
