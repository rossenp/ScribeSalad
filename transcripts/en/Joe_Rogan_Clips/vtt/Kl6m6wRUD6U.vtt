00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.040
Here's something we're probably going to disagree about. Uh,

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.360
recreational marijuana. You you're apparently not Dave.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.740
I really thought we're going to do a whole show with Joe Rogan and you weren't

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.720
going to bring up marijuana.

6
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.650
<v 1>Like, what are the chances.</v>

7
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.370
<v 0>You're not in favor of recreational marijuana?</v>

8
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.190
<v 2>No, I can, I could be convinced, but I'm not there.</v>

9
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.590
<v 0>Against you right now. Well, spark one up.</v>

10
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.900
<v 3>I, I don't like it. I just.</v>

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.500
<v 2>Don't like it. I liked, I like scotch. I like that too. We got that.</v>

12
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.440
We've had scotch this whole time. Well, you gave me this amazing.

13
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.390
You gave me this amazing coffee. That's where.

14
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.500
<v 0>The Hamilton superfood coffee. It's pretty good. Right? Maybe so coherent. Like,</v>

15
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.600
yeah, I love it. The clarity. Good. Well, it's got tumeric.

16
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.640
It's it reduces inflammation. It gives you a yellow lips though. So.

17
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.720
<v 2>I I'm definitely,</v>

18
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.590
I'm definitely more open to just the federal legalization of medical marijuana

19
00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:53.210
and all the benefits that come with that.

20
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:56.600
I think the science backs that up pretty well. Sure. The, um,

21
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.570
on the recreational side, I'm happy to leave that to the states. Okay.

22
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:00.800
And then there's the argument of, well,

23
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.770
the states are having trouble with some things, the banking laws, et cetera,

24
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:08.300
because the federal government does it may still makes it illegal. Th my, my,

25
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.890
my issue with recreational marijuana still is it's. And again,

26
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.270
this is not a strong opinion I have.

27
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:17.780
This is not a hill I'm dying on by any means. Um,

28
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.550
but if we're going to change it,

29
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:22.910
I want to understand what the point is and like what the benefits are of it

30
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.390
recreationally. I understand the benefits medically very well. Uh,

31
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.253
but I understand the,

32
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.040
the recreational benefits and I wanna see how this data plays out in places like

33
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:32.750
California and Colorado. You know,

34
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:36.080
I want to see if there's an increased use among young people. Cause there's,

35
00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:37.850
there's, there's very good science that says,

36
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:40.040
if you use marijuana a lot under the age of 26,

37
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:42.620
you're going to have cognitive issues for the rest of your life,

38
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.150
along with a lot. Yes. But, and people compare those things.

39
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.630
But my counter isn't that my counter is simply this,

40
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:53.450
the alcohol issue is out of the bag. Like it just is, you know,

41
00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:56.210
we're never going to put that back in. Um, and.

42
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.220
<v 0>So they're going to put pot back in the bag.</v>

43
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.890
<v 2>Well, not necessarily. My point is this,</v>

44
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.800
there's a normalization that occurs when you legalize something.

45
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.280
You're telling me. Okay. So let's say you make the age 21 or not.

46
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.150
What is it in California?

47
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.270
<v 0>I think it's 21. Isn't it? So let's say, I want to think.</v>

48
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.490
<v 2>So let's say you make it 21.</v>

49
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.120
What you've done though is you've normalized it for teenagers because you said,

50
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:20.240
well, yeah, it's 21, but it's legal. So there's nothing,

51
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.430
there's no issues with it. Okay.

52
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.800
That's what you're T I think that's what you're telling people.

53
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.610
And there's a lot of people who can just live their lives extremely productively

54
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:31.820
and smoke pot a lot. There's a lot of people who can't. Okay.

55
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:32.900
And there's lot of people don't.

56
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.270
<v 0>Lazy. Well, yeah.</v>

57
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.280
<v 1>Let me help you.</v>

58
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.670
<v 0>Live your life. You just listen. Pot's not for everybody.</v>

59
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:43.610
And I have a lot of friends who don't smoke pot, but pot is a tool,

60
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.160
just like a hammer. You could build a house with a hammer.

61
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.400
You can hit yourself in the Dick. If you're crazy, like scotch,

62
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.530
you could drink scotch recreationally.

63
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.960
You can have a couple of glasses with some friends and have a great

64
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:57.620
conversation. And it's a social lubricant and people enjoy. And I enjoy.

65
00:02:57.621 --> 00:03:00.040
And that's why we got a bunch of bottles of it over there. Uh.

66
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.881
<v 2>Look, but, but don't,</v>

67
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.810
you have to drink way more scotch to get even close to the,

68
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.470
to the basically cognitive incoherence that you'd be able to just one bite of a

69
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:08.910
brownie.

70
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.010
<v 4>You, you would.</v>

71
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.520
<v 0>But not me. I smoke pot all the time. I could smoke pot.</v>

72
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.870
I could have smoked pot before this podcast and the exact same podcast I could

73
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:21.690
have had several hits. If I gave you several hits,

74
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:25.640
you'd be obliterated and you'd be so paranoid, freaking out.

75
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.060
You think the government's coming to get you,

76
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:30.360
and they're going to close down Congress. And oh my God, the Chinese listen.

77
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.290
Anyway, it's it's um,

78
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.620
a lot of it is based on our own ideas and perceptions.

79
00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:41.160
And I had a lot of these misconceptions in my own head.

80
00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:45.690
I didn't really S I smoked pot maybe six times or so.

81
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:49.260
Seven times before I was 30 years old. And then when I was 30,

82
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.810
I started hanging around with a guy who smoked a lot, my friend, Eddie Bravo.

83
00:03:51.811 --> 00:03:54.120
We started smoking pot together. And I realized like, oh,

84
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.460
this is an incredible tool for creativity.

85
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.820
Like if you use it correctly and yeah, it makes you paranoid.

86
00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:04.590
But I think a lot of what that paranoia is is you being acutely

87
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:09.390
aware of your vulnerability and your actual real place in the cosmos

88
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.140
and your real place in society and the real dangers of driving cars and the real

89
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:17.010
dangers of being in crowds of people that it's not, it's a weird,

90
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:17.970
uncomfortable feeling,

91
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:20.610
but ultimately you get through that and you're going to be okay. Yeah.

92
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.460
<v 2>In a culture that I just don't really have a problem with what you're saying,</v>

93
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.810
you know, like it's, I'm just, I'm not cultural, I guess, on a personal level.

94
00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:30.900
I'm just not opposed to what you're saying at all. Uh,

95
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.240
from a policy level though, I just look at things differently.

96
00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:37.740
Like when I extract myself from the personal situations I've had with pot,

97
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.220
and I look at it from a policy perspective, what personal situations,

98
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:45.570
ideas I've tried it, you know, and it's paranoid. I don't like it. I just,

99
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.050
I really don't freak out. I don't know. I'm not a freak out.

100
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.000
I'm not a freak out kind of person, but within your, like, uh, it just,

101
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:58.050
it's just the sensation that just in general, I just really didn't like it. Um,

102
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.913
I, I don't know.

103
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.460
<v 4>Did you smoke too much? What, sorry.</v>

104
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.940
<v 1>I think there's something going on with my headphones.</v>

105
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.360
<v 0>That gloss over this. So,</v>

106
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.560
but here's the problem with keeping an illegal criminal sell it? I mean,

107
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:15.540
this is the same problem we had during prohibition.

108
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.810
This is what propped up the mom, right? We all know this, and this is a,

109
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:21.630
this is the number one problem we have with the Mexican drug cartels.

110
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.110
And the number one problem is that there's a customer base in the United States,

111
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.620
and they're making billions and billions of dollars selling illegal drugs.

112
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.710
And what's the solution to that. I don't know. I mean, not look, I don't,

113
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.730
I have kids. I don't want heroin to be something you could buy at seven 11.

114
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.670
Yeah. I don't want you to be able to go to a store and buy meth, you know,

115
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.540
that gets.

116
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.330
<v 2>Into a whole other conversation about all drugs, right? Yeah.</v>

117
00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:43.470
But those are the real dangerous.

118
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.590
<v 0>Ones, pots, not that. And when you lie to kids and tell them that pots,</v>

119
00:05:46.591 --> 00:05:50.100
the real, real danger, and you shouldn't do it, then they start going, well,

120
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.620
maybe you're lying about heroin. Maybe you're lying about meth.

121
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.483
Maybe just square.

122
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.100
Maybe just some loser just wants to be stuck in a cubicle all day.

123
00:05:56.101 --> 00:05:58.250
And you want me to be living like you, but it does.

124
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.570
<v 2>Reduce. I mean, it does reduce productivity. I think more than alcohol.</v>

125
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.130
<v 0>Does, we can do highly dependent upon the person I get paranoid.</v>

126
00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:08.350
And I want to do more things. Cause I don't want to be a loser. Yeah.

127
00:06:08.351 --> 00:06:09.910
That's what happens to me when I smoke pot.

128
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.200
I think it accentuates many aspects of people that are already lazy.

129
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.920
If you are already lazy and you have a problem with discipline, which I don't,

130
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.910
if you have a problem with discipline and you smoke pot. Yeah. Yeah.

131
00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:23.950
You're going to just want to vege, outline the grass and stare at the clouds.

132
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.400
I want to get going. Yeah. I smoke pot and go to the gym. I mean,

133
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.930
I do it all the time. And again.

134
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.960
<v 2>As a policy maker though, I have to look at the whole situation.</v>

135
00:06:31.961 --> 00:06:36.010
So I see people like you and you're like, yeah, it'd be fine. Why not? Um,

136
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.901
but I,

137
00:06:36.901 --> 00:06:40.060
but I do have to take into account the entirety of the situation and ask myself,

138
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.670
well, what is the benefit of society, society doing this?

139
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.890
What is the people nicer? It.

140
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.720
<v 0>Enhances the sense of community.</v>

141
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.960
It makes people more aware of their surroundings. Kinder.

142
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.251
<v 2>I mean, I don't know.</v>

143
00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:54.580
I think alcohol is much more of a social lubricant definitely makes it meaner

144
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.241
too. But I mean,

145
00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:58.630
as far as getting along with people and going out and interacting with people,

146
00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.980
it's different, it's different.

147
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.520
<v 0>But definitely inhibits your inhibitions.</v>

148
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.840
It lowers your inhibition. So it allows you to talk more freely with people,

149
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.070
definitely encourages more sex and more terrible decision making and driving

150
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.350
too. But the thing about marijuana.

151
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.650
<v 2>Policy problem. Yeah. Because like how do you test for it? You know,</v>

152
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:22.210
we have a very kind of clear standards on alcoholics. Just those again, again,

153
00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:25.150
I'm not, I'm not just not dying on this hill. Um, I just,

154
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:27.820
I have questions and those questions are unanswered. I understand.

155
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.870
But this questions.

156
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.020
<v 0>Oftentimes are coming from a place of propaganda.</v>

157
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.600
Like people have this idea of what it is versus what it really is.

158
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.860
<v 2>I don't know. I like, I have personal experience with this and I'm 35.</v>

159
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.230
So like I've grown up around this my entire life. This isn't, so it's not,

160
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:45.580
well.

161
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.390
<v 0>What again, did you do it right? But it's the same thing with alcohol.</v>

162
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.350
You could have driven drunk and crashed your car and go, well, alcohol is bad.

163
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.440
Look, I drove my car into a tree and I go, well, Hey man,

164
00:07:56.441 --> 00:07:58.720
I just had a couple of beers with my friends. We had a great old time.

165
00:07:58.721 --> 00:08:00.370
We laughed it up and nobody got hurt.

166
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.070
<v 2>The differences again, the way to,</v>

167
00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:06.520
to measure how much to alcohol too much alcohol is is, is well-defined.

168
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.920
And we also have just hundreds of years of experience with like,

169
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.960
as a culture with how to figure out alcohol.

170
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.500
<v 0>And how to deal with,</v>

171
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.710
we used to have thousands of years of experience of how to use cannabis,

172
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.800
but it was suppressed in the 1930s by William Randolph,

173
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:19.270
Hearst and Harry Anslinger.

174
00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:22.720
And there's more of an eco economic decision than it was a public health

175
00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:27.100
decision. Yeah. And I think I've heard your podcast on that. Interesting. Yeah.

176
00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:30.160
There's many, many documentaries and books written on it,

177
00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:34.000
but I think that the real problem is when you make drugs, illegal,

178
00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:37.330
only Outlaws sell drugs. You prop up illegal enterprises.

179
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:42.310
It's a guy coming in next, next month or next week, rather John Norris, who,

180
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.270
uh, is, uh, a guy who works for the state.

181
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.260
He's one of those guys that asked to go around and find these illegal grow ops

182
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:52.720
on public land. And it's extremely dangerous. Yeah.

183
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.040
<v 2>I mean, bottom, bottom line is my, my position. That's a state decision,</v>

184
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.630
you know, it's a state decision.

185
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.580
<v 0>Why wouldn't it be federally legal? If alcohol is federally illegal,</v>

186
00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:04.790
if we'd know that no one's dying from it. No one, I can't overdo.

187
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.520
<v 2>It. I just want to see what the data comes out is from Colorado.</v>

188
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.290
It's mixed right now, frankly.

189
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.370
<v 0>I think we need a strong education program to let people know. First of all,</v>

190
00:09:13.371 --> 00:09:16.460
if you have a problem with reality, if you have schizophrenia in your family,

191
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.820
if your reality is already slippery, marijuana is not for you.

192
00:09:19.821 --> 00:09:23.120
And I've personally seen people that have struggled that,

193
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.590
that do have an adverse reaction to marijuana and they go off the rails.

194
00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:31.190
It does happen particularly with edibles edibles in particular,

195
00:09:31.191 --> 00:09:32.720
to knock people for a loop,

196
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.380
but then there's other people that doesn't do that too. And I think we, the,

197
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.780
the way to study that is to have actual funding and make it legal where you

198
00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:44.600
could, you could look at things across the board and figure out why. Yeah.

199
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.490
<v 2>Yeah. I think, I think as far as the battles,</v>

200
00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:48.980
we should fight at the federal level. We've got to start with the medical side.

201
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:53.600
I think this, I think the science is clear and like, so, you know, let's start.

202
00:09:53.601 --> 00:09:55.040
I mean, I, I just, I just.

203
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.941
<v 0>The gateway right.</v>

204
00:09:55.941 --> 00:10:00.650
CBD is non-psychoactive and helps so many old people with arthritis and so many

205
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:02.270
people with anxiety. It's fantastic.

206
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:03.723
<v 2>Just again,</v>

207
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.940
another reason I'm a Republican is because I believe in somewhat slower

208
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.830
policymaking too. Like these,

209
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.850
these conversations have to play out in society and they w w we don't always

210
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.380
need to,

211
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.340
to solve the problem right away.

212
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.820
Like there's a reason for that things must happen. So, so I think,

213
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.280
I think the medical conversation is, is the one we should be fighting for.

214
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.310
I think the recreational side is, is a few steps beyond that.

215
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.860
And then we get to that and we'll have the we'll know more. And I,

216
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.410
and I think that's, that's, that's why generally,

217
00:10:33.411 --> 00:10:35.120
when people ask me that I'm like, this is the,

218
00:10:35.121 --> 00:10:37.130
the medical thing is the thing to be talking about. Right?

219
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.760
<v 0>No, I appreciate that conservative perspective and the slow approach to things.</v>

220
00:10:40.761 --> 00:10:42.330
And I understand what you're saying, but what,

221
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:46.850
what bothers me more than anything is that American citizens are not doing any

222
00:10:46.851 --> 00:10:51.110
harm to anyone could be criminals for something that's been used by human beings

223
00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:54.140
for thousands of years and doesn't show any real problems.

224
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.860
I don't think young people should drink, but I drank when I was young. I mean,

225
00:10:57.861 --> 00:10:59.480
I didn't drink a lot, but I did occasionally.

226
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.570
I don't think young people should smoke pot. I definitely don't encourage it.

227
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.690
As a matter of fact, I deeply discourage it and I tell people, look,

228
00:11:05.691 --> 00:11:06.261
there's a reason.

229
00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:09.200
One of the reasons why I enjoy it as I didn't start smoking really until I was

230
00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:13.070
30. And, you know, I take time off all the time.

231
00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:15.020
It's not an addictive substance. To me,

232
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.510
it's psychologically addictive to some people.

233
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:19.280
And there might be some evidence that a very,

234
00:11:19.281 --> 00:11:22.670
very small percentage of people it's physically addictive,

235
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.750
but not like alcohol is not like a lot of the things that we can just buy

236
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.613
anywhere else.

237
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.720
<v 4>Yeah. Those are all fair arguments.</v>

238
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.820
<v 2>And it's a good discussion to have, and we sort of disagree on it, but,</v>

239
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.820
but only because I just think more due diligence needs to be done. It's not,

240
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.580
this is not, uh, something I'm vehemently opposed to.

241
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.020
<v 0>Well, I think anything for young kids can be a real problem,</v>

242
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.480
especially for young kids where their brain is still developing.

243
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:49.580
And they're trying to find their way through life and you give them something

244
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.880
that's severely distorts, reality, whatever it is. Um, I,

245
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.580
we had that same due diligence,

246
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:58.210
the way they prescribed psychotropic drugs to kids, because we don't, you know,

247
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.100
we should talk to parents discretion.

248
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.240
So many parents are putting their kids on Ritalin and Prozac and Adderall. And,

249
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.550
you know, you're making kids speed freaks.

250
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.720
<v 2>As opposed to relying on like cognitive behavioral therapy,</v>

251
00:12:09.721 --> 00:12:13.320
which is proven to work much better because you're getting at the problem you're

252
00:12:13.321 --> 00:12:16.260
questioning, you're questioning the untruths that you're telling yourself,

253
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.850
that's it, that's effectively what CBT is. Um, you know, it's good practice.

254
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.950
The kids have exorbitant.

255
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.430
<v 0>Amounts of energy and you can call that hyperactive. Or you could just say,</v>

256
00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:29.670
well, that kid's got a great engine, got a lot of gas,

257
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.670
just figure out a way to get this kid engaged in what they, like.

258
00:12:32.671 --> 00:12:35.250
I guarantee you'd take that kid, put them in front of a video game.

259
00:12:35.251 --> 00:12:36.600
He doesn't have any problem focusing.

260
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.620
He has a problem with his classes with boring subjects, right.

261
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.060
And teachers that are uninterested.

262
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.170
And so many people are being labeled as being problems because.

263
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:50.420
<v 2>Of that blame something else besides reality. And that's, that's, that's,</v>

264
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.970
that's problematic. Um, and, uh,

265
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.280
it talked about looking into certain drugs. I mean, you know,

266
00:12:56.281 --> 00:13:00.630
the opioid epidemic is an issue too, and that's a bipartisan issue. It's just,

267
00:13:00.631 --> 00:13:03.210
again, it's not exactly clear. How do you solve this? Right.

268
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.021
How do you solve this?

269
00:13:04.021 --> 00:13:07.380
I have a ton of experience with opioids because I've been injured so many times.

270
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.620
<v 0>Did you ever have a problem getting off of them once you.</v>

271
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.340
<v 2>It's devastating? It's absolutely. It's absolutely devastating. And I didn't,</v>

272
00:13:14.341 --> 00:13:17.190
I never knew this was in 2012,

273
00:13:17.191 --> 00:13:21.030
so I didn't know how devastating it would be. Cause I just stopped taking them.

274
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.580
I don't think I'm in pain anymore. I should probably just not take these.

275
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.420
And then I was in, in worse pain. I didn't know I was sick.

276
00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:28.440
I didn't know what was wrong with me.

277
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.110
<v 4>What was the experience like? Uh, it's.</v>

278
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.920
<v 2>Nash. You just, you can't move. You're sick. I don't know how to describe it.</v>

279
00:13:34.921 --> 00:13:38.550
You're just really sick. And is your body craving the pills? Yeah, but,

280
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.880
but I didn't know that. I think so. You're just feeling the sickness,

281
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.660
the sickness. It wasn't, I didn't, I didn't quite know where it was coming from.

282
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.240
Um, and then, you know, you tell your doctor and be like, oh yeah,

283
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.550
you got to wean off of that. We didn't tell you that. No,

284
00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:54.480
you didn't tell me that. Um, it was very, I was 28 when this happened.

285
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.390
So I, my body can get over. You're.

286
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.210
<v 0>Also 28 with a strong mind. Who's a seal.</v>

287
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.270
<v 2>Right? Yeah. But they're, but the age matters just like it matters with pot.</v>

288
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.980
Just like it matters with addiction. Your you're when,

289
00:14:06.981 --> 00:14:08.940
when teenagers are hooked on opioids,

290
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.030
when not one dealer gets into the system,

291
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.360
like you change that person's brain forever.

292
00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:17.700
And they're always addicted to it really bad ways. And like,

293
00:14:17.701 --> 00:14:20.640
it's different the way I'll always remember it.

294
00:14:20.641 --> 00:14:23.070
Like it's ingrained in my brain too, but it's different because I was older.

295
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:23.550
Like if.

296
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.570
<v 0>You got an injury today, would you be re would you be reluctant to.</v>

297
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.080
<v 2>No, no. I, I have faith in my ability to,</v>

298
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.790
to just stacked responsibly. Like I, I, you know,

299
00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:40.380
and so that requires a lot of things, but when you win and this is, this gets,

300
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.500
this is a little bit gets to the war on drugs, philosophy. Like,

301
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.440
do you just not do it because we're losing all the time.

302
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.670
And I actually disagree with that pretty strongly because th th yeah,

303
00:14:50.671 --> 00:14:53.810
you might be, feel like you're losing all the time, but you are mitigating it.

304
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.200
And supply does create demand, especially with something like opioids.

305
00:14:57.201 --> 00:14:59.950
If that one dealer gets into that one high school and,

306
00:14:59.951 --> 00:15:04.610
and gets those kids addicted at one party, like those in those kids die 10,

307
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:08.720
12 years later, and I've watched this happen. I've been to the funerals. And,

308
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.590
uh, it's, it's devastating. And that supply, that,

309
00:15:11.591 --> 00:15:16.160
that demand was created by supply. So like the, again, no, there's no,

310
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:17.750
there's never a black and white to anything.

311
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.450
And so when we say a war on drugs is stupid, or it's not stupid, like not,

312
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:23.240
it's complicated, it's complicated. And the opioid epidemic is I think,

313
00:15:23.241 --> 00:15:24.860
a good indication of that.

314
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.350
<v 0>What could be done to mitigate that other than sawing Florida off and selling it</v>

315
00:15:29.351 --> 00:15:33.160
to the Russians. Did Florida do Florida was the problem, you know,

316
00:15:33.161 --> 00:15:34.990
the whole deal with the pill mills. Did you ever,

317
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.880
there's a great documentary called, uh,

318
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:41.890
the Oxy Oxycontin express detailed how they had pain management centers

319
00:15:41.891 --> 00:15:46.570
in Florida set up right next to the doctor was next door to the

320
00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.550
pharmacy that only sold opioids.

321
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.180
And they didn't realize it was a Florida and they didn't have a database.

322
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.790
They didn't have a database. So there was no computer database. So you could,

323
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.510
if you were a doctor, I could go to you. I could get my opioids.

324
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.100
Then I'd go over Jamie. He's a doctor.

325
00:16:00.101 --> 00:16:02.440
He could hook me up and then I'd go down the street and get more.

326
00:16:02.441 --> 00:16:03.610
And then when people started selling them,

327
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.740
and there was an express from Florida,

328
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.950
went up into Kentucky and Ohio and all these different states that were having

329
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.670
giant problems. And they found out the pills were all coming from this one area.

330
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.320
It was a Vanguard documentary.

331
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:18.460
<v 2>And in that stuff's been slammed down pretty hard ever since.</v>

332
00:16:18.461 --> 00:16:21.100
And so in the pendulum has swung a little too far.

333
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.800
Cause now pain patients are having trouble getting the opioids. They want, like,

334
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.160
here's two pills for your surgery. And you're like, really? Right. Um,

335
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.890
so some people legitimately need this stuff.

336
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.680
And so we've got to find that correct balance. And again,

337
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.020
you've always got to know why there's a problem. Um,

338
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.360
and as a general policy approach,

339
00:16:37.361 --> 00:16:41.190
we should always really question why the problem exists in the first place and,

340
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.920
and, and what the characteristics of that problem are. Uh,

341
00:16:43.921 --> 00:16:45.610
so a lot of people are dying. Not necessarily,

342
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.830
they're not like they're not overdosing on Oxycontin.

343
00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:52.600
They're overdosing from illegal forms of it or heroin that is laced with

344
00:16:52.601 --> 00:16:55.390
fentanyl. Uh, so like, how do you tackle that? Well, fennel,

345
00:16:55.391 --> 00:16:58.420
I was coming from the Southern border. That's where it's coming from. Um,

346
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.810
you know, we can talk about immigration too, but little, it happens a lot is,

347
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:02.620
you know,

348
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.320
those massive waves of immigrants who were turning themselves into border

349
00:17:05.321 --> 00:17:09.400
patrol, they're allowed to cross because the drug cartels say they can cross,

350
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.830
okay. That's why they come across an organized groups.

351
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.930
And then they turned themselves into border patrol and they,

352
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.800
and they claim asylum.

353
00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:16.750
They always bring a kid with them so that they know they can stay.

354
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.480
But what's also happening is just down the road.

355
00:17:19.481 --> 00:17:21.370
The drug cartels are moving the fentanyl and other,

356
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.400
or other drugs across most of the bulky drugs, mostly like marijuana,

357
00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:27.460
things like that. Fentanyl is so small. They can just bring it through trucks,

358
00:17:27.461 --> 00:17:29.410
through ports of entry. So the,

359
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.670
and so we need sensors to actually detect that. And we're getting those,

360
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.920
getting those put in place more. Um,

361
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.260
and we need to secure the border because this is where it's coming from.

362
00:17:38.261 --> 00:17:40.270
And we need to deal with where it's coming from south of the border,

363
00:17:40.271 --> 00:17:41.104
which is China.

364
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.140
And so the administration actually did that and we got the Chinese to say,

365
00:17:44.141 --> 00:17:47.490
at least that they'll do it. You never know how much they're enforcing that. So.
