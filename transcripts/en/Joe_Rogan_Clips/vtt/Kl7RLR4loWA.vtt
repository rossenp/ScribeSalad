00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.310
<v 1>Right? Because if I hate doing table news hits because I have two minutes to,</v>

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.440
to basically deduce a complex issue that we've been debating for decades almost

4
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:14.160
centuries. Yeah.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.700
<v 2>It's the worst. And it's also people talking over each other and there's one,</v>

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.310
you know, they have two boxes, one guy here, one guy there,

7
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.260
usually you're not even in the same room together.

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.750
You're talking through those ear pieces. It was a delay.

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.110
Those things are a disaster. Horrible. One of the worst ways to communicate.

10
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.690
<v 1>Hi. I tried to establish my platform with my show.</v>

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.010
Nawar I try to have it as a platform. That's open to people to come on. Hey,

12
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:37.920
look, you want to come on and discuss this issue by all means, come do it.

13
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.870
<v 2>You had anyone that's S that's like really strict anti-gun</v>

14
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.950
on.

15
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.040
<v 1>Yeah. I had a, I'd had an entire season. So what we did in the season,</v>

16
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.780
I think it was two seasons ago.

17
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.570
We brought on a young lady and a guy from New Zealand.

18
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:57.510
I can't remember, but he came on the show. They were antiques.

19
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.270
And so what we did was he had a round table discussion at the end of every

20
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:04.260
episode of my show. And we would bring up a specific topic and we discuss it.

21
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.500
And so they basically, it was like two against one, essentially.

22
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.900
And so they would talk to me about what their thoughts on,

23
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.590
on what we talked about in the show or a particular gun control issue.

24
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.150
And we had that conversation. I had an individual, I sit down with her as well,

25
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:20.850
and we talked about it and then took her to the shooting range to shoot for the

26
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:25.020
first time, you know? Um, but that's going to be overlooked. Right.

27
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.040
They know they ignore it.

28
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.080
<v 2>Well, they probably aren't even aware of it cause I wasn't.</v>

29
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.580
<v 1>Aware of it. Um, no they're aware of it.</v>

30
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.150
So people who need to be aware of it are aware of it. Okay. Because like,

31
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:35.760
for instance, I bring this point up. Um,

32
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.270
it makes me come across as if like, I feel some type of way.

33
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.500
Cause he didn't mention me,

34
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.460
but it's not really that it just speaks volumes to what I've been pointing at.

35
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.850
For the longest they ignore rational discourse.

36
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.650
John Oliver did a 20 minute monologue on NRA TV about NRA TV,

37
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.600
right. 20 minutes, you know how long? A 20 minute long that's a long time.

38
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.930
Yeah. He didn't mention me once. He didn't mention my show.

39
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.500
I have three shows on NRA, TV, three shows. And I have the second longer,

40
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.560
longest running show in an ITV. He didn't mention me once.

41
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.690
The level of detail that they went into within that monologue lets me know.

42
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:16.230
They watched everything on that platform. They watched.

43
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.000
<v 2>It all. And why do you think he left you out?</v>

44
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.410
<v 1>Because didn't fit the narrative.</v>

45
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.963
<v 2>Right?</v>

46
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.290
Also because he is a progressive guy with

47
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.560
glasses. Who's white and you really shouldn't.

48
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.480
You really shouldn't say anything negative about.

49
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.390
<v 1>Black people. How so? He's but he's not white though. He's a minority.</v>

50
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:35.790
Just like me. What is he? He's I don't know. He's like.

51
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.670
<v 2>I don't want to Oliver. He's white. It's not white.</v>

52
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.210
What is he then told her white, if he's not white, I'm not white.

53
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.860
What the is he?

54
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.380
<v 1>Irish?</v>

55
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.670
<v 2>Irish. My white. If I'm not what the is. If I saw you on the streets you are</v>

56
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.920
In the olden days. I wasn't my grandparents. Weren't white.

57
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.400
When my grandparents came over that guy's white. He's white like paper, Tom.

58
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.270
<v 1>Isn't it? Yeah. Oh. I'm wrong. Well, there you go. Um,</v>

59
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.770
what did you think he was? I don't know.

60
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.430
<v 2>I never thought I'd get him confused with the daily show guy. I probably.</v>

61
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.340
<v 1>Am. Trevor Noah. No, not Trevor. I know, but I know about Trevor.</v>

62
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.620
<v 2>Yeah. He's white as. He's a white Englishman man. I'm racist.</v>

63
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.860
Um, but for a guide like that, uh, guys like that have Dave,

64
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.710
here's the thing about Progressive's and I like John Oliver. I'm not,

65
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.880
I'm not negative against John.

66
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.280
<v 1>I'm going to say doing a show. I have,</v>

67
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.090
I had this perspective up until this point. So I'm going to shut off.

68
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.390
I'm going to shut off my belief system and listen to you and listen to what

69
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.340
you're about to say, because I haven't thought about this.

70
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.810
Cause I've thought he wasn't wiped his entire time. So now he's white.

71
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.010
<v 2>Um, I mean it might not even be what be, why he did it.</v>

72
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.000
He might've found the worst examples and maybe you were too reasonable and it

73
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:54.700
doesn't fit the narrative of being funny. I mean his show,

74
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.380
although his show has points and he makes these very, you know,

75
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.240
these clear conclusions and you know, but it's funny. It's a funny show.

76
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.830
That's the whole thing behind it is.

77
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.390
<v 1>Well, who's dating me, knows like I have enough episodes on, on, on,</v>

78
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:13.450
on that platform. You can find some stuff to make fun of me about.

79
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.740
<v 2>Well, I'm sure they could,</v>

80
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:17.920
but I don't think that's the kind of thing they're trying to make fun of like

81
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:19.960
individual personalities that say stupid.

82
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.910
I think what they're trying to do is point out the disingenuous

83
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.830
narrative from the NRA while ignoring the disingenuous narrative

84
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.690
from the anti-gun advocates.

85
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.780
<v 1>Okay. I could possibly see that.</v>

86
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.650
I'm trying to, I'm trying to be fair and reasonable. Cause my mind wants to go.

87
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.910
Nah, he saw, he S he realized that by mentioning me, right, it's going to,

88
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:49.030
it's going to peak curiosity with the audience in which he's trying to.

89
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.480
<v 2>So you think you're too reasonable and too logical.</v>

90
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.770
And that since you're not like this redneck hee haw type character that like to

91
00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:59.200
talk about you, it doesn't fit their narrative.

92
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:02.450
So let's just ignore him because that's a trade on the dummies. Think about it,

93
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.360
everybody on there's still real though. Right?

94
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.340
<v 1>There are some dummies. They have domains on all.</v>

95
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.630
<v 2>Sides. That's true. That's true.</v>

96
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.920
But it's pretty easy to find like pro gun dummies.

97
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.780
You can find quite a few of them. I can.

98
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.110
<v 1>Pretty easy to find dummies on the other side as well, too, for sure.</v>

99
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.320
<v 2>But you wouldn't be looking if you were on that side, right?</v>

100
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.210
If you're on the anti-gun side,

101
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.620
you're looking for pro Gumm dummies pro gun dummies pro gun dummies are easy to

102
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:28.960
find. They are right. There's plenty of them right now.

103
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.340
You can go find them on Instagram and Twitter and there's,

104
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.170
there's dummies all over the world.

105
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.860
<v 1>Let's see. Here's the thing though. The thing about what John Oliver does,</v>

106
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.060
and this is the thing,

107
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.470
this is the kind of disingenuous nature of satire political satire. It,

108
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.180
I call it the, the, the comedian plausible deniability card, right? Okay.

109
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.170
So you can make a joke about something and then say, oh, it has no influence.

110
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.570
Cause it's just a joke. It's not.

111
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.340
<v 2>But you're not saying that is he, he's not, he doesn't have an influence.</v>

112
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.940
<v 1>Exactly. He understands the influence at wields, but he's what he's saying,</v>

113
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.000
but he can, he can always swipe the plausible deniability card and say, well,

114
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:07.310
no, I wasn't making an actual political statement.

115
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:09.890
Like I know that there are reasonable people on the other side, no,

116
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.670
you're pushing a narrative that has been pushed for decades about an

117
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:17.120
organization that fights for the second amendment, the same, the same,

118
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.140
the same narrative.

119
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.830
That's being pushed by groups of people who say the only thing standing in their

120
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:26.030
way of more gun control is the NRA. So what do you do?

121
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:28.850
So where does anybody get its power from? Because they, they,

122
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.840
they talk out of both sides of their mouth and he gets a power from there. Uh,

123
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.080
sorry. They know he gets a power by their membership. Right? Right.

124
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.730
So what do you do? You, you do your best to stifle that membership.

125
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.940
You make it seem as unattractive as possible. And then you also,

126
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.110
your audience is already largely uneducated on the issue. Right?

127
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.290
And then there's already this perceived notion that the NRAS is just a bunch of

128
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:55.880
racist, white rednecks. Right? So then what do you do to further that narrative?

129
00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.590
You talk about their platform and then you pull out all of those things that

130
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:04.220
further drive that narrative while ignoring the most popular figure on the

131
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:08.300
platform, which is, which is me. And so who so happens to be black.

132
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.860
So what does that say? It tells me that this is that it was deliberate.

133
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.180
I really do want to agree with you and say, you know what, he's white.

134
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.240
He didn't want to be seen as attacking the black guy so forth and so on.

135
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.430
<v 2>I think there's a little of that, but I think there's also,</v>

136
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:26.210
he's doing a show now, let, let me, let me explain how a show works.

137
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.360
He's got a team of writers. There's a ton of people back there.

138
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.870
They are just trying to be funny. They are trying to make points for sure,

139
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:35.240
but they're trying to find stupid that they can mock.

140
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.510
And why would they concentrate on the guy who makes sense if they look at,

141
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:40.760
for stupid that they can mock, they're not trying to make a balanced,

142
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:43.250
reasonable argument. Like maybe we would do right here. Right now,

143
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.310
what they're doing is doing a condensed, edited down,

144
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:51.290
very smooth polished television show with that rent has been dissected and

145
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:52.820
gone over by a team of writers.

146
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.870
And they have video that corresponds to it and photographs that they shoot go to

147
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:00.500
and they have clips that they show. And then they mock the clips. It's a,

148
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.880
it's a comedy show. They do have a point, but it's a comedy show. Absolutely.

149
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.960
So that's why they didn't go after you is because maybe you're a lawyer.

150
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:10.160
Maybe you're articulate.

151
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.850
Maybe you is because you're young and black and they just don't feel like it's a

152
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:16.850
smart thing to do, but it's because they're making a show.

153
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.870
<v 1>I agree with you. Now, let me tell you why my panties are in a ruffle about it.</v>

154
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.390
It's because I understand the influence of that show when people make.

155
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.240
<v 2>Good decisions, but don't you think it's preaching to the choir? That show?</v>

156
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.640
What do you mean? That one? That show. Yeah. John Oliver's show.

157
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:32.690
I think if I had to guess how many people who are watching the show are left,

158
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.010
wing, leaning, uh, democratic leaning, liberal leaning.

159
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.630
I would say it's a giant percentage.

160
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.430
<v 1>The problem though, the number of people who come to me and say,</v>

161
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.970
I don't, I don't deal with the NRA because they're racist.

162
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.390
And they're a bunch of white rednecks who says that, oh God,

163
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:51.224
I get it all the time.

164
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.710
<v 2>The wool, what is the evidence that they point to? They just assume the.</v>

165
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.410
<v 1>Yep. That's, that's just it because in their,</v>

166
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.080
in their attempts to just make a show. Right.

167
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.870
And I agree with you wholeheartedly. I absolutely agree with you,

168
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.340
but we can't undermine how influential that show is at crafting people's

169
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:12.630
thoughts about particular issues and ideologies within this country. Right.

170
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.980
Right. And so I stand back and I'm like, man, this is dangerous because to me,

171
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.100
the second amendment is incredibly important. Right? I don't, you know what?

172
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.170
The funny thing is, I thought the monologue was hilarious.

173
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.360
The mom's a funny dude. Mama monologue is hilarious. I'll give him,

174
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.240
I'll give him the mom. I'm arguing with monologue was funny. Um,

175
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.340
then isn't he a funny dude? Because he said that funny.

176
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.670
He was a funny dude during that 20 minute model, sometimes it's not,

177
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.670
you're demonstrating. You got another, you got to do stay consistency,

178
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.400
consistency. You give me some consistency.

179
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.800
I'll let you drop the ball a couple of times here and there. That's fine.

180
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.700
But as far as consistency, it's tough job. No, John Oliver guy,

181
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.490
he's got a tough job. I think it's, I think it's incredibly tough. I think,

182
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.710
I think comedians don't get enough credit.

183
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.170
I'm not sure even a real comedian will stand up this John Oliver.

184
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:01.380
Is that, is that, is that the barometer for being comedian? Stand up for us.

185
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.140
Okay. Yeah. There's a big, there's a big difference.
