00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. From a trafficking.</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.980
That's another thing that we don't talk about.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.810
<v 1>That is another thing that just goes in and out of the news we were talking</v>

4
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:13.980
about on the podcast, the 39 or 35 kids that were rescued in Georgia.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.130
And it was a blip in the news, like how, and meanwhile,

6
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:20.460
I saw a thousand articles on how mean Ellen is. Yes.

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.750
Ellie's mean she's so mean. No,

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.680
there's like people are out there risking their lives to stop human trafficking.

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.330
The rescuing children from human trafficking. Yes.

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.980
What is this? Us? Marshall. Wow. 72 million missing children.

11
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.400
Excuse me, 72. Let's say million 72 missing children across Indiana,

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.170
Iowa, Ohio, and Georgia in the past several weeks,

13
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.390
the past several weeks. So what is, what is, this is where these,

14
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.130
so when you read an article like that, us marshals rescued 72 missing children.

15
00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.970
You,

16
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.510
this is where like all the Q and on people get crazy because they think that

17
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:06.990
Donald Trump is secretly working behind the scenes to stop child trafficking.

18
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.010
And that the there's like some secret cabal and the government that wants to

19
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:14.370
enable this. And then Facebook bands Q and on, and they say,

20
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.000
everyone's going crazy. Now, like this,

21
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.860
this child trafficking thing is real. It has always existed.

22
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.820
<v 0>Did you know that Houston is actually one of the hubs for child trafficking,</v>

23
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.000
Indiana in the U S really? Yes, it is.

24
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.370
<v 1>Now, how did they, how did they find out about child trafficking? Like what,</v>

25
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.080
what do they, how do they infiltrate?

26
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.430
<v 0>So usually it's local law enforcement that recognizes, uh,</v>

27
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.360
some abnormalities and their behavior of some of the children. Um,

28
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.240
usually it's certain areas, certain shops,

29
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:50.360
certain businesses that are kind of harboring these people.

30
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.270
A lot of them just get stopped because I mean,

31
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:56.540
it's kind of really odd if you're in a van or an 18 Wheeler,

32
00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:00.740
and then there's like 20 kids in it. It's weird. And

33
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.133
we,

34
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.640
as a culture have got to work with local law enforcement to start to curb this

35
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:10.250
thing, because that's where the rubber meets the road.

36
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.610
I don't know if you saw the story. I don't know if you could pull it up, sir.

37
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.410
But if you saw the story about the flight attendant that helped out the girl

38
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.940
that recognize the abnormality of a girl on a flight by herself and saved her

39
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:23.450
life.

40
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.510
<v 1>Yeah. And they had the authorities on the ground when the plane waited. Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.560
Waiting. Yeah.

42
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.320
<v 0>We got, we have got to see more of that. And so this is,</v>

43
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.140
this is how we talk about in the army. You got to police your own troops.

44
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.610
We got to police our own. If we are just, uh, uh,

45
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.230
acutely of wa acutely aware of the abnormalities and the behavior of young

46
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.080
children who clearly are under duress,

47
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.410
we cannot turn the BLI a blind eye to it. Why.

48
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.420
<v 1>Is this not a bigger story in mainstream news?</v>

49
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.460
This is one of the things that concerns me.

50
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.980
I don't understand why you're not seeing this on CNN.

51
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.640
This is not a why aren't we seeing this every day on CNN w that story right

52
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:04.300
there should be leading everything. Primetime news,

53
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.830
everything that should be leading 72 missing children rescued. Yes.

54
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.560
So how would, how would they th they can't,

55
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.890
it can't be just that they're randomly discovering what these kids in a truck,

56
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.460
or they see a kid on a plane acting weird, and that's how they catch everybody.

57
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.310
Like, right. How are they infiltrating? Like how, because there's,

58
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:25.840
there's also a bunch of guys that are former spec ops

59
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:30.210
guys that are working to fight child trafficking. How are they doing this? So.

60
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.100
<v 0>The solution to this, in my opinion. Yeah, I'll get,</v>

61
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.740
I'll get your answer in a second. Dilution is, in my opinion is actually,

62
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.270
and I will be in huge favor of this,

63
00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:44.040
of literally starting a separate task force to address this and known

64
00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:48.120
hotspots. The other way we're finding out as to answer your question,

65
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.360
the other way that we're finding out as to how they're infiltrating is really,

66
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:54.390
if you go to hubs of the world, like Houston,

67
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.580
you go to coastal cities where people are actually bringing people into the

68
00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:02.370
country. That's exactly where you're going to find a lot of it.

69
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:04.890
So if you just kind of hang out around these areas,

70
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.920
then you'll see a lot more of it. You'll discover a lot more of it.

71
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.790
And so Houston has become kind of one of those hubs because of its geographic

72
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:14.220
locations. It's, it's actually near a port city.

73
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.260
And obviously people are coming through port cities at a higher rate cargoes

74
00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:20.490
coming through at a higher rate.

75
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.940
And so we're actually able to track that a better rate if you're just kind of

76
00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:25.260
hanging around the hoop, you'll find it.

77
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.580
<v 1>So how are these people communicating? Oh my goodness. This is the,</v>

78
00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:37.440
it seems like if the government can use programs like Edward Snowden

79
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:41.520
revealed, like, how are they, how are they organizing these things?

80
00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:42.930
And where are they getting these kids? Um.

81
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.450
<v 0>Again, he's kissing maxi all over the world.</v>

82
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.660
A lot of them were coming from impoverished communities. Um,

83
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:52.980
a lot of them are coming from impoverished countries and shipping,

84
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.370
shipping them in a lot of them come from an Asian countries actually.

85
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.800
And a lot of them come from right here in the U S and this is

86
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:05.310
something that, that dawned on me is particularly with having two girls now.

87
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.181
And that is,

88
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:10.710
it's also my job to continue to protect them and all of these young people.

89
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.590
And it's actually young boys as well. It's not just, it's not just young ladies.

90
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.850
It's actually incumbent upon them to keep them safe. If we can't keep them safe,

91
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:21.990
then what are we doing here? Literally like, that's our role now,

92
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.100
you know,

93
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.820
as fathers and as responsible human beings is keeping our young people safe.

94
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.760
And the biggest thing is this,

95
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.970
there clearly as an appetite, and they're clearly as a culture for it.

96
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.310
What I want to do is how do we place

97
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.120
extreme punishment on those who behave in this

98
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.320
and partake in this behavior? I'll tell you what it is.

99
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:51.440
It could be happening right next door to you,

100
00:05:51.441 --> 00:05:56.180
to somebody that seems to be a normal human being. But we have got to stop them.

101
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.320
We have to stop predator from feasting on our children. Yeah.

102
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.610
And it's got to be demonized. Let's let let's demonize that.

103
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.680
<v 1>Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. How,</v>

104
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.570
how are these people communicating though? Doing it through the dark web?

105
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.500
Are they doing it through forums? Are they doing it through the using code?

106
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.770
Like, how are they doing this? I've heard all the above. Yeah. I've also.

107
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.700
<v 0>Heard communicating through just open email in boxes. Right.</v>

108
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.451
They don't hit send,

109
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:28.270
but they have the password for multiple emails and they'll just go in,

110
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.620
get the message and then never open or close.

111
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.100
So it's impossible basically to track. It's just like a draft.

112
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.263
<v 1>Oh, I see.</v>

113
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.890
And so other people have the logging logging account and they check it out

114
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:43.600
through the draft. Uh, that makes sense. And it's funny cause this subject,

115
00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:46.360
because of, uh, things like pizza gate,

116
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.470
the subject became so taboo that no one wants to talk about it.

117
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.430
Cause it sounds preposterous because pizza gate was so preposterous guy shows up

118
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.280
with a gun, looking for kids that are tied up in the basement.

119
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.790
And everybody's like, oh my God, there's nobody here. Everyone's wacky.

120
00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:02.650
These child sex trafficking,

121
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.710
fanatics that are interested in this and they're trying to stop this.

122
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.070
They're all crazy people. Right. But that's not really the case. Right?

123
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.900
The problem with something like pizza gate is that it, it confuses everybody.

124
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.700
And you start thinking that all this stuff is nonsense, but then these stories,

125
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.230
they, they make it to these websites and you see that this is a real thing.

126
00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:25.990
These are real news stories, but then they don't get talked about mainstream.

127
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.980
Right.

128
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.900
<v 0>And, and, and then we lose track of who the real enemy.</v>

129
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.320
<v 1>Is. Yeah. That's a real enemy. Not felon. That's dangerous. You're right.</v>

130
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.330
Not Ellen mean to her assistant.

131
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:35.643
<v 0>Just the.</v>

132
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.870
<v 1>This is what we care about is so bizarre. It's so it's such a symptom of how,</v>

133
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.270
how sick we are as a,

134
00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:48.040
as a culture and that our per our priorities are so skewed and that

135
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.080
this is sort of accentuated by our addiction to social media and that people

136
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:57.880
are concentrating so much on things that are trivial and

137
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.040
nonsensical. What's up, buddy? I.

138
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.420
<v 2>I found an article on routers that said that like the mainstream media has been</v>

139
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:05.380
reporting on this.

140
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:10.360
So like that I'm looking through pages to find out details on different

141
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.340
reporting of this. All I'm finding this on is like local news sites.

142
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:19.060
So how, like, what does that mean though? That it's not being reported? Well,

143
00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:19.150
you.

144
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.380
<v 1>Don't see it on CNN.</v>

145
00:08:20.381 --> 00:08:25.180
You're not seeing it as like mainstream television news where it's a big subject

146
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:30.030
that gets discussed that we have a giant problem like this in this country I'm

147
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.460
digging through.

148
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.610
<v 2>Here. And then like the human trafficking angle,</v>

149
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.010
according to what the U S Marshall has done here,

150
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.620
it's one in four of these kids. So if it was 25,

151
00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:42.070
kids picked up at six or seven of them were human trafficking,

152
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.650
the other 25, 20 or so,

153
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.980
or like kids that ran away or kids that were being abused,

154
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.740
they found them because they were missing.

155
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.130
So some of them missing for two weeks, I'm up to two years. Wow.

156
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.310
Not every kid in a human trafficking.

157
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.800
<v 1>72, the ones, the 35 though in Georgia.</v>

158
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.860
I think they'll just say it's all the same thing. Yeah. Same kind of thing.

159
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.580
So they're collecting and then they're like reporting the numbers.

160
00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:12.200
So like they're getting the, collecting these 35 kids over a period of time.

161
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.130
And then they're reporting. We found 35 kilowatts a month later,

162
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.660
they found 35, 1.

163
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.450
<v 2>From, uh, September, which should have been reported five weeks ago.</v>

164
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.590
It says that they recovered,

165
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.830
twenty-five missing and endangered children over the last month.

166
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.090
One and four was part of what they believe in alleged human trafficking

167
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:29.690
situation.

168
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.790
<v 1>Obviously one is too many obviously,</v>

169
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.670
but so it seems like there's Al there, they're finding missing kids.

170
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.600
And a percentage of them happened to be a part of human trafficking.

171
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.220
And now here's the question.

172
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.410
How many of the kids that are being human trafficked actually get discovered?

173
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.360
And we're finding this five here, six here, these part of these groups,

174
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.170
how many of them actually are there? Do we know we don't right. We don't,

175
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.630
we don't just the fact that it's a real thing is spooky as. And it's dangerous.

176
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:06.800
Yeah. It's terrifying. It's terrifying for fathers and mothers. You know,

177
00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:09.650
it's like the fact that we're brothers and sisters,

178
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.170
the fact that it could be someone close to you. Yes.

179
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.930
Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.

180
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.080
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

181
00:10:21.081 --> 00:10:23.510
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

182
00:10:23.511 --> 00:10:27.200
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.
