00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.360
<v 2>Again, I, I keep going back to that one point, which is,</v>

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.640
it doesn't really matter what the facts are anymore.

4
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.920
It does it as an example today was now I'm kind of bouncing around a little bit,

5
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:16.600
but today was, uh, uh, hearings up on the hill. Uh, the, uh,

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.830
Senate arm services committee was holding hearings. So who to the, they have,

7
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:25.350
they had secretary defense, Lloyd Austin. They had, uh, uh, CENTCOM commander,

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.110
uh, general McKenzie, great guy. They had, uh,

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.910
the chairman of the joint chief of staff, uh, general Millie.

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.510
So they all to, to the, to the last one said, yes,

11
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.500
uh, we were advising the president that, um,

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.820
you know, our advice is to maintain a small troop presence,

13
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.780
minimum of 2,500 troops. Right. Um, in Afghanistan.

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.340
Um, and our belief was not that it would collapse as quickly as it did,

15
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.820
but that it would collapse if you took those advisors,

16
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.380
those troops out that it would collapse maybe by fall this fall.

17
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.410
<v 0>Uh, and yet you've got the president saying,</v>

18
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.330
I don't recall being told any of that. And that's okay now because no,

19
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.010
and nobody's questioning it, right. Nobody's saying, saying, well, well,

20
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.450
hold on. No. How about some pushback? How about saying,

21
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:17.690
what do you mean you don't recall?

22
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.050
This is one of the most important decisions you've made or will be making.

23
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.520
And don't recall whether you're senior,

24
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.400
top military advisors were telling you that in their advice,

25
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.680
keep the troops in there for a period of time. And he's saying, I,

26
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.440
I don't remember. And there's really no serious pushback this whole hearing.

27
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:38.320
If anybody wants to know what Washington DC is like and how that city runs,

28
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.030
I'd recommend maybe on Thursday watching some more of these hearings, uh,

29
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.670
on the Afghanistan process, because it's just on one hand,

30
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.750
it's very depressing. It's just a show.

31
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.710
You've got the senators on the armed services committee who have been there,

32
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.990
who have been privy to all sorts of intelligence over the past few years,

33
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.030
right now, sitting in a hearing to understand what happened,

34
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:03.660
what went wrong with the Afghan withdrawal. And they're all at thing as if,

35
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.340
you know, they could be surprised by this. When,

36
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.020
when these politicians have been sitting up for Capitol hill being briefed on

37
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:14.100
this, having the opportunity to ask questions,

38
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.180
doing all the things they should be doing. But now, because it's all theater,

39
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.340
now they get to sit in a hearing in front of some of the,

40
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.500
the senior military commanders and act as a,

41
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.890
if they're a little bit surprised by all of this and oh my God,

42
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:27.930
how did it happen? How can we prevent it from happening again?

43
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:31.170
Senator chin Shaheen actually asked that I think it was of Millie saying,

44
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.450
you know, well, how do we prevent this from happening again?

45
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.450
Are you kidding me happening again? Yeah. That's your question.

46
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.690
Jesus Christ anyway, it's it, it it's I tell you what it, it was, uh,

47
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.880
yeah, it's, it's been it's know, fascinating period of time.

48
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.560
<v 1>So let me ask you this. So the,</v>

49
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.480
the president has the ability to say whatever the, you know, like, so if,

50
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.520
if someone advises him to leave 2,500 troops, he has the ability to say,

51
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.080
I don't think so. No troops.

52
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.960
<v 0>Yes, yes he does. So he can take all that advice. And,</v>

53
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.160
and the military leaders are saying, look, we, we provided this advice, right?

54
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.000
It is. I, I think it does surprise people sometimes, um,

55
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.240
when they see the extent and if they, if they were watching these,

56
00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:18.950
these hearings and understanding the information flow about stair, look,

57
00:03:18.951 --> 00:03:20.310
there was a lot of talk, right? Yeah.

58
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.110
And in the aftermath of this withdrawal clown show, um, that,

59
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.950
you know, what, what happened, who was advising, who,

60
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.830
how did we miss certain pieces of intelligence? And there's a lot to, uh,

61
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.790
to figure out there, but the idea that,

62
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.540
that the president would sit there in his, in his office, uh,

63
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:42.300
with all these senior advisors around and they would say, sir,

64
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:44.380
here's here are your options because that's always,

65
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:47.140
basically what they're doing. And theoretically, they, you know, they,

66
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:51.380
they are supposed to be strong enough to argue their point as strongly as

67
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.660
possible, right. They're not there to just go along. So they, you know,

68
00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:57.580
they all come in, they say, we think you should be, you know,

69
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:02.530
keeping troops in there and the president then steps away

70
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.290
and now Millie McKenzie, others. They all said that Biden listened very,

71
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.290
you know, seriously to them, but there was a political decision here, right.

72
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.970
That political decision was, we're getting the hell out. Now,

73
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.210
the interesting thing is, is that Biden, um,

74
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.960
he kind of wants to have it both ways, right?

75
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.720
He wants to take credit for being brave and saying, we're getting the hell out.

76
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.643
Right.

77
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.720
But then he also wants to blame the previous administration for the reason why

78
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.960
he had to be getting the hell out. Right.

79
00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:37.360
So he wants to blame the Doha agreement that Trump signed in February of 2020.

80
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.480
And what was that? Well, that was when,

81
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.310
when Trump had been registration made a deal with the Taliban and in,

82
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.270
in, uh, in February, 2020, and basically it had conditions within that and, and,

83
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.190
and, uh, general milli and McKenzie talked about those conditions, I think, uh,

84
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:55.350
today and they're in the hearings actually, um,

85
00:04:55.351 --> 00:05:00.190
there were seven conditions placed on the Taliban for this agreement to

86
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:03.780
go forward. And there was a may withdrawal date.

87
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.540
Now the administration, the previous administration,

88
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.140
people don't want to hear this, right,

89
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.540
because they're so entrenched in their own camp. Right?

90
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.980
So people who are on the, the hard left,

91
00:05:12.981 --> 00:05:16.940
they're not gonna want to hear the fact that the Doha agreement was based on

92
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:18.020
conditions, right.

93
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.130
But &lt;laugh&gt; the most senior military commanders today reaffirmed that, yes,

94
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.690
there were seven conditions for that agreement to follow through for us to

95
00:05:26.691 --> 00:05:28.650
follow through. We had eight conditions for the us.

96
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.250
And now during the course of the discussions and the negotiations,

97
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:35.450
and this whole agreement was based on a power sharing,

98
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.850
the idea was we want to create an opportunity for the Taliban and the,

99
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.931
the Afghan government.

100
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:43.440
We want them all to come together and create are sharing agreement. Well,

101
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.960
you know, on, on one hand you could argue, you'd say, that's,

102
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:50.040
that's never gonna happen. Sounds crazy. Yeah, it sounds crazy, but that's,

103
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:53.400
that's where they were. And you could also argue, and again, you know,

104
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:54.640
because people are so entrenched,

105
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:57.320
no one's want to give any credit to whether they wanna give credit to Biden.

106
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:00.040
They wanna give credit to Trump or any Republican president or Democrat

107
00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:02.960
president. Uh, you know,

108
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.800
the Trump administration did kind of broker the hard, uh,

109
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.360
heavy lift of saying, we're getting the hell out. Right.

110
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.240
There had been talk around the edges and previous administrations about, well,

111
00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:16.240
how long would it be there? Right.

112
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.870
But the Trump administration did finally actually say, let's get a negotiation.

113
00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:23.110
Let's go. And let's set a time, time to get the out after 20 years

114
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.750
right. Or wrong. So they, they put that on the table. They set the table for,

115
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.430
for that, you know, hard line withdrawal,

116
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.710
but the Taliban never met those conditions.

117
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.550
The only thing they did was not attack us troops directly,

118
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.500
but as Millie and Kenzie said today,

119
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.940
they never met any of the other conditions.

120
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.380
So it had been explained to the Taliban that if that was the case and you don't

121
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:50.780
meet these conditions, we're not gonna leave in may.

122
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.820
We're gonna just keep pushing the, the, uh,

123
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.460
the withdrawal date further to the right.

124
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.050
So why was the decision made to withdraw then? Well,

125
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.610
look in part, I think because, uh,

126
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.530
I think everybody got behind the idea that we can't stay there forever because I

127
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:10.570
think everybody, you know, understood that it just wasn't happening.

128
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.370
They weren't buying what we were selling. They never have. Right. I mean, and,

129
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.690
and you don't wanna be completely fatalistic all the time, but with Afghanistan,

130
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:18.723
it's not a bad,

131
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.280
it's not a bad frame of reference to remember all the other times that things

132
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:23.114
like this have failed.

133
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.080
And so the idea that somehow we were going to build a stable,

134
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.800
pseudo democratic government in Afghanistan was always flawed. And it was,

135
00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:36.640
there was never really any evidence to show that it was gonna happen and

136
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.030
it was propped up. And I think nobody really wanted to tell the truth,

137
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.070
um, in positions of leadership,

138
00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:46.550
whether it was military or government or Intel community.

139
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.630
And so I think there was general agreement that, yeah, we gotta,

140
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.390
we gotta get the out. Uh, and then it came down to, well,

141
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:56.830
how do we do that? Right.

142
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.220
And we faced some of the same problems at the old opiates faced getting the hell

143
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:03.460
out of Afghanistan. But I think with this case,

144
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.100
you know, part of it was,

145
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.020
we had pulled advisors off the Afghan units, you know,

146
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.260
two, three years ago, right. That had been a process.

147
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.890
So the withdrawal process had been going on for a number of years, you know,

148
00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:24.330
over the past decade or so, you know, in a sense, right. We'd been drawing back,

149
00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:28.290
pulling out some resource, pulling out troops, lowering the troop numbers, um,

150
00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:30.250
putting more responsibility on contractors.

151
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.810
And once you take the advisors out of the Afghan units, right. In a sense,

152
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.680
you don't have really eyes and ears right. Inside the AF military.

153
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.360
So you can have, you know, president Gotti or, you know, some, Afghan commander,

154
00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:46.720
just telling you whatever you want to hear,

155
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.440
but you didn't have a lot of folks at ground level working

156
00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:56.920
with the troops saying, right, it's this not gonna hold. Right.

157
00:08:56.921 --> 00:08:59.080
Particularly after the Doha agreement. Right.

158
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:03.120
Once I think that the Doha agreement was made, I think the writings on the wall,

159
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.080
and even the Afghan military could see it. Right.

160
00:09:06.081 --> 00:09:10.920
And they could read it and they could say, okay, this not gonna happen.

161
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:14.280
We're not gonna keep getting money. We're not gonna keep getting advisors. And,

162
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.830
um, we're not gonna get the air support.

163
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:21.070
That is really the only thing that keeps us in, in, in power. So,

164
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.190
you know, at some point over a period of a few years, we,

165
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.190
or we were degrading our own ability to,

166
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.470
to actually understand just how bad it was getting. Right. And, um,

167
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.940
so it, then it became a logistical exercise.

168
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.620
You gotta move personnel and you gotta move material out of the country.

169
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.300
And that's where you could argue it

170
00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:50.820
all kind of went sideways. Well, they left behind how much, a lot of, a lot of.

171
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.980
Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; crazy. Right? No, we left. We left Blackhawk. Yes. Yeah.

172
00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:58.970
Hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars as a conservative estimate. Uh,

173
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.930
why that's a conservative estimate? Well, because, uh,

174
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.570
partly because you could argue that, um,

175
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.770
some of the material was decommissioned, you know,

176
00:10:08.771 --> 00:10:13.410
some of the heavier platforms were, uh, made nonfunctioning. Okay, fine.

177
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.280
Um, I don't know to answer the question.

178
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.680
I don't know why the military wouldn't have moved more of the gear, the, the,

179
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.760
the light gear out there. In other words, the, the night vision devices, the,

180
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.080
the, uh, the weaponry, right. The small arms, uh, ammunition,

181
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.200
why not spend three or four months right. Getting that gear the hell out. Right.

182
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:37.870
You don't have the troops to that that require them. Right.

183
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.870
So now you've got all this stored. Now they,

184
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.710
the thought could have been that this is for the Afghan military.

185
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.630
They're gonna hold. But here's the, here's the thing that,

186
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.510
that interesting point that came out from general,

187
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.830
Billy and chin McKenzie during these hearings is that they claim

188
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:55.711
they're stating,

189
00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:58.940
and I have no reason not to believe they're stating that the general consensus

190
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.380
by the fall of 2020, right.

191
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.020
Was that without the troops in there, once you take the us troops out and the,

192
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.860
um, and, and the money, then, uh,

193
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.740
the government's gonna collapse probably by fall of this year.

194
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.690
It took like three hours. Yeah. It took like it. Yeah. It took 11 days now in,

195
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.490
in a classic piece of Washington speak, I think it was, uh,

196
00:11:21.491 --> 00:11:24.570
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in answering the question said, no,

197
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.930
we never saw any assessment that said that the government would collapse in 11

198
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.730
days. He's very specific. Right. He's not saying, uh, in short order. Yeah.

199
00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:36.050
He's just saying 11. I didn't see one for 11 days.

200
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.440
We had one for like two weeks. Uh, so that's, that's,

201
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.480
that's just the that happens on the, on the side.

202
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.280
So they assumed that the Afghan army eventually was not gonna fight the Taliban.

203
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.480
Yes. Yeah. So there was what they're saying is we all, and look,

204
00:11:49.481 --> 00:11:52.000
the Intel community, we've been talking about that for years. We,

205
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.480
we knew all you had to do was study the, the,

206
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.360
the Soviet papers for their time, their occupation in Afghanistan,

207
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.960
to understand how we were likely gonna replay that scenario.

208
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.960
And we did. Right. So, you know, you could argue that, uh,

209
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.270
what should have happened was years ago, we should have like,

210
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:17.310
looked around and thought this is a exercise, right? Doesn't mean that the,

211
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.990
that, you know, and I think the military today, uh,

212
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.070
the senior commanders today, and during this week,

213
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.910
I think you'll see them make a huge effort to say first and foremost,

214
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:35.540
the veterans, uh, and, and everyone who fought there and, and, and all the, the,

215
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.380
the hardship it was wasn't in vain. I think they're gonna focus on that.

216
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.740
And they're gonna say, cuz for two decades, uh,

217
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.833
the, you know,

218
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.780
we haven't been attacked on our home soil and in a narrow definition. Yes.

219
00:12:51.781 --> 00:12:53.420
That's why we went in and,

220
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.530
and then it kind of got blown up into this idea that we were gonna create,

221
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.690
you know, like this, this bastion of democracy in.

222
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.890
<v 1>Afghanistan, but it's been widely known forever. That Afghanistan is insane.</v>

223
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.290
Like it's impossible to manage. Yeah. The Soviets couldn't handle it. You know,

224
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.610
the, the, the whole area is incredibly mountainous.

225
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.200
Like it's very remote.

226
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.440
It consists of these little clans that are run by war Lords.

227
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:23.160
Like it's not like cobble is essentially the only real city, right? Yeah.

228
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.920
Is there, are, there are other cities there, there real cities there are.

229
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.120
<v 0>But there are there, they're still run like little fiefdoms and,</v>

230
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.480
and like FTOs a good word. I know. Right. I, I like how you pulled that out.

231
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.753
<v 1>Right that down, right.</v>

232
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.390
<v 0>That one down thief them. I don't, well, no, I can't.</v>

233
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.670
<v 1>Don't know. I dunno how to spell it. It's like something from the Hobbit.</v>

234
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.990
&lt;laugh&gt; what is a fiefdom? Do you know what a FDO is? Jamie?

235
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.910
I think watch the entire episode for free, only on Spotify.
