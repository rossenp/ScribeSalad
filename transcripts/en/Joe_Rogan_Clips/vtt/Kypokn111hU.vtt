00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 2>You you've always been a staunch advocate for free speech,</v>

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.960
even when that speech is hate speech. And, uh, that's a, that's a very,

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.000
it's a difficult argument for people to have in this day and age because people

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.360
want ban hate speech. They wanna ban people from talking.

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.110
You've always been an, an advocate for free speech and saying that like,

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.910
even though it seems like it's a good idea to ban these ideas or to ban people

8
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:32.270
discussing these things. In fact, it actually turns out to be a terrible idea.

9
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.720
<v 1>Well, you see, when people say they wanna ban hate speech,</v>

10
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.800
what they mean is they wanna band a speech that they hate. Yes.

11
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.740
But if you allowed something called hate speech

12
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.153
to be banned,

13
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.740
then the only important question would be who decides.

14
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.740
And again, if the government is gonna be the one to decide what hate,

15
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.130
hate speech to ban,

16
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.570
it's not gonna be the same speech as the speech you hate.

17
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.090
It's gonna be the speech they hate. Um, think if, again,

18
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.370
for liberals who are very hot these days about banning hate speech,

19
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.400
what they mean is they want to ban speech that is bigoted against

20
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.720
people based on skin color or based on sex or based on religion.

21
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.920
That's what they mean by hate speech.

22
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.640
But what I always ask liberals is, well,

23
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.640
what makes you think you are gonna have the power to decide what's hateful.

24
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.510
You're never the ones who are gonna have the power.

25
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.630
What would happen if the guy who decided what speech to hate

26
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.710
and Ben was Joe McCarthy, he would've banned your speech.

27
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.590
What if it was Giuliani who tried unsuccessfully?

28
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.190
When he was mayor of New York to ban art in the Brooklyn,

29
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.460
a museum of art that he didn't like,

30
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.940
because he thought it was disrespectful of his religion. Um,

31
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.820
uh, and he hated that speech. Now, the speech he hated,

32
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.380
wasn't the same speech that I hated the speech. He hated.

33
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.980
Wasn't the same speech as, uh, as liberals or progressives hated,

34
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.490
but he was the one who and decide not they. Um,

35
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.010
and that's, you know, that's the problem.

36
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.450
That's really why hate speech cannot be a category, uh,

37
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:37.650
that is allowed to bend because it all depends on who's gonna decide.

38
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.410
And what they hate is not gonna be the same as what you hate. Um,

39
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.640
in the 19 nine, uh,

40
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.480
there was a big move on a lot of college campuses to ban hate speech.

41
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.600
And what they meant by that is they wanted to ban racist speech.

42
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.600
And a lot of black students were in favor of it. And I,

43
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.400
I was then ahead of the,

44
00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:03.000
a C L U and I used to go around speaking to these audiences. And I had a,

45
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.080
a very substantial reputation as being an advocate for racial justice

46
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.440
and affirmative action and, and, uh, and all that. Uh, uh,

47
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.120
so I was sort of on their side and they knew that, uh,

48
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.990
in terms of the substance &lt;affirmative&gt;, but I use,

49
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.110
I didn't preach to them about the first amendment.

50
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.990
I used to ask those black students,

51
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.680
if you succeed in getting your university to ban hate

52
00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:33.770
speech, what do you think is gonna happen next?

53
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.650
You think you are gonna be the ones to decide,

54
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.440
or do you think the board of trustees is gonna be the one to decide?

55
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.040
And the board of trustees are white and the board of trustees don't share your

56
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.520
politics. And the truth of the matter is if,

57
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.040
if there had been hate speech codes on college campuses in the 1960s,

58
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.440
their most frequent victim, would've been Malcolm X, not David Duke.

59
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.040
And the kids would look at me like they had never thought of it that way,

60
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.920
but that's the problem.

61
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.520
The problem is always who gets to define what's hateful and who

62
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:14.520
gets to decide what to ban.

63
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.360
And it isn't often gonna be the ones who advocate for these codes.

64
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.470
Um, &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, the same thing happened in England in 1973, when,

65
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.110
when the national student union banned hates speech, uh, uh,

66
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.710
banned racist speech, uh, from college campuses in, in England.

67
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.390
And, um, uh, uh, a group of, uh,

68
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.460
Zionist kids who were among the, uh,

69
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:46.900
leaders of the national student movement at the time, uh, were all for that.

70
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.540
And then a few years later, a very few years later, um, uh,

71
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.340
the, the, the, the students changed, there were different students deciding,

72
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.660
and they decided to ban a Zionist speaker on the grounds. They,

73
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.370
they said that Zionism was a form of racism. Well,

74
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:10.130
the Zionist kids who had supported those hate speech bands,

75
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.370
they didn't think that Zionism was a form of racism,

76
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.370
but a few years later,

77
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.450
a majority of the national student union did so think.

78
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.720
And so the very hate speech band that these kids supported

79
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.000
ended up being used against their own speakers.

80
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.800
Uh, there are hundreds of examples like that.

81
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.200
And the reason why these bands don't work is,

82
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.930
is that nobody can define what hate speech is,

83
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.680
and it all ends up coming down to who decides,

84
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.960
and most often it ain't you.

85
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.960
<v 0>Yeah. I, I mean,</v>

86
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.120
I can completely understand the position that a social media company would have,

87
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.960
where they wouldn't want to have what consider hate speech on their platform,

88
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.320
because they think it reflects poorly on them. And they also think that it, um,

89
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.720
it radicalizes young people, it gets young people to,

90
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.000
to think along the same lines, if they're very charismatic and they're enticing,

91
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.790
they could get young people to grow, join what they believe are hate groups.

92
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.990
Right. But what, so is the solution,

93
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.390
just leave everything up and let everybody just kind of duke it out in the town

94
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:24.390
square of ideas.

95
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.070
<v 1>Well, I, I, I think so.</v>

96
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.590
And the reason I think that is that the only alternative

97
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.060
is to give somebody the power to decide what should be excluded from

98
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.900
the town square. And who is that somebody, right. You know,

99
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.260
I don't think you can get out of that dilemma. Um, uh, you know,

100
00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:50.700
at the very beginning of our history, uh, uh,

101
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.780
when the first amendment was first invented, uh,

102
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.570
we all learned in school that people like James Madison and Tom Jefferson and

103
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.290
the rest of them were all these super advocates of free speech and first

104
00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:07.570
amendment, but they weren't. Um,

105
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.170
a lot of them believed that the first amendment did not protect full speech,

106
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.450
because the way, the same way that people, how about, about hate speech is,

107
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.440
well, what does the virtue of false speech,

108
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.640
why does false speech contribute anything, uh, to a rational discussion?

109
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.360
Uh, how does false speech, uh, uh, enhance democracy? So they,

110
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.120
they, there was largely a consensus at the beginning of the 18th at the, uh, uh,

111
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.950
end of the 18th century, uh, when, when the country there was largely a,

112
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.270
a consensus, even among the, the, um, the, the,

113
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.270
the, the fiercest advocates of free speech,

114
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.870
that full speech was not protected by the first amendment.

115
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.450
Then under John Adams presidency,

116
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.200
the second pre of the United States, um,

117
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.560
they passed something called the alien inition acts,

118
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.840
and this was a federal statute that Congress passed.

119
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.160
And it, it, um, uh,

120
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.200
it made it a crime to say false things,

121
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.230
critically things about the president.

122
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.470
And the problem was is that it was the president who

123
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:30.590
decided to whom that law should apply.

124
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.510
So it ended up that people who were, uh,

125
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.100
critical of John Adams, including a, a member of Congress,

126
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.980
including several editors of newspapers, including, you know,

127
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.660
lots of people who were, they, they were arrested and convicted and sent to jail

128
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.070
under this. And why did that happen?

129
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:58.560
It happened because the people in charge said that their speech was false.

130
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.400
The, the speech of the people that they prosecuted. And, you know,

131
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.520
when people think of true or false, they think of things like, well,

132
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.640
if you say two plus two is five, we know that two plus two is four.

133
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.990
So two plus two is five is false, but in the world of politics,

134
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:23.030
almost everything can be interpreted as true or false,

135
00:09:23.031 --> 00:09:25.630
depending on who the speaker and who the listener is,

136
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.790
look at what just happened with, with our elections. Um,

137
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.310
70% of people in this, uh, uh,

138
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.260
among Republicans leave that the election was fraudulent.

139
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.210
Now you can argue about whether that's true or whether that's false,

140
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:47.010
but do you really wanna make it a crime for people to say

141
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.090
that the election was fraudulent? You have to fight it out.

142
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.610
You have to duke it out. Um,

143
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.560
otherwise you're gonna end up using these bands as weapons,

144
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.240
uh, to use against people you don't agree with, uh,

145
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.080
by simply claiming that what they said was false. That was the history in the,

146
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.400
in the early part of, of, uh, of the American experiment.

147
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.870
And the same, the thing is true today about hate speech or a bigoted speech,

148
00:10:16.871 --> 00:10:19.470
or any other kind of speech. You know, you,

149
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.830
the price we pay for having the freedom

150
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.950
to speak and listen and argue is that some of the stuff

151
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.030
we have to hear is ugly

152
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.330
and it's like an insurance policy.

153
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.010
And what we're insuring against is if we don't want to hear the ugly speech,

154
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.770
if we want to ban ugly speech,

155
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:49.010
we give the government the power to decide what's ugly enough to be banned,

156
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.330
and then we'll lose our own rights to free speech. For sure. And there,

157
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:59.280
I don't think there's any way out of that. Um, it's not intuitive. You know,

158
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.640
I used to say, I, I was a kid who grew up in the streets of Brooklyn.

159
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.600
If somebody called me a dirty Jew, uh, uh,

160
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.000
or insulted my mother or, or anything else. I mean,

161
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.720
there were two responses you didn't argue with.

162
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.230
I didn't know about free speech when I was 11 years old on the streets in, uh,

163
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.510
if somebody insulted you or said something bigoted to you, you had two choices,

164
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:28.030
you punched them out, or you ran if they were bigger than you,

165
00:11:28.031 --> 00:11:32.630
or there was more of them than you, uh, free speech is an inquired taste.

166
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.550
It's something you learn about later. Um, it's something I didn't understand,

167
00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:39.540
really. I really,

168
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.300
until I got to the a C L U and began to come to grips with these kinds of

169
00:11:43.301 --> 00:11:45.700
problems we're discussing now, was it an.

170
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.100
<v 0>Easy thing to come to grips with? Or did you go back and forth with it? Like,</v>

171
00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:49.934
was this like a.

172
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.660
<v 1>No, it's, it's,</v>

173
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.040
it's not an easy thing to come to grips with because it's not intuitive. I mean,

174
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.120
you know, the first time I saw, um,

175
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:06.490
people from the clan talking or neo-Nazis talking,

176
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:11.290
my first instinct was I wanted to take a club and beat them over the head.

177
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.360
I mean, how could, how could your first instinct not be that? Um,

178
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.370
uh, but I began to see that the consequences of that

179
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.490
was to give the government,

180
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:29.890
which was often gonna be

181
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:36.500
in the hands of people that didn't like what I believed, um,

182
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.100
to give the government the power,

183
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.860
to decide who to beat over the head and for what speech.

184
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.620
And I began to see pretty quickly as you come to grips with these in real life

185
00:12:48.621 --> 00:12:49.454
cases,

186
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:55.650
that if you give the government the power to decide what speech is ugly enough

187
00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:58.890
to be banned, it will as often be your speech,

188
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:04.330
as it will be the speech that you don't like. And that powerless people,

189
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.770
people who are discriminated against, uh, black people,

190
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.130
women gay people, Jews, Muslim, uh,

191
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.880
political minorities, so socialists, uh,

192
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.880
communists, whatever. Uh,

193
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.560
those are never the people who get to decide what speech to ban.

194
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.680
They are the victims of the speech bans, uh,

195
00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:32.160
because the people who get to decide are, are more often,

196
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.990
as I keep saying more often gonna be people like Joe McCarthy and Richard

197
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:42.550
mixing and, and, uh, uh, and, and, and Trump, and,

198
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.070
and why would we want to trust? Why would black lives matter?

199
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.350
Protestors want to trust their speech rights

200
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.910
to somebody like Donald Trump?

201
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.960
Why would right wing, uh,

202
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.680
people want to trust their speech rights to Bernie Sanders

203
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.960
say, um, and you know,

204
00:14:08.961 --> 00:14:13.760
this doesn't often just break down on liberal conservative lines.

205
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.320
I mean, remember that, that, you know, in the,

206
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.390
and one of the worst atrocities of civil liberties that this country has ever

207
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.270
seen, uh, Americans, American citizens of Japanese descent,

208
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.150
um, these were not aliens. These were not immigrants. These were, you know,

209
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.990
these were American citizens of Japanese descent. Uh,

210
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:39.700
not one of whom was ever charged with anything criminal

211
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.180
or with anything treasonous or with anything traits.

212
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.980
120,000 of them were plucked from their jobs and their homes

213
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.940
and their businesses,

214
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.480
and sent off to camps for the duration of the war for no other reason than,

215
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.080
than the ASC descendant from Japanese people.

216
00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.910
And this was done by Franklin Del or Roosevelt, you know? So,

217
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.750
so the fact is you can never trust the powerful

218
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.020
with your civil Liberty. That's true about speech,

219
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.260
and it's true about all civil liberties. Um,

220
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:21.300
power is the antagonist, not, not Republicans,

221
00:15:21.301 --> 00:15:25.980
not Democrats. Um, power is the antagon and whoever has it,

222
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.020
uh, is a danger to civil liberties. If they're not restrained.

223
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.010
And one of the strengths

224
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.050
is in the first amendment to the constitution,

225
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:41.490
which says Congress shall make no law that it

226
00:15:41.491 --> 00:15:45.820
bridges speech. Now, you know, no law means no law.

227
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.860
It doesn't mean some laws. And it doesn't mean, oh, well, bad laws.

228
00:15:50.861 --> 00:15:53.050
They can abridge, but, but not,

229
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.770
not good laws because you can't trust what they decide is good and what they

230
00:15:57.771 --> 00:16:00.610
decide is bad. So, yeah, I, I think,

231
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:06.450
I do think you gotta duke it out with words and the line between what's

232
00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:11.250
permissible and what's not permissible needs to be between speech and conduct.
