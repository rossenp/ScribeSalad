WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. No, well.</v>

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.720
<v 1>You get compared to him a lot. And, um, one in one way,</v>

3
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:13.890
I really saw that comparison was your brilliant coverage of the financial

4
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:15.890
crisis. And what was the,

5
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.690
the mechanisms behind the scene of the financial crisis?

6
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:21.420
And that I became a really big fan of your work, uh,

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.860
reading that because th that, I think you covered that as well,

8
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:28.490
if not better than anyone. Oh, well, thanks. Yeah. I mean.

9
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.240
<v 2>So I knew nothing about any,</v>

10
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:35.990
I couldn't even balance my checkbook when they assigned me to that story. And,

11
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.450
um, and I had to start basically from square one and, uh,

12
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.900
I was calling people and saying things like,

13
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:47.810
can you tell me something about something that I'll understand? You know,

14
00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:50.720
I was cold calling investment banks and literally saying that,

15
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.740
and I finally got a guy to, to, um, have lunch with me.

16
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.230
And he said,

17
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.880
your problem is that you're trying to understand this as an economic story.

18
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.770
Um, once you look at it as a crime story, you'll get it. Uh,

19
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.720
and, and from that point forward, I, I totally, I felt like I,

20
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.650
I started to understand the whole mechanism, you know,

21
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.500
the subprime mortgage scam. It really was a scam. It's really,

22
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.330
it's really just a massive corporatized version of like

23
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.880
selling, uh, oregano is weed, basically. Uh, they,

24
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:33.530
they took stuff that these, these incredibly worthless, uh,

25
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.890
highly risky mortgage loans, right. You know,

26
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:40.940
they would give out loans to everybody with a pulse. Um, you know,

27
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:44.300
whether you had a job or not, whether you were a citizen or not, didn't matter,

28
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.530
port thing was to get the loan immediately sell it off, chop it up,

29
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.340
turn it into securities. And then they use this highly advanced,

30
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.580
um, sort of mathematical trick to turn all that sort of

31
00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:03.410
mortgage hamburger into AAA rated securities. So you'd have like a, you know,

32
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:07.910
a junk rated mortgage, like the riskiest, uh,

33
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:10.370
loan in existence, uh,

34
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.630
something that was so toxic that it country companies like Countrywide wouldn't

35
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:17.210
want to hold onto it for more than a week because they were afraid it would,

36
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.340
this stuff would blow up and then they would sell it off to like a pension fund

37
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:24.440
or, um, you know,

38
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:29.390
an insurance company in the form of a AAA rated security, which,

39
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.040
you know, is as safe as a us treasury bond. So it was, it was a scam.

40
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.350
Uh, again, the, the, the, the, the, the metaphor of,

41
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.030
you know, baby powder taking baby powder and selling it as Coke or whatever,

42
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.350
that that's exactly what it was.

43
00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:49.460
They just took worthless and sold it as something that was, that was gold.

44
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.810
Uh, and they got, they did it for years and years and years and years. And they,

45
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.970
they knew that this gigantic huge bubble of risk

46
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.320
and disaster was just accumulating.

47
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.760
And that someday it was going to all explode and cascade and

48
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.350
ruin the economy, but everybody was trying to time it right.

49
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.600
And, and bet on when that would happen and make their money before that,

50
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.560
that judgment day came. And, uh, it was,

51
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.680
it was fascinating once I, once I started to learn about it, it was just such a,

52
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.630
an amazingly disgusting, uh, fascinating story that, um,

53
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.970
it was just hard not to, not to get into it.

54
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.100
<v 1>Crime story. Yeah. Think of it as a crime story. Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.660
<v 2>Yeah, no, absolutely. I even got one guy gave me a book.</v>

56
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.560
Um, it was called famous, famous con artists in history. Right.

57
00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:50.970
It was like this little tome, uh, it's smaller than like the smallest paperback.

58
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.270
And it was the biography of this guy.

59
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.760
Victor Lustig was his name.

60
00:03:56.761 --> 00:04:01.410
He was famous because he sold the Eiffel tower twice. Right. Uh,

61
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.060
and, um, he H he had this, uh,

62
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.430
the scam that he called, I think it was called the, the,

63
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.120
the Hungarian box. Um, I'll have to go back and look,

64
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.110
but basically what he would do is he would get on a boat,

65
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.120
um, in New York. And he had this, uh,

66
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.720
sort of beautiful mahogany box with a crank on it that had two holes in it.

67
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.430
And he would show all the guests that he would put a blank piece of paper in one

68
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.410
end turn, a crank, and a hundred dollar bill would come out the other end. Uh,

69
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.940
and he convinced them all that it was a machine that made money.

70
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.650
And, uh,

71
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.600
everybody would offer him an increasing amount of money for this invention.

72
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.000
Uh, and he wouldn't sell it until the last day, uh, when he would sell it for,

73
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:55.560
you know, 40 or $50,000.

74
00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.170
And then he would disappear and jump off the boat in France.

75
00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:02.040
Never be seen again. People would, yeah, there it is. What's it called?

76
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.710
Wow. Yeah. Um, but, um,

77
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.570
but that's exactly what the mortgage.

78
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.670
<v 1>Is. Yeah. Let me see his face.</v>

79
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.400
Look at that creep. Look.

80
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.590
<v 3>At him. Wow. Let me see that box again.</v>

81
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.820
<v 4>Wow. That is crazy.</v>

82
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.660
<v 2>So, yeah, so it was obviously fake and, and,</v>

83
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.270
but that's what the Morgan scam was. They, they,

84
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.040
they were taking basically blank paper. These,

85
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.660
these subprime loans that belong to janitors who were going to

86
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.630
foreclose within 10 minutes. All right.

87
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.500
And they were telling people that, oh,

88
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:49.380
we have this new mathematical process that allows,

89
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.800
that actually makes this stuff really safe. Um,

90
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.100
and you can put it in your, uh,

91
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.840
in your college endowment, you can put in your pension fund.

92
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.390
And so all these people, you know,

93
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.200
whose retirement monies were based on securities,

94
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.170
we're buying all this that they thought was triple aerated.

95
00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:14.600
And that's, that's how they woke up. And, you know, and in 2008, 2009,

96
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:18.080
and they found their 401k is where were, you know,

97
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.380
wiped out by 40% or whatever it was. My neighbor.

98
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.420
<v 1>Really did that happened. Then my neighbor bought this plot of land and, uh,</v>

99
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.570
had this, uh, dream to build his dream house. And, uh,

100
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.570
he would go buy the plot of land and he was always cleaning up and getting

101
00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:36.160
ready. And I was talking to him and then boom, 2008 happened.

102
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.350
He lost everything. And he would still go by that plot of land and cleaning up.

103
00:06:41.351 --> 00:06:43.670
And he, and I would talk about it and, you know,

104
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.130
they just told me he lost everything.

105
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.510
<v 2>Yeah. So it's never going to happen, huh? Yeah, no, I think he, uh.</v>

106
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.260
<v 1>I think he died. He eventually got really sick and they,</v>

107
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:55.570
they took him out of his house and brought them somewhere.

108
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:58.600
But I think he's dead now, but yeah, his, uh,

109
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.580
his story was awful, awful to hear this guy who was in his sixties,

110
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.640
who had got this piece of land with a nice view. And it's like,

111
00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:09.160
this is where I'm going to drink, build my dream house.

112
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.260
And he had all this money prepared for it,

113
00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:16.000
all this money saved away and he was ready to rock and roll and then boom,

114
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.380
it all went out.

115
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.860
It just drained out somebody put a hole in the bottom of the boat and

116
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.040
everything, everything went to the bottom on the ocean.

117
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.731
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

118
00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:27.760
And then he probably got ripped off twice because his tax dollars went to go

119
00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:31.690
bail out the guys who, uh, you know, who, who cause some of the,

120
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.460
some of the banks got stuck holding some of this.

121
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.510
And rather than eat the losses, like your, your friend did,

122
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.100
they got the federal reserve to buy it from them, you know, and,

123
00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:45.790
and you know, or, or the treasury.

124
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.320
<v 1>So how the did they get away with giving the CEOs bonuses.</v>

125
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.590
<v 2>During that time? Yeah. Bonuses.</v>

126
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.040
<v 1>During the time where the, they had to be bailed out by the taxpayers.</v>

127
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.490
<v 2>Yeah. That was another scam. Like, so there were,</v>

128
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.130
if you looked at the fine print of all the bailouts,

129
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.980
it's it basically said that, um,

130
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.550
you had to repay the money by us by X time, uh,

131
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.290
before you could start paying people, exorbitant amounts of money again. Uh,

132
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.430
but a lot of those, a lot of those conditions were never really followed.

133
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.200
And, you know, the,

134
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.820
the conditions of repayment were kind of glossed over. And,

135
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.120
um, the, the,

136
00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:30.190
the companies that they were supposed to be able to pass these things called

137
00:08:30.191 --> 00:08:32.440
stress tests, which, uh,

138
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.870
demonstrated that they were back on solid footing again,

139
00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:37.930
before they paid people, uh, bonuses.

140
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.340
But the stress tests were all fudged. And, you know, I mean, th th there were,

141
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.920
there was crime and corruption,

142
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.630
illegality basically in every direction during that whole period. And, and,

143
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.290
uh, not just in the government, but in, in all of these companies as well.

144
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.240
Jesus. Yeah. But fascinating to, to follow.

145
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.300
<v 1>Yeah. What was it like covering that? I mean,</v>

146
00:08:59.301 --> 00:09:03.800
how long did you spend working on it? Uh, seven years. Probably.

147
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.533
Yeah.

148
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:06.350
<v 2>Yeah. Well,</v>

149
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.220
cause one of the things that I found out that it was really interesting was

150
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.180
I did my first story about this and I got this incredible

151
00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:22.040
reaction because it turns out that the financial press there is nobody

152
00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:25.130
in the financial press who writes for ordinary people.

153
00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.620
Like it's basically what I was doing was a translation job.

154
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:32.450
I was trying to basically take what had happened and

155
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.530
explain it in a way that a person who knew nothing about finance would be able

156
00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:40.250
to understand. Uh, and it turns out that nobody is doing that.

157
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.750
So all of these people who had questions about it, who,

158
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.590
who wanted to know what had happened to their money, or why to,

159
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.620
why did my house get foreclosed on or what, you know, what's,

160
00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:56.090
what's a subprime mortgage or anything. Um,

161
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.430
you know, there, there was nobody else doing that work.

162
00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:01.130
So I had lots of it to do, and it was,

163
00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:04.730
it was really interesting and I just kept doing it. Wow.

164
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.530
That'd be depressing. Yeah. Oh yeah, of course. Of course. I mean, most,

165
00:10:09.531 --> 00:10:13.610
most investigative reporting is depressing. Uh, well.

166
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:18.230
<v 1>Particularly that, because, I mean, a lot of it was old people. Oh my.</v>

167
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:23.150
<v 2>God. Old people, minorities. I mean, uh, I did one story about,</v>

168
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:29.480
um, a bank, uh, in Maryland. Well, it's a national bank,

169
00:10:29.481 --> 00:10:31.310
it's a bank that, you know,

170
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.820
I wouldn't be surprised that a lot of people listening,

171
00:10:34.821 --> 00:10:38.930
how have their accounts at this bank, um, they, uh,

172
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.950
had to pay a settlement to the government because they were, uh,

173
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.120
intentionally targeting elderly black people, uh,

174
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:52.100
to sell subprime mortgages to, and they called the mud people. Uh,

175
00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:53.150
and there were all these,

176
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.620
these like toxic emails going back and forth about how stupid they were and how

177
00:10:57.621 --> 00:11:01.570
they'll buy anything, et cetera, et cetera, emails, they call the mud people.

178
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.200
Yeah. Yeah. And so they had to pay a settlement to the government. And, but the,

179
00:11:06.201 --> 00:11:08.030
you know, the racial component of the, of,

180
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.480
of that crash was something that I didn't really clue into until late,

181
00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:14.900
but that was a big part of it too. It was, um,

182
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.110
a lot of it involved these mortgage lenders

183
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.340
going into particularly like lower middle class,

184
00:11:25.341 --> 00:11:29.570
black neighborhoods and knocking on doors where there be like an elderly person

185
00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:33.770
at home and saying, Hey, would you like to refi your mortgage?

186
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.460
And you'll have a little bit of extra spending money this month, right.

187
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.350
And the person won't know anything about finance and they'll

188
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.300
they'll sign this refinance deal that allows them to save a little bit of money

189
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.223
each month,

190
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.370
not knowing that they had just converted their fixed mortgage into a floating

191
00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:56.920
mortgage. And that as soon as the interest rates change, you know,

192
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.000
you'd have people who went from paying $900 a month to paying

193
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:05.770
$7,000 a month. Right. And suddenly they're out in the street and,

194
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.190
and, you know, the, uh, the company that sold them,

195
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:13.540
the loan is long gone by then. They, they, they're not holding it. They,

196
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.450
as soon as they got her name on the dotted line,

197
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:19.750
they sold it off to a bank in New York who in turn again,

198
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:23.290
chopped it up into hamburger and sold it probably to your pension fund or who,

199
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.520
or whatever. So there was nobody she could complain to. And, you know, yeah.

200
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:28.840
That's stuff. It was really depressing.

201
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:33.330
<v 1>It's a feeling like of having very little understanding about finance and then</v>

202
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.590
immersing yourself in it.

203
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.600
And that was fascinating that this is the underlying structure that our society

204
00:12:39.601 --> 00:12:43.800
is run on, that our money is established through. This is,

205
00:12:43.801 --> 00:12:47.670
this is how we, we sell houses and loans.

206
00:12:47.671 --> 00:12:49.890
And this is what we're doing. This is.

207
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.420
<v 2>Yeah, no, it was, it was fascinating. I, because before that,</v>

208
00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:58.290
I was mostly covering like elections, right. And again,

209
00:12:58.291 --> 00:12:59.280
if you cover elections,

210
00:12:59.281 --> 00:13:03.780
it's incredibly boring and you never hear anything of substance and it's not

211
00:13:03.781 --> 00:13:08.160
terribly complicated. And, you know, one, one, the Democrats says that,

212
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.470
you know, we want to help the middle class.

213
00:13:10.471 --> 00:13:13.200
And the Republican says we want to protect family values.

214
00:13:13.201 --> 00:13:16.830
And that's pretty much the extent of the intellectual challenge in terms of

215
00:13:16.831 --> 00:13:20.670
covering that stuff. And I always thought to myself, you know,

216
00:13:20.671 --> 00:13:23.760
politics in America must be a lot more complicated than this, right.

217
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:28.740
There must be some other hidden thing where

218
00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:32.680
it's incredibly complex and diabolical and, and, you know, the,

219
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:37.380
the real machinations of power must be visible somewhere. And,

220
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.300
um, I think that you find that when you, when you start looking at the,

221
00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:46.800
how wall street works, how money works, how central banking works, how,

222
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:53.040
um, you know, how the concentration of wealth works.

223
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:58.320
Uh, I mean, basically the subprime scheme was

224
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.760
an effort to pull the remaining savings out of the population, right?

225
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.150
It just wasn't, you know, in the old days, invest in banks,

226
00:14:06.151 --> 00:14:07.710
made their money by lending money,

227
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:11.550
to companies who would build factories and they would make stuff and sell it

228
00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:14.940
around the world. And everybody would make money and never, you know, even,

229
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.330
even the population would, would, would benefit from it.

230
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.400
But that manufacturing economy, it's all gone it's overseas.

231
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.110
So you have this financialized economy and they have no

232
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.490
normal beneficial, uh, way to make money. And all their,

233
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.540
all they can really do is look to see where is their money and how can we get

234
00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:40.260
it? And most people had money in their houses, right?

235
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.190
Like the, the accumulated savings of most people,

236
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.690
whatever was left after the internet crash in the nineties, uh,

237
00:14:48.691 --> 00:14:49.710
was in real estate.

238
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:54.590
And this was the scam by which they

239
00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:00.020
took the wealth that was left in the pockets of ordinary people and

240
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:04.760
transferred it to, you know, nine people in Manhattan, basically. I mean,

241
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.800
that's why you have, you know,

242
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.400
we told them when we talk about wealth inequality now, right.

243
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:15.440
It being a huge factor that, you know, the top, you know,

244
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.990
95, I'm sorry,

245
00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:22.910
the top 1% of the population owns 90% of the wealth in the country or whatever

246
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:27.740
it is. Um, that's a consequence of schemes like this, where they're just,

247
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.210
they're, they're finding out where people have a little bit of money and they're

248
00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:37.040
systematically coming up with scams to move it from there to here and with no

249
00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:39.200
consequence, no, with no consequences.

250
00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:42.740
And that was the other part of the story that I ended up having to cover later,

251
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:46.610
which was, you know, the, the last time they tried something like this,

252
00:15:46.611 --> 00:15:49.040
like during the SNL crisis, which,

253
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.400
which was also sort of a giant fraud scheme,

254
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.150
also that involved real estate lending. And, you know,

255
00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:01.520
but that the government after that actually, you know, indicted 1800 people,

256
00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:04.580
they put 800 people in jail. They put a lot of, you know,

257
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.350
serious influential people on the dock after that. Uh,

258
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.580
nobody, nobody went to jail after this stuff. And, and there was,

259
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.830
and people think that, well,

260
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:18.500
they didn't do anything that was technically illegal, no. There,

261
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:22.070
there was lots of stuff that was, that was brazenly, uh,

262
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:27.140
criminally illegal. I mean, they, they committed fraud on a broad scale. Uh,

263
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:30.230
but some of these companies were into the things that were even worse than that.

264
00:16:30.231 --> 00:16:32.780
I mean, you take HSBC,

265
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.300
HSBC admitted to laundering

266
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:42.110
$850 million for a pair of, uh, central and south American drug cartels, uh,

267
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.070
including the Sinaloa cartel. Right. Which is suspected in thousands of murders,

268
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:48.920
like, and, you know, they,

269
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.260
they admitted to this activity,

270
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.910
they agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the government

271
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.850
where nobody did a day in jail.

272
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.440
No individual had to pull out a dime out of their own pockets to pay the

273
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:07.940
shareholders, ponied up $1.9 million. But some of that was tax deductible,

274
00:17:07.941 --> 00:17:12.860
which means we P we paid some of that fine. Um, and,

275
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:13.311
uh,

276
00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:17.390
and the only real punishment with any teeth is that some of the executives had

277
00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:21.950
to partially defer their bonuses for five years. Uh,

278
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.540
so that's,

279
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:27.800
it laundering $850 million for narco terrorists

280
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.640
gets you a total walk. Uh, you know,

281
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:36.380
that tells you basically everything you need to know about, you know,

282
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.010
do we prosecute white collar crime in this country? Basically? No. You know,

283
00:17:40.011 --> 00:17:43.010
I mean, that's the answer ultimately that you find out.

284
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.760
<v 1>And there was paperwork that showed they knew it was from the cartels.</v>

285
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:51.660
<v 2>Oh yeah. They, if you, if you look at the, the, the agreement,</v>

286
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.310
uh, and you can watch the third, there's a, there's a video of, um,

287
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.110
of Loretta Lynch and Lanny Breuer.

288
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.740
Cause this was before Laura Loretta Lynch was attorney general, but she was, um,

289
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.450
uh, she was basically the head of this deal. Um,

290
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.480
they talked about the fact that the HSBC branches,

291
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.160
because most of this was done in Mexico, um, uh, H max,

292
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.690
which was the subsidiary company, they had special teller windows built,

293
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.420
uh, to fit cash boxes that the drug cartels were bringing into the bank.

294
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.120
Uh, so basically you've seen these,

295
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.630
seeing the scene in Scarface where the guys come in with duffel bags of cash to

296
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:37.280
the bank. Right. And, you know, that's like a montage, you know, there's that,

297
00:18:37.281 --> 00:18:40.140
that song, I forget what song it is in the background, same thing.

298
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.290
These guys would come into the, the bank.

299
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.680
They would slide in these boxes of cash one after the other.

300
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.880
And that's admitted activity, the bank signed off on this. They, you know,

301
00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:52.050
it's not like they're contesting it.

302
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:56.340
They're not saying we neither admit nor deny it's, it's part of the deal.

303
00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:01.740
Uh, so, and, and they agreed to the amount, everything. So,

304
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.390
um, yeah, it was a $1.9 billion settlement, but, you know,

305
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.270
it's not like it came out of the pockets of the people who did it,

306
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.920
and it's not like any of the people who did it are in jail. It's just, you know,

307
00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:17.760
a thing that happened and, you know, that's five weeks of profit for the bank.

308
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.220
So what, what the? They don't care.

309
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.650
<v 4>Right. Did.</v>

310
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.750
<v 1>You see the documentary, the inside job?</v>

311
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.480
<v 2>Uh, yeah. Yup. We covered a lot of the same territory. Yeah. That.</v>

312
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.680
<v 1>Was a sobering documentary where they're talking to the very people that caused</v>

313
00:19:33.681 --> 00:19:37.820
the financial crisis and, and realizing that these people were economics,

314
00:19:37.821 --> 00:19:42.320
professors that eventually got these jobs really lucrative jobs with

315
00:19:42.321 --> 00:19:46.520
banks and how they finagled this system and made it.

316
00:19:46.521 --> 00:19:48.200
So it looked like these things were appropriate.

317
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.920
<v 2>Yeah, no. I talked to some of the,</v>

318
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.650
some of the things that they invented that made this,

319
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.970
the crash possible sounded like good ideas. Like they,

320
00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.450
they came up with this thing called the credit default swap. Right.

321
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.150
And I won't bore you with what that is exactly.

322
00:20:05.151 --> 00:20:09.650
But basically it's a kind of insurance, uh, where,

323
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.290
uh, it's, it's basically a bet. It's hard to explain. Um, but,

324
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:20.570
uh, it, it's a way of, of quasi insuring a product,

325
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.500
um, without having to pony up a lot of money. Uh,

326
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:29.330
and the it's it's called the derivative. Right.

327
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.000
Uh, and these instruments are completely unregulated. Um,

328
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.990
how can I put this? A credit default swap is, is like, uh,

329
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:46.580
you and I betting on whether or not a third person's house is going

330
00:20:46.581 --> 00:20:50.170
to, uh, burn in a fire, right?

331
00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:54.670
Like the old school insurance said that it had to be your house in order for you

332
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:56.890
to get insurance on it. Um,

333
00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.480
this new form of quasi insurance said that two totally

334
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:04.000
disinterested parties could have an interest in a, in a,

335
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.860
in a third thing that happens. So it's basically gambling. Uh, and,

336
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.650
um, on the one hand,

337
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.910
it allowed people to create a whole lot of capital,

338
00:21:15.911 --> 00:21:17.440
which allowed them to lend more money,

339
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:22.150
which theoretically allowed people to buy more houses. But in reality,

340
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:25.390
it just created the system where all these people had bets that were back and

341
00:21:25.391 --> 00:21:29.740
forth on, on all these properties. That's one of the reasons why the,

342
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.310
when the crash happened, when, when all those mortgages started to fail,

343
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.250
it wasn't just the failures of those properties.

344
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:39.160
It was all these people who were betting on whether or not these people could,

345
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.640
could pay their mortgages. They started to lose money.

346
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:45.340
And then there were people who had bets on that, who started to lose money.

347
00:21:45.341 --> 00:21:50.260
And it's like this cascading Whirlpool of that happened. And,

348
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:55.090
um, again, it just, it started out as an idea to just create more money to lend,

349
00:21:55.091 --> 00:21:59.020
to land. And it turned into this nightmare, uh,

350
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.850
mechanical scenario that just, that created losses, uh,

351
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.030
you know, in this almost apocalyptic fashion. And,

352
00:22:07.031 --> 00:22:11.070
and a lot of them had no idea that, that, that was going to be the adventure.

353
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.670
Wow. Yeah. It's, it's, it's crazy. It's definitely crazy stuff.

354
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.300
<v 1>As a person who didn't really follow finance before,</v>

355
00:22:21.301 --> 00:22:24.870
how much has that affected your life now? Like the way you look at things?

356
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:29.490
<v 2>I definitely pay a lot more attention to the fine print,</v>

357
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.440
uh, when I enter into any financial contract. Um,

358
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.640
I think about where I do my banking. Uh,

359
00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.030
but the reality is you just don't have a whole lot of choice in this country.

360
00:22:42.031 --> 00:22:45.570
Anyway. I mean, it's like everything else. There's only a few companies left.

361
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.520
Um, so almost every bank, uh,

362
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.970
that's out there where you can have a bank account and a mortgage is,

363
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:58.830
is a bank that I've written about some massive scandal, uh, before. So,

364
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.450
uh, that, that's, that's a problem. Um, but, uh, yeah,

365
00:23:03.451 --> 00:23:04.830
I worry about it all the time. I mean,

366
00:23:04.831 --> 00:23:09.360
I have friends in finance who call me and they, they tell me that,

367
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:14.160
you know, that the things that are incredibly unsafe and that this, that,

368
00:23:14.161 --> 00:23:16.110
and the other could, could, could happen.

369
00:23:16.111 --> 00:23:20.640
And so I have an anxiety level about things that I never had before. But, um,

370
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:25.590
apart from that, yeah, I mean, that's a natural consequence of,

371
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:30.090
of having to spend seven years looking at all these horror stories,

372
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.970
crazy. It's crazy. You spent their lunch time on it.

373
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.670
<v 1>Do you see any other bubbles coming up?</v>

374
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.410
<v 2>Yeah. People talk about that all the time. Um,</v>

375
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.410
there's a lot of, um,

376
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.770
a lot of negative press about subprime auto loans, for instance, which is,

377
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.720
uh, it's not exactly the same, but it's a similar thing. I mean,

378
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:58.130
th th the same basic scam of taking

379
00:23:58.131 --> 00:24:02.990
loans chopping them up and then repackaging them as something

380
00:24:02.991 --> 00:24:06.800
that's more valuable than the original loan. You can do that with anything,

381
00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:09.080
any kind of credit. You can do it with credit cards,

382
00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:12.410
you can do it with aircraft loans. You can do it with, with car loans,

383
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:16.960
you can do it with, with home mortgages. Um, and so the,

384
00:24:16.961 --> 00:24:20.150
the mechanism of taking things that are,

385
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:25.490
are toxic and risky and making them look like triple a is still,

386
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:31.100
uh, is still part of the economy. And, um, it's everywhere.

387
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.110
The plus side of that is that there's more credit available. Uh, you know,

388
00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:39.920
almost anybody can get a credit card, or even if you've had screwed up credit,

389
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:42.530
you can get a car, you know, I mean, uh, there's.

390
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.660
<v 1>Put us on this, like endless cycle of buildup, bubble collapse, buildup,</v>

391
00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.320
bubble collapse, rebounding collapse again.

392
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:55.060
<v 2>Absolutely. I mean, I think that's, that's, that's why, yeah.</v>

393
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.190
You have to be nervous about the, you know,

394
00:24:57.191 --> 00:25:02.110
the skyrocketing stock exchange because we've had verified.

395
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.260
Yeah. I mean, you should be right. Do you have heavily invested in it?

396
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.243
I've got some in there.

397
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.140
<v 1>I just did. When, when the whole,</v>

398
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.870
when Trump was saying the economy's never been better,

399
00:25:10.871 --> 00:25:13.540
I look at the stock market stock, market's killing it all these days,

400
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.630
and then it'll have a bad day and you'll go, okay, well,

401
00:25:16.631 --> 00:25:18.910
I thought we were doing great. Like, what's going on with this bad day?

402
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.360
Can you not control these bad days? Like what's happening here. Right.

403
00:25:22.361 --> 00:25:24.250
If you're, if you're in control of the good days,

404
00:25:24.251 --> 00:25:27.490
you're also in control of the bad days, right? Yeah, of course. Of course.

405
00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:31.390
It just, it seems, it seems super suspicious.

406
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.680
<v 2>Yeah. And, and yeah, in the old days, you'd have a lot of confidence that,</v>

407
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.480
well, the stock market always eventually goes up, so yeah,

408
00:25:40.481 --> 00:25:42.730
there's going to be bad days, but it'll, it'll go back up.

409
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.780
But the problem is the underlying economy in America, just isn't all that hot,

410
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:51.120
you know, like w like, what do we really make in this country? What, what,

411
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.190
where where's the floor, right? Like we have,

412
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.780
we have some industries that sorta perform well, but if, you know,

413
00:25:58.781 --> 00:26:01.990
periodically we go through these bubbles that are based on nothing more than

414
00:26:01.991 --> 00:26:06.310
enthusiasm. Uh, you know, in the nineties, it was the, the, the,

415
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.450
the tech bubble, right. Where people like Alan Greenspan would say things like,

416
00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:14.170
well, we have a new paradigm and you can omics rights. So, um,

417
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:18.610
it doesn't matter whether a company hasn't shown any ability to

418
00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:23.320
make money or, um, you know, has no,

419
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.270
uh, reasonable profit and loss statements. It's just, if it's a good idea,

420
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.930
the stock is sound and everybody should invest in it.

421
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.260
And the stock market is going to continually go up, go up.

422
00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:39.880
So don't worry about it. Of course, that doesn't happen. Everybody. It blows up,

423
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:42.820
everybody loses their shirt, but what, what do they do?

424
00:26:42.821 --> 00:26:47.100
The fed lowers interest rates basically allows wall street to

425
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.570
recapitalize, drink itself sober. And they plunge into the next,

426
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.770
the next madness, which is mortgages. And once again,

427
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:58.890
you have Alan Greenspan saying, Hey, you know,

428
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:03.630
real estate is a great bet. It's, you know, it's going to continually ascend.

429
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.920
People should use their homes as ATM machines. You know, you should,

430
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.460
you should consider refinancing your house so that you can get a little bit of

431
00:27:11.461 --> 00:27:14.220
extra cash. And, and this, this,

432
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:17.160
this was actually the message they sent to America. And again,

433
00:27:17.161 --> 00:27:21.810
it creates this artificial mania where the economy is

434
00:27:21.811 --> 00:27:24.690
stoked, artificially, uh,

435
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.790
two gigantic dimensions, but it's not based on anything. And so when,

436
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.860
when it, it crashes, when you finally get like any Ponzi scheme, it, you know,

437
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:35.694
it depends,

438
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.800
it depends on more new investors coming in than old investors leaving. Right.

439
00:27:40.801 --> 00:27:44.970
So there's always going to be that moment when suddenly we don't have as many

440
00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:48.330
new ones as old ones. And the instant that happens,

441
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.530
it all goes Kaboom. Right. And that's what happened with, with, uh,

442
00:27:53.531 --> 00:27:57.570
the subprime market. There was a moment in time where the,

443
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.280
they just couldn't keep it going anymore.

444
00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:02.130
They couldn't find any more new suckers to get to,

445
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:07.260
to sell mortgages to. And the mania ended and it all went splat.

446
00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:12.060
And then it was amplified by the fact that we have this system now of people

447
00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:16.860
betting on credit, uh, that is legal, um,

448
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.540
which creates more losses out of, out of thin air. So, yeah,

449
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:25.170
I I'm terrified every time I see this, the stock market go up,

450
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.800
what's it based on, is it based on our economy actually doing well?

451
00:28:28.801 --> 00:28:33.540
I don't know. I don't think so. You know, um, I'm sorry. I'm look, look,

452
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:35.960
I'm scaring you a little bit. You're definitely a scary, okay.

453
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.880
<v 1>But I think that's good. I think I need to be scared.</v>

454
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.300
I tend to take these things and just, you know,

455
00:28:41.301 --> 00:28:44.390
I have financial advisors that I like let them handle money. Right.

456
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.730
When I hear things like this, I just go, oh Jesus.

457
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.530
W w I get terrified when I hear about really smart people getting scammed like

458
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.410
yesterday, we were talking about, uh, [inaudible]

459
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:54.410
. Do you know that a blood testing company that turned out to be total horseshit? No, I didn't hear about this. Oh, it's 

460
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:54.410
a great story. It's a, it's a story of, uh,

461
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:54.410
 one of those things where you, you find someone who you hope exists and you build them up. There was this woman

462
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:54.410
, uh,

463
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:54.410
 she looked like Steve jobs. She wore a black turtleneck in every photo. And,

464
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:54.410
uh,  she was, uh,

465
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.243
 the, the richest ever self-made woman. She was worth $4 billion.

466
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:26.510
She had, uh, built this company called Marranos right out of college.

467
00:29:26.511 --> 00:29:27.590
She was like 19.

468
00:29:27.591 --> 00:29:31.670
When she started the company was a blood testing company that just required a

469
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:35.720
small prick of your blood to do complicated blood analysis for diseases and

470
00:29:35.721 --> 00:29:39.560
things along those lines. It turns out it didn't work at all. And, uh,

471
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.180
Dave faked a bunch of, and widespread fraud.

472
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:46.250
A lot of people got their blood tested. It turned out to be, you know, they,

473
00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:48.940
they were at risk for all these diseases. And, uh,

474
00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:53.650
Warren buffet have invested a hundred million dollars, I think 1 25,

475
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.620
uh, Betsy Davos, uh, more than a hundred million dollars.

476
00:29:56.621 --> 00:30:00.460
Like all these super wealthy people get scammed. Wow. Yeah.

477
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:05.170
When you find out that really wealthy people that do this for a living

478
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.760
and buffet does that for a living, right. That he can get scammed out of

479
00:30:09.761 --> 00:30:14.540
$125 million. Right. Yeah.

480
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:19.410
<v 2>And, and, and Warren buffet is his mantra is supposed to be</v>

481
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.990
picking the,

482
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.730
the absolute long-term investment. Right. So it's not,

483
00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:31.770
he's not like a Stevie Cohen type who just looks at the tape and tries to time

484
00:30:31.771 --> 00:30:33.570
it just, right. So, you know, you can,

485
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:38.040
you can make an investment for 10 seconds and come out with, with a, you know,

486
00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:43.560
if he, if he's investing in a company and, and even he can be fooled, that's,

487
00:30:43.561 --> 00:30:45.930
that's pretty terrible. But look at Enron. I mean, and Ron was,

488
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.040
was another example of the world's best financial analysts were looking at this

489
00:30:50.041 --> 00:30:52.290
company for a decade.

490
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:57.690
And the, the results were completely ridiculous.

491
00:30:57.691 --> 00:31:01.890
Like, it should have been obvious to any lay person that, that, uh,

492
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.490
these profit numbers couldn't possibly be real. Uh,

493
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.110
and it wasn't until, uh, one of those guys, uh,

494
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.190
I think it was Jim channels. It was sort of a famous short seller. Um,

495
00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.840
men sort of said, Hey, wait a minute that there's something up here. Um,

496
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.170
but people continually invested in these companies,

497
00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:26.880
and there's just not a whole lot of oversight that goes on, um, uh, with,

498
00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:31.530
with wall street. And I think that's, that's a major lesson of, of, uh,

499
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.650
you know, the last 20 years is that,

500
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.720
is that there's just not a lot of eyes on, on crime in this area.

501
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.170
Another example is, um, uh, I'm sorry,

502
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.560
who's the guy who scammed all the rich people. Yeah.

503
00:31:46.561 --> 00:31:49.360
I was going to bring him up. He used the most egregious example, right? Yeah.

504
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.040
I mean, there, there are other, there are other people who did similar things.

505
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.300
Um, but this guy didn't even make investments. Right. You know what I mean?

506
00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.990
Like he, he was literally just sort of taking money and, you know,

507
00:32:00.991 --> 00:32:03.620
when someone cashed out, he would, you know, it was,

508
00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:08.460
it was like a who's that little girl, a little tag, a little tag. Yeah, exactly.

509
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.210
Just like throwing, he had a big pile of cash and, you know, he would,

510
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:17.250
he would take some man and throw some out. But if the sec had had at any time,

511
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:22.860
just looked at his books and said, what are you invested in? Um,

512
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.660
it all would have, you know,

513
00:32:24.661 --> 00:32:27.750
that whole house of cards would have fallen and invest in anything.

514
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:33.060
And he wasn't, he wasn't making trades. He wasn't doing anything, you know? And,

515
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.330
and there were a bunch of stories like this. Uh,

516
00:32:36.331 --> 00:32:41.000
there's a great book called the octopus, which about as somebody who did a,

517
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:44.990
Maydoff like scam, another hedge fund, um, where same thing,

518
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:46.190
they weren't really making trays.

519
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:50.570
They were just sort of creating phony profit and loss statements and, and,

520
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.240
and creating records that look like trades. Uh, they could, they,

521
00:32:55.241 --> 00:32:58.220
they could tell their investors about, but they weren't actually doing anything.

522
00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.210
So if anybody,

523
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.040
any expert at any time had just poke their nose

524
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:08.510
into this person's books, they would have seen it in 10 seconds. That's the,

525
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:12.050
I mean, that's the amazing thing about this. Um, you know, not,

526
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.170
not to get back to, you know, my, my drug dealing book,

527
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:18.770
but this is one of the things that he says, which is that, you know,

528
00:33:18.771 --> 00:33:21.140
you can be in a, you know,

529
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:25.510
in a poor black neighborhood and a couple of kids will be on a cell phone

530
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:29.210
talking about selling $10 worth of weed.

531
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:32.000
And there'll be picked up by cops w you know,

532
00:33:32.001 --> 00:33:36.230
within 20 minutes or something like that. Meanwhile, you know,

533
00:33:36.231 --> 00:33:38.090
somebody like, uh, you know,

534
00:33:38.091 --> 00:33:42.980
Bernie Madoff can commit a hundred million dollar frauds year after

535
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:47.270
year after year, and not even do any take any effort to try to,

536
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.320
to cover it up all that well, and get away with it. Well, Bernie's.

537
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.680
<v 1>Big crime was that he ripped off rich people. Yeah, absolutely.</v>

538
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.540
He had done the exact same thing to poor Pete. Well, what he did was just,

539
00:33:58.541 --> 00:34:02.770
it was just too easy to call what he did a crime versus what you were talking

540
00:34:02.771 --> 00:34:03.850
about with these financial issues.

541
00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.830
<v 2>Right? Yeah. Yeah. If he, if he had lawn, if he had laundered it through a,</v>

542
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.670
a slightly more legitimate process, he would have gotten out fine. But the,

543
00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:17.410
one of the things that a lot of these guys, these scam artists get into it,

544
00:34:17.411 --> 00:34:22.030
thinking that they're actually gonna be real hedge funds. Um,

545
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:22.871
and that they,

546
00:34:22.871 --> 00:34:26.260
they have some stock picking system that's actually gonna make all their clients

547
00:34:26.261 --> 00:34:30.340
money. And one of the things they find out is that a they suck, they, they,

548
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.850
they're not outperforming the market and they're not that smart,

549
00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:37.870
but B that their clients can't tell if they just make up the numbers.

550
00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.520
So there,

551
00:34:39.521 --> 00:34:44.470
there are a number of cases of people who start out trying to be legitimate and

552
00:34:44.471 --> 00:34:47.110
trying to be real, real investment advisors,

553
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.420
but they just end up turning into Bernie Madoff types because it's just easy.

554
00:34:52.421 --> 00:34:56.590
There's no, there, there, there aren't that many people watching for it. And,

555
00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:59.070
uh, you know, that that's kind of scary too well.

556
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.340
<v 1>It's like, there's so many people doing it.</v>

557
00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.220
How could there be enough people watching it? Right.

558
00:35:06.221 --> 00:35:09.070
Think about how many investment firms there are and how many different people

559
00:35:09.071 --> 00:35:13.600
that are involved in trading. How could anybody be watching all of it,

560
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.190
right? Yeah, no, they're.

561
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:18.370
<v 2>There, but even, even,</v>

562
00:35:18.371 --> 00:35:21.520
so even if you take that into consideration than the,

563
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:24.790
than the number of eyes that are, that are on this world is,

564
00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.960
is ridiculously low, like take, take AIG. All right.

565
00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:32.290
AIG was one of the world's largest, uh,

566
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.670
companies that AI before, before it crashed, it had like 180,000.

567
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.020
Um, it was,

568
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.610
it took advantage of this weird loophole that allows financial companies to

569
00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:49.440
essentially choose their own regulator. Um, so because,

570
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:53.370
because AIG had a thrift or a savings alone,

571
00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:57.570
that's basically the same thing they chose to be regulated by,

572
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.550
um, the OTs, which is the office of thrift supervision,

573
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:07.920
which is this tiny, tiny little, um, uh, you know,

574
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:12.270
office in Washington that oversees basically savings and loan operations.

575
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:16.950
And in, in the OTs, this is, this is actually true.

576
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:21.390
The, they had exactly one insurance expert on staff.

577
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:26.730
So essentially with the world's largest insurance company was being regulated

578
00:36:26.731 --> 00:36:31.590
by a government office that only had one person who really understood insurance

579
00:36:31.591 --> 00:36:32.580
and, and even,

580
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.610
and even that person wouldn't have understood the,

581
00:36:36.611 --> 00:36:38.610
the part of the company that blew up,

582
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:43.920
which was essentially an investment bank within the insurance company

583
00:36:43.921 --> 00:36:47.640
that was creating these sort of highly advanced sort of derivative operations,

584
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:52.920
um, that no, that they just would not have been able to understand that stuff.

585
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.753
So

586
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.250
the government just does not place a lot of resources

587
00:36:59.251 --> 00:37:01.020
into, you know,

588
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:04.290
keeping an eye on even the most basic things.

589
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:08.790
And when you compare that to law enforcement and other areas, you know,

590
00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:13.260
is how many, how many people do we have, you know, worrying about bank,

591
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:18.030
bank robberies in this country or, or drugs, right. Or, you know,

592
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:19.740
how many people are, are being watched,

593
00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:23.330
because there are marijuana dealers in other states. I mean, it,

594
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:26.850
it dwarfs the number of people who are watching for economic crimes.

595
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.190
<v 1>Yeah. One person. Yeah. I just loved the, the name of it.</v>

596
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.000
Office of thrift supervision. Yeah, exactly. I'm not.

597
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.590
<v 2>Even sure it exists anymore. I think it was, it was merged into some other,</v>

598
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:45.750
uh, cause there used to be the OCC, the officer of the control or the currency.

599
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.460
And I think they created a new regulator out of all of that after the crash.

600
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:55.290
But, um, but yeah, it, AIG shows its regulator and its regulator,

601
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:59.040
you know, was totally over-matched didn't couldn't understand.

602
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.090
And that's one of the reasons why the company blew up the company also blew up

603
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.920
because it was run by insurance people who didn't

604
00:38:07.921 --> 00:38:12.090
understand it was basically wall streets, bookie.

605
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:13.500
All these people were betting.

606
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.440
All these investment banks were betting on whether or not mortgages were going

607
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:17.280
to fail or not.

608
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.590
And AIG was selling the product that they could use, uh,

609
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.070
to make those bets essentially. Or they were taking on insurance on,

610
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:30.810
on packets of mortgages. So if they exploded, you would get a payout,

611
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:35.070
right. Uh, it was, it's like, it's like buying an insurance policy,

612
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.050
your neighbor's house. If it goes up in flames, you get paid on it.

613
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:38.943
You get paid.

614
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:44.140
AIG was selling a product that allowed banks essentially to buy insurance on,

615
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.890
on houses, on mortgages. And if the,

616
00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:49.360
if people foreclosed,

617
00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:54.370
if the mortgage has failed or pools of mortgages failed,

618
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.960
uh, if you, if you bought that kind of insurance, you got these huge payouts.

619
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:02.170
So people were betting against mortgages basically.

620
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.580
And AIG was taking all this book. And, but the,

621
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.120
the heads of the company were old school insurance executives and just didn't

622
00:39:10.121 --> 00:39:14.650
understand this sort of new fangled, um,

623
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.920
complicated form of insurance.

624
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.740
And so they would look at the numbers that they were being given,

625
00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:23.920
and even they didn't get it. They didn't, they didn't understand the, how,

626
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:28.780
how exposed they were. And so when all the bets started going the wrong way,

627
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:33.520
suddenly they're being asked to pay out billions of dollars. And they're like,

628
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:35.920
whoa, wait, where is this coming from? So,

629
00:39:35.921 --> 00:39:40.360
so even the companies were kind of clueless about the that was going on.

630
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.390
It turns out jeez. Yeah.
