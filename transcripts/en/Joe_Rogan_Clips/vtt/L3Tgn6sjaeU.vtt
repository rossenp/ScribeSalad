00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, this,</v>

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:07.360
this particular coronavirus issue that we're dealing with right now seems to be

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.520
a, a great illuminator of that very fact,

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.840
is that there's so much data and there's there's so there's so much that's open

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.280
to interpret. There's so many thing, cuz it's all happening in real time. Right?

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.190
And like, particularly right now in California, we're in stage two,

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.670
tomorrow or Friday, two days from now stage two retail store is opening up.

8
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:29.504
Things are changing.

9
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.910
Like when no one knows the correct process that needs to take place

10
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.310
to save the most amount of lives, but yet ensure that our, our,

11
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.780
our culture and that our, our economy survives.

12
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.020
It's a lot of speculation and guessing. But if you go to certain places,

13
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.140
they'll tell you, we know why, and we know this and we know, uh,

14
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.763
it's hard.

15
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.380
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, in general, I think that's like we,</v>

16
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:02.410
we should be concerned about, uh, anything.

17
00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:06.050
That's a massive infringement on our civil, civil liberties. Yes. You know,

18
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.610
so it's like, you gotta put a lot of weight on that. Um, people,

19
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.250
lot of people died to, you know,

20
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.530
when independence with the country and fight for the democracy that we have.

21
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.210
And uh, you know, we should treasure that and not,

22
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.360
not give up our liberties too easily. I think we've, we,

23
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.600
I think we probably did that actually.

24
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.760
<v 0>So, well,</v>

25
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.600
I like what you said when you said that it should be a choice and that

26
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.600
to require people to stay home,

27
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.400
require people to not go to work require and to,

28
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.270
to arrest people for trying to make a living. This all seems wrong. And I,

29
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.910
I think that it's a wrong approach. It's a, it's a, you're, you're,

30
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.110
it's an infantilization of the society that is gonna

31
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:54.470
tell you what to do. Fundamentally.

32
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.270
<v 1>A violation of the constitution. Yeah. Freedom of assembly. And you know,</v>

33
00:01:58.271 --> 00:02:02.830
it's just, I mean, I don't think these things stand up in court.

34
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.860
<v 0>Really. They're arresting people for protesting. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

35
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.140
Because they're protesting and violating social distancing and these mandates

36
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:12.460
that tell people that they have to stay home. Yeah.

37
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.180
<v 1>These, these, these are, these would definitely not stand up. Uh, you know,</v>

38
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.820
if the Supreme court here, I mean, it's obviously complete violation of rights.

39
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:21.050
Yeah.

40
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.450
<v 0>Yeah. And again, this is not in any a, um,</v>

41
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.610
disrespecting the people who have died from this disease. No,

42
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:28.970
it's certainly a real thing to think of.

43
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.210
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, it, it, it, it, it just should be, if, if you're,</v>

44
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.810
if you're at risk, you should not be compelled to leave your house. Right. Um,

45
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.170
or leave a place of safety, but you should also not be, uh,

46
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:44.480
if you're not at risk or if you are at risk and you wish to take a with your

47
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:45.960
life, you should have the right.

48
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.760
<v 0>To do that. And it seems like at this point in time,</v>

49
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.160
particularly our resources would be best served,

50
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.520
protecting the people that are at risk versus penalizing.

51
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.280
The people that are not at high risk for living their life, the way they did,

52
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:04.360
particularly having a career and, and making a living and feeding your family,

53
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.360
paying your bills, keeping your store open, keeping your restaurant open. Yes.

54
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.880
<v 1>I mean, there's, there's a strong, a strong downside to this. Yeah. Um, so</v>

55
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.990
yeah, I just believe like, you know, if this, as a free country, you should be,

56
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.910
you know, allowed, allowed to do, you know, what you want,

57
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:25.310
as long as it does not endanger others.

58
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.910
<v 0>But that's the thing, right? People, this is the argument. They will bring up.</v>

59
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.990
Like you are endangering others. You should stay home for the people that,

60
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.070
that you, you, even if you're fine, even if you know, you're gonna be okay,

61
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.020
there's certain people that will not be okay because of your actions.

62
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.220
They might get exposed to this thing that we don't have a vaccine for.

63
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.060
We don't have, uh, universally accepted treatment for, and then we need to,

64
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.540
there's two arguments, right? One argument is we need to keep going,

65
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.980
protect the weak, protect the sick, but let's open up the economy.

66
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.130
The other argument is stop placing money over human lives. And,

67
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.540
uh,

68
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.130
let's shelter in place until we come up with some sort of a decision and let's

69
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.650
figure out some way to develop some sort of a universal income,

70
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.090
universal basic income plan or something like that to feed people during the,

71
00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:18.850
during this time where we make this transition. I think there's a.

72
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.920
<v 1>&lt;Affirmative&gt;. Yeah. Um, as I said, yeah, my,</v>

73
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:27.960
my opinion is if, if, if somebody wants to stay home, they stay home.

74
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.680
If somebody doesn't wanna stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home.

75
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.320
That's my opinion. Do you think if, if, if somebody doesn't like that, well,

76
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:39.960
that's my opinion. Um, so the now, yeah. Um,

77
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.230
the, the, this notion though that, uh, you, you know,

78
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:46.070
you can just sort of send checks out everybody and, and things will be fine,

79
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.110
is not true. Obviously. Um, the there's, some people have this absurd,

80
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.390
like, uh, view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty.

81
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.540
Like, it just makes stuff, stuff, you know, whatever,

82
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.900
just there's a magic water plantee and the goods and services,

83
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:08.220
they just come from this magic corner. Plantee and then if, um,

84
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.500
like if somebody has more stuff than somebody else's cuz they took more from

85
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:15.260
this magic plantee now let me, uh, just break it to you,

86
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.620
the fools out there, if you don't make stuff, there's no stuff.

87
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.790
Yeah. So if you don't make the food,

88
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.030
if you don't process the food, you don't transport the food and the, well,

89
00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:37.190
the, the, whether, you know, medical treatment, getting,

90
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:41.870
getting your teeth fixed or there's, there's no stuff

91
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.100
I become detached from reality. You,

92
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.500
you can't just legislate money and, and solve these things.

93
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.700
If you don't make stuff, there is no stuff.

94
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.560
Obviously we'll run out of the stores,

95
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.840
we'll run out of the, you know, the, it, the whole,

96
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.280
the machine just grinds to a halt. But.

97
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.240
<v 0>The, the initial thought on this virus, the,</v>

98
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:15.160
the real fear was that this was gonna kill hundreds of thousands.

99
00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:19.270
If not millions of people instantaneously in this country,

100
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.710
it was gonna do it very quickly. If we didn't hunker down,

101
00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:26.590
if we didn't shelter in place, if we didn't quarantine ourselves or lock down,

102
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.750
do you think that the initial thought was a good idea based on the perception

103
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.750
that this was going to be far more deadly than it turned out to be?

104
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.690
<v 1>Maybe I, I think briefly, briefly, briefly. Um,</v>

105
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.490
but, uh, I think if you know, any,

106
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.010
any kind of like sensible examination of what happened in China would lead a

107
00:06:50.011 --> 00:06:52.810
conclusion that that is obviously not gonna occur. Uh, this,

108
00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:54.570
this virus originated in Wuhan.

109
00:06:54.571 --> 00:06:59.480
There's like I don't a hundred thousand people a day leaving Wuhan. So it, it,

110
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.373
it, uh,

111
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.920
it went everywhere very fast throughout China throughout the rest of the

112
00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:07.600
world. Um, and

113
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.520
the fatality rate was, was.

114
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.080
<v 0>Low. Don't you think though, it's difficult to appreciate. It's difficult to,</v>

115
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.310
to filter what the information that's coming outta China to,

116
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.270
to accurately really get a real true representation of what happened.

117
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.390
The, the propaganda machine is very strong. Sure. What, what they,

118
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.190
the world health organization appears to have been complicit with a lot of their

119
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.073
propaganda.

120
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.820
<v 1>The thing is that American cup companies have massive, uh,</v>

121
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.580
supply chains in China, like hun Tesla, for example,

122
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.260
we have hundreds of suppliers like tier 1, 2, 3, 4 suppliers throughout,

123
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.260
throughout China. So we know if they are able to make stuff or not.

124
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.540
We know if they, if they have issues or not, then they they're. China is back,

125
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.900
back at full steam. Um, and, and te many

126
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.820
pretty much every us company has some significant number of supplies in China.

127
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.820
So, you know, you know, if they're able to, you know,

128
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:16.100
provide things or not, or if, if there's, you know,

129
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.410
high mortality rate, Tesla has thousand people in China. So

130
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.330
zero people died zero.

131
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.730
<v 0>Okay. So that, that's a real statistic that's coming from. Yeah. Yeah. You know,</v>

132
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:32.810
those people. Yeah.

133
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.570
<v 1>We literally, we run per.</v>

134
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.530
<v 0>Do you think there's a danger of this? Just like.</v>

135
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:37.913
<v 1>Like, uh.</v>

136
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.800
<v 0>Same folks are there. Yeah. You think there's a danger of politicizing this,</v>

137
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.240
where it becomes like opening up the country's, uh,

138
00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:48.600
Donald Trump's it's his goal, it's his, and then,

139
00:08:48.601 --> 00:08:51.400
then anything he does is sort of, uh,

140
00:08:51.401 --> 00:08:54.960
there's there's people that are gonna oppose it and come up with some reasons

141
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.680
why he's wrong, particularly in this climate.

142
00:08:56.681 --> 00:09:00.520
Whereas as we're leading up to November and, you know, the, the,

143
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.000
the 2020 elections, do you think that this is a, a real danger in terms of, uh,

144
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.840
public's perception that Trump wants to open it up?

145
00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:11.440
So they knee jerk oppose it because they oppose Trump.

146
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:18.080
<v 1>I, I think there has been some &lt;affirmative&gt; politic, this has been politicized,</v>

147
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.240
you know, um, both directions really. So it's, um,

148
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.440
which, which is, uh, not great. Um,

149
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.110
yeah, but like I said, separate apart from that,

150
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:36.830
I think there's the question of like, you know, where, where do civil,

151
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.220
civil liberties fit in this picture, you know? Yeah. And, uh, what, what,

152
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:44.620
what can the government make you do? What can they make you not do and what,

153
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.900
you know, what's what's okay. Right. Um, and, uh,

154
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.280
yeah, I think we went too far.

155
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.560
<v 0>Do you think it's one of those things where once we've gone in a certain</v>

156
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:02.630
direction, it's very difficult to make a correction, make a,

157
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.510
an adjustment to, to realize like, okay, we thought it was one thing it's not,

158
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.030
it's not good, but it's not what we thought it was going to be.

159
00:10:10.031 --> 00:10:11.950
It's not what we feared. So let's,

160
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.950
let's back up and reconsider and let's do this publicly and say,

161
00:10:15.951 --> 00:10:19.830
we were acting based on the information that we had initially,

162
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.500
that information appears to be faulty. And, uh,

163
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.500
here's how we move forward while protecting civil liberties while protecting

164
00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:32.140
what essentially this country was founded on, which is, uh,

165
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.140
a very agreed upon amount of freedom. Yeah. That we respect and appreciate.

166
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.420
<v 1>Absolutely. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>
