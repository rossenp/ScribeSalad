00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.800
<v 2>There's so much stuff that we kept from the story that, that if I told you,</v>

3
00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.280
you wouldn't believe me now, when it came to the movie, we,

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.480
we filmed it around the gun fight. Like what? So we filmed it, the,

5
00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:16.600
the movie around the gun fight, cuz that's when everyone was alive, I was like,

6
00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:19.520
you shouldn't have known that I was gonna be the guy that make it out when they

7
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:20.440
were picking the actors. I,

8
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.550
so if you get somebody like an A-list actor and then everybody they'll know t

9
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.910
hat, that he's the one that made it out. I was like,

10
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:27.510
when you're watching the movie, you shouldn't know that.

11
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.910
Of course Hollywood does kind of, kind of, kind of does their own thing.

12
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.043
<v 0>But</v>

13
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.440
the craziest part about that whole operation was getting me out of there.

14
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.310
And that wasn't in the movie and the movie, they did it, daylight,

15
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.550
daylight extract,

16
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:46.750
like they came in landed and a couple shots and they got outta there and real

17
00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:51.150
life. It wasn't like that. It was unbelievable. I mean,

18
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.070
it was a night and the, I mean the world was blowing up.

19
00:00:57.071 --> 00:01:00.310
We were in this like a volcano, like sitting in the middle of this volcano.

20
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.300
And I remember looking down the Mount there, there was a,

21
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.060
there was a river running down. I mean, it looked like miles down

22
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.940
and they had moved me. They had to carry me. I couldn't walk. And they,

23
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.180
they kinda like, and they, they, we would stumble over the green bras Rangers.

24
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:16.420
It was a hodgepodge. Let me tell you something.

25
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:20.740
When them guys showed up to rescue me, when they found me, I was laying in a,

26
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.370
in a river bed, dried up, tucked under a rock. They, the,

27
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.410
the villagers had shoved me underneath this rock.

28
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.090
And there was this one guy I had never met before.

29
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.170
And he was sitting there listening to a AMFM radio

30
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.250
and he was scrolling through the channels. We hand those out for morale,

31
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.130
like the, the us military handle those out. And he had one of 'em.

32
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:42.750
I recognized it.

33
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.680
And he was list to the different channels and I could recognize the different

34
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.440
languages, German, Japanese. And he was like, Hey, they're talking about you.

35
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.000
And I was like, okay, I didn't know who he was.

36
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.950
He was kind of messing with me a little bit, cuz I, I couldn't move. And he,

37
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:02.630
he had this sting anyway, it's not important. And then, um, then the,

38
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.620
the Google love and a couple of the, a, the villages came and, and picked me up.

39
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:08.420
They had to carry me everywhere. And they were, why, why did.

40
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.260
<v 1>They save you? Cuz in the movie it's confusing.</v>

41
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.220
It is cuz in the movie it's like these guys save you and you don't,

42
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.940
you don't know why they're saving you.

43
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.100
<v 0>When he found me, they have to fight the Taliban. Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.930
Can you believe that crazy. So I had been crawling for a day and some change.

45
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.970
I was like crawling through the mountains and I,

46
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.290
I had somehow some way got to the top of this Ridge line. I was so thirsty.

47
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.443
I mean, I,

48
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.123
but I had thought about this.

49
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.290
There's an insanity that goes with thirst. I was so in, I was so thirsty to,

50
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.080
I was willing to kill anything to get water. I was go, I mean,

51
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.800
you can't even believe it. I was drinking my own urine, my own blood,

52
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.760
nothing would Quin the thirst. God hadn't thought about this in a while.

53
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.040
And I got to the top of this Ridge line and there was a waterfall and I,

54
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.000
I was trying to slide down into it. I was like,

55
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.200
I'm just gonna go down in here and I'm gonna hit that water and it's gonna be

56
00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:07.240
something grit to drink. So I tried to slide down, I just took off.

57
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.800
I got UN uncontrollably and I started sliding.

58
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.080
I rotated upside down and I remember looking over and my rifle was sliding

59
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:18.160
beside me. I couldn't throw that thing away. It was like,

60
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.510
every time I I'd lose it, one of my boys was like, Hey, you're gonna need this.

61
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.950
And I flipped into upside down over backwards into the river. And then my,

62
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.470
I remember my knees hit me in the face and it knocked me out again.

63
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.790
And I was kinda, I mean, I was, I was blobbing mess, everything was broken.

64
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.510
And I, I rolled over and I remember kind of sitting on all fours.

65
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:40.020
I picked my head up and I looked up there was that water fountain there.

66
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:42.020
And I remember sliding down, this is the craziest thing,

67
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.940
God hadn't thought about this.

68
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.620
And I remember seeing this little pool of water and I was like, oh,

69
00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:49.860
that'd be a great place to get something to drink. &lt;laugh&gt; so I climbed,

70
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.260
I crawled back up into this thing and I leaned into that waterfall and I

71
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.660
remember washing my face and hands. My gloves were, um,

72
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.930
I had gloves on the mechanic gloves and all the fingers were ripped out and the

73
00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:03.530
palms were ripped out. So I just kinda, and uh,

74
00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:07.330
it was the best water I ever had. I'll never forget it.

75
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.370
It was cold. And uh,

76
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.690
I was hurting real bad and I remember hearing somebody screaming at me and I

77
00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:16.210
kind of turned around and over my shoulder,

78
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:18.090
there was a guy standing there looking at me, pointing at me.

79
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.650
He was like Taliban Taliban.

80
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.240
So I swung around with my rifle and then all of a sudden

81
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.920
behind me again, there was, I could hear someone screaming at me.

82
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:30.760
They're like he and they were.

83
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:33.760
And I look up and there was this guy standing on the hill that I just fallen off

84
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:37.440
of, but he didn't have a weapon. He was just pointing at me.

85
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.560
And then there was some guys on the Ridge line moving around. They had weapon.

86
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.510
I saw him. So I turned back around and I, I kind of started to crawl.

87
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.710
I was like, man, I was in a channelized area. It was kind of bad. And I,

88
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.950
I remember I was leaning against this rock. I was sitting on my, my butt.

89
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.550
I had my rifle, man. I was breathing. I couldn't breathe.

90
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.310
I'd bitten my tongue in half. And I, I was like, that was a crazy story.

91
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.780
But the guy screamed at me again. I turned around to shoot and he,

92
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.620
he saw me and he, he duck behind this rock. And then, I mean,

93
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:11.020
right over my left shoulder, probably 30 yards, not even that

94
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.220
I hear American American and I kind of turned around and it was, uh, Gulla.

95
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.460
One of the main villages who rescued me and I turned,

96
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.370
don't know I had my gun at my hip. My safety was off.

97
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.210
My tension was outta my trigger. And he was kind of looking, I mean,

98
00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:30.010
we were staring at each other straight in the eyes and I, I mean, I was like,

99
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.610
like death, you know how you can smell death when it's there. I was like, man,

100
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.530
okay, let's go. And uh,

101
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.010
I don't know why I didn't kill him.

102
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.520
I don't know why I didn't didn't have to even go to my shoulder to kill him.

103
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.041
I mean,

104
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:49.120
I had the tension outta my trigger and I was just sitting there looking at him.

105
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:50.880
He was looking at me and he was, he wouldn't say,

106
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.760
he said American a couple times. And then he said it again. I was like Taliban.

107
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.000
And he was like American.

108
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.800
And then he kind of put his hands up and I came off my trigger kind of want to

109
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:01.634
kill him.

110
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.810
And he started walking down on me. He's like, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Shampoo,

111
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.570
hydrate, shampoo, hydrate. That's what he is telling me. Shampoo, shampoo.

112
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.650
&lt;laugh&gt; that's what he said. Two English words. You knew. I was like shampoo,

113
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.480
hydrate. You know how good that sounded. I was like, bro,

114
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.040
I would love some water. And if you wanna wash my hair, &lt;laugh&gt;, it's so funny.

115
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:24.920
So if you ever get into a bad situation and you're about to lose your mind,

116
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:27.640
just say shampoo and hydrate and you'll be fine, dude. And I'm like,

117
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.840
can you believe that? That's what he said to me. That's crazy.

118
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.920
And I dropped my muzzle down and he walked up on me and I pulled a grenade out.

119
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.990
&lt;affirmative&gt; I pulled the pin. Don't ever do that. And I, I was gonna like,

120
00:06:40.991 --> 00:06:42.750
if you try something, I'll just kill us all. I don't care.

121
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.430
But then he kind of rolled me over and he's like, it's okay. I got you.

122
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.670
You know, I could just tell, you know how, when you can tell like, Hey man,

123
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:50.870
I got you. I fricking got you.

124
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.350
You can feel that like you can feel if someone's like, Hey man, I, I, I got you.

125
00:06:55.351 --> 00:06:57.750
And then I'm gonna Jack you up later. And this guy was like, man, I got you man.

126
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.180
And, and I reppin that grenade. I'll never forget. I was like,

127
00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:04.860
I heard you're not supposed to &lt;laugh&gt;. I mean, there was so much crazy stuff.

128
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.580
Anyways, all these kids came running out from everywhere and they picked me up.

129
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.580
I couldn't walk. And they carried me down, started carrying me down the,

130
00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:14.580
the Ridge line into the, into the valley. And there was a village down there.

131
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.620
And then the kids and everybody, they were laughing and,

132
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.890
and whatnot and pulled me into this room and they started kind of doctoring.

133
00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:23.050
They doctored me up, stopped my bleeding, patched me up,

134
00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:24.090
gave me all the water I could drink.

135
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.130
And then the Taliban came in after that and then snatched me up.

136
00:07:27.131 --> 00:07:29.890
But so how much of what, what was in the script?

137
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.130
I know you didn't see the movie,

138
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.050
but how much of what was in the script was accurate?

139
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.600
Every bit of it, everybody died like in the movie.

140
00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:42.480
When you see those guys falling down a mountain looks cool.

141
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.840
Imagine going past cool. To when it looks like chaos,

142
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.120
imagine playing your favorite sport on the side of a mountain.

143
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.560
When people shooting at you, it didn't look cool. I was like,

144
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.200
it looked horrific, sexy. I mean, I, I, it was terrible. I mean like,

145
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.760
cuz getting ripped apart and like we would come in and the guys would just be

146
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.350
like, man was shot in the face and it was kind of,

147
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.950
his eyes were gone and I, I like, I'm a medic.

148
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.980
Some of 'em were bad. Some of 'em was bad, but then,

149
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.930
you know, I was like, I, I don't didn't know what to do. I just started,

150
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.650
I never knew what to do. Isn't that crazy? I was like, man, it's well trained.

151
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.090
I was like, got my in a pickle. I couldn't get out. I didn't know what to do.

152
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.490
And I would just sit there and there'd be times when I, when I would talk,

153
00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:34.490
think about my brother and all my buddies. I was like, Hey man,

154
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:36.690
you guys don't stupid. I'm still here. Come get me.

155
00:08:36.691 --> 00:08:38.970
And then I could see aircraft flying overhead. And I was like,

156
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.880
right I'm right here. And they would just keep lying.

157
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.240
And then someone was trying to kill me.

158
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.760
Like a wall would blow up or a bullet would sit through the wall and then they'd

159
00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:51.640
have to move me, man. It was a hell of a week. It was rough.

160
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.680
They left me in this hole for a while. They buried me. And uh,

161
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.130
I was like, man, I'm a foreign man, a foreign land. Everybody's dead.

162
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.450
And I mean who, who, who, who knows where I'm at? I was in hell.

163
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.650
I was literally in hell. And if it wasn't for them, I mean, and that,

164
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.530
and the way that whole thing worked out, I, I,

165
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.850
it's funny when I talk about it, it's hard to wrap your head around it, right?

166
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.770
Like man, why, why am I even sitting here? Cuz y'all came and got me.

167
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.890
I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. When y'all showed up.

168
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.730
I signed up to be an expendable asset to die if necessary.

169
00:09:31.731 --> 00:09:34.890
That was the sexiest thing I ever heard of. I was nobody. I, you know,

170
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.483
I have a specialist,

171
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.040
I was expendable asset and you worked till you become dependable and they'll

172
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.920
kind of keep you around. So when y'all showed up, I couldn't believe it.

173
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.280
I couldn't believe it. I remember talking to 'em. I was like, man,

174
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.800
I can't believe y'all made it out here. We were out in the middle of nowhere.

175
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.760
And then, and then, um,

176
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.710
the first time I ever got like scared was when they,

177
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.190
when they were with me and trying to get me outta there, I was like, Hey man,

178
00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:03.830
I hope y'all can get me outta here. &lt;laugh&gt; is that selfish? I was like, man,

179
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.470
that's that selfish? Is it &lt;laugh&gt;? I was like, I sure would like to live man.

180
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.390
And they threw, I mean, it was a CRA to get me outta. There was the,

181
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.790
it's a whole different movie altogether. Those green BES,

182
00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:17.580
those Rangers and P PJs that were on that plane that

183
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.140
on the heel of the pilots, like Spanky, he was one of the pilots, skinny.

184
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.980
When they came in, they came in to crash. You don't ever talk about that.

185
00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:28.180
Like he had to crash that bird on the side of a mountain to get to get in there

186
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.660
and he did it. He didn't give a.

187
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.980
He's like watch this boom and just brought it in. I mean,

188
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.180
there was a gun fight going on from the top. And the bottom,

189
00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.970
every aircraft we had in country was wagging like spinning overhead

190
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.450
the specs. That's a hand of God, you know, or the finger of God. I mean the,

191
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.250
the, the weapon rehab man, they can look down on you and just erase you.

192
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.490
And they got me outta there. I couldn't believe it.

193
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.330
I hadn't thought about that in a while.
