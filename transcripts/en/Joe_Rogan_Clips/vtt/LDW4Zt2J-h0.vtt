00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.220
<v 1>Experience. Yeah. So people don't know the sport.</v>

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.480
Botter Hari is one of the biggest names in the sport, like forever.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.040
He's he's a guy who he's stopped Alistair Overeem

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.590
he, you know, he's fought in [inaudible].

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.380
<v 0>Who, I mean.</v>

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.450
<v 1>He he's a wild man, you know,</v>

8
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.860
but he hasn't fought in high-level competition for a long time.

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.930
And then he fought you. Yeah. Yeah.

10
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.460
<v 0>Yeah. So the thing was, everybody was, uh,</v>

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.280
I was beating everybody. I was champion and I was beating everybody.

12
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.320
People said, yeah, he goes good. He's the champion. But he hasn't fought Baader.

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.310
I was like, Hey, if he went on national television and said, Hey,

14
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:45.990
if he wants to fight, let's.

15
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.330
<v 1>Go. But he had been dealing with a bunch of legal trouble.</v>

16
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.860
<v 0>Had a lot of problems.</v>

17
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.590
<v 1>Yeah. He broke someone's leg in a club. Yeah. A.</v>

18
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.423
<v 0>Lot, a lot of.</v>

19
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.960
<v 1>It's crazy. There's a video of him slapping some guy's face at a, in a hotel.</v>

20
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.330
Yeah. Imagine that guy's slapping your face,

21
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:03.630
your support worker behind the counter Bonner comes in and like.

22
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.023
<v 0>Do everyone.</v>

23
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.800
<v 1>Here take their keys here?</v>

24
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.000
<v 0>Yeah. So, so yeah, he had a bunch of problems, but then the,</v>

25
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.790
eventually the fight happened because that's the fight that people wanted to

26
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:21.510
see. But for me it was just like another fight.

27
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.860
And then the fight at the end, the fight ended that way. Uh, yeah,

28
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:29.160
that was too bad. So, but now we can do it again. Yeah.

29
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.950
<v 1>So the fight was quite a while ago. How long.</v>

30
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.810
<v 0>Ago was that? 2016.</v>

31
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.750
<v 1>Yeah. That's why did it take so long for the rematch?</v>

32
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.770
<v 0>Yeah. There was a bunch of stuff going on in between.</v>

33
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:43.260
And like last year he fought as the,

34
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.640
Girgis also a good Kickbox I believe he's now doing MMA in Beltour

35
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.900
and he's fought before, right? Yeah. He fought as we before,

36
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:53.010
but it got disqualified.

37
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.870
<v 1>So that's right. He stomped them.</v>

38
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.250
<v 0>On the ground. Yeah. So, so, and, but after death he's so crazy.</v>

39
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.040
So wild dude. Yeah. And then after that fight, they both got,

40
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.250
uh, got, uh, caught with using.

41
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.920
<v 1>Whatever. Oh, steroids. Yeah. Oh.</v>

42
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.440
<v 0>So, so they,</v>

43
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.730
they both got suspended and I believe has as he wasn't suspended,

44
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:22.200
I don't know. But he got suspended til December this year. So that's why.

45
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.830
<v 1>How did the fight go? The last, when you fought last year with the head Z.</v>

46
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.420
<v 0>He won one. It wasn't easy, but he won. Was it.</v>

47
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.130
<v 1>Lost? I mean a decision or was it a decision? Yeah. Yeah. So for him,</v>

48
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:39.150
that was the first fight since your fight with him in 2016. Is that it?

49
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.960
Yeah. Cause he's been because he's had a.

50
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.880
<v 0>Bunch of on and off. Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.050
<v 1>But, uh, and then now he's not training at Mike's gym anymore. Well, right.</v>

52
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.640
Do you know who he's training with?

53
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.970
<v 0>Um, yeah. I don't remember his name, but I know, I know the guy,</v>

54
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.460
but not always training.

55
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.840
<v 1>With, well, he looks good on Instagram.</v>

56
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.680
<v 0>For sure. But it's very.</v>

57
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.920
<v 1>Fat. A lot of people, a lot of people look good on Instagram,</v>

58
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:06.850
you know that or you see them in real life. Totally different. Well,

59
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:09.700
I'm sure he looks the same, but it's uh, it's, uh,

60
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.590
what's interesting is when you're in high level competition, like he was,

61
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:18.730
of course in the days when he fought Alster before Alster made the transition

62
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.220
full time to MMA, um, when he,

63
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:23.140
before he came to Strikeforce and all that's tough,

64
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.990
that's that's a long time ago. Yeah. You know,

65
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.860
it's probably hard to get back in. I mean,

66
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:34.000
and to jump straight into top level competition, like headsy,

67
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:38.860
or especially like fighting you as a champion, that's a big leap, right? Yeah.

68
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.110
<v 0>So, but that's the thing now we both have it. So he fought last year,</v>

69
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.650
March and I fought last year, September.

70
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.870
So because I'm was in negotiated and still am in negotiations with glory

71
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.830
for a new contract. So it's a, it's both been a while for us,

72
00:03:56.831 --> 00:04:00.130
but I've been before that. I was like in Montreal.

73
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.380
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Crazy flow. Yeah. You definitely have much more momentum. And just,</v>

74
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.590
there's a thing about fighting too. When guys take a long time off,

75
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:13.540
it's almost like they, they lose the feel for it. Yeah. They lose.

76
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.020
Do you know how, obviously they know how to kick. They know how to punch.

77
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:18.970
They know what to do. They're in shape. Yeah.

78
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.020
But there's a field that they have for the ring for.

79
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.440
<v 0>Exactly. Exactly. This is where people don't. And I said like, Hey,</v>

80
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:28.630
you step in the ring. And that's what, that's what you do.

81
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.060
That's what you were born to do. That's true.

82
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.270
But you need that attention.

83
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:38.950
You need that five of walking towards the ring, stepping into the ring,

84
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:41.560
all those people looking at you at that moment,

85
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:46.180
that's a certain type of feeling that you get and you gotta be comfortable with

86
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:49.330
it. Yeah. And that that's exactly what it is. You got to feel comfortable.

87
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:53.830
And the only way you can be comfortable and stay comfortable is being active.

88
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.190
<v 1>Yeah. So being active is very, it's just so critical for a fighter. When,</v>

89
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.280
when a guy takes a year off or two years off or three, I mean,

90
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:04.810
it's like the more, the time is the more it becomes problematic.

91
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.910
<v 0>And the older you get this class.</v>

92
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.460
<v 1>How old's bought are now 35, I think.</v>

93
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.340
<v 0>Mm. So yeah. Does.</v>

94
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.750
<v 1>Glory drug test?</v>

95
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.050
<v 0>Yeah, they do. That's how they got caught. Was.</v>

96
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.840
<v 1>It him or was it an athletic commission? I mean, was it Gloria? Was.</v>

97
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.900
<v 0>It a no, it's not glory. It's an induction local.</v>

98
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.250
<v 1>Look at Dutch athletic club.</v>

99
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.500
And so they're going to drug test for this fight as well. Yeah.

100
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.400
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. For sure. So I got tested like every, every time.</v>

101
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.410
<v 1>Is it like water testing at the same standards world anti-doping.</v>

102
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.790
<v 0>Agency. Yeah.</v>

103
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.970
<v 1>So they like wake you up like seven o'clock in the morning. Hey Rico.</v>

104
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.020
<v 0>Oh no, no, no, no. That's not the testing. Would they just test at the events?</v>

105
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.850
Oh, I, I would even rather have that wake up and random come test,

106
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:52.900
but that's not what they do, but they test like really strict when you're,

107
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:53.734
when you're there.

108
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.130
<v 1>Yeah. That's, that's a little bit easier to pass though. That's true. No,</v>

109
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:59.570
that's a lot easier to pass. I should say.

110
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.800
<v 0>I have no clue. I don't know what to do or what ways there are two,</v>

111
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:06.920
because I'm not on it. I don't want to stay busy.

112
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:09.680
I don't want to think about it, but whatever, you know,

113
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:12.650
I just jump in there and just do what I gotta do.

114
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.210
But that's why I told glory now again,

115
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:18.830
after this whole issue,

116
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:23.300
because a lot of people were caught like last year and they didn't expect that.

117
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.190
I was like, Hey, we got to keep doing this because this is the way we

118
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.110
make the sport clean. And I think that's what we deserve because we,

119
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.950
yeah, we are, we are a good sport. We are all athletes,

120
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.910
but I want to be safe in the ring. And what do you mean we're safe?

121
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.740
You're going into a fight understand,

122
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:45.980
but somebody that uses whatever,

123
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.090
can maybe just punch a little bit harder in the beginning of the fight or

124
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:50.480
whatever.

125
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.910
<v 1>I have a little more endurance hit you with some punch.</v>

126
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.740
They wouldn't be able to hit you with the non some.

127
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.670
<v 0>Exactly. So that's what I mean, uh, with Darren glory,</v>

128
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:01.010
I want to be safe when I'm in the ring. Well, for sure.

129
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.720
<v 1>Or, I mean, if, if one person's on it and one person's not that's, you know,</v>

130
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.560
it's a, it's a giant advantage. Anybody says it's not,

131
00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:11.490
it's just lying to themselves. Yeah, yeah.

132
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.890
<v 0>Yeah. So, but I'm in the end, you know, I just go in there and don't,</v>

133
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.180
I'm not even thinking about it.

134
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.940
<v 1>Well, it is the fight to make in kickboxing too.</v>

135
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:23.690
And if there's a fight that I could tell people, Hey, you got to watch you.

136
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:26.480
You really want to know what kickboxing all about. Watch this fight.

137
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.480
That is the fight because Bob are such a wild man,

138
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:30.740
and he's such a knockout artist.

139
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:34.100
And you obviously one of the most successful heavyweights ever, you know,

140
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.800
I mean your, uh, your kickboxing record in glory.

141
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:38.660
I mean just the highlight reels. Amazing.

142
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.370
You've got so many great fights over there too. Yeah.

143
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.640
<v 0>I've been doing so good. I'm really enjoying myself. And that's what I said.</v>

144
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:47.060
I want to bring kickboxing to a new level. Like then,

145
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.430
especially when you go now in Holland,

146
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.960
like normally in Harland was like soccer or

147
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.020
cycling or ice skating.

148
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.890
That's where parents were bringing their kids through and do that to keep out

149
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.400
kickboxing. And now they're like, Hey, Kickbox this is cool.

150
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.390
When did that change? I think like two, three years.

151
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.350
<v 1>Ago, w what made.</v>

152
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.300
<v 0>A change? I think, uh, because of the border fight that was,</v>

153
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.500
so we were getting,

154
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.270
we were getting more airtime and after the barter fight and everything that

155
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:22.940
happened around him and it was surrounding him,

156
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.230
like the things you said would happen outside in the club and this and that.

157
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.100
He was like the national right now.

158
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.220
And I was like the national good guy because everybody, so,

159
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:39.110
and that was like the perfect clash. And then of course, yeah, I beat him.

160
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:44.030
So everybody was like, oh, he's our hero. Right. So that,

161
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.570
that's, that's how everything, a little bit exploded. But.

162
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.720
<v 1>But again for you, that's unsatisfying the way it happened, though,</v>

163
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:52.370
that he gets his arm injured. Yeah.

164
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.330
<v 0>Yeah. In whatever way, reason, whatever he thinks happened.</v>

165
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:01.440
But like you, cause you're suspicious about I'm suspicious about it. So,

166
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.740
because he's looking at one arm then looking at the other arm and it just,

167
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.140
it's a fake thing for me, but it's like,

168
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.550
but that's what I have with this whole thing that he tries to create.

169
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.500
It's like, when he's getting announced and everything, he's like, yeah,

170
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:17.911
butter, oh, sorry,

171
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:22.200
110 something fights and 90 knockouts,

172
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.420
but I'm obsessed with what I'm doing. Um, uh, when I,

173
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.240
when I fight and when I have an opponent and I'm fighting,

174
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.460
I'm looking for everything.

175
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:37.200
I want to know everything about you and everything.

176
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.480
These days you can find on the internet.

177
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.180
So when I'm looking on the internet and for example,

178
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.990
you look at Wikipedia and looking all, all the fights from back in the days,

179
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:50.430
K one days. And even before that, you maybe get to 60, 70 fights.

180
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.050
So where are the other fights? Does that mean?

181
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:58.920
Like when you were younger in the youth period,

182
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.880
you did like 40 something fights that you knock everybody out.

183
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.050
I don't know. My train has been there for years, even before that.

184
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.550
And he doesn't know about it.

185
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.570
So that's strange because everything is documented on,

186
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.530
on the end and everything you can find on the internet. So.

187
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.180
<v 1>So you think his records inflated?</v>

188
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.220
<v 0>I think so. He's got.</v>

189
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.150
<v 1>Some crazy knockouts.</v>

190
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.990
<v 0>Though. He got.</v>

191
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.160
<v 1>The Stefan Leko [inaudible].</v>

192
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.270
<v 0>But that's what I said. He got, he he's got that.</v>

193
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.370
He's got amazing records, but yeah,

194
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.420
I think it's not as crazy as they make it to be.

195
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.220
<v 1>Which is crazy because the reality is pretty crazy. I mean,</v>

196
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.040
you don't need to hype it up any more than it really is, right?

197
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.600
<v 0>No, but it's been there for years.</v>

198
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:48.540
Like 100 something fights are so many knockouts,

199
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.990
but when I look at it is I can't find it,

200
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.270
but maybe it's there. Maybe it's there. Maybe it's from years ago, whatever.

201
00:10:57.271 --> 00:11:00.270
I don't know. But that's all that I'm looking at. You're suspicious.

202
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.030
I'm suspicious about it because when I look at Wikipedia and I'm looking at,

203
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.073
when he was around,

204
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.910
it starts from when he was around 16 till now it's like 60, 70 fights.

205
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.700
<v 1>Funny. When you look at them in the early days too, he was so skinny. Yeah.</v>

206
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:17.070
Like even when he fought stuff on Lego. Yeah. And then now he's jacked. Yeah.

207
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.350
But he puts so much time into strength, strength and conditioning workouts.

208
00:11:21.351 --> 00:11:24.720
So you could see like, he's always doing some crazy strength routine. Yeah.
