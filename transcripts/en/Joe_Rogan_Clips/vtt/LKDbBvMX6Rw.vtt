00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.600
So you are working there and while you're working there,

3
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:10.640
you're under this crazy schedule. Forgive me for explaining your story,

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.600
but you, uh, would get these phone calls. You would have to go to the,

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.230
to the airport at 11:00 PM and your wife of thinking that

6
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:22.150
you were having an affair.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.310
<v 1>Yeah, apparently. So, um, now I did give my permission to have,</v>

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.310
you know, as, as part of the, you know, security clearance process, um,

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.030
I,

10
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.830
I gave written permission to have the phones monitored and things of that sort.

11
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.780
So they weren't doing any covert stuff. They, um, you know,

12
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:46.660
with any Q clearance or which is civilian top secret clearance or military

13
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:50.140
top secret clearance, they go talk to friends and, you know,

14
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.660
place places you've been, make sure you're not connected to foreign countries,

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.260
but, you know, monitoring your phone is nothing unusual. However,

16
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.460
they insisted that, you know, you'd,

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.770
don't even talk to your loved one to your partner, to your wife,

18
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.730
whatever about what's going on.

19
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.570
So she was essentially in the dark and didn't know the phone was being

20
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.090
monitored. Well,

21
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.930
part of the security clearance is that not only do you not have any

22
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:20.290
connections to foreign countries and aren't a maniac,

23
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.680
but you have to have a stable home life too. Uh, well,

24
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:26.400
she started having an affair with a flight instructor.

25
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.000
Now they were monitoring this on the phone and they knew it and I didn't.

26
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.280
So they stopped me coming in and their attitude at the time was,

27
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.393
um,

28
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.040
we need to see how this is gonna play out and if Laars gonna get a little weird

29
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.270
or anything thing, so let's just, you know,

30
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.310
hold him off from coming in and, uh, you know, see what happens. And.

31
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.110
<v 0>They explained this to you. What was happening.</v>

32
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.070
<v 1>Well after the fact? Yeah,</v>

33
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.950
cuz time kind of went on and there were guys that were following me

34
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:02.070
around and I started getting a little concerned going, well,

35
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.220
are they booting me out of the project? And if so,

36
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.500
they're not just gonna let me hang out at home and go get a new job,

37
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.380
knowing what I know. So as time went on,

38
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.300
I started getting a little concerned and I took my closest friends and just kind

39
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:21.540
of got together. And I said, Hey,

40
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.850
remember that job I told you about this is what's going on. And uh,

41
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.730
like, you don't need to take my word for it Wednesday night.

42
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.570
We need to all go out here. I wanna show you what's going on.

43
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.130
So I took everybody and we went out to, um,

44
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.130
remember since I had the test flight schedule and went outside the base, um,

45
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.720
out desert. And so everybody could see, you know,

46
00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:49.720
one of the high performance tests and uh, you know,

47
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:53.800
it left quite an imprint on everybody. So they knew I wasn't and there's videos.

48
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.800
<v 0>Of these tests. Right?</v>

49
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.360
<v 1>Yeah. But remember this is in the, it's in, in the dark,</v>

50
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.840
in the eighties with a big monster size cam quarter.

51
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.600
And you got mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, a bright light jumping around.

52
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.560
But uh, yeah. I mean, we did video of it, but there's no by today's standards.

53
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.400
It's but is.

54
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.120
<v 0>Your video specifically available the video that you took?</v>

55
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.520
<v 1>Yeah. Well, George nap has it it's is it, do you know? I have no idea, Jeremy.</v>

56
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.000
Yeah.

57
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.910
<v 2>I show clips of it in my film it's it's online and someone did a deep analysis</v>

58
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.910
of it. Uh, it was interesting, uh, to take a look at how pull this microphone.

59
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.550
<v 0>Up your face. Tell me about a fist from your face.</v>

60
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.350
<v 2>Right. Um, you know, to see how his video looks now,</v>

61
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.830
but as far as video evidence, I mean, we're, we are talking eighties,

62
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.270
camp points. The most important thing is the human story here,

63
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.900
everybody that he took a up there on three separate occasions.

64
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.580
They don't all like each other. They don't all talk.

65
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.300
They all agree on one thing.

66
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.780
They saw something that night at the exact point in time and space that Bob boar

67
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:53.540
said, and remember, this is 17, 15, 17 miles south of air 51,

68
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.100
no one even knew really about air 51. We're talking PAOO lake.

69
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.930
And they all agree. They saw something that night they had never seen before.

70
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.610
And they've never seen since right when he said it.

71
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.730
So that's one of like the six things where I'm like,

72
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.330
how did he know you can dismiss him? I, I tried to dismiss it,

73
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.050
but some things we can't get around and, and there's about five or six of them.

74
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.770
How.

75
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.130
<v 0>Did he know about those? If Jamie wants to find that video right now,</v>

76
00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:16.964
what would he look under?

77
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.800
<v 2>Bobar UFO S four area 51,</v>

78
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:27.480
just kind of like that. Uh, so it's like the S for UFO video, Bob Lazar,

79
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:32.320
and a guy does an analysis, but you're analyzing these eighties videos,

80
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.160
right? He, he, from the very beginning, Bob never said,

81
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.920
I have proof of my story and I'm gonna tell the world.

82
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.310
He said at the very beginning, I cannot prove my story.

83
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.230
That's not why I'm telling this.

84
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.630
George nap convinced him to tell people and he lived through it. And I,

85
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.110
I didn't believe it either until I, I talked with George.

86
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.750
<v 0>Okay. So you, you film these,</v>

87
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.470
this test flight one test flight, and then you get caught.

88
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.060
<v 1>Actually it was, I think the third time, because it,</v>

89
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.460
we went out there the first time everybody saw it,

90
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:11.020
everybody was amaz cuz it did some radical maneuvers. And um, you know,

91
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:12.260
everybody had a lot to say.

92
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.020
<v 0>About it, maneuvers that I've seen, I've seen the video. It doesn't,</v>

93
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.340
I don't think there's something we have now that does that. No,

94
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.410
in terms of like a human piloted craft, I don't know,

95
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.770
obviously with the government, no.

96
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.210
<v 1>It's, it's impossible. Nothing can move like that.</v>

97
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.730
And remember we didn't start filming from the very beginning, you know, the,

98
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.930
we were waiting for something, you know, to happen.

99
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.290
The craft took off and then came flying at us, stopped, you know,

100
00:05:36.291 --> 00:05:39.650
turned it or Ang flew back. And then, you know, after it did some, you know,

101
00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:43.400
amazing stuff to get the camera and then we started filming.

102
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.800
So it doesn't have all of it on there. It just has some the.

103
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.440
<v 0>Way I describe it to my friends and they said, what does it look like I said,</v>

104
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.240
take a laser pointer and then have a wall and then move it around the wall.

105
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.160
Like, you know how it moves around the wall.

106
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.000
It doesn't seem like it has anything to do with inertia or physics or it's not

107
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.360
impeded in any way by the atmosphere.

108
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.480
<v 1>Yeah. That's what it looked like. You're essentially separated from reality,</v>

109
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.760
as crazy as that sounds with being in,

110
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.720
in case it's own gravitational envelope, inertia is not gonna affect it.

111
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.960
And you know, this is, uh,

112
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.110
this is how some of those recent sightings with commander David FRA,

113
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.310
I'm sure you've heard of the TTAC U UFO. I mean,

114
00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:28.030
he describes exactly that the thing operates exactly the way I was describing.

115
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.590
That's why, uh, he was interested to talk to me. Um,

116
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.950
but we saw this and you know, on the way home, it's like, what,

117
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.340
Hey, we got away with it. We should try it again. The next test flight date.

118
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.540
So this became a thing to do. And I think it was on the,

119
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.820
the third time that we got caught. I mean,

120
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.460
we started becoming a little careless.

121
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.500
I think we took a motor home out there &lt;laugh&gt; and you know, I mean,

122
00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:57.020
it was like the stupidest thing you could possibly imagine started tailgating.

123
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.250
Yeah. It was ridiculous. And um, again, you're in your twenties. Yeah.

124
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.690
And you know, what was funny was, um,

125
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.210
we went out there and my friend, gene Huff,

126
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.290
and I were leaning on the front of a vehicle.

127
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.010
And just for some reason we just started talking

128
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.920
like, uh, well, I hope the, they realized that, uh,

129
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.400
I don't remember what we were saying,

130
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.280
but you know that something about attacking the base or something along

131
00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:31.440
those lines and stealing the, the craft or something like that crazy.

132
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.720
And um, then about 20 feet in front of us,

133
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.030
we see a little green light fall on the ground and roll to us

134
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.990
and unbeknownst to us now it's pitch black.

135
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:43.510
You can't see your hand in front of your face.

136
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:47.190
There were a bunch of guards standing right out there and they had a night

137
00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:50.790
vision scope where they were like from here to the wall, looking at us,

138
00:07:50.791 --> 00:07:54.030
listening to us and the guy dropped it and the scope rolled over to us and you

139
00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:56.390
could see the green screen &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

140
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:01.020
we turned the lights on and all these guys are there. So it was uh, whoa.

141
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.220
Yeah. Yeah. So we did incredibly stupid stuff and got caught as we should have,

142
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.420
cuz it was stupid. So when they catch.

143
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.260
<v 0>You and they bring you in.</v>

144
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.700
<v 1>Then what happens? Well, I went in for debriefing the following day,</v>

145
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.980
I went to Indian Springs air force base,

146
00:08:13.981 --> 00:08:18.700
which is kind of a defunct base that they used to use at the nuclear

147
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:23.250
test site. And this is when they brought out, um,

148
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.530
the transcript of the phone call with my wife and

149
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.090
you know, they sat me down and we said, you know,

150
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:35.170
when we meant to keep the secret, we meant you can't tell your friends. Right.

151
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.210
You know? And it just being sarcastic and trying to mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

152
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:44.440
and then out real serious. Uh, but this is where they, you know,

153
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.280
took the transcript out and were reading me what, uh,

154
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.480
my wife and, you know, our friend were talking about.

155
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.680
And uh, I don't know. It was a hard.

156
00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.520
<v 0>Time. So what happens from there? What do they do with you?</v>

157
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.560
Why don't they arrest you? Don't.

158
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.160
<v 1>They arrest? I don't friends don't I don't know why. I'm not sure they exactly,</v>

159
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.400
they knew what to do,

160
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.400
but they did let me go that night and I went home and

161
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.150
th this is kind of when the most stress full part started. Cause.

162
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.110
<v 0>You're realizing that you're being monitored. Yeah. Before.</v>

163
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.830
<v 1>Seven now. Yeah. Now I know, not only am I being monitored,</v>

164
00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:25.470
but now I know I'm in trouble and uh, it wasn't a short time after that,

165
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:27.910
that I contacted, you know, at that time,

166
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.590
the only investigative reporter I had heard of in Las Vegas was George kn

167
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.350
and um, you know,

168
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.180
told him some of the story cuz I had no idea what the hell was gonna happen at

169
00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:38.880
that point.

170
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.500
<v 0>So George NA tries to dissect your story,</v>

171
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:46.100
tries to find holes in. It tells it,

172
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.500
puts it online and makes everybody aware of it. And that's how I found out.

173
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.460
<v 1>About it. Yeah. To make a long story short &lt;laugh&gt; what.</v>

174
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.610
<v 0>What happens? Yeah. To really make a long story short. What, from there on,</v>

175
00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.010
I mean, do they contact you and say, Hey Bob, it's probably a good idea.

176
00:10:00.011 --> 00:10:00.844
If you shut up.

177
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.583
<v 1>Oh.</v>

178
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.250
<v 0>They try to label you as crazy. Was there.</v>

179
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.890
<v 1>There boy, there were a lot of things that happened at, you know,</v>

180
00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:17.800
between that point. Um, I'm leaving out a lot of stuff, uh,

181
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.800
to fill in the story. Uh, we'd have to go back to Los Alamos and, and

182
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.000
well, I really don't want to talk about that. The, um.

183
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.640
<v 0>Top secret weapons stuff that you were working on.</v>

184
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.920
<v 1>No, I'm talking about the one 15 mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,</v>

185
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.710
well, I don't know. I have to think about how I'd.

186
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.230
<v 0>What is the problem &lt;laugh&gt; with the, I.</v>

187
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.063
<v 1>Don't, I don't wanna,</v>

188
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.310
I don't wanna get myself into more trouble by admitting something. So, um,

189
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.590
I just have to dance around a couple. He was.

190
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.590
<v 0>Rated just during the filming of the movie.</v>

191
00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:56.630

192
00:10:56.631 --> 00:10:59.380
