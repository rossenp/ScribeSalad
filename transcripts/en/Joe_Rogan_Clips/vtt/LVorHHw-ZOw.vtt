00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.280
<v 3>Do we live in a weird time, man?</v>

3
00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:07.800
Are you paying attention to all this stock market with game stop? So I heard,

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.640
I heard a little bit about it. What, what, what we covered.

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.840
We covered it a little bit yesterday. My friend ser and jetty from, uh,

6
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.640
the rising the hill, he, he covered it and we played some of his.

7
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.390
What basically is going on is these people are, uh,

8
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:25.550
speculators on wall street, you know, they're, they, they short stocks,

9
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.510
meaning they are gambling that a stock is gonna lose value.

10
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.190
And so then these Reddis, these smart dudes on red are like, you know what,

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.430
these people let's just buy a bunch of this stock and Jack that price up.

12
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.900
And so they all got together, thousands of them and they bought a,

13
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.180
all that stock and the price went flying, like went way up.

14
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.740
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. And so then all the hedge fund people that were gambling on it,</v>

15
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.340
losing money mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they lost billions of dollars. Yeah.

16
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:56.020
Like instantly and wall street started panicking.

17
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.980
And so then they realized these reds realized they can do this.

18
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.410
So they started doing with other stocks, like movie theaters to, and then,

19
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.210
and so then this app called Robin hood, which is an app, which,

20
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:10.530
which is Robin hood is supposed to be steal from the rich give to the poor

21
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.530
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, that's the story of Robinhood. Instead,

22
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.490
they are protecting all these hedge fund people by stopping people from doing

23
00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:23.400
this. So they're stopping all this sale of these stocks that these reds all get

24
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:27.160
excited about. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so these people, even if they buy the stock,

25
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.560
now they can't sell it. Or now they is that what it is, or they can't buy it.

26
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.520
They can't buy it. They can't buy it, buy. They can't buy it anymore.

27
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:36.840
They can sell it, but they can't buy it. So it's, they've,

28
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:40.680
they've essentially tried to do what they can to stop this scam.

29
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.710
And ever everyone is furious at them so much so

30
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.510
that I sent you an article that, uh,

31
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.590
Google removed over 100,001

32
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.510
star reviews from their app store because they,

33
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.190
they were saving this application from having one star in the Google app,

34
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:05.980
because everyone was so mad at him. But meanwhile, that's a legit cons.

35
00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:09.980
That's a legit criticism. Like here it is, Google salvaged,

36
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.780
Robin Hood's one star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews.

37
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.900
Unhappy users have been reviewed bombing the app. So that's what's going on.

38
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:21.580
What basically has happened in Jamar is,

39
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.010
is all these people forever have been manipulating the stock market and making a

40
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.970
shitload of money, doing it, hedge funds,

41
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.610
all these billionaire wall street people. Now,

42
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.290
regular folks on Reddit are starting to do the exact same thing.

43
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:38.850
And they're making millions of dollars, millions of dollars in the apps with,

44
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.963
with, with stocks.

45
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.610
And they're trying to figure out a way to stop these people from doing this,

46
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.800
cuz they don't want them to be able to do it. They want wall street,

47
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.560
normal people or, or yeah,

48
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.720
normal people are being penalized for figuring out a new way to

49
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:56.680
hack the system. That wall street has been manipulating forever.

50
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.360
I need tell about, is that accurate?

51
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.240
What I said does an accurate way of describing it.

52
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.200
<v 1>Basically. That's a very good, simple way to describe it. Yeah.</v>

53
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:04.440
There's more levels.

54
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.440
<v 0>To it. So Sagar did a much better job of it. It go to, uh,</v>

55
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.840
you can go to his, their YouTube page, uh,

56
00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:15.560
crystal ball and SA and jet it's called rising the hill.

57
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.560
It's my favorite political talk show.

58
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.830
Cuz there's a person SAS on the right and Crystal's on the left,

59
00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:25.550
but they're both honest and objective and they, they discuss how,

60
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.510
how up this is and how crazy it is. It's.

61
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.550
<v 1>It's gone on. So after yesterday it's still going on today. Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:33.310
So after yesterday went on through uh,

63
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.830
the stock market because the shutdown happened.

64
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.710
I think people's attention was like, well that they're gonna do that to us.

65
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:42.260
Let's take it over the crypto market. And so now the uh, Doche coin,

66
00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:47.140
which started as a complete joke has like skyrocketed to not a joke anymore.

67
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.140
It hit an all time hive, almost 10 cents yesterday, but it was so minuscule.

68
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.580
You wouldn't have understood why you have millions of shares.

69
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.100
Didn't Elon tweet that too. So Elon has been adding to this,

70
00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.300
like he'll tweet something and it'll make something spike.

71
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.130
He like add Bitcoin into his info. I think his bio.

72
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.850
<v 0>And also that gentleman who's running for governor of California.</v>

73
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.890
How do you say his name? I don't know.

74
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.010
<v 1>If he's actually running for, cause I, I saw him get asked that he's like,</v>

75
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:12.250
is this real? And he was like, well technically, you know, recall Gavin Newsom.

76
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.410
I don't think he's officially, he's not file paperwork or anything. You know,

77
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.530
he's having fun. Yeah.

78
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.770
<v 0>I think so. Yeah. He's having fun, but he tweeted about it too.</v>

79
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.240
He's and did he's he's an ex, he was, he was with Google or with Facebook,

80
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.480
Google. But did, do you have anything to do with Facebook ever? Probably,

81
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.800
probably find out if he did cuz I I'm reading. Um,

82
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.120
Matt TA's book. Um, senior executive.

83
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.720
<v 1>Yes. Earlier at Facebook. Maybe not Google.</v>

84
00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:37.520
Maybe it was Facebook then I'm sorry. Instead of Google. Correct.

85
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

86
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.910
But he's basically explaining in one of his tweets recently pulled that up cause

87
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:47.630
he was comparing Robin hood to Facebook and he's saying that they pretend that

88
00:04:47.631 --> 00:04:51.030
you're a customer, but you're not a customer. In fact,

89
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.790
you're the clients and they, you know what,

90
00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:58.230
what you are is you're the product and they pretend that they're doing you

91
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.170
service.

92
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.980
But what they're really doing is they're take all of your data and they're

93
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:05.300
selling it and they're getting rich and they're not,

94
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.500
and they're not giving you any of that money.

95
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.100
And that's the same thing with Robin hood. It's the same sort of scenario. He,

96
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.740
he, he laid it out in his Twitter, but it's,

97
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.660
it's a situation where once his genie's out of the bottle where these regular

98
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:24.130
people figured out how to manipulate stock markets, I and truth be told,

99
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.610
I don't know Jack's about stock markets.

100
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.370
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't know anything. I literally barely pay attention.

101
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.010
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but Dave figured out how to manipulate it.

102
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.850
And once they figured out how to do this, they can keep doing this.

103
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.090
And unless I don't know how they're gonna stop it.

104
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.970
I have no idea how you gonna stop Reddit.

105
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.680
How are you gonna stop these intelligent people with plenty of time? I mean,

106
00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:44.760
so they're organizing. I.

107
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.720
<v 2>Mean, so can like, um, like, like, but you'd have to know how to actually do it.</v>

108
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.560
Cuz I was over here. Like maybe, maybe I should call my,

109
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.000
maybe I should call my brother and tell me he should um, yeah.

110
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.600
<v 0>Get in on this. But it's like a Ponzi scheme. It's like a pump and dump, right?</v>

111
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.120
The idea is like you get in early and then it gets to a certain point.

112
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:05.360
You gotta realize like, okay, it's time to get out. It's time to get out.

113
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.960
Like if you buy it a dollar and then it gets to $30 and then you like, this,

114
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.600
this might crash soon. Get out now I don't know what the number would be.

115
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.680
I'm just saying it.

116
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.110
<v 1>I think that's what a lot of people think. But that understanding I have of the,</v>

117
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.030
this game stop situation is what makes it a little different is that short

118
00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:24.630
squeeze situation is where there's contracts, which I think it just happened.

119
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.390
Cuz the market just closed because those contracts exist.

120
00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:30.430
Someone has to buy that contract at the end of the day when the contract comes

121
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.323
to.

122
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.790
<v 0>I don't. When is the market close?</v>

123
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.190
<v 1>Four o'clock every day. Oh four.</v>

124
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.023
<v 0>O'clock just close time.</v>

125
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.740
<v 1>Just closed. Yeah. Half an hour. So that's what this big issue was.</v>

126
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.060
Was these contracts you could tell were gonna close on the 29th,

127
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.660
which is Friday at 4:00 PM. And when that happens,

128
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.100
whoever holds that contract has to fill, they have to fill the contract.

129
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.093
So they have find the shares.

130
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.260
<v 0>Oh, so that's, they're trying to drive the price. So.</v>

131
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.020
<v 1>People are. So we'll see what happens after the next couple days,</v>

132
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.380
which like after hours trading, which not out,

133
00:06:57.381 --> 00:07:00.290
so something a retail investor gets to do and his hedge funds do get to do.

134
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.130
And that's what was happening. Uh,

135
00:07:02.131 --> 00:07:05.650
maybe two days ago they were driving the price down because they have the

136
00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:08.650
ability to do that. They have ability is that retail investors don't have.

137
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:11.850
And that's really the big argument I feel like is going on right now is like

138
00:07:11.851 --> 00:07:13.010
they can do. We can't do.

139
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.120
<v 0>It's all.</v>

140
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.930
It's also weird because the stock market has always been this weird number thing

141
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.400
it's based on confidence. Like you can decide, buy, sell,

142
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.360
where is it going? Where is it going? Sell it, sell, sell,

143
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.560
sell sounds stressful. Oh my God. I had a friend of mine that I, uh,

144
00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:32.000
used to do TaeKwonDo with that became a stock market guy.

145
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.400
And he was just into Coke and hookers. And then he got,

146
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.240
he got into stock market and I ran into him once.

147
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.710
This is when I was doing standup. I hadn't seen him forever.

148
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.710
He's like not a guy that you would think of being as a, a market guy.

149
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:49.150
He was a tank. He was like 5, 10,

150
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:54.030
2 20 big thick neck, always partying, just a animal.

151
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.910
I think he was on steroids and I,

152
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.260
I ran into him and he was just doing Coke and drinking. Yeah. And uh,

153
00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:01.940
tell me he is in the stock market now. I was like, you're, you're a stock.

154
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.380
You're a stock broker. He's like, bro, it's fun, man. I love it, man.

155
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.660
We're selling stocks. We're making money. Like he was an animal like that.

156
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:11.940
This dude was, I,

157
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.180
I thought of a stock market analyst as being a guy with like a pocket protector,

158
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.540
like Warren buffet or some. Well, back in the day,

159
00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:21.730
like I thought they had a later and a computer and they really knew a lot about

160
00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:24.570
the business and they were just really calculated about their investments.

161
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.370

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.450
I'm like this guy's wild. I'm like, you're a stockbroker. And he was like, dude,

we're talking about a long time ago.

165
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.440
I just ran into him randomly at a comedy club. Mm.
