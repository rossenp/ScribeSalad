3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.320
I could not have married a woman that didn't have nice. Oh, there's a.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.160
<v 1>Right now. Sorry. You're not real women. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.</v>

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.790
But I couldn't have married one. I, I respect you and I'll hang out with you.

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.230
I'll let you into my shows. Wow. But I'm not gonna marry you.

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.870
I'll let you into my shows. &lt;laugh&gt;

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.670
if you get outta the itty bitty committee early and you want to go see a comedy

10
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.390
show. Wow. No, I, I, I look, I respect all women. I just think I really do.

11
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.100
You do all of them.

12
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.630
<v 0>What about mean ones that kill people?</v>

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.700
<v 1>Respect. I respect them even more. &lt;laugh&gt; they're fighting back. They're me.</v>

14
00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:50.140
They're me toing out there. Huh? You hear about the hashtag?

15
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.140
Me too. No, you're gonna love this Joe Rogan. Oh, oh God.

16
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:58.220
There's a thing now because of Harvey Weinstein, there's a hashtag,

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.810
I seen that women that have been sexually harass asked pound,

18
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.010
sign me too on their social media. Jesus Christ. And the, and you know,

19
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:09.010
it's actually harassed.

20
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.250
<v 0>I would say it's probably a hundred percent.</v>

21
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.330
<v 1>Yeah. Because it's a murky definition. Right. You know? I mean,</v>

22
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.410
some of the stories that you hear and I look this Harvey Weinstein thing is

23
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.680
atrocious and that are like,

24
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:26.480
that are the reason why guys like us have to watch what we say.

25
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.680
All the sensitivity that we've been talking about is because of a few,

26
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.560
not a few. There's a lot of, but.

27
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.520
<v 0>And it's not just, I mean, we're not talking about a person trying to get late.</v>

28
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.040
We're talking about a person who is holding employment over people, right.

29
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.830
Power. And did you see the TMZ thing where TMZ,

30
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.910
they were describing the nature of his contract,

31
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.390
that he had sexual assault and, um,

32
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.350
and sexual harassment lawsuits

33
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.710
written into the contract. Like how.

34
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.950
<v 1>Much like a waiver defined.</v>

35
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.980
<v 0>Yeah. How much he would be fined and for are 1, 1, 1, um,</v>

36
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.220
uh, person saying it, it was a certain amount of money for two allegations.

37
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.860
Oh no. It was more for three. It was like, it was like a hundred thousand,

38
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.100
2 50, 7, 50 a million. Wow. Yeah. He had written.

39
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.940
<v 1>In like caps on how much he should have to pay. No.</v>

40
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.730
<v 0>Like how much they would pay him like here or how much he would have to pay.</v>

41
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.490
According to the contract.

42
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.730
If Weinstein treated someone improperly in violation of the company's code of

43
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.370
con of conduct, he must reimburse T WC for the settlements or judgements.

44
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.643
Additionally,

45
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.730
you Weinstein will pay the company liquidated damages of $250,000

46
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.400
for the first such instance, $500,000 for the second such instance,

47
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.360
seven 50 for the third and a million for each additional instance.

48
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.600
Wow. To just imagine that they wrote this in they're complicit,

49
00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:58.520
they're all complicit. There's another provision. Uh,

50
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:03.240
he can be fired for the pur. Whoa, perpetuation.

51
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.040
Have you ever said perpetuation? Perpetuation? That's a weird word. Yeah.

52
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.040
It is perpetuation by you. Uh,

53
00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:14.480
Weinstein of a material fraud against the company. Okay.

54
00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:17.600
What does that mean? The question. Where's the fraud.

55
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.630
Lance mayor off a board member who negotiated the Weinstein 215,

56
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.270
2015 contract said in an interview and we've confirmed.

57
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.470
The board knew Weinstein had settled prior lawsuits brought by various women,

58
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.790
but they assumed it was to cover up consensual affairs. Sure.

59
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:38.710
It was the board's assumption does not constitute fraud on Weinstein's part. Mm.

60
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.393
Scroll up.

61
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.060
Keep going more surprisingly is how T WC fired

62
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.460
Weinstein supposed Weinstein, no Weinstein,

63
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.420
supposedly without giving a specific reason,

64
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.900
which could potentially violate the terms of the contract. Oh my God.

65
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.420
That's crazy. Here's the kick.

66
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.810
Even if Weinstein had committed fraud by not fully informing the Bo board of

67
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.690
directors, the contract says before he can be fired,

68
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:09.290
he has the right to mediation. If that doesn't work,

69
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.970
he's entitled to arbitration. He got neither.

70
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.890
He was summarily fired and sources connected with Weinstein. Tell TMZ.

71
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.330
He was never given a specific reason. Wow. Well.

72
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.400
<v 1>He's fighting at yeah. I love that.</v>

73
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.320
Where do you get the balls to fight back right now?

74
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.960
<v 0>I guess he feels like it's the only way to sort of reclaim some ground.</v>

75
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.680
Yeah. I mean, is that a way.

76
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.800
<v 1>To look at it? Well, that's that mentality and you know, at that level,</v>

77
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.710
the power brokers that run Hollywood, you know, they're all it's.

78
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.750
Trump is like that too. It's all aggression.

79
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.110
It's all come at you when you come at them. Yeah. I mean, it's.

80
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.350
<v 0>Gotta be a crazy position to be in,</v>

81
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.470
to be the head of Miramax. Yeah. You know, I mean, it's like, it's the biggest,

82
00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.710
it's one of the biggest, right. What's the biggest, what, I don't know.

83
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:03.540
What is the biggest studio? If it's not Miramax,

84
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.660
it's one universal universal Miramax.

85
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.980
So at the very least he's responsible for some of the most

86
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.500
iconic movies ever. Yeah.

87
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.900
<v 1>Certainly the most Oscars of any studio in the last 20 years. So.</v>

88
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.060
<v 0>Everyone's kissing his. Yeah. Massive amounts of power.</v>

89
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.770
And this influence over people like royalty. Right? Mm barks.

90
00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:30.570
They all come, you know, everybody's at his whim constantly. Mm.

91
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.090
And then tries to all these starlets.

92
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.570
Like if he had just stuck with like prostitutes

93
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.130
probably still would come out, but it wouldn't come out the same way.

94
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.023
It wouldn't have come out.

95
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.920
<v 1>You don't think, think about the fact that they covered up sexual assault on,</v>

96
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.600
it sounds like a weekly basis. I mean, this,

97
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.480
this story broke what, five days ago, something like that.

98
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.000
And there's already so many women that have come out and now you've got a bounty

99
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.480
on more women to come out. Like some, I think that there,

100
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.840
somebody else is offering a certain amount of money for every woman that comes

101
00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:05.040
out against him. Jesus.

102
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.600
So it's gonna be like Cosby all over again. And you think about.

103
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.040
<v 0>But Cosby was drugging and raping women. No, but.</v>

104
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.873
<v 1>I just mean in terms.</v>

105
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.870
<v 0>Ly another step, more.</v>

106
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.790
<v 1>Evil though. Right? I'm just talking about like the frequency of it and,</v>

107
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.910
and the complicity of okay. People that set up the meetings yeah.

108
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:29.670
Covered up the lawsuits. Oh yeah. Gave the women work after the meetings,

109
00:06:29.671 --> 00:06:29.990
you know,

110
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.510
a lot of them got script deals got rolls in movies because let's a lot of 'em

111
00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:36.910
didn't walk outta the room. A lot of them gave 'em the back rub or whatever.

112
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.700
<v 0>Else. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was what Whitney was talking about.</v>

113
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:45.180
The other day, Whitney Cumings was telling me her and one of her friends, uh,

114
00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:47.700
who's an actress. I did their show at the Largo the other night.

115
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.500
And they were in the, the green room.

116
00:06:49.501 --> 00:06:53.340
And they were talking about how many women literally wrote into their contract.

117
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.380
Like not wrote into it,

118
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.490
but there was an agreement that they would him to get like editors cut.

119
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.730
They would him to get more lines. They, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.610
Girls like prominent actresses had sex with him to ensure that they got big

121
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.730
roles. This.

122
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:10.610
<v 1>Was written down.</v>

123
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.850
<v 0>Some of it was agreed upon. I don't know if they wrote it,</v>

124
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.530
but these things were agreed upon whoa.

125
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.400
And that he always kept his end at the bargain. He was known,

126
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.480
he was known for hooking them up. Wow.

127
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.880
It was part of how he got this whole thing to work.

128
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.280
<v 1>Which means every director and editor that kept those lines in</v>

129
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.040
knew because editors all the time would chop you chop out whole scenes cuz they

130
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:36.874
don't work.

131
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.470
<v 0>Yeah. But that's only, that's like, like when did it happen?</v>

132
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.230
Did it happen before the film was shot? Like he would give them final cut.

133
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.470
Like he would allow them to, you know,

134
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.870
to be in the editing room or was it like,

135
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.950
I will give you the choice part mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; whatever.

136
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:58.950
It was like some sneaky deal. Yeah. I mean, who knows how he said it?

137
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.700
Who knows how they did it. Yeah.

138
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.700
But the idea that all these actors are coming out and like I have no idea.

139
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.620
Can't believe it. I'm so horrified. How do you not know that.

140
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.420
<v 1>I'm a road comic and I knew about it. Yeah. I'm not in the middle of Hollywood.</v>

141
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.340
Yeah. I've known about it for 15 years. What did you know?

142
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.780
I knew that he was a casting couch guy.

143
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:19.340
Everybody knew that he was this sleazy fat.

144
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.490
I always would joke about how like I think he makes himself less attractive cuz

145
00:08:23.491 --> 00:08:26.290
it's more of a power trip for him. It's more fun. Yeah.

146
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.410
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

147
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.850
To have his fat gut resting on their forehead while he shoots a load in their

148
00:08:30.851 --> 00:08:35.290
mouth. All right. You got the part. Yeah.

149
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.730
Next does some blow. Right?

150
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.840
<v 1>Doesn't wash hum. Purpose. Yeah.</v>

151
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.040
<v 0>Has his balls just stink like locker rooms and yeah, it's a weird thing,</v>

152
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.080
man. It's a weird thing that that's, that went on for forever in this,

153
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.640
in this industry, not this industry, the music, the movie industry,

154
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.800
the music industry as well.

155
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.760
Sturgell Simpson was telling me some story about some guy who's a,

156
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.720
a known PST who is like there's,

157
00:09:02.721 --> 00:09:06.720
he's in a similar position in the music business. And like people know like you,

158
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:09.400
