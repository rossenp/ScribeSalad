00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.880
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now,</v>

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.080
one of the things that's happened to you that has allowed people to discredit

3
00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:13.040
you was, there's obviously been some sort of an effort to erase your past.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.720
Yeah. Some sort of an ire, uh, an effort to erase your education history,

5
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.870
your employment history Alamos. In fact,

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.390
the only way your employment history was proven that Los Alamos was someone got

7
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.950
a list of directory of the employees from the past and read into it.

8
00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:32.230
And you were on that list. So it proved that you worked there,

9
00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:33.470
even though people were trying to deny it.

10
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:35.350
And they were trying to use that as a way to discredit you,

11
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:38.110
that you never did work at Los Alamos. You weren't really the scientist.

12
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.060
What was, what was that like to experience? I mean,

13
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:45.100
of course we're talking about the 1980s, the 1990s,

14
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:47.100
when you could get away with something like that.

15
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.020
<v 1>Yeah. I obviously there were a lot less, uh,</v>

16
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.660
a lot less records on computers at that time. It was still file cabinets and,

17
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.580
and folders. But, uh, yeah, that was frightening.

18
00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:02.770
That was one of the first things that happened. I think it's,

19
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.930
I think George nap was the first one that uncovered that. I mean,

20
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:10.050
he saw my birth certificate disappear. He, um, it disappeared.

21
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.810
<v 0>Yeah. But there was no record of you.</v>

22
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.610
<v 1>Being yeah, there was, there was no record of that. There was, uh, his mom.</v>

23
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.250
<v 2>No record me. His mom tells me about that. Like, it was frightening for her,</v>

24
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.090
for, he's got a real family, you know, he's a real person,

25
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.360
it was frightening her.

26
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.600
<v 1>But even the Los Alamo thing really surprised me and that they were so adamant</v>

27
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.440
that no, this guy never worked here. Don't be ridiculous.

28
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.880
And George went back and forth, you know, for, for,

29
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.280
I got the letters on the wall. Yeah. Months. I mean, it, it was ridiculous,

30
00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:40.600
but fortunately, somebody came up with a 1982 phone book directory,

31
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.230
I mean, and also, uh, originally I told you, uh,

32
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.550
you know, when I worked there, I was on the front page of the, the paper. Yes.

33
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:52.030
So they were still able to archive, you know, break,

34
00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:54.430
bring that back from the archives. And you know, Bob Lazar,

35
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.430
a physicist working here at Los Alamo. Also, there was at least something there,

36
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.670
but, uh, somehow George came up with the, the phone directory and.

37
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.740
<v 2>Then, then Bob took George with cameras into Los Alamos.</v>

38
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.300
<v 1>Oh yeah. Yeah. So we flew out there and I said, look, come on in,</v>

39
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.060
I'll show you where I worked. We'll go in, we'll meet people.

40
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.020
And George went with me and, you know, filmed inside and you navigate the place.

41
00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:20.940
So you don't oh yeah. You know, met people and you know, and Los Alamos.

42
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.890
<v 0>Was also the place where they had the machine that was able to read the,</v>

43
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.490
the size of your digits.

44
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.570
<v 1>No, no, that was, that was S four.</v>

45
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.570
<v 0>That was S four. And explain that.</v>

46
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.290
<v 1>So now this was back in the eighties, and this.</v>

47
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.170
<v 0>Is back in the eighties where, when you discussed this, people were like,</v>

48
00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:40.130
this doesn't even exist. Yeah.

49
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.050
<v 1>Yeah. Okay. What was it? It was a way, you know,</v>

50
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:47.200
this is before fingerprint and scanners and you know, and anything of

51
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.920
anyth any high resolution scanner at that time. So what it was,

52
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.520
was a device that, uh,

53
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.600
had a little picture of a hand on a glass plate with pins in it.

54
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.600
So you could jam your hand in there and there was a bright light above it and a

55
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.720
sensor underneath. And when you put your hand in there,

56
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.400
the light would turn on and it would measure the bones in your finger because

57
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:13.080
the light shown through your bones. And apparently

58
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.320
the length of the bones in your fingers are extremely unique and easy to

59
00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:21.990
measure. And they used that when you put your hands on there,

60
00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:25.070
the light would turn on and your badge would pop out. Is it right there? Oh,

61
00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:28.550
there it is. That's, that's it. And I tried to describe this, um,

62
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.990
to people and they said that is the most ridiculous thing we've ever heard. And,

63
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.350
um, I said, Hey, that my badge came out of that thing. I put my hand on it,

64
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.020
badge popped out. And that's how I could open the doors and get into S four.

65
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.940
And, um, you know.

66
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.500
<v 0>And everybody discredited that they said it was with science fiction.</v>

67
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.060
And Jeremy, you found this.

68
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.900
<v 2>I, I found it through a good friend of mine named Tyler rogue away.</v>

69
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:54.500
And he had some good sources inside of area 52,

70
00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:58.660
where they also used these for the stealth program right around that time.

71
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.210
So now out all these people that worked within who, you know,

72
00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:05.730
said only if you're in certain programs, would we use this technology?

73
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:06.690
It was kind of. Actually.

74
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:08.850
They didn't keep it for very long beginning of biometrics.

75
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.890
So I was able to reveal it in my film.

76
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.250
I kept my mouth shut until I showed it to Bob, you know,

77
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:17.530
in the movie is the first time he saw it was how you see it in the documentary.

78
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:19.490
That's his genuine reaction. I'm getting goosebumps.

79
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.280
<v 0>I was great at yeah. The way you did it.</v>

80
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.880
<v 2>Thank you man. Because you know what, guess what I'm,</v>

81
00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:25.880
I'm actually trying to see if he's telling the truth. That's how I started,

82
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.040
you know, that's how I started.

83
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.360
So it was really cool to see that and that you get to see it, his actual.

84
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.960
<v 0>Reaction has that been verified by other people? Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.360
<v 2>So, yeah. So to me it has, uh,</v>

86
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:40.440
personally I get emails every day and people are telling me where these are used

87
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.110
and how they're used in the semi photos.

88
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.430
I got a lot of photos of identity mats now. Well, how they.

89
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.430
<v 0>Were used, right. They're.</v>

90
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.550
<v 2>Not used how they were used. They're not using anything. Yeah. But, uh,</v>

91
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.390
I don't the most recent one was way more recent than I thought in another

92
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:55.590
country. But yeah, that technology was used. So what's so funny is,

93
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.990
um, that this technology, even in the area of 52 or,

94
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.660
or they'd use 'em for, to paw, one of the guys who will go on camera with me,

95
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:08.700
he will do an interview with me. He was a technician for one of these and,

96
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:12.340
and he hated them cuz they were really bad. They always broke down and never,

97
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.300
and he was a technician for him. Now he won't tell me where,

98
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.140
if he worked at area 52. So it's probably tone paw.

99
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.500
It's very separated even on base. But yeah. So.

100
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.290
<v 0>There was that. Yeah. There is your education record.</v>

101
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.850
That was also like what happened with that?

102
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.810
<v 1>Well, that disappeared also, you know that I I've, I've never gone.</v>

103
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.330
I've never gone anywhere for education. I've never gone.

104
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.480
I never attended in eight classes at Cal tech. I never attended anything at MIT.

105
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.520
<v 0>You did attend classes in those places.</v>

106
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.760
<v 1>I did attend classes in those places. Do.</v>

107
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.360
<v 0>You know anybody that you went to school with.</v>

108
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.600
<v 1>That? Yes I do.</v>

109
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.560
<v 0>And have they verified that they went to school with you? Well.</v>

110
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.320
<v 1>I gave Jeremy some names, but peop yeah. I,</v>

111
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.360
the reason I don't say these names publicly is because every single time

112
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.520
I mention a name, somebody gets in trouble. You don't want.

113
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.353
<v 2>To be of course.</v>

114
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.920
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah, of course. Um, but what,</v>

115
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:13.640
what is that experience like seeing your birth certificate erased,

116
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.480
seeing your employment.

117
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.910
<v 1>History? Well, its frightening. It's, it's absolutely.</v>

118
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.710
<v 0>Frighten, but it's also the fuel that the debunks use.</v>

119
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.630
The so-called air quote skeptics. I don't like the term skeptics.

120
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.150
I'm gonna say this publicly. Cause I really only said this privately.

121
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.710
I think it's a sloppy, lazy way to look at things, to just be a skeptic.

122
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.980
I want people to be objective and I think there's a lot of things you should be

123
00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.180
skeptical of. I think you should,

124
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.020
you should look at things and look at things from a hard

125
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.300
line science perspective. You should be objective. But the idea of skeptics,

126
00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:52.260
the problem with that is you're always looking for things to be. Yeah.

127
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.060
And I think that's dangerous cuz I think some things aren't.

128
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.260
<v 2>It's confirmation bias on the other end. You're just,</v>

129
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.130
I need to take a square thing and put it in a round hole no matter what.

130
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.490
<v 0>And I find a lot of them to be lazy. Yeah. A lot of them to be lazy thinkers.</v>

131
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.810
Sure. Because they're always putting it into that box instead of going. Hmm.

132
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.650
Instead of just separating their ego, they're trying,

133
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:14.050
they're playing a game and the game is calling.

134
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.320
I wanna call and I'm gonna line up all these reasons why I it's.

135
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.200
And I'm gonna ignore anything that might be contrary to that definition. Yeah.

136
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.560
<v 2>That doesn't every time I'm thinking I'm gonna catch him in something, you know,</v>

137
00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:26.960
all along this process. Um,

138
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.600
I found Dr. Crangle he came forward and said I was in security briefings with

139
00:07:30.601 --> 00:07:32.720
Bob Lazar, the physicist at Los and Alamos.

140
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:35.240
He went on the record with me now the other people I talked with,

141
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.960
why won't they go on the record with me?

142
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.950
Cuz they're still working there &lt;affirmative&gt; so that that's the difference,

143
00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:43.390
right? What is the, what can the public have? Right. Or even.

144
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.150
<v 0>If they're not working there, you know, they wanna live their lives. Why?</v>

145
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.270
I mean, obviously people have seen what's happened to you Mike.

146
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.950
<v 2>Thick pin after 30 years. Yeah. Really.</v>

147
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.430
<v 1>If you look at all the information on, you know, concerning my accounts,</v>

148
00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:58.990
that's, that's very,

149
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.340
it can't possibly be a story anymore.

150
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:08.060
It's really way past that point. Yeah. I mean that was my Mike Thigpen is,

151
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.100
I mean, how could I possibly know?

152
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:11.800
<v 2>Uh,</v>

153
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.780
so Mike Thigpen was the guy that did the security clearances to go

154
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:18.940
to the BA one of the guys that was used. And this is the guy that you worked.

155
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:19.890
<v 0>With. He's said.</v>

156
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.210
<v 2>He did. Right? And, and George NA you know, George didn't believe him.</v>

157
00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:28.250
George put him through four polygraph tests. Right. He tried to see, man,

158
00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:30.810
this is a big risk. It sounds interesting.

159
00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:34.570
But let's see if he's telling the truth. One of the things was, Bob said,

160
00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:37.130
there's a guy named Mike, thi penny did security clearances for the base.

161
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.520
And that's a weird name. It's a very specific for 30 years.

162
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.800
George found this guy in this weird department that he didn't even know it was

163
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.760
my thick pin, but the guy wouldn't talk to me,

164
00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:51.640
ghosted him totally ghosted for 30 years used Facebook and Google image match

165
00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:54.960
through his children. I was able to find him after 30 years.

166
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.480
And I talked to him three times on the phone. He lives on the east coast.

167
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.440
He almost went on camera with me,

168
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.760
confirmed that he did security clearances for the base in 1989. Confirmed.

169
00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:06.360
He remembers Bob Lazar.

170
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.400
And what you don't know is there's a handwritten note that a friend of yours has

171
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.320
from Mike. What that I know I'm gonna give it to you later. I don't. But that,

172
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.110
that is actual. So a handwritten note that says what, you know,

173
00:09:17.111 --> 00:09:20.790
like this is new to me. So, so when the, I, when you're.

174
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.630
<v 1>When they do security cl clearances, they go.</v>

175
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.790
<v 2>Through all your friends and family and they go to your friends. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

176
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.990
So this is too Bob and I had people come to me for a friend of mine.

177
00:09:31.991 --> 00:09:34.350
That's serving and they're doing a security clearance for him.

178
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.540
And even like the UFO guy, uh, they did, you know,

179
00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:41.580
the FBA come and visit my house and make sure that they talk about my friend and

180
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.820
they lift a little card. And when my wife told him to get away,

181
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.700
cause he didn't know who they were. They left a little card. It's super cute.

182
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.620
Now back then it was a handwritten note and his friend has it for him that you

183
00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:56.130
haven't seen in. Oh my God. Two decades. So you're listening.

184
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.490
You're telling me it is now. I don't know why I'm telling this.

185
00:09:58.491 --> 00:10:02.170
What is this card? It's just a little handwritten note with Mike thig.

186
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.010
Pin's signature on your card. Like a, like a, like a postcard,

187
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.290
like a piece of paper that he left on the door saying when Bob gets back or

188
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.330
whatever it says on it. So it's just another little funny thing.

189
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.650
I found the guy, he does the security clearances. He admitted to me, he did it.

190
00:10:15.651 --> 00:10:17.920
And he admitted to me, he was dodging George NA,

191
00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:20.800
because when George said his name on the, on the, on the news,

192
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.400
he dropped his fork into his steak, earned his potatoes or whatever.

193
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.560
And he's looking at his wife, he was in trouble.

194
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.240
His name's never supposed to be out there.

195
00:10:28.241 --> 00:10:29.880
Like it's just a security clearance guy,

196
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.800
but you don't want national attention associated with anything. Bob has to say.

197
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:34.841
But anyway,

198
00:10:34.841 --> 00:10:39.110
this unique name Bob said for 30 years and the guy ghosted George nap,

199
00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:41.950
George could prove he existed. He actually talked to me, man.

200
00:10:41.951 --> 00:10:46.110
He talked to me three times. He almost went on camera with me. It's just crazy.

201
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.150
What, what do you, what happens after 30 years? You just get more info.
