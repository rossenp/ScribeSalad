00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.330
<v 2>Because I'm obsessed with David Goggins. This is all your fault. Stay hard.</v>

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.320
This is what I do to my mother. I'm like, mom, we have to meditate.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.020
I don't want to meditate, mom. We're going to meditate. And then in her mind,

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.320
meditation is prayer, right? Cause she's very Catholic.

6
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.740
So you sit and you pray and I'm like, and I'll get her to come and sit.

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.400
And then I put on David Goggins and he's like, if somebody tells you,

8
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:27.660
you can't do something, you tell them, go themselves. And my mother said, Jason,

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.520
turn this off. This is awful. You're.

10
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.280
<v 1>Wise. You have to curse. I'm going to read you a David Goggins sent me on my.</v>

11
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.040
<v 0>Birthday. I'm obsessed with him. He's awesome.</v>

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.140
I send it to my nephew all the time because I want him to get like when he

13
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:42.330
gets down on himself, we always get hard on ourselves.

14
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.490
<v 1>He's uh, he's an awesome human being. He's not a lot of those out there.</v>

15
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.120
There's not a lot of those out there this day. 54 years ago,

16
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.410
you took your first breath. When taking that first breath,

17
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.750
it made you eligible to die.

18
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.570
I hope you're not enjoying your day by sitting on the couch with your feet

19
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:07.620
up. Hopefully you're out there somewhere suffering, talking to that in a.

20
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.200
See Jo, the inner loves birthdays. Why.

21
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.390
<v 0>I'm jealous.</v>

22
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.610
<v 1>Because it makes you need a bigger pitch because we feel it's us special</v>

23
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.420
day. So we can just chill the out.

24
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.760
Most people wake up to just exist on this planet. So Joe,

25
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.970
if you haven't gotten the after it yet,

26
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.420
maybe you should five exclamation points.

27
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.030
<v 0>I'm obsessed with him. I love you to be.</v>

28
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.300
<v 1>Birthday. Five extra motion points,</v>

29
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.180
Goggins out six exclamation points.

30
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.970
<v 0>I love him. I listened to his book driving. I go crazy.</v>

31
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.100
I've listened to his book like three, four times.

32
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.650
<v 1>The greatest birthday messages around really.</v>

33
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.900
<v 0>Is. That's amazing. But.</v>

34
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.413
<v 1>Your suffering.</v>

35
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.700
<v 0>Is exactly right, because that's what we do.</v>

36
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:11.010
Like you took your first breath to know that you can take.

37
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.650
<v 1>Like to die.</v>

38
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.630
<v 0>The only proof of life is death. So it's so.</v>

39
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.730
<v 1>Yeah, the people I know they're the most miserable don't suffer on purpose.</v>

40
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.820
<v 0>Well, and, and that's like, we were talking about working out and like that.</v>

41
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.800
Like I have depression, obviously. I don't know, uh, comics get it. Do you,

42
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.100
are you on that? Do you get depressed? No. See,

43
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:36.360
you're one of those that's Andrew.

44
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.930
<v 1>I'm not depressed because I forced myself into,</v>

45
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.810
well also I don't have the chemistry for it. I'm not,

46
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.170
I don't have like depression in my family,

47
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.330
but also I've been very physically active since I was young.

48
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.450
And there was studies that was done. Like we pulled it up the other day.

49
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.470
The thing about the difference between the effectiveness of SSRI versus the

50
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:03.970
effectiveness of a like regular rigorous exercise,

51
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.440
they're very similar.

52
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:10.360
And some studies they've shown that regular rigorous exercise is more

53
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:15.280
effective than SSRI. I'm reducing it. I think it's variable,

54
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.450
right? Like the way you.

55
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.100
<v 0>Your pace in line.</v>

56
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.430
<v 1>Right? Your baseline biologically is different than Jamie's.</v>

57
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.390
It's different than mine. Everybody has a different genetics.

58
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.450
There's diff there's, there's a different baseline. So it's like,

59
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.830
no one can ever say the way you feel is the way they feel because they have no

60
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.640
idea. It's part of the problem. Right. Which is part of the problem.

61
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.030
When they prescribe medication, they don't know how you feel. Yeah.

62
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.210
So they're trying to guess, and they're like, are you self-indulgent?

63
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:46.810
Is this guy hypochondriac? Is this guy really depressed? Like,

64
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:48.010
is he really on the verge of suicide?

65
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:51.070
Because there's a chemical imbalance or maybe his girl broke up with him and

66
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:51.904
he's being a like.

67
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.480
<v 0>Way. Maybe he's just.</v>

68
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.440
<v 1>Lazy sitting around playing video games all day, drinking mountain Dew.</v>

69
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.320
And he feels like. Maybe there's that. There's that when,

70
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:03.220
when a person feels like,

71
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.060
it's hard to know if you're just an outside objective observer.

72
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.160
It's hard to know why they're feeling like.

73
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.440
<v 0>A hundred percent I can remember.</v>

74
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.520
And I always feel terrible for my nieces and nephews because they have too much

75
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.540
time and they have too much space, like growing up in my mother's house.

76
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.200
There's 10 of us, 12 of us, whatever in a three-bedroom row,

77
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.230
home two and a half technically. But so.

78
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.970
<v 1>Explain a row home in a row.</v>

79
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.200
<v 0>Home. If you've seen Rocky, like the houses are all connected, basically.</v>

80
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.280
Who doesn't watch Rocky David Goggins. Huh? Anyway.

81
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.140
<v 1>45 Times a day.</v>

82
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.050
<v 0>Round 11. Okay. So like he breaks it down to the round. It's the best.</v>

83
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.730
But anyway, he, um, so, so my thing is like we were on top of each other,

84
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.580
like I do a joke about being in the room with my brothers.

85
00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:53.800
There really was seven of us sleeping in one room.

86
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.300
It was me and all my brothers.

87
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.230
And then my sisters were in the middle room and my mom and dad was in the back

88
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.340
room until my dad left.

89
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.360
And then my little sister went in there cause she was where's daddy. Anyway,

90
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:05.770
that's a whole sad story. But anyway,

91
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.940
so we were on top of each other and I can remember days being like sad.

92
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.690
And I be under the table, like crying, holding my dog, being like,

93
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:17.830
no one loves me. Right. I don't know why my brothers be like, get up, get out.

94
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.230
So I would just go play softball or go swim or whatever I was doing, you know?

95
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.220
And so I kept active. Then there was like an adult time where,

96
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.070
when I got into my twenties where I stopped doing that,

97
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.300
I wasn't playing softball at the time. And it started getting worse. Like I was,

98
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.810
I would immerse myself in work or little things like that,

99
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:42.490
but I wasn't working out until I started the wrestling and really working out

100
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.770
that helped so much when I get down. And um, I,

101
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.700
I know I joke about Goggins,

102
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.090
but I'm serious when he says get the up and get after it.

103
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.730
It's that little moment when you don't want to go,

104
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.530
is the best you'll feel after you go. Yeah. People.

105
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.180
<v 1>Like Kim or fuel there's there's people like Jocko, Jocko, Willink,</v>

106
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.950
Cameron Hanes, David Goggins. There, those people are fuel.

107
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.280
You know, they they're, they're letting you know,

108
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.050
then I hope I'm like a bridge to fuel because like I do what they do,

109
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:19.100
but I'm not as Savage as they are. They're right. But,

110
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.500
but, but you know what I'm saying? It's like,

111
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.510
I want to let everybody know that like feel all those same feelings

112
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:28.070
that you feel too. Like,

113
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.070
even though I work out one of the things that Goggins said to me and he goes,

114
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:35.060
don't take, I don't want to procrastinate. He goes, sometimes see my shoes,

115
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.540
the running shoes. I stared those for half hour before I put them on.

116
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.550
And every time he says it, I'm like, I know, but I always put them on,

117
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.530
but I always put them on watch the entire episode for free, only on Spotify.
