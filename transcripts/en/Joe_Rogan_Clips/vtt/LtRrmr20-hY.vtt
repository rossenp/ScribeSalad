00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.770
<v 2>I remember watching Mr. Jones on, uh, MTV and,</v>

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.480
uh, I love that video, man. And I love that you dancing in that,

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.120
was it like a living room or something like that? I'm like,

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.080
I want to be that free. Like you seem so loose.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.400
You were so in the moment I remember thinking that I was,

7
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:26.940
I remember talking to a friend of mine, let, let, uh, that night after a show,

8
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:30.030
I was at a bar. I was like, you ever see that Mr. Jones video? I go,

9
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:33.330
when that dude's dancing, I go, I want to like, figure out how to get there.

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.320
<v 1>I want to be that free. But you know, it's a weird thing I used to,</v>

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.430
I'm gonna take this off for now. I used to be, for me, you know,

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.240
life is often very awkward and uncomfortable,

13
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.720
but not on stage, you know, like on stage, I always felt like, well,

14
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.960
this is the one place on everything I do is fine. Right? So when I started,

15
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.690
you know, making videos at first, it was just like,

16
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.090
this is apps. This is easy because all I got to do is do the stuff I'm can,

17
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.970
I'm gonna do, you know, and, and there's nothing wrong I can do.

18
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:07.440
I can just be as free as I want. And that lasted about a year and a half,

19
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.400
maybe two years,

20
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.710
something that like getting really famous out of nowhere. And then,

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.570
you know, all the kind of backlash that comes with it.

22
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:21.510
I noticed a couple years later, I was a lot more

23
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.930
self-conscious I'm still on stage.

24
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.080
I never think about anything when I'm playing it. Nothing bothers me.

25
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:29.670
But in front of cameras,

26
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.530
I got really self-conscious in front of cameras after sometime in the middle of

27
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:38.130
our second record. I just noticed that I started to suck on not suck on video,

28
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.470
but definitely not like that. Mr. Jones video.

29
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.881
<v 0>You,</v>

30
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:45.780
you became aware that so many people were watching and criticizing you or like,

31
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:46.440
what was it?

32
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.590
<v 1>I think it was that, you know, cause at first I just, uh,</v>

33
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.370
well didn't care and I just thought that there's nowhere in the world.

34
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:55.260
I'm more comfortable than here. So I'm fine.

35
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.540
And then I think on our second album,

36
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:00.180
when we got a lot of backlash and you get a little too big and everybody,

37
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:02.340
you get, you annoyed the out of people being, you know,

38
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:06.300
especially cause in a band because you get a really successful song.

39
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:08.430
They're going to play it on the radio every five minutes after a while,

40
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:10.570
it's like, God who wouldn't get sick of it, you know?

41
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.280
And then you get some backlash after that. People say some terrible things.

42
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.350
And then, and then I started thinking about like,

43
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.310
what do I look like on film then I got really self-conscious, you know,

44
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.740
what is this pants? Does this look, this song, make my look big. You know, uh,

45
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.850
I noticed that I got kind of crappy in just in front of cameras,

46
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.120
not the rest of the time and not like cameras when I'm on stage at a concert,

47
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:35.010
like you play a big festival, there's lots of cameras,

48
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.990
nothing bothered me there. It's just kind of sometimes on TV and in, in filming,

49
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.040
I got kind of self-conscious and I'd never been that way, the press.

50
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.990
<v 0>Stuff like that kind of stuff. I just think so.</v>

51
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.570
<v 1>I mean, I don't really know what caused it exactly. I would.</v>

52
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.510
The only reason I would say, I think you're right about that is that,

53
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.760
is that it happened then, you know,

54
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:55.740
and that was the first time I'd experienced that. Cause you know,

55
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.260
no one says anything bad about you when they don't know you exist for one.

56
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:03.100
And then on our first record, we couldn't buy a bad review, you know? And,

57
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.640
but by our second record it was, we weren't even getting, it was like,

58
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.160
forget him. He's this chick. So I don't have to forget his music, you know?

59
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.420
And then like he got fat, whatever it would be, you know, you start, you know,

60
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:19.690
when you nationwide, but a national publication, Causey fat.

61
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.020
I remember getting a review in like in England once and somebody called me

62
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.750
poncy as a fish mongers cat,

63
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.320
which I suppose fishmongers cats eat a lot on see like.

64
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.090
<v 0>Is that like chubby Potsy.</v>

65
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.160
<v 1>I thought it meant chubby. I assume, I guess, I don't know.</v>

66
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.890
Just sounded bad compared to a fishmonger's cat.

67
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.580
The fact that fishmonger is involved at all as a word,

68
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:48.520
when they're talking about your cancer, seems like a bad sign, you know?

69
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.040
<v 0>Yeah. There's a thing that happens, right?</v>

70
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:55.630
Like when people discover you and they find out about you and you haven't

71
00:03:55.631 --> 00:04:00.400
gotten big yet, like, especially for bands, I think where they,

72
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:04.330
they, they love the fact that they're the first to tell their friends,

73
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.710
you got to listen to this band, gotta listen to this album. This is awesome.

74
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.790
But then when you get really big and other people like it and too many people

75
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.330
like it, then you're like, ah, man, they were good in the beginning.

76
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.430
<v 1>I think you're, I mean, I think that music, unlike almost everything else,</v>

77
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.220
it becomes our personal cool, you know, I mean,

78
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:26.950
we literally wear it on our shirts, you know, and, and it,

79
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.180
it defines who we are.

80
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:32.630
We talk about this John rhe or that genre as being our gang almost. And when,

81
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.140
when you're discovering stuff. Yeah, it's really cool.

82
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.960
And then when you have to share it with that guy at the water cooler,

83
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:40.300
who likes that worst music, you know,

84
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:43.120
that guy who's been coming in for years and he's just listened to outer.

85
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.790
And now he loves your band too. And you're like,

86
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:49.990
I don't want to share this with captain over there, you know? And, uh.

87
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.800
<v 0>I've never understood that cause why can't people with terrible taste also like</v>

88
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:56.320
great things like great things are great, no matter what,

89
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:58.240
like everybody loves the godfather, right?

90
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.630
It's like whoever says that movie socks, nobody,

91
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:04.450
but people who like terrible movies still like the godfather.

92
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.441
<v 1>You know? Well,</v>

93
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:08.980
I think it's less because they now like it as that you're now as opposed to you

94
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:12.280
were in a club without them, and now you're in a club with them.

95
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.460
And that just sucks. Cause you didn't have to be in a club with them before.

96
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.860
Right. It's human nature. I mean, I get it.

97
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.930
I didn't like it when it landed on me, but uh, yeah. I mean, I get it well,

98
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:23.680
and it happened to you.

99
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.610
<v 0>You pre-social media. Yeah. You were,</v>

100
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.390
you guys were just getting reviewed by experts.

101
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.150
You weren't get on by the general public.

102
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.350
<v 1>Yeah, no. I mean, but that was kind of, that was a good thing for one,</v>

103
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:42.730
but I was really into soap. Right? Well it's, for me,

104
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:47.170
it had happened when I was kind of already into social media because I remember

105
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:50.590
moving down to LA after our first album and, and that year,

106
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:55.090
while I was writing the second record, discovering that AOL had these, uh,

107
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.610
like message boards. So this is 95 say,

108
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.600
and I realized that AOL had these forums and message boards for all the bands

109
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:06.140
and suddenly occurred to me. Well, I could just go on there and talk to people.

110
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.730
Cause when I read it, they were worried about,

111
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:10.940
were we ever going to make a second record? Where were we going to?

112
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.860
Did we exist anymore? Like what,

113
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.760
all the questions that you wonder about your band between records and it

114
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:17.780
suddenly occurred to me? Well, I could,

115
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.090
I have the answers to all those questions. You know,

116
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:22.970
I could just go on there and it took me a little while to convince the people on

117
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:27.950
there that I was me, but uh, understandably of course,

118
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.270
but eventually I did. And then we sort of started this kind of community there,

119
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.000
uh, you know, way before other social media.

120
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.950
But it occurred to me because the rest of the time you,

121
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.740
you can't get to your fans except through,

122
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.200
or you couldn't then except through the radio, the DJs and the press. So like,

123
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.360
you don't really get to give anybody your own words.

124
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.040
They gotta be filtered through everybody else.

125
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.100
But that AOL thing was a chance to just like, well,

126
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:56.180
like what Twitter and everything is now. But it occurred to me back then.

127
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:58.310
It was really cool. And when people started,

128
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.770
then I got in arguments with our own fans. I've always done that.

129
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:02.960
It's just like, what kind of arguments? Well, you know,

130
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:06.530
like I don't think I'm who they think I am.

131
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.660
Who do you think they think you are? Um,

132
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.510
a classic rock guy driving around in a pickup truck, uh,

133
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.310
like going to drive in movie theaters because that's this Americana dream vision

134
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.290
of like, we all sit around, you know,

135
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.940
going to drive ins and live in some dream of a Springsteen song.

136
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.130
The Springsteen isn't even any part of, you know,

137
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.020
I would go on there and I'd be like,

138
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.650
have you guys heard the first Justin Timberlake album? It's amazing.

139
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:34.460
It's got like Timberland and the Neptune's doing all the songs and I would try

140
00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:35.900
and make this thing to tell them like,

141
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:38.930
you should listen to this it's brilliant music. And they just,

142
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.540
they couldn't grasp the Justin Timberlake thing.

143
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.170
Cause in their mind in sync was the guy at the water cooler. Right. You know?

144
00:07:45.171 --> 00:07:46.880
And so like I would get in these types of nights with them,

145
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:49.430
like you guys don't know about music. You're just like,

146
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.520
you're in this little niche rigid, you know, you like us.

147
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:55.730
And I think that's very smart and intelligent shows a lot of wisdom,

148
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.490
but you're limited. You're not getting all these fights with them.
