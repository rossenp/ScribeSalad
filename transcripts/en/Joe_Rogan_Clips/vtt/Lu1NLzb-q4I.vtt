00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>How many times have we seen this and people will say, Hey,</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.460
you know why aren't there more women at the comedy store?

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.310
Why aren't there more of this? Why aren't there more of that? Whoops.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.980
<v 1>Oh yeah. That lady, that lady who said like, where'd he come,</v>

5
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:13.680
he's only got three spots last month. Explain that like where,

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.490
what you're doing is accusing. But if you're actually asking why to,

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.100
when he comes on,

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.010
I get three spots last month is because Whitney Cummings called in for three

9
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:22.890
spots last month, she gets every spot she wanted.

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.430
She will tell you that if you ask it to her face, she's one of the ones who

11
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.840
you don't get, you don't call in and not get a spot.

12
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.400
There's certain people who get the spots they want. Yeah. So she's one of them.

13
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.960
So the answer is she's busy. She has, yeah, exactly. The answer is sexism there.

14
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:40.080
Yeah.

15
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.460
<v 0>Yeah. Well, that's nonsense though,</v>

16
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:44.610
that that kind of thinking almost always comes from people who suck.

17
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.790
If you look at their art, they're almost always bad.

18
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.580
It's just a fact they want acknowledge it.

19
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.670
<v 1>And I was talking to Lisa about this recently. It's not new.</v>

20
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:56.370
It made me realize same thing with Dan cook up big people like, oh,

21
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.323
cause it was good-looking.

22
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.020
And that was a bunch of sucky guys who weren't killing every set like Dane was

23
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.730
sure. And they were going, there must be a reason other than it's on me.

24
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.080
Why I'm not as big as him. So how about the good-looking thing? That's off me.

25
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:12.570
I have no control over that. Right. And it's really like, dude,

26
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:16.950
that guy kills 19 times at a 20 and you kill two out of 20. Yeah. Like,

27
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.400
can you possibly say it could be based on that.

28
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.890
<v 0>But it's the people that are complaining are almost never doing well anyway.</v>

29
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:26.850
So there's why they complaining. I mean, what what's, what's going, I mean,

30
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.130
you're not going to hear certain people.

31
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.830
You're going to hear bill Burke complaining about other people do show up.

32
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.630
<v 1>It goes, I mean, black comics who do well, they're all successful.</v>

33
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.640
Hugely you guys, if you're doing well on stage consistently as a black comic,

34
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.150
there's no question. You'll be, you'll be doing, you'll be making doctor money.

35
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.080
He didn't say that. But like.

36
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.720
<v 0>That's what it is. But if that's what it is. Yeah. Well,</v>

37
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.790
comedy in many ways is very egalitarian in that way.

38
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.480
<v 0>I mean, you are what you are, you either.</v>

40
00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:58.770
You're really funny or you're not okay.

41
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.960
<v 1>There's black rooms for black comics was something like,</v>

42
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:03.810
so I'm in that doesn't relate to certain white audiences.

43
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:05.910
Like I just can't figure it out, but there's rooms for them.

44
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.700
There's the Mexican rooms where they do half the punchlines in Spanish that

45
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.030
wouldn't play at the comedy store. But it would play in certain audiences.

46
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.150
<v 0>Diaz used to do Miami. He would do Spanglish.</v>

47
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.420
He would have his punchlines be in Spanish and people would follow the chair

48
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:19.740
laughing because I understood it.

49
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.240
And if you were a white guy who didn't swear for luck, good luck.

50
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.240
<v 1>That was another thing. Oh, you're dirty. That's why you're successful.</v>

51
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.080
And it's like, Hey man, just start crushing. And it's, won't be an issue. Yeah.

52
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.650
<v 0>Well that was a nonsense issue too. Like I don't want to fall someone dirty.</v>

53
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.760
Yeah. Why not? Yeah. Why?

54
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.360
<v 1>Yeah. But this idea that like I'm not getting a hook as a reason. It's not new.</v>

55
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.330
I just realized this has been going on as a reason to be like off me.

56
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.590
Why I'm not doing well. Yeah.

57
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.060
<v 0>It does. I think the real sexism, especially for women,</v>

58
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.390
is having to work with a bunch of people that are trying to you all the time.

59
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.650
<v 1>Especially I think at open mics when you're already ready to quit, anyway,</v>

60
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.320
you're about ready to quit. And now this,

61
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.100
these creeps were around and there's no one to talk to what the across the

62
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.250
coffee shop. They're homeless. I mean, for real.

63
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.450
<v 0>Yeah. But people line up for open mics.</v>

64
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.100
There's a giant percentage of them that are out of their minds.

65
00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:17.680
So if you're some girl who already feels vulnerable around men to begin with,

66
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.690
because you're smaller and you know, you're a target for this.

67
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.500
<v 1>Like manager to go talk to him like, Hey, this guy's, can you walk me to my car?</v>

68
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.660
<v 0>No rules. You sign up. There's 30 other people sign up.</v>

69
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.450
You wait around for your name to be called. If you're lucky,

70
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.343
you get three minutes.

71
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.710
<v 1>You're still no matter what, five years away from making a dollar. So it's like,</v>

72
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:40.090
you know what, it. I'm done. If Mary Lynn rice, Cub today gets harassed,

73
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.510
she's not going to quit. It's still making money. Right. You know,

74
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:46.240
she'll she might not come to the store anymore if nobody does anything about it.

75
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.710
Um, but people would do. So there's a place to go to for like, Hey,

76
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:52.450
you need to get rid of this guy, this audience member can't come.

77
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.810
<v 0>And that's just comedy. I mean, with any job.</v>

78
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.640
<v 1>I think the real issue.</v>

79
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.760
<v 0>Well also with men, men are stupid. Okay.</v>

80
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.510
If you're working with a man and uh, you're nice that man,

81
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.080
he assumes you want to him because this is how this is evolution.

82
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.950
This is how it worked.

83
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.800
<v 1>Yeah. We're monkeys my arm. And it's like, oh, you must have liked.</v>

84
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.670
<v 0>Me. So if a woman is like kind to a guy and get some coffee,</v>

85
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.360
the guy thinks she wants to suck his Dick because he's stupid because this is

86
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:22.510
how we're programmed. We're programmed to think that women who are nice to us,

87
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.360
if that woman is attractive, she must be sending a signal.

88
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.500
She wants sexual attention.

89
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.370
It can't just be some completely platonic workplace situation.

90
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.790
That's not possible because eight hours a day, when you're working with someone,

91
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.270
you develop feelings and thoughts and ideas about that person.

92
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.560
<v 1>We're not, we're doing the nasty show at the Montreal. And uh,</v>

93
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.220
there's all these young interns. Um, some of them women and, you know,

94
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.700
young people are cuter than old people. I don't know what to tell you.

95
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.800
I'll stand by. You can be by mail. You want to talk to every magazine.

96
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.470
Um, and you get this idea and you're there a week early from everybody else.

97
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:01.210
And nasty show starts way earlier. So you pretty much,

98
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.790
you only English speaking show while the French stuff is going on.

99
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.260
And these interns, um, come out and you're like, Ooh, I think I can one of them.

100
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.670
And then it hit me like, oh wait,

101
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:13.330
there's also a male entrance who also showing up to the shows. And you're like,

102
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.190
oh, they're all just comedy fans.

103
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.450
And I'm reading in these women must be flirting.

104
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.260
Whereas they're coming when they're exhibiting the literally the exact same

105
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:27.010
behavior as the men who are coming, coming to like,

106
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.940
I want to hang out with the comedian. Yeah. And they might want hookah.

107
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:35.320
They might not, but I'm putting something on them only because of their gender.

108
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.050
And then it's like, okay, step back. You can't any of these people. Right?

109
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.090
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

110
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.240
And that's must be what it's like if you're the manager of an office and there's

111
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.470
a cute woman who works for you and a guy who's fat and gross,

112
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.950
and they're both exhibiting the exact same friendly behavior towards you.

113
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.350
You don't assume the fact that I wants to suck your Dick. Right.

114
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.500
<v 1>And then, and then also it's like, if you can still hook up,</v>

115
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.540
but they have to do all the work. The underlaying has to do all the pushing you,

116
00:05:59.541 --> 00:05:59.900
even.

117
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.940
<v 0>Though I don't think you can in an office environment.</v>

118
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.990
<v 1>I think of the underlined keeps pushing. You get push hard. You have to push up.</v>

119
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.380
You can, you can be like, what are you doing this weekend? And everybody like,

120
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.170
I'm going to move. You want to come? Like, I'm sure anybody else want to come?

121
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.800
Like you, you have to like really not push and put them in a position.

122
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.790
<v 0>Yeah. And there's people going to take advantage of that on both sides. Yeah.</v>

123
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.330
And even on the female side, um, there's a friend of mine who works at vice.

124
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.140
And uh,

125
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.460
he was talking to me about this woman who is making these like really obvious,

126
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.283
um.

127
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.790
<v 1>Well.</v>

128
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.780
<v 0>Advances. She was trying to have sex with him. And uh,</v>

129
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.850
he contacted one of the other guys that he works with that is

130
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:43.580
also there. And he's like, do not her.

131
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.000
Like she is upwardly mobile. Like what she was doing.

132
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.910
She's trying to her way up to the top. She did it to this guy.

133
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:53.270
And then she called sexual harassment on him after she flirted with him.

134
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.360
And then she.

135
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.520
<v 1>And then she got.</v>

136
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.350
<v 0>Some, some advance that she shouldn't have. And um, some,</v>

137
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.030
some nonsense went on, people are political.

138
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.690
Some people are very calculated and some people are sociopaths and they exist

139
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:09.470
with vaginas. They exist with penises is just, this is part of being a person.

140
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.610
There's some people that are just bad people.

141
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.390
<v 1>But there's also some women who like power and that's not wrong either.</v>

142
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.130
And so it's like, oh, you're a manager. Right.

143
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.180
It's justifiably makes me want to you a little more. And so that's okay too.

144
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.020
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

145
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.200
Well there's some women also that like being in power and we hate those women,

146
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.420
but we don't hate the men who like to be in power.

147
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:29.390
That's a weird thing to like a woman who wants to run where like, Ooh,

148
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.010
this crazy wanting to run everything.

149
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.610
Whereas a guy who wants to run seems totally normal. Yeah.

150
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.960
<v 1>I will say, it's a bigger wrong, it's like,</v>

151
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:42.740
what are you most likely want to avoid? You know? And it seems like a bigger,

152
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:45.530
wrong for someone to have to like, worry about getting,

153
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.150
not just being able to do their job versus uh, oh,

154
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:52.280
this chick wants to sleep with me. Cause she wants to get ahead. Yeah.

155
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.000
<v 0>Well that's easy to avoid it's for the guides. There's no physical threat.</v>

156
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.710
<v 1>There's never a physical threat from the guy. I feel like, well, I got my crabs.</v>

157
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:03.800
Like, and you could end it anytime you want. It's not the same stuff.

158
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:09.020
<v 0>I mean, unless you're like really a mess and you know,</v>

159
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.710
you're just vulnerable psychologically, physically, all the above.

160
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.440
<v 1>Yeah. You're an aberration. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I don't know how to correct it,</v>

161
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.190
but like.

162
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.040
<v 0>We're lucky we don't have to work with people all day, man,</v>

163
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.930
beat people in a office environment that are working around people all

164
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:31.910
day and people have some weird. And then you go to the company, Christmas party,

165
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.110
and some guy who works with your wife says some creepy to you. Cause you know,

166
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:40.550
he's been like, he's been coveting your wife behind your back. And you know,

167
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:44.690
he wants her and you know, he's, he talks about you to her.

168
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:48.170
And she tells you, and that kind of is so normal, man,

169
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.220
because you think about how many hours are in a day. You have 24 hours in a day.

170
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:55.620
Eight of them you're sleeping. Okay. So w how much time is commuting?

171
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.590
How much time has work most of your day is at work.

172
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.370
So your life is not with your spouse. You might not hook up with them,

173
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:04.230
but you're interacting with them. And then.

174
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.320
<v 1>Yeah. But do you think with people sometimes talk about me too going too far,</v>

175
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:13.680
but let's talk about for a second, like me too going the right level,

176
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.950
do you think, and we don't work in an office job, so we're just guessing, right?

177
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.650
You think sexual harassments are down now. Okay.

178
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.520
<v 0>I think men who are creeps are probably a little more.</v>

179
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.120
<v 1>Cautious.</v>

180
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.890
I remember after them and see a video people all over open mics were calling

181
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:33.270
each other out on it. Yeah. And then occasionally it was a question of,

182
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:35.460
it went too far. We were like, you stole that joke from him. It's like, dude,

183
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:37.470
we both talked about the same movie. Right.

184
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.070
You're trying to write me off my whole career off because I talked about, uh,

185
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.370
you know, whatever dances with wolves. And so were you,

186
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:46.770
but your thing was about the native Americans. Your thing was about the

187
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.950
co you know, the, the dog they had.

188
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.400
And so I'm sure it went too far here or there, but it was nice where it, like,

189
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.520
it was no longer acceptable to steal jokes. Yes.

190
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.580
And it wasn't just something we're going to tolerate. Right.

191
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.650
It's gotta be like that too. With this me too stuff.

192
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.540
It's no longer acceptable that patent.

193
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.720
And you can be like bored or just wanting to an everyone else.

194
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.220
Even the guy's like, dude. No.

195
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.330
<v 0>I couldn't imagine being a man where rather the opposite.</v>

196
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.680
I couldn't imagine being a woman,

197
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.750
working for a man who wanted to me and me getting a,

198
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:19.471
raise,

199
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:24.270
me getting some sort of a upward movement in my career as dependent

200
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:28.110
upon this person, making a decision. And this person's always trying to me. Oh,

201
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.310
that'd be disgusting.

202
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.830
And that's what a lot of women have to deal with all day long.

203
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.780
And that's only one step of it. How about the bill Cosby step? How about you?

204
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.010
Can't leave your drink alone. You can't leave your drink.

205
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:44.220
That's a reality with a lot of women. That's not a reality with you or me,

206
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.930
but always trying to rape us. I mean,

207
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:51.060
there's a lot of that women have to think about that.

208
00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:54.690
We don't have to think about a lot, many, many, many, many, many, many men.

209
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.720
<v 1>Yeah. It is interesting. This now is all coming up. Like what,</v>

210
00:10:57.721 --> 00:11:01.740
how many of you had something. It's worse than I thought a of it too.

211
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.680
Cause like, you just want to believe the best in the world and people.

212
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.700
And so when you're like this, you're like, no, that can't happen that much.

213
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.520
It's not like, you're the problem. You're not doing it.

214
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.340
You just don't want to believe. That's so removed.

215
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.970
Probably some kid can get chopped up by some, you know, some monster, right?

216
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.240
Like, no, right. Yeah. We're removed from, we don't see it as much.

217
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:22.530
It's not directed us. Right.

218
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.220
<v 0>I live in up worlds, man. Our world is everybody smokes pot.</v>

219
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.220
Almost everybody drinks. You know, everybody's a deviant.

220
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.060
Everybody is impossible for them to have a regular job.

221
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.880
Every single one of us that's successful as a comic.

222
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.800
It's virtually impossible for any of us to have ever existed in an

223
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:44.640
office environment and survived. Yeah. We're too up,

224
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.060
but we're perfect for comedy. You know what I mean? So like us,

225
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.750
us talking about office politics and office environments.

226
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:53.770
<v 1>Idea. Really.</v>

227
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.130
<v 0>What it is. That's why I think it's funny when people say like talking about,</v>

228
00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:00.190
I don't know, Louis or something where it's like, it was a comedy festival.

229
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:02.500
So it was, it was at their job and it's like, oh no, no, no, not,

230
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:06.640
you just don't understand what comedy is. Safety issue. If it was a workplace,

231
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.380
then, then, then you would have to say like, by the way,

232
00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:10.420
actually do people do Coke at the workplace.

233
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.200
We're no job people actually consensually during work. Yeah,

234
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.120
because that happens to a lot of pot smoking at our workplace.

235
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.650
<v 1>It's not, it's not.</v>

236
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.650
<v 0>It's not workplace has a designated pot-smoking place.</v>

237
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.330
And now where are we are here.

238
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.620
<v 1>In the green room? You can't with anybody, but you can, you can smoke. Yeah.</v>

239
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.570
It's not a, it's not a workplace.

240
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:33.100
<v 0>It's not, well, it's.</v>

241
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.890
<v 1>Just, you should still have the rights to safety, but it ain't a workplace.</v>

242
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.490
<v 0>Well, and you should, it's all like, here's the thing.</v>

243
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.440
Like say if you're Tom and Christina, you're married together.

244
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.270
Yeah. You could in the green room,

245
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.410
lock the door and who's going to stop you so you could at the workplace. Yeah.

246
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.930
Yeah. You could. That's not an issue.

247
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.320
<v 1>That people the Greenville all the time, this girl's coming in, but you can't.</v>

248
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.610
<v 0>If you know,</v>

249
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:01.210
you're the manager and she's a secretary and you pull her into your office,

250
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:04.210
you get fired for that. Even if it's your wife, you're not allowed to do that.

251
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.260
<v 1>Real work. You can't at work. at work. When we're kids, fans, I got fired.</v>

252
00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:11.380
He goes, is that not allowed? What did he do at work? the mate.

253
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.680
And then they were like, we caught you on camera. He goes, oh, well I did.

254
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.170
Was that a problem? I didn't realize trying to lie his way out of it.
