00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 1>Experience. Thanks for inviting me. This is awesome. I I've.</v>

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.960
<v 0>Seen a bunch of videos online of you talking about space and your, your,</v>

4
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.440
your dream of being an astronaut as a young man. And what,

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.680
what is it like just to see the earth from above and to be you lived up

6
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:19.200
there for like what, 95 days.

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.070
<v 1>95 Days, which actually is kind of a bummer, to be honest with you because, uh,</v>

8
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.030
you know, this, if you saw that video maybe, but yeah, the thing is,

9
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.230
if you stay for a hundred days, they give you a patch. Right?

10
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.630
And I I'm a day 95 and the space shuttle discovery shows up to bring me home.

11
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.270
And Mark Kelly was a commander. He goes, Garrett,

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.700
it's time to hop in and come home. And I'm like, man,

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.020
I just need five more days. &lt;laugh&gt; to.

14
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.180
<v 0>Get that patch. Can't.</v>

15
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.820
<v 1>We just like go around a few more times or something and it'll work.</v>

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.660
<v 0>It seems like 95 days should be enough, man. Give them man a patch. Right.</v>

17
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.500
<v 1>Right. You know, how much does a patch cost? What's the.</v>

18
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.660
<v 0>Longest anybody stayed up there?</v>

19
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.250
<v 1>The longest, um, for an American was Scott Kelly's, uh,</v>

20
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.210
nearly a year in spaces, longest, uh, in, in, in a row basically. Uh,

21
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:10.130
but it is a Russian, uh, that stayed up there for longer than a year.

22
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:11.250
And he has the all time record.

23
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.850
<v 0>How, and, and they, when they come back, like what,</v>

24
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:16.530
what is 90 days like coming back?

25
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:19.770
Because I've talked to people who've gone there when they come back,

26
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.240
their balance is all off. The equiliums all.

27
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.360
<v 1>Screwing. You're kind of, it is,</v>

28
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.920
you're kind of messed up and in your vestibular system is what's affected the

29
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:33.800
most, at least that's what's most noticeable when you first get back. Um,

30
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.560
actually the first thing I noticed, let me back up is, uh,

31
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.640
how heavy things were again, you know,

32
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.840
so like I took off my helmet and I was holding it in my hand.

33
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.390
And if felt like I was holding the anchor to the USS nimittz, you know, &lt;laugh&gt;,

34
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.870
it's like, I'm like, how am I ever gonna brush my teeth?

35
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.310
It'd be like too arduous. You know, does.

36
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.230
<v 0>Your body severely weaken in 95 days? Well.</v>

37
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.070
<v 1>Back in the day, back when I was going there. So that mission, my,</v>

38
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.190
my long term mission was back in, uh, 2008.

39
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.940
And back then we were still losing bone and muscle mass. Uh,

40
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.100
as we're going up there along about, you lost about 1% of bone every month.

41
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.460
So that was about 3% low. They don't anymore. They don't anymore.

42
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.860
Cause we found out we,

43
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.940
we came up with better countermeasures to prevent that what are the

44
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:20.700
countermeasures it's basically working out. Oh, uh,

45
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.300
and it's resistive exercise that, that does it for you,

46
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.650
which we knew back when I was going. But the problem was we had a, a, uh,

47
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.810
we had this machine that was kind of a, um,

48
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.890
a first generation of the workout machine. And it could do large reps, but,

49
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.410
but low load. So you're doing like a lot of reps at, at, at low weight.

50
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.050
And, and that helped. But, but what helps it turns out we didn't,

51
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.880
we found this out could kinded by happenstance, but it turns out that high load,

52
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.440
low reps works much better. Mm.

53
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.320
And so we got this new machine that you could really crank it up to 11.

54
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.160
And the guys now that are,

55
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.520
that are working out on that thing are coming home with no muscle muscle or,

56
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.320
or bone loss at.

57
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.120
<v 0>All. Wow. That's that's.</v>

58
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.520
<v 1>Because who, who what's the Canadian gentleman that we had on Chris Hatfield?</v>

59
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.520
Yes. Chris Hatfield. When, when commander Hatfield came back, he,

60
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.600
I believe he said it took him a whole year to recover. Yeah. I mean,

61
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:15.320
that was still like in the early, still kind of in the early days. So he, he,

62
00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:16.920
I don't know which machine he used.

63
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.830
He probably did use a new one &lt;affirmative&gt; but overall it does take to get

64
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:23.150
everything back to get your full vestibular system back.

65
00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:25.230
Your sense of balance to get your, all your bone,

66
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.390
all your muscle back to baseline. It took me a year to get all that back too.

67
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.830
Wow. It's kind of like rehabbing from a major sports injury.

68
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.590
<v 0>That's gotta be so strange that your,</v>

69
00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:40.260
your body just wants to shriivevel up when you're up there because there's no

70
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:41.094
gravity.

71
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.940
<v 1>Yeah. It's really interesting. Cuz you're, it's, it's an adaptation and the,</v>

72
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:48.580
and the body is, is incredible. So what it's doing is it's realizing, Hey,

73
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.780
you know, I don't have to carry my own weight anymore.

74
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.620
&lt;laugh&gt; so why do I need this big bulky skeleton? Oh wow. It's like,

75
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:59.020
you're becoming kind of like a fish where you're, you're just,

76
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:03.210
you're shedding all the bone density, uh, because you don't have to your,

77
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:06.170
your body realizes I don't need it. I it's like a, it's like a fish and water,

78
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:08.410
you know, that have fish have very slender bones. Yeah.

79
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.490
<v 0>So that's an interesting way to look at it. Like a fish. Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.610
<v 1>Wow. And we fight it by working out.</v>

81
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.530
<v 0>And how often do you have to work out every day? Every day. Every day.</v>

82
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.770
How often? Like how much time they theyschedule.

83
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.240
<v 1>Hours? No, you're not on the machine for two hours. So that's also prepping,</v>

84
00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:27.320
you know, you getting changed and uh, you know, clean it up afterwards. But um,

85
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.960
so you're working a good hour every day. What is.

86
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.040
<v 0>It like a sweat and space.</v>

87
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.640
<v 1>It's weird because &lt;laugh&gt;, cause what happens is, uh,</v>

88
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.440
if you don't notice if like in the beginning you don't even realize it,

89
00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:42.670
but it's all building up &lt;affirmative&gt; and even without like, if,

90
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:44.030
if you have no hair to soak it up,

91
00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:46.990
it just builds up like this thin film of water on your head,

92
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.870
like a coating of water. Oh.

93
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.070
And you don't even notice it cause it doesn't run down and then,

94
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:54.670
and then somebody calls your name and you're like, yeah. And then psh.

95
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.870
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; it's like, &lt;laugh&gt; oh, that's crazy. I never even thought of that.</v>

96
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.700
So it just kind of floats off your yeah.

97
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.580
<v 1>It's like a dog shaking itself, you know? And it just goes everywhere and.</v>

98
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.300
<v 0>It's so if you have it on your arm, you can kind of just go sh and the, the,</v>

99
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.540
the sweat' will go flying.

100
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.580
<v 1>You know, your crewmates won't be too happy with you. You can do this a lot,</v>

101
00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:12.360
but yeah.

102
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.100
<v 0>Wow. Oh, that's is there video of people doing that in space? There's.</v>

103
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.140
<v 1>Gotta be, there should be, we we've shot so much video.</v>

104
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.660
Somebody's gotta have done that, but.

105
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.330
<v 0>So are you basically doing like compound movements,</v>

106
00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:25.570
like dead lifts and squats and things along those lines?

107
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.610
<v 1>Yeah. Functional fitness kind of stuff. Uh, where, um, but,</v>

108
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.170
and you're focusing on certain areas.

109
00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:34.610
So the bone loss comes mostly from your legs. Oh. Because you're not loading.

110
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.770
So, so basically our bones, um, need a stimulus, uh, uh,

111
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.330
to regenerate and it happens to us every day.

112
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.600
So you walk as you go upstairs that load, that the bones feel,

113
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:49.160
the compressive load is telling the bone, Hey, make some more, mm.

114
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.760
Now you take that away. And the bone stops making more. And that's the problem.

115
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.240
People say like, can't you just like, like calcium pills, but it's not a,

116
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.720
a mineral deficiency. It's just a load. It's no load.

117
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.000
<v 0>That's interesting that the body adapts so quickly. Yeah. That 90 days has such.</v>

118
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.360
And if you didn't do anything for 90 days at all, you'd be in real trouble.

119
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.680
<v 1>Right? Yeah. That's, what's really kind of freaky is thinking about like, well,</v>

120
00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:13.280
what if we don't fight this?

121
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.400
Because all these adaptations should go through are not,

122
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.270
not a problem when you're in space. It's only a problem.

123
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.470
If you want to come home. Right. Right. Losing that bone. Um,

124
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.710
even like not using your vestibular organs anymore, your semicircular canals,

125
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:31.310
your odolith organs, you're not making use of those for your balance.

126
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:32.550
You're just going, purely on the visual.

127
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.190
What that does initially is to make you kind of sick. You get kind of,

128
00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:40.420
it's like being air sick or seasick, but once your body adapts, you're fine.

129
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.580
So the question is like, what would we become if we didn't fight it?

130
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.700
What if we just went with it and stayed up? There'd feel like a water.

131
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.420
<v 0>Balloon. &lt;laugh&gt; what would you become? Right.</v>

132
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.900
<v 1>You'd become actually the, the place I think in science fiction,</v>

133
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:57.810
that gets it the most. Correct. Is if you watch the, the band,

134
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.023
you ever watch that show.

135
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.090
<v 0>No, I heard it's a really good show. I never got into.</v>

136
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.250
<v 1>It though. It's good. And, and, and they get it right?</v>

137
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:05.970
Because they show people like these belters that live in partial gravity,

138
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.010
like their whole lives. And they have much, Slen more slender bones. Oh.

139
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.450
And like, they catch this like terrorist guy and they want to torture him.

140
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.890
And all they do is they make 'em stand up in gravity and on earth.

141
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.840
And at it's incredibly painful for him. And I'm like, oh, wow. Yeah,

142
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.280
that would probably be.

143
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.280
<v 0>What would happen. And it must take a long time to get everything back.</v>

144
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.240
If you went from earth gravity to the space station and you lived up

145
00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:34.200
there for a year and didn't do anything about it and then came back to earth.

146
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.600
I mean, you'd basically be like, it would be hard to crawl, right? Yeah.

147
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.630
<v 1>You, you would, your, your, um, all, all your, if you don't try to fight it,</v>

148
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.790
um, you, you, you,

149
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:47.350
the vestibular stuff would come back probably about the same rate,

150
00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:50.430
but you would be really hurting with your muscle atrophy and your bone.

151
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:51.231
So you would,

152
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:53.950
you would lose a lot of your skeleton if you're up there for a year and did

153
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:57.950
nothing. And you would also your, your, all your muscles that you don't use,

154
00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:01.300
like in your legs and your postal muscles. So in your lower back,

155
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.420
you're not using those anymore.

156
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.780
So they would just like waste a weight to nothing. You'd be okay in your arms,

157
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.460
cuz you're doing everything. You're everything you do is with your arms.

158
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:13.260
That's how you move. That's how you get around is by pulling and pushing.

159
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.220
But you don't, you don't, there's no walk in. There's no stairs.

160
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:17.860
There's nothing. Does it affect.

161
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.940
<v 0>The way you think at all?</v>

162
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.570
<v 1>You know, some, some people describe a, a kind of a,</v>

163
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.450
an issue with short term memory, they call it like spacebra &lt;laugh&gt; and.

164
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.371
<v 0>Boy,</v>

165
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:31.250
is that a small group of people that would understand what you're talking about

166
00:08:31.251 --> 00:08:34.610
there? Oh, I got space brain, bro. I got that too. Oh yeah.

167
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.440
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; so it it's, uh, something that, um, I,</v>

168
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.160
I never really noticed it, but um,

169
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.600
I don't know how much of that is real and how much results, like,

170
00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:47.640
like you're freaking out cuz you're in space. Right.

171
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.960
So it's distracting and maybe you forget like what that number was you' were

172
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.960
supposed to remember, but mm. You know,

173
00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:55.800
like if you're really in the middle of something and,

174
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.440
and you're all excited and, or, uh, and, and,

175
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.200
and you kind of can't remember somebody's phone number. It's kind of like,

176
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.640
kind of like that. Oh, okay.

177
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.160
<v 0>So it's just, well, I would imagine that just being up there,</v>

178
00:09:06.161 --> 00:09:09.760
breathing that recirculted, air's gotta be odd, right?

179
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.960
<v 1>Yeah. And it might stink,</v>

180
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.630
but I don't know because the other thing that happens is you have this big fluid

181
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.473
shift.

182
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:22.550
So right now we have a lot of blood pulling up in our legs and our,

183
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.430
our heart it's most important job of course,

184
00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:27.430
is to feed the brain oxygenated blood.

185
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.870
And then when you take the gravity vector out of the picture,

186
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.950
the heart sends too much up to the brain and the stuff doesn't collect the,

187
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.940
in our legs anymore.

188
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.180
And it all shoots up here and you get the shift of all that blood volume to your

189
00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:43.820
upper body and your head gets all puffed up. Whoa. Yeah. Like my,

190
00:09:43.821 --> 00:09:46.820
so my first night in space, I, I, uh, went to sleep,

191
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.260
which was kind of hard to do, cuz you're in space.

192
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.100
You don't want to go to sleep. Right. Yeah. Um, and on that first night,

193
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.970
um, I, I woke up in the middle of the night and I could have sworn,

194
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.970
I was standing on my head doing a headstand or a handstand. I'm like,

195
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.530
why am I up standing on my head in my sleep? This is strange. Right.

196
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.370
And then I looked out the window, I saw the earth and I'm like, oh,

197
00:10:09.371 --> 00:10:11.370
that's right. I'm in space. &lt;laugh&gt; like.

198
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.410
<v 0>So all the blood was just kind of pooling in your head. Yeah.</v>

199
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.480
As if you were like hanging by gravity boots or.

200
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.280
<v 1>Something, it, it feels exactly like that. Wow. And then after a day or two,</v>

201
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.920
you get used to it and it doesn't bother you anymore,

202
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.040
but you feel congested cuz you still have all this volume up here.

203
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.080
So your sense of smell and your sense of taste are all deaded. Oh wow.

204
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.560
It's kind of like, yeah. So it's kind of like when you have a cold and you,

205
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.390
and your sense of own, your sense of taste are like not as strong.

206
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.950
So it's like that all the time. That's why we take, we, we cover,

207
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.990
we have every hot sauce known to, to humankind up on the space station.

208
00:10:46.991 --> 00:10:49.710
Oh really? Like sracha we got, uh, you know,

209
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.870
Louisiana can fire sauce and all, whatever.

210
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.300
We got like a whole stockpile of it because you, you pour that on every thing.

211
00:10:57.301 --> 00:11:01.180
So you can get some taste cuz otherwise everything tastes really bland. Oh wow.

212
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:01.620
Now.

213
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.500
<v 0>What are you eating up.</v>

214
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.220
<v 1>There? Oh, it's terrible. &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

215
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.100
<v 0>Is it freeze? Drieded foods mostly.</v>

216
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.500
<v 1>Or Mo yeah. You don't go for the food. All right.</v>

217
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:15.460
There's not like a foody holiday. &lt;laugh&gt; you know, it's like, uh,

218
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.610
so you get basically two choices. You have the American food,

219
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.490
which is essentially mrres like military freeze dried or radiated, uh,

220
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.970
you know, infinite shelf, life kind of stuff. And uh,

221
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.290
and then the Russian food is also based on their militaryrations,

222
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:35.210
but from submarines and the, and the Russian food actually tastes better.

223
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.640
But the problem is one of, because it comes in cans.

224
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.760
So you get these, these cans. And even though it tastes good,

225
00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:47.160
you open that can up and you look at it and it's like, God,

226
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:48.040
it looks like dog food.

227
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.480
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; there's like congealed and yeah, but it tastes better taste. It,</v>

228
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.080
it tastes.

229
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.360
<v 1>Better. Uh, but it's just like, so unappetizing,</v>

230
00:11:57.361 --> 00:12:01.120
when you open that can up and you know, it's just not.

231
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.800
<v 0>Does what, what would happen if you brought fresh things up there, would they,</v>

232
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.360
would they rot at the same rate that they would rot in America?

233
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.230
<v 1>Yeah. The only the thing is, um, we have no refrigeration. Oh we didn't.</v>

234
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:16.470
When I was there, they actually have a small refrigerator now.

235
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.550
So you can't have anything that, that needs to be refrigerated,

236
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.510
but you would usually like for the first couple days we'd take a bag of fresh

237
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.430
food and we took like sandwiches and, and, and uh,

238
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:29.510
fruits and vegetables and stuff. And then,

239
00:12:29.511 --> 00:12:31.430
cause that's the last time you're gonna have it. After that,

240
00:12:31.431 --> 00:12:34.220
it's all gonna be this, this stuff. And the pack it's that you add water to.
