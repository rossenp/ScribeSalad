00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.120
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. We took a break for off the road for four years.</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.920
And when we came back three years after a break to make a record,

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.360
it was like we had gain, we, we had gleaned a lot of ex of perspective,

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.881
you know,

5
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.480
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and our conversations when we first started making this

6
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:20.000
record aside from like, uh,

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.630
watching the news and talking about that and laugh, making each other laugh and,

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.470
it was like, this band is something really special.

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.270
You know what I mean? The fact that we are sitting in this room, you know,

10
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.190
18 years after,

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.110
after starting this band and it working out and we're here,

12
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.580
we need to make sure that this band is always something that's fun and not a

13
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:48.980
burden and not stressful as little. It shouldn't be stressful. It should be fun.

14
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.220
It's rock and roll. You know what I mean? Yeah.

15
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.100
And I think that we've been spending the last year figuring out to make how to

16
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:59.980
make every decision. So that, that way, you know, so like first this show,

17
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.490
we were like, do you wanna do TV show this TV show? Like, no, we want do we,

18
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:06.690
we wanted to, I, we both watched Joe Rogan, listen to Joe Rogan. I,

19
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.010
I happened to watch it. Um,

20
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.090
what we wanna do Joe's podcast, you know what I mean? That's what we wanna do.

21
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.730
That's what's important to us. We don't wanna play Woodstock.

22
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.490
It's not important to us. It doesn't speak to us.

23
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.130
These are the things we wanna do.

24
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.040
And taking that type of position with the band and also looking at the,

25
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.000
the business side of it and being like, this is. This is ridiculous. You know,

26
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.120
what, what, what, what,

27
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.040
what this band should be giving to us is the ability to help other bands,

28
00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:38.520
which is what we do all day long when we're not touring. I mean,

29
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:43.510
in the last five years, Dan's produce probably like 15 albums.

30
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.630
Uh, for other artists, I've done a handful of myself. He has a label,

31
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.830
puts out other people's music. There's a lot of work EV when we're not touring,

32
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:53.910
we're still working on other music.

33
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.710
And the craziest thing is this we've sold millions of records.

34
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.980
We've made between the two of us, something like 60 per plus albums.

35
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.970
When I'm finished a record, I'm really proud of.

36
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.130
And I sent it to Warner brothers. The last time I did that,

37
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:13.450
they didn't even respond to the email.

38
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.650
And when that, when that happens to you, you know what you want to do,

39
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.370
tell 'em to themselves. You know what I mean?

40
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.560
And right now we're in a situation where our record kind track's done, you know?

41
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.600
And I saw what happened to my uncle. Ralph, do you need a contract now, no, no,

42
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.040
it doesn't seem like you do. But what we need is we need, we need people to,

43
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.400
to work with people who understand that the black keys is,

44
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.880
is very important to us,

45
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.920
but it's also a vehicle that we can leverage to help our other artists when

46
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:43.754
we're producing.

47
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.510
And it's so infuriating to have been in this business

48
00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:54.190
for 20 years and honestly understand the business better than most managers

49
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.070
and be treated like dog by this person that you've made millions of dollars for.

50
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.080
Do you know what I mean? Well, it doesn't make any.

51
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.760
<v 1>Sense that you need anything like that.</v>

52
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.280
All you need guys need to do is have studio fees.

53
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.040
Or if you have your own studio produce the music and then once people know your

54
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.400
is out. No, but.

55
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.560
<v 0>It's different because check it's different. We don't need.</v>

56
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.480
But if you take a new artist from Nashville, you say,

57
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.830
and you make a record for them, okay, okay. You, they need an agent. They need,

58
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.350
they, they need, they need, they need to go on tour. Right?

59
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.870
They need to do all the stuff that we did. But we, we were like, malnourished,

60
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.430
freaks. Right? Course we were, we were like losing money.

61
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.070
The whole time we were able to lose money because our, our, our,

62
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.950
my rent was $145. We started and we practiced in my basement and they,

63
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.780
and lived in his parents' house. We didn't have, we could,

64
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.300
we could make like $200 a month and be in the red or in the black. Wow.

65
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.460
&lt;laugh&gt; so, but no, no one else is like, that's not realistic. No. You know,

66
00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:53.340
so if you really wanna, well, here's, what's real if you wanna start,

67
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:57.940
but if you wanna help, but why isn't it realistic? I mean, it's realistic.

68
00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.420
Why is it more realistic?

69
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.730
Go get in $60,000 worth of debt and not be able to get a job. Well,

70
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.010
I'm just saying that most bands, aren't two pieces.

71
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.650
Most bands aren't like right. Human cockroaches.

72
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:13.690
Like &lt;laugh&gt; when we first started, Dan was like, Dan's like,

73
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.730
I need wton soup every day. That's what I need.

74
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.210
It's that's I need $3 and 50 cents. We go get a wton soup.

75
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.680
I needed a pack cigarettes. Wow. But yeah, you know,

76
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:24.200
so you do need some finance, but.

77
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.600
<v 1>Listen, you, you, you have the answer right in front of you.</v>

78
00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:27.800
You're a great talker.

79
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.160
If you just developed a podcast where you played new music and then talk

80
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.400
the way you do now, it would be gigantic. Maybe I, if you just go on the road,

81
00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:40.400
just do pat and Dan, you could call it pat and Dan on the,

82
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.630
and you guys just do it from your tour bus or wherever you just let him wind him

83
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:48.510
up, let him talk about things and then play music,

84
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.830
like music that you really enjoy. If someone like Spotify,

85
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.430
wouldn't jump on something like that. They'd be crazy. It's a great idea.

86
00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.030
And you could use it as a platform to help artists avoid the system entirely.

87
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.710
I'm.

88
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.340
<v 0>Thinking that might work, but also it would work. Man. If,</v>

89
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.060
if we just tweeted mark Zuckerberg,

90
00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:09.180
that we need 145 million &lt;laugh&gt; he'd probably do it.

91
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.820
<v 1>Probably do it. It seems like a good deal.</v>

92
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.060
If someone wanted to do something like that,

93
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.180
it's a great idea because you can use it to launch like,

94
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.740
like I've done with comics on this podcast. You find people that are funny.

95
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.970
Let it's not hard. Get a, get a group of people that are really interesting.

96
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.410
Keep the conversations going, keep more cool people coming in,

97
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.810
and then you can use that to help other cool people and let everybody know you

98
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:36.210
could do it through your social media. You do it through a podcast.

99
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.330
And of course you,

100
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.490
you guys are still gonna do the same stuff you're already doing with producing

101
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:42.480
people and them out,

102
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.320
but you definitely could have your own distribution network,

103
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.480
but be ethical free or ethical. Quandri's free.

104
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:52.160
Like you don't have to think about it. You just give it to him for free.

105
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.320
You just do it as a podcast to broadcast him, Hey, check out this band.

106
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.640
I love this. I love this song. Play it. Bam. Would, that would help.

107
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.680
<v 0>A lot with like exposure to new new music. Yeah. But I mean, I, I think,</v>

108
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.120
I guess what I'm saying is, uh.

109
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.320
<v 1>They're gonna need an agent into bookshels. Well.</v>

110
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.000
<v 0>Yeah, but I'm saying, but I do think it is what I'm saying. The music industry,</v>

111
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.070
what is actually, what, something that I think that, um,

112
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.710
I think we're trying to figure out now is basically how to actually really work

113
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.350
again, truly independently. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm,

114
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.630
&lt;affirmative&gt; where it is something that we can figure out a way to actually do

115
00:06:30.631 --> 00:06:34.670
the things we're passionate about, which is a lot of it is making records and,

116
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.740
and, and how, how opening, uh, and to even to make a record and impress it.

117
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.900
Cause, you know, it's like, it's at least 10, $10,000, you know what I mean?

118
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:45.820
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so I guess what I was trying to say was like,

119
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.180
you'd expect that someone would look at your work and respect it enough to kind

120
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:51.140
of step in and help out,

121
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:53.860
cuz it's not like you're asking for millions of dollars a year to,

122
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.050
to finance some you're asking for like a couple hundred grand. Um,

123
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.170
but that's the problem with the music industry is that,

124
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.090
so is that certain labels are, are willing to give like,

125
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.770
uh, a SoundCloud rapper, like 15 million, you know,

126
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.730
but then they look at a band and they can't quantify their metrics.

127
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.160
Like maybe the black keys or, or who ever. And they, they don't give us.

128
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.560
<v 1>That I well, help me out with this. Cause I don't understand it.</v>

129
00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:26.240
What do they provide? What, what, what is a record company.

130
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.440
<v 0>At provide at this point, at this point to us, uh, physical distribution,</v>

131
00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:30.800
which is something that we.

132
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.880
<v 1>Physical distribution of, of like of.</v>

133
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.713
<v 0>Vinyl LP.</v>

134
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.640
<v 1>Right? That's crazy though. How much is that? Yeah.</v>

135
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.310
<v 0>But I mean, rape, there are a lot of people buying though. No, no, no. I mean,</v>

136
00:07:39.311 --> 00:07:42.510
for us really, it, it isn't, it isn't tons. OR's some marketing,

137
00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:45.670
there's some stuff like that. But honestly, I mean, we,

138
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.910
we get more from like a live nation, probably mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

139
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.510
<v 1>You know what I mean? So they, what does a record company do then?</v>

140
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:55.830
Like if you're a young artist, they get you, do, they scare.

141
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.910
<v 0>You distributed, do they scare you? You,</v>

142
00:07:56.911 --> 00:07:59.740
they scare you into handing over the that they need.

143
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.580
<v 1>And then they sign you to a long term contract. Is that how it works?</v>

144
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.620
And then they pray, you have a hit, they pray, you have a hit.

145
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.540
And if you do and you wanna leave, then you're.

146
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.660
<v 0>And then if you don't, they, if they don't think so, and they think they,</v>

147
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:14.260
you wanna leave and you got two records left,

148
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:17.620
they shove that record until you go with another one. Yeah. That's what they do.

149
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.810
<v 1>It just doesn't seem, dude, we had this guy, it's a legacy.</v>

150
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.290
<v 0>Check, check this out.</v>

151
00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:24.450
We had this dude who was president of a label at one point,

152
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.010
it got back to me that he was taking credit for our success.

153
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.130
He wasn't even around when we broke, you know what I mean?

154
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.130
And the credit he was taking was the most genius credit. This is how,

155
00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:39.410
this is how smart these people are, is like he said, yeah, man. You know,

156
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:43.400
I think I really, I really take a lot of pride in that band, uh,

157
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.560
and really help them a lot by just staying outta the way. Ooh.

158
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:52.480
He didn't even write a check for, uh, tour support or no promotion.

159
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.840
He's taking credit cuz he was smart enough not to it up. &lt;laugh&gt; know. I mean,

160
00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:59.160
it's like I take personal credit,

161
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:03.160
like at bojangs chicken for them being successful or, or the new, uh, the new,

162
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.680
uh, the new, uh, Popeye's chicken sandwich. I take a lot of new,

163
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.560
I think a lot of credit.

164
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.360
I take a lot of credit though in that chicken sandwich man,

165
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:12.680
because I didn't buy one. I didn't it up. I didn't like put the wrong post up,

166
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.160
but.

167
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.550
<v 1>That's a way better attitude of least a working attitude.</v>

168
00:09:15.551 --> 00:09:17.630
Then the guy from Pepperton who wants to with a high hat.

169
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.550
&lt;laugh&gt; wouldn't you prefer that guy who just gets the outta of the way.

170
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.470
I would say I'll take that guy off all day long. I.

171
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.510
<v 0>If those are the two options then yeah, yeah. Absolutelyely all.</v>

172
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.870
<v 1>Day. I would say. I mean, is he taking credit for it or is he just,</v>

173
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.590
he's kind of bragging that he works with you.

174
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.710
He can't be taking credit for that. There's a little credit,

175
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.430
but I think a little bit of credit, a little bit of credit,

176
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.463
a little annoying to you.

177
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.860
<v 0>Dude. There's a lot of credit that gets taken for a lot of. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

178
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.500
<v 1>Dude, it seems like a frustrating and infuriating business and I' glad,</v>

179
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.180
I'm glad I don't have to participate in &lt;laugh&gt; to as comics.

180
00:09:46.181 --> 00:09:47.540
There's no business. We, we.

181
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.460
<v 0>We've like, we're like in the top 0.0, zero,</v>

182
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.860
1% of this and still annoying every single day.

183
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.850
It's like it's the, the trick to the music industry is to,

184
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.930
is to it's because if you really love music,

185
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.610
like the way that Dan and I do where it is,

186
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.210
the Mo still the thing that we're most passionate about, you know what I mean?

187
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:09.810
Like I love music. I only think about music,

188
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.290
listen to it all day,

189
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.930
but yet you have to find that fine line where like you don't win.

190
00:10:14.931 --> 00:10:18.120
Like you make a record that you're really proud of and no one hears it.

191
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.880
And no one that works with you even responds to an email about it.

192
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.360
You have to find that space where you don't want to kill everybody.

193
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.400
You know what I mean? And you still wanna go make another record and.

194
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.720
<v 1>Do you need to be connected to someone like this though? Does this,</v>

195
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.360
is this a valuable thing in your world?

196
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.470
What to have this record company? No, no. I mean, no, no, not right.

197
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.150
So you can let all this go right? And don't do it anymore.

198
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.190
<v 0>No, the trick is to find,</v>

199
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.790
to find out how to still learn learning as the industry changes is to learn how

200
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:49.630
to pivot and make it, make it have' it make sense?

201
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.110
<v 1>So the real problem is young talent. That's just getting started.</v>

202
00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.630
That gets signed when they don't really know they're worth yet.

203
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.660
And they don't know how the prob the.

204
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.380
<v 0>Problem is is that no one is investing in real bands.</v>

205
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:03.380
They're investing in like a songwriter.

206
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.620
They're investing in an artist that they, that was a puppet that like,

207
00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:09.780
they can go and like, say this, person's gonna listen to this. Right? Do this.

208
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.060
It's like a pop machine. You know what.

209
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.940
<v 1>I do you think that you could do it ethically that you could do it your way?</v>

210
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.970
Look, I, I think, but you do you have the time for something like that? If.

211
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.170
<v 0>I was to run a record label,</v>

212
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.850
the main difference would be that I would look at it as I let's try to

213
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:25.531
break.

214
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:30.530
Even let's realize that some of the most important records here have never

215
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.570
sold a million copies.

216
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.570
Like the Ramones never sold a million copies of any of the records.

217
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.690
There may be the most influential punk band.

218
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.280
So what is let's, let's redefine what success is.

219
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:46.280
Success is getting behind art that we really are proud of and not, and,

220
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.040
and not getting trampled and not,

221
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.280
and getting the support that it needs. This all seems.

222
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.160
<v 1>Doable. Yeah. But then you, what you're.</v>

223
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.880
<v 0>Describing with you seems doable, but then think about this.</v>

224
00:11:56.881 --> 00:11:57.510
This is the problem.

225
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.320
This is the crux is then you think about the Ramones and you realize this is a

226
00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:06.200
band that toured in a van for 20 years. Do you wanna subject a band to that? No.

227
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.400
You want to be able to elevate that band to the point where they're actually

228
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.390
doing that comfortably. You know what I mean? And that's the hard part.

229
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:14.830
You know what I mean? Can you though.

230
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.710
<v 1>I think that, would they be the same band? Not always. Right.</v>

231
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.590
<v 0>I think that you could, yes. It's.</v>

232
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.630
<v 1>Possible depend upon the individual dude. That's why Metallica.</v>

233
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.310
<v 0>Has these therapists band. They're trying to figure out &lt;laugh&gt; how to.</v>

234
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:25.991
<v 1>Figure out.</v>

235
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:29.630
But don't you think that part of what you guys are is your background when you

236
00:12:29.631 --> 00:12:33.420
were paying 125 bucks a month for rent, and you're a, you know,

237
00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:34.380
you were living with your parents.

238
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.340
So this is part of why you guys were so good because you really wanted

239
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.380
it. You needed it. You had to get to a better place. We had no other option.

240
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.140
Yes. But I think there's, somethingmething, that's that, that flavors,

241
00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:46.900
the music.

242
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.700
<v 2>I think that's what we do. And we try to work with people.</v>

243
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.180
We see that same quality in other people.

244
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.090
<v 1>Hmm. So people have already, he been down that road, artists.</v>

245
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.970
<v 2>That I'm working with now, people like Yoola and people like D white and dude,</v>

246
00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:03.330
this really change all these people. They're just ornery and they want it.

247
00:13:03.331 --> 00:13:03.880
You know, this is.

248
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.530
<v 1>Begging for an organization. Like, you're your passion for this? I mean,</v>

249
00:13:07.531 --> 00:13:08.730
we're important. So we're, we're already.

250
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.570
<v 2>Sort of doing.</v>

251
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.403
<v 1>It. We're dude,</v>

252
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.920
you guys should have a radio station or a podcast that just about these,

253
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:18.440
these new albums and what's going on and what you're doing.

254
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.000
And I'm sure people would love it and just play music,

255
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.400
play the music that you guys are producing, play music that you enjoy,

256
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:26.120
that you find out about. I mean,

257
00:13:26.121 --> 00:13:29.040
it seems like there's a real easy fix for this angst.

258
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.840
<v 0>I don't think there is because it's been going on for &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

259
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.750
<v 1>40 Years, but for you, there's a fix, at least there's a better path for some,</v>

260
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:38.570
the, some people.

261
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:42.470
<v 0>The angst is important because it is, uh, it's valid. I'm also,</v>

262
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.470
we're also by the way, not that angsty, but when I do talk about the business,

263
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:48.950
I get a little angsty, but, um, &lt;laugh&gt;, I, I,

264
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.870
I pretty chill individual to be honest, most of the time, but when.

265
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.750
<v 1>I, how many business is so much easier?</v>

266
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.900
<v 0>Well, you know, I mean.</v>

267
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.420
<v 2>We get to, we get to use that in our music.</v>

268
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.340
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure the drive.</v>

269
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.460
<v 0>Is like the thing it's like, you know, I, when I,</v>

270
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.860
I found this photograph that I just hung up in my road case of Dan and I play

271
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:13.100
one of our first shows. I'm like, oh, this is important. I should be,

272
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.130
I should make sure I have this hung up because it just reminds me of all the

273
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.250
days that we spent,

274
00:14:18.251 --> 00:14:23.130
like being miserable in a van because we love music so much.

275
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.690
We go play a show for nobody,

276
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.330
and maybe make enough money to get like a motel six room, share a bed,

277
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.970
get up the next day and go to waffle house &lt;laugh&gt; and keep doing it for you

278
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.400
years and years and years and years. But it does take that type of motivation.

279
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.200
And it's, it's frustrating when you do that.

280
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:47.320
And then you get to a point where it is the point that we're at and you

281
00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:50.840
feel like you've gotten really good at what you do. And, uh,

282
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.880
you help another artist. And it's you realize that like, after all that work,

283
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.400
it's like the mythisyphus it's like, oh, after all that work,

284
00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:03.040
it doesn't move the clock at all. Still these same, aren't,

285
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.040
aren't helping, you know.

286
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.910
<v 3>I.</v>
