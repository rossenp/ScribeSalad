00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um,</v>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.610
has anybody come up with any sort of comprehensive plan or

3
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:13.380
anything that makes sense where they can viably

4
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:15.900
repopulate the ocean? I mean,

5
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:20.520
the idea of stopping and slowing down fishing would be wonderful,

6
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.510
but it's, I mean, if we,

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.520
if it really gets to a point where we've got to somehow

8
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:30.240
or another independently grow these fish and re-introduce them to the wild,

9
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.330
I mean, is there any talk of doing things like that or is it even part.

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.700
<v 1>I think it's impossible. The scale of what's going on right now. Um, you know,</v>

11
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:42.660
when I was in Japan, they were saying that, oh, we used to go out all, you know,

12
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:47.250
we could fill up a boat a day now it's, you know, eight days now we have to,

13
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.670
then we have to go out 30 and we're competing with the, the, you know,

14
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:54.540
the Koreans, the Chinese, the Taiwanese, you know, it's it's and.

15
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.490
<v 0>Everybody's just going gangbusters. And.</v>

16
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.250
<v 1>We ha we were using military gear to, you know,</v>

17
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:03.030
sonar to catch things at this unprecedented rate. It's not sustainable.

18
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.370
I personally don't believe that fishing to feeding this planet

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.870
currently, you can do it with fish. I don't think he can do it with,

20
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.290
you know, and we know what's, you know,

21
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:21.090
that the unethical side of raising, you know, farm animals for this is,

22
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:24.450
it's just, I think we have to transition to another form.

23
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.880
I think there's going to be, you know, 10 or 12 years,

24
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.800
but I think we're headed that direction and people,

25
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.180
I think what you're seeing now is that there's a direction towards trying to

26
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.870
people want to eat healthier. They want to eat sustainable. And I know,

27
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.930
I know you're a hunter. I mean, I was 102. I hunted fish. And, you know,

28
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.940
I understand like when you come back with the goods,

29
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.940
you come back with an animal and you're feeding your family.

30
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.340
You're feeding your friends. You feel like the man, you don't feel like,

31
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:53.270
you know, there's something you tap in. That's really primitive in a, in a,

32
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.610
in a,

33
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.230
in a really genuine way that makes us feel good about who we are that you're

34
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:02.130
providing. And I know that that happened when I was, when I was a fisherman,

35
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.610
you know,

36
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.580
you go hunt a fish with your friends and there's a group thing going on and you

37
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.950
everybody's there. They're enjoying themselves. And it feels wonderful,

38
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.890
but we can't do it with wild fish. And, you know,

39
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.330
with 4% of the biomass being wild animals now, and the rest of it being it's,

40
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:21.090
it's, naissance sustainable. And I wish it was because

41
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.990
that, that there's something we lost with that,

42
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.530
but we have to transition we're at that period right now,

43
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.700
where we have to figure out how do you feed a planet?

44
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.820
<v 0>That's the real problem. Right. And not just, how do you feed a planet?</v>

45
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.930
How do you feed a planet that may double its population the next 50 years?

46
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.980
<v 1>Yeah. Well, it's just total talking 10 billion by 2050.</v>

47
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.040
And we're already at a point where, you know, we're at the.

48
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.400
<v 0>Yeah. So 20 years past out, it might really be double.</v>

49
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:57.990
It might be 15 million or excuse me, billion people. Uh, that's.

50
00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.800
<v 1>Crazy. So, you know.</v>

51
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.940
<v 0>You can have 18 and a half million people in the greater Los Angeles area going</v>

52
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:05.980
out and hunting for their food or fishing, you know,

53
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.820
so what are we going to eat? You know, and I think the, you know, the,

54
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.770
the way to do it is, you know, drifting more towards plants getting, you know,

55
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.820
I was last week, I was in Loma Linda, California, you know where that's at,

56
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.570
you preferred about one of the blue zones and you know,

57
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.480
so it's the people out there that don't might not know about. It's, uh,

58
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.780
Dan Buettner, uh, geographic fellow, um,

59
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.110
popularized the idea that there's these five geographic regions of the planet

60
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:35.590
where people live longer and without chronic disease than any other place in the

61
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:36.250
planet.

62
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.270
So is out there last week at the bar at the brain health and Alzheimer's clinic.

63
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.290
And there's two researches that started when there wasn't one for miles around

64
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.603
and they opened it.

65
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.590
One out of three people in America in the next 10 years are going to be affected

66
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:52.840
by Alzheimer's either they're going to have it, their mates going to have it.

67
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:54.910
There would be taken care of somebody who has it, their parents.

68
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.610
So it's going to overtake heart diseases.

69
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.090
Our number one disease that we have the opened up the brain health clinic there

70
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.260
with an Alzheimer clinic.

71
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.520
And nobody came now about half the population.

72
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:09.340
The seventh day Adventists are vegetarians by religion.

73
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.600
And he go to the grocery store. They don't sell meat. You go to, they have milk,

74
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:15.310
they have cows milk, but it's on the bottom shelf.

75
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:19.030
They just have a few things of it. And they, uh,

76
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.420
to find people initially they had to go to San Bernardino across the road,

77
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.470
across the highway.

78
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:27.040
There there's nothing different geo geologically different between San

79
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:31.120
Bernardino and Loma Linda. It's the right, you know,

80
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:34.270
drinking the same water, breathing the same era, but they have a different diet,

81
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.870
but they're living about 10 years longer than everybody you have on San

82
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:40.780
Bernardino is one of the unhealthiest populations in America.

83
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.780
And on another side of highway Teddy,

84
00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:45.640
you have one of the healthiest populations in the entire world,

85
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.070
and they're living about 10 years on average longer.

86
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.150
They're doing other things too. It's not just diet, it's big factor sleep.

87
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.760
I mean, Dr. Matthew Walker has been on this podcast.

88
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:59.590
Who's a well-renowned sleep scientist was discussing that it's one of

89
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:04.390
the biggest corollary, uh, one of the biggest factors where they've,

90
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.420
uh, determined that the less sleep you have,

91
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:12.220
the higher likelihood you have of Alzheimer's disease. And it's really stark.

92
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.880
Like the numbers are they're, they're, they're pretty undisputable.

93
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.680
<v 1>Yeah. Well, I agree. There was the four principles, you know, the, the,</v>

94
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.120
his eyes, you know, Dean and ISIS assures I sleep is one of them. Yeah.

95
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.840
Whole foods, plant-based diet, um, support, you know,

96
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.580
the community support and, and exercise. Those are the, those are the big ones.

97
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.150
Yeah.

98
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.410
But out of the 3000 people that they have in the Alzheimer's clinic clinic now

99
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.940
only 19 of them, or, sorry, only 13 of them are vegetarians and three vegans.

100
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.050
So, I mean, you look at, you know, if you look at,

101
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.970
if you break it down the population,

102
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:53.530
like how many of the 24,000 people there that are vegetarians, about 15%,

103
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.920
you would expect, you know, uh, several hundred of them to be, you know,

104
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.600
with Alzheimer's to be vegetarian.

105
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.130
<v 0>So, so many of them are following that, uh, seventh day Adventist diet,</v>

106
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:05.180
which is vegetarian,

107
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.050
but when you're talking about San Bernandino is a very poor community,

108
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.540
unfortunately. And I think, you know,

109
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:14.240
as well as I do a lot of people in poor communities eat terrible.

110
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.200
It's true when you're eating junk food and sugar and all that crap. I mean,

111
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.310
that, that's one of the primary factors when it comes to poor health and.

112
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.940
<v 1>Education is related definitely to brain health, unfortunately.</v>

113
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.890
And it says to us to do that, they're stupid.

114
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:29.180
It's just that they're you're right. They,

115
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.630
they're not that they're not eating as well. They have to, you know,

116
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:36.290
the first McDonald's was in San Bernardino, you know, it wasn't really, yeah.

117
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.140
There was, we went to the museum there, the McDonald's museum,

118
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.920
they have a McDonald's.

119
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.250
<v 0>The museum, they have all the Ronald McDonald's from the beginning to the end.</v>

120
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.070
<v 1>Yeah. Um, yeah,</v>

121
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.330
th th so they've been really good about keeping fast fluid out of, um,

122
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.160
out of Loma Linda for.

123
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.120
<v 0>Um, isn't there giant concerns, even with large-scale agriculture,</v>

124
00:06:56.121 --> 00:07:00.680
when you talking about mono crops and growing things for 15 billion people,

125
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:02.540
you're going to need gigantic swaths of land.

126
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:04.430
It's going to displace a lot of wildlife.

127
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:07.700
You're going to have a lot of different chemicals get released into the ground,

128
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:10.130
unless you're doing regenerative farming.

129
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:12.410
In which case you're going to have to use some animal products anyway,

130
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:15.200
because you have compost and fertilizer,

131
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:19.190
you need fish for fertilizer or something that creates nitrogen as well.

132
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.340
There's a lot of issues. Even with large scale agriculture,

133
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:23.690
when you're growing crops, you're,

134
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:27.710
you're doing something that's wholly unnatural. If you have, you know,

135
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.150
a thousand acres of corn or soybeans or anything that you're growing in large

136
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:36.140
scale, that's not, not how nature intends it, nature in tens,

137
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.300
everything to be combined together.

138
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.230
<v 1>Right. But if you look at the amount of crops that are out there,</v>

139
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.420
the most land is being used to grow crops, to feed animals. So, you know.

140
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.480
<v 0>Sort of a lot of its being used for feed animals,</v>

141
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:53.960
a lot of it's being used for corn syrup and a lot of different

142
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:56.880
[inaudible]. I mean, you've seen king corn, right? That's

143
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:56.880
, that's pretty crazy when they check your DNA and they find out how much of your DNA is corn based. 

144
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:56.880
And you're like, what, like what is going, or

145
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:56.880
 how much of your, your, your cellular structure is

146
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:56.880
 corn based. It's like how much corn is in your diet. And then you go through the supermarket and go and pick up box after box and read how much corn is in 

147
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:56.880
there. Corn starch, corn syrup, different proteins that they've

148
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.713
 extracted from corn.

149
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.660
<v 1>Well, let me ask you, how do you think, you know, if we have to feed 10,</v>

150
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:33.560
15 billion people in the future, how do you think, you know,

151
00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:35.090
we should be feeding the population. That's good.

152
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.480
<v 0>The question, it's a very good question. I have hoped for this, um,</v>

153
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.240
this fake meat, not, not, um,

154
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.420
the plant-based stuff where they're using oils and the,

155
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.010
but the actual physical meat that they can figure out some way to

156
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.720
create meat without animals die. Like I am not a fan of factory farming.

157
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:55.620
It's the reason why I got into hunting in the first place.

158
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:57.930
I saw a lot of those pita documentaries,

159
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.900
and I just didn't want to have any part of any of that.

160
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.760
And I know there are ethical ranchers that raise our

161
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:10.590
animals, grass fed, and they let them roam. And, you know,

162
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.470
um, there's a guy named Joel Salitan who has this, um,

163
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.690
thing called Polyface farms, or he, he teaches people,

164
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:23.130
regenerative farming methods and teaches people how to let animals be animals.

165
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:27.600
And there's the polar opposite of factory farming. When you see these,

166
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.290
and I'm sure you've seen some of these disgusting videos of these pig farms,

167
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:35.580
where they have lakes of sewage attached to these

168
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.110
farms where these pigs are in these warehouses, stacked in one,

169
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:41.010
on top of the other.

170
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.060
And then they're all their waste goes down through the floor and into these

171
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:47.910
giant, uh, huge lakes of and.

172
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.100
<v 1>And they sprayed on the crops. Well.</v>

173
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.980
<v 0>I don't know if they spray that on the cross, but it leaks into the ground.</v>

174
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.540
They spray the pig and on low on the crop. Oh yeah. Well look,

175
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:00.210
all that stuff is wrong. I mean, all of it's wrong. I mean,

176
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.970
whether chickens raising chickens like that, or cows like that,

177
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:06.330
or pigs like that. And there's a reason why they have these ag gag laws.

178
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.410
And those are another thing that are akin in my eyes to the same thing.

179
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.300
That the way we feel about dolphins in captivity, in a place like SeaWorld,

180
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.990
those ag gag laws, agricultural gag laws,

181
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.120
they keep people from divulging the horrors of these factory farms.

182
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.710
And there's, there's gotta be a way to stop those laws. First of all,

183
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.190
th you, you should, they, these places should be transparent.

184
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.550
If there's something there do, that's a boring, it's something they do with you.

185
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:39.030
You could see the lives of these animals and they're treated in these horrific

186
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:43.770
ways. It's not necessary. It's not, it's just, they're doing that for profit.

187
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.240
And this is why you can get a chicken sandwich for a dollar 99 or whatever the

188
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.313
it is.

189
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.150
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, if like, you know, the saying of slaughterhouses that glass walls.</v>

190
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.260
Yes.

191
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.610
<v 0>Right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But.</v>

192
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.150
<v 1>They're not going back to it though. I mean, so how do you, so lab meet you?</v>

193
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.110
<v 0>I think lab meat has real potential.</v>

194
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.040
The same way cell phones used to cost a thousand dollars.

195
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.730
Uh, well, more than that, like what was, uh,

196
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.790
what was like one of those big Motorola bricks,

197
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.480
remember those things that like Gordon Gekko had and wall street,

198
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.490
they were really expensive.

199
00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:22.620
Like when he was walking on the beach with that thing, like, wow,

200
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:25.920
that guy has a ball or he's got a phone he's just walking with no cord.

201
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.580
Now everyone has a phone. I mean, I was in Brazil and, um, you know,

202
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:32.700
these people were walking around, they had very little money,

203
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:33.600
but they all had phones.

204
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.120
Cell phones have made their way throughout virtually all of the world, how much?

205
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.800
Four grand, four grand to four. So four grand and 82 was probably what today.

206
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:48.780
20 probably like 20. Right? Sure. Yeah. It's a lot. Just say,

207
00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.330
let's just say it's a lot, even if it's four grand, if,

208
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.160
imagine if a iPhone was four grand P would be going crazy,

209
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.770
the new one's almost two grand and everybody's going crazy.

210
00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.960
So I think that sort of technological innovation and improvement,

211
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.610
I think we're going to see that in this sort of factory created meat,

212
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:10.300
because the original factory created burger that they made,

213
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.920
I believe it was a quarter of a million dollars that it costs to create

214
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:18.820
one and people ate it and they were like, this is beef. This is like real beef.

215
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.050
I think with innovation there, they could figure out a way to do that.

216
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:27.010
So we don't ever have to have these factory farming situations. I mean,

217
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:28.210
I think that's possible. Yeah.

218
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.790
<v 1>Yeah, no, I think it is too. When I I've talked to us,</v>

219
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.960
some of the people that are working on that. And when you look at how fast

220
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.760
cells can reproduce and we know it's just a matter of scale and getting the

221
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:41.650
right texture and taste.

222
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.020
<v 0>Yes. Look, I'm, I, you know,</v>

223
00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:47.620
I'm not under no illusion that what I do is available to everybody.

224
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.270
I go hunting in the mountains. Most people don't want to do that. You know,

225
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.620
and I do it with a bow and arrow. No,

226
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.660
most people don't want to learn how to do that.

227
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.700
They're they don't have it in them. They don't want it.

228
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.240
It's not interesting to me. It is.

229
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.110
If I shoot one elk that has 400 pounds of meat,

230
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.760
one life feeds me for a year. And I feed my friends.

231
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:10.990
I feed a lot of people.

232
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.880
I give elk meat out to a bunch of people I know under no illusion that

233
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:19.660
everyone can do that, but this, everyone can't do most of the things that I do.

234
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.680
I just do it because it makes me feel better than going and getting something

235
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:24.670
that's factory farm.

236
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.710
If I saw what they did to check-ins and I knew that my chicken had come from

237
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:33.730
these horrific environments and I ate that. I feel sick. Yeah.

238
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.070
And so that's why I became a hunter in the first place.

239
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.630
<v 1>Yeah. Well, that's, you know what we concern ourselves as like, wait,</v>

240
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.230
how can you like, yeah. You and I can eat you probably better than me, but I,

241
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.960
I can eat how I want to eat.

242
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.130
<v 0>But doesn't that sound weird? You say, I eat better than, you know.</v>

243
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.780
<v 1>What you can afford more is what I'm saying.</v>

244
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.500
<v 0>But I'm telling you, I'm getting my meat from the woods.</v>

245
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.230
<v 1>Uh, well, I'm not, I'm not saying better.</v>

246
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.150
I'm I'm saying that you could eat how you want. Oh, you easier than me.

247
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.990
I'm just saying I'm not financially. I've seen the, what you have around here.

248
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.920
This nice little cozy a man, Dan, you have down here,

249
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:15.940
but boys used to see what's out there. It's like the ultimate, uh,

250
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.590
it's a man cave, man. Yeah.

251
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.540
<v 0>Not cave man, but man cave, man cave man would be, uh,</v>

252
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:27.520
a giant Neanderthal. Um, but yeah. Um,

253
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.140
it's uh, the conversation between, I mean,

254
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.610
I kind of a gang of friends that are vegan and vegetarian.

255
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:38.230
One of my best friends is the Ian Edwards. I love him to death. I,

256
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.140
I don't, I don't, um,

257
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.110
dispute that we're in a conundrum.

258
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.650
And then we're in a terrible situation. As a civilization.

259
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:50.920
We've certainly overpopulated the planet in many.

260
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.660
And we've certainly allowed something to take root in our society that I

261
00:14:56.661 --> 00:15:00.440
think is disgusting. That's factory farming of animals. There's,

262
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:04.970
there's something vile about it, undeniably vile.

263
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.160
And there's a reason why people are prosecuted for exposing what makes

264
00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:13.520
everybody sick. Look, if they exposed it and say, look,

265
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.940
I'm going to take a picture. I'm gonna tell you,

266
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.170
show you a video of how these cows are living and you take the video and the

267
00:15:19.171 --> 00:15:23.930
cows just wandering around eating grass. No one would give a. Right? Right.

268
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:28.400
It's when you see these people kicking these cows and when you see them alive,

269
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.780
when like kosher, the way they do that, where they, they,

270
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.320
they have to slice their throat and they have to do it with one cut.

271
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.850
And this is why people want kosher meat, like some ancient,

272
00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:45.710
ridiculous idea of how to dispose of a life. Whew. I mean,

273
00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:50.420
all those things, sick and people, which is the reason why they have those laws,

274
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:54.110
keeping people who work there from videotaping, exposing it in the first place.
