1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. The last time I saw you.</v>

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:07.560
I don't think the Pentagon had come out because it was actually during the

3
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.300
pandemic where the Pentagon came out.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.240
I don't think we talked about this last time. Did we? I don't think so.

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.600
Where they said they've recovered alien crafts.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.860
They said we have recovered crafts that are not from this world.

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.520
Is that exactly what they said?

8
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.090
<v 1>Hold it up. Pull that, pull that up. That exact quote from.</v>

9
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.100
<v 0>Sketch Pentagon actually. Um, that was, uh,</v>

10
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.570
the guy from Vegas, the guy from Nevada. What is his name? Um,

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.430
the Zia Senator from Nevada. Harry Reed. Yeah.

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.210
<v 2>Pentagon former contractor was the one that said, oh, you're thinking.</v>

13
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.540
<v 1>Of a yes. Yeah. You thinking of, uh,</v>

14
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.800
he's got an aerospace business out there that.

15
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.940
<v 2>Was, uh, funded in part by, uh, taxpayer money that, uh,</v>

16
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.610
it was a sort of a pet project of Harry Reid's in a sense. Um,

17
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.190
I'm struggling to remember the guy's name.

18
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:02.510
I should remember it because we we've talked about it. Um, no, no.

19
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.360
Um, aerospace buddy of Harry.

20
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.910
<v 0>Reid's. Can we Google that? The skin Walker ranch guy? No, no.</v>

21
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.120
<v 2>This is, uh, this guy is, they've actually still got a business.</v>

22
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:16.970
He's still developing it right now. I think what he's trying to do is develop,

23
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.400
um, um, portable, um, living. Yeah. That is a skin.

24
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.150
<v 1>Walker ranch guy is right. Yeah. That is the guy. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:27.400
I know who you're talking about. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.850
The name's on the tip of my tongue.

27
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.590
<v 2>I know. Um, but if he's the one who said it, then yeah,</v>

28
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.830
it doesn't come from the government. They, they, you know, that a tip,

29
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.890
which is at a advanced aeronautical threat identification program. I mean,

30
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.420
I think the most interesting thing that the government has come out and said is

31
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:45.470
that, yes, we did have a,

32
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.490
we did have an operation within the Pentagon and office within the Pentagon.

33
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:54.410
I've taught, you know, that was there to identify an

34
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.690
identified, uh, threats. Right. So we get something up in the air and,

35
00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:02.480
and we can't identify. It's like the tick tock, uh, the tic-tac, um,

36
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.380
sightings by.

37
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.120
<v 1>David Fravor. Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.810
<v 0>David Fravor for anybody who wants to, who's interested in this,</v>

39
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:12.380
please listen to him on the Lex Friedman podcast. Cause I had him on,

40
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:14.660
but I had him on with Jeremy Corbell who's the,

41
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:16.760
the documentarian behind that Rob Bazaar,

42
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.620
Bob was our movie and by himself Fravor and

43
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:26.540
Lex, they get deep into the technical specifications of their

44
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:31.100
aircraft and why he believes that no known

45
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:33.410
aircraft could have ever operated the way it is.

46
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:37.340
And also how it was blocking their tracking devices,

47
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.170
which is technically it's an act of war. But also it showed that it was an,

48
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.460
it was aware of them.

49
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.110
<v 2>Very credible. I mean, he's extremely credible. He's, he's a good guy. Uh,</v>

50
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:51.920
I've talked to him, uh, a handful of times have sat and reviewed the, the, uh,

51
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:56.750
the gun camera footage with him as he's walked through it. Very credible.

52
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.290
Right. So that was of,

53
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.400
that was a perfect example of why they had set up a tip right within the

54
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:07.380
Pentagon. Um, apparently not funded anymore as an,

55
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.340
as an operating office. Cause they probably.

56
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.180
<v 0>That they can't tell you about because that one got out there,</v>

57
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:13.980
they close it down. That's a New York times.

58
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.460
<v 1>That is what they do. Right. Well.</v>

59
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.640
<v 2>I mean, Hey, your reallocate, the, you know, it's all on the budgets,</v>

60
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.350
which is again, kind of why we do this,

61
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:25.120
this show for a science general black falls, because we're,

62
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.150
we're chasing the bus. Finally got to that.

63
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.690
<v 1>I know, right. I know I got like.</v>

64
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.790
<v 2>Two other promos to do. I haven't even touched yet,</v>

65
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.290
so I can help people are thinking, wow, he's really slow this time. Uh,

66
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.560
but yeah, if you follow the money, it's like an investigation, right?

67
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:42.360
If you not so much follow me, but if you,

68
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.600
if you start pulling on those threads around budgets or, uh,

69
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:48.090
it's like with investigation and asset tracing, you know, getting,

70
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.770
getting bank records is absolutely key. If you can, you know, legally, uh,

71
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.690
get them, uh, during the course of an investigation. But, um, uh, with,

72
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.550
with military operations, oftentimes those, you know,

73
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.760
those budgets for the most interesting, uh,

74
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.660
projects and operational elements get buried into something else.

75
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.610
That's just the way it works. Right.

76
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:12.540
And so that's where you maintain secrecy to maintain secrecy, but that's,

77
00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:16.320
that's, it's, you know, so it's, it's an exercise and, and we don't, you know,

78
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.280
obviously with blackfellas,

79
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:20.130
we don't identify anything that's currently classified because we'd all end up

80
00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:23.520
in, in the who's gal. But, uh, yeah, we, uh,

81
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.510
we're looking at some pretty interesting things and, and it's, and it speaks to,

82
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.980
um, where programs are going currently. Right?

83
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:33.960
You look at some things in the recent past and you say, okay,

84
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:36.030
this is where this new development is heading. Yeah. And.

85
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.870
<v 0>Isn't it, it's there, it's an interesting conversation too,</v>

86
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:43.710
because for people that don't like secrecy and they don't think we should have

87
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:48.270
secrecy for national security and for the development of things,

88
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.440
you know, like the stealth bomber,

89
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.050
like a lot of other things that show that we have male

90
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.120
military superiority over our,

91
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.350
our enemies it's important dev secrecy. Oh wait.

92
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.020
<v 2>Yeah, absolutely. You can't, you can't function, uh,</v>

93
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.010
as a secure and safe and lasting a Republic without it. Right.

94
00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:10.440
There's just no way now, you know, people will say, oh,

95
00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:13.890
we should have transparency around everything. No, no, you gotta draw the line.

96
00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:18.660
You, you gotta, you, you, you, you want to not over do it. Right. So you want.

97
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.780
<v 1>To, that's where I was going to get to do it part, but.</v>

98
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.620
<v 2>You've got it. You've got to have the ability to protect sources and methods.</v>

99
00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:29.490
You've had to have a sort of a need to know policy around certain things, right.

100
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:33.470
Within, um, national security concerns and the alternate, uh,

101
00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:37.510
intelligence community. Um, but yeah, again, it's, it,

102
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.270
it can be used as a weapon, you know, you can over again, overdo it. Uh, and,

103
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.780
but if you don't.

104
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.440
<v 0>Have security, you don't have the Manhattan project, right? No abs absolutely.</v>

105
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.410
Yeah. We don't, I mean, you don't have many things.

106
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.620
<v 1>That they think about, you think about, um.</v>

107
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.010
<v 2>China, look at this, I'm a,</v>

108
00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:58.940
now I'm deep into the show and I'm just now bashing China for their theft of

109
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.760
economic, uh, economic intelligence. But you look at the,

110
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.240
the effort that they make in terms of stealing our intellectual property and

111
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.770
research and development, right. I mean,

112
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.290
the idea that you don't protect your most critical information,

113
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.920
whether it's operationally important or whether it's just, again,

114
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.620
R and D for development of, of, of, uh, of materials and,

115
00:06:20.621 --> 00:06:25.250
and that speaks to the strength of your economy and, and, uh, you know, so yes,

116
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:29.000
certain things have to be kept secret. Um, but again,

117
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:31.970
you can over classify things which tends to happen, right.

118
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:34.010
It tends to just because you're trying to protect everything, right.

119
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:37.850
So I'm just going to over classify and, and that also creates a problem then.

120
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.660
So, you know, trying to strike a balance, it's a human endeavor,

121
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:43.300
so you never really get it. Right, right. I don't think.

122
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.010
<v 0>But, well, this is where people feel like the line when it,</v>

123
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.470
when it comes to alien spacecrafts.

124
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.930
And if the government knows and is aware of alien spacecrafts and alien

125
00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:56.500
technology,

126
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.300
this is where the line of secrecy and being swarmed oath,

127
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.890
where it crosses over into a need to know for the general public Bob,

128
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.790
our story,

129
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.680
the story about him working for S for he was a physicist for Los

130
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:15.580
Alamos labs. That's been proven. He was on the employee list. There.

131
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.470
He also was listed in a newspaper article when he put a jet engine in a

132
00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:24.140
Honda, um, that he was a, uh, uh,

133
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.030
a physicist at Los Alamos labs. And he was a propulsion expert,

134
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.370
says he worked for area S four and says he was hired to back engineer

135
00:07:33.371 --> 00:07:34.240
UFO's and says,

136
00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:37.090
they never could figure out how these things worked and that they were never

137
00:07:37.091 --> 00:07:39.970
going to because they really couldn't because they were trying to keep

138
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:40.804
everything secret.

139
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.650
They couldn't share all this information with the general scientific community.

140
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.890
And he's like, science doesn't work in these containment, bubbles,

141
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.600
you can't compartmentalize science and have only the, the,

142
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.530
these a few small propulsion experts sit around and try to figure this thing

143
00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:59.350
out. And then they fire and bring new guys in and no one ever gets it. Right.

144
00:07:59.410 --> 00:07:59.620
Which.

145
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.380
<v 2>Is what you can use against. I mean, if I'm, if I'm trying to, uh,</v>

146
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:07.180
pull information out of, of, uh, of, uh, uh, another nation, right.

147
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:09.160
If I'm targeting intelligence from,

148
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.670
and they're developing some new ballistic missile system or whatever it is,

149
00:08:12.671 --> 00:08:15.610
propulsion system, then yes, I'm going to,

150
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.140
I'm going to play off of that desire on the part of engineers and scientists to

151
00:08:20.141 --> 00:08:22.270
have a collaborative community. Right. And that's,

152
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.970
and that the Chinese do that very well. Right. They,

153
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.710
in particularly when they target, uh,

154
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.100
Chinese Americans working here in the U S and in potentially sensitive

155
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:33.250
positions, you know, this idea that we're all working together, you know,

156
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.810
and w this is, this is just what we should be doing. Um, you know, we've done.

157
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.310
Um, my, my, my company has done a work trying to protect, um,

158
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.270
information for, um, companies, pharmaceutical companies.

159
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.620
This is a good example where the scientists, the engineers,

160
00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:53.200
the doctors need that free flow in their mind.

161
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:54.700
They gotta have this free flow in this,

162
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.570
this collaborating in this sharing of information. And meanwhile,

163
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.580
you got the other side, you know, where the, the,

164
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.970
the bean counters and security personnel and all that, and they're going like,

165
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:07.260
no, this is the lifeblood of our company. We can't risk losing this information.

166
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.270
So we've got to lock it down to the degree. We can.

167
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:11.790
Those two things don't necessarily coexist all that well together,

168
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:16.080
but you got to try to find some, some medium. So, um, yeah, I think,

169
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.940
you know, there's the, the S the, the, the,

170
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.020
the fact that the government came out and talked about a tip,

171
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.590
I thought it was a big step. Right. That's a big deal for them. Right. I mean,

172
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:30.990
that, that, uh, they would discuss that.

173
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.480
Do I think that they're hiding things? I, you know, again,

174
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:39.810
I don't take anything. I wouldn't take anything off the table. Right. Frankly,

175
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:44.460
because I don't know. Uh, so it would be, it would be, uh, you know,

176
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:46.890
stupid of me to say, no, they definitely,

177
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:51.210
aren't holding onto some propulsion system that, you know,

178
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:55.170
isn't of this world or whatever. I don't know it.

179
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:59.100
I can't say absolutely not. Um, but wouldn't.

180
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.120
<v 3>You want to know though? Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah. But how you, I mean, you know,</v>

181
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.750
what are you doing? I mean, Greece, a few palms.

182
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.350
<v 1>That it, yeah. Yeah. I want to see it.</v>

183
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.890
<v 0>Man. I guess you could do that. I let the government know right now. Listen.</v>

184
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.480
Yeah. I'll say a lot of. That's not true. Just get me to the UFO's.

185
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.340
<v 1>Show me the UFO's a lot. Gosh. Yeah, no,</v>

186
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.940
it's it is. It's not true. I'm like, I'll.

187
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.700
<v 0>Tell you right now. Don't tell me they're lying. Because if you tell me,</v>

188
00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:29.534
I'm telling everybody.

189
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.750
<v 1>Yeah, look, they know that I'm sure they.</v>

190
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.750
<v 2>Know. They know that they're writing it down right now, whatever happens,</v>

191
00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:36.380
happens, but.

192
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.880
<v 0>It's two bad episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify.</v>

193
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.080
That's right. They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

194
00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:47.510
they're going to be available everywhere. But after December 1st,

195
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.200
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

196
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:55.190
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

197
00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.020
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
