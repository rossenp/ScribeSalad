00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.120
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.440
<v 1>Has there been any news, uh, updates on the John John situation of like, no.</v>

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.433
<v 0>I haven't heard nothing.</v>

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.240
<v 1>That's so disappointing. So.</v>

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.800
<v 0>Makes me sad. The redand insights on this one. Yeah, that's right.</v>

6
00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:18.640
You called the Dick pills. I would just like you say for the record, Brian,

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.390
redand completely called the pill thing. You, if I paraphrase, you were like,

8
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:26.950
lemme say he parties, he does Coke. Uh, he, you know,

9
00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:31.030
he probably took some Dick pills and I was like, what? Jesus Christ.

10
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.190
It made so much sense. It was like how it was there right along the whole time.

11
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.110
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; I just remember the fda.gov had like, you know,</v>

12
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.910
breakdowns of certain like rhino, uh, Dick pills at gas stations.

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.540
Lot of had steroid type things in him. Yeah. And it's.

14
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.100
<v 0>He's so crazy. He was taking that stuff that is probably still taking him. Well,</v>

15
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.700
now I bet he would. I mean, now, now he's like, it. I'll just take everything.

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660
<v 1>You could get addicted to him. I was addicted to him for a while.</v>

17
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.380
I don't know why I don't.

18
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.300
<v 0>I don't think he's addicted to it. I,</v>

19
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.650
the new thing that he tested positive for has nothing to do with that.

20
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.210
They said the new thing that he tested positive for is a steroid that they only

21
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:12.970
test for in urine. And, uh, according to jail, Sunon, it's like a very,

22
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.650
uh, it's not a very common steroid and it's actually kind of old school.

23
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.450
It's like something they used to do a long time ago.

24
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.280
So he it's his thought was that if somebody is getting him to do that, it, that,

25
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.480
um, if that's not a TA supplement, if someone's getting 'em to do that,

26
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.640
that person knows their. Like that's, that's some sneaky steroids. Wow. Yeah.

27
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.840
And he said, it's usually combined with other things. That's so.

28
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.720
<v 1>Unfortunate, man. I don't.</v>

29
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.840
<v 0>Know if it's true. Right? He could have got sabotaged.</v>

30
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.360
<v 1>What's he saying? Is he saying.</v>

31
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.990
<v 0>No, one's saying anything. Ah, there's no official statement.</v>

32
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.870
I don't think like, yeah. Cause there's,

33
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.470
I think they're trying to test other sta other samples.

34
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.070
They tested a blood sample and then they released the results of the blood blood

35
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:54.350
sample. They always do a blood in a urine. The blood sample was negative,

36
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.230
but the blood sample didn't test for that stuff. So I don't, you know,

37
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.230
you could speculate all day long. I'm sure as the facts come in,

38
00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:03.700
we'll get a better under standing of it.

39
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.420
But it would be the most disappointing thing ever if someone spiked his,

40
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.780
it'd almost be less disappointing. If he took something and got caught,

41
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.140
then it would be if somebody tainted him.

42
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.620
<v 1>That's why I'm saying it. Like he knows his past.</v>

43
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.860
It just seems ridiculous to think that he would even try,

44
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.500
even if it's old school or stuff, they barely right.

45
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.650
It seems like why would he even risk that? Cause he already went.

46
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.483
<v 0>Through that. Totally. Right.</v>

47
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.250
But being a cage fighter is a ridiculous way to make a living. Yeah.

48
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.730
And people who are cage fighters, especially like elite level,

49
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.170
like a guy like John Jones,

50
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.010
he's that guy has like probably a belief in himself. The,

51
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.960
that you and I will never understand and completely impulsive

52
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.120
in like what he decides. So he's wi he's a wild. That's why he's so good.

53
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.520
Cuz he's smart. And he's wild. Like he'll take,

54
00:02:57.521 --> 00:03:00.040
he's like legitimately wild he's wild chances.

55
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.280
Like I always talk about like when he fought showgun for the tile and when he

56
00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:07.360
fought showgun for the title, he opened up the fight with a flying knee.

57
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.760
That was the first thing he did fighting a legend,

58
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.560
fighting a UFC light heavyweight champion. I mean he's,

59
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:18.320
he was crazy talented and still is right. I mean he's only 30, but he's um,

60
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.350
wild man and wild men sometimes do that they don't even know why they're

61
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:25.870
why they're doing it. They're just doing it. You know?

62
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:30.070
And if you're a guy that's that powerful as a guy like John Jones,

63
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:34.710
like try controlling him. Good luck, good luck telling him you can't go out.

64
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.030
Good luck telling him what he's gotta do. You know,

65
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:40.060
it's one of the things about him in the past is that hasn't trained hard for

66
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:42.380
fights and they were way harder fights than they should have been.

67
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.620
Probably because he really wasn't in shape and everyone around him kind of knew

68
00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:50.340
it. But it was, he was that good that he could fight world class,

69
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.180
title challengers and beat them in five round fights without really training.

70
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.900
Like that's how good that guy is. So you and I,

71
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.690
we don't know how his brain even works. So who knows what the happened?

72
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.050
I hope he didn't do something. But then again,

73
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.770
that means that one of two things happened either.

74
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:13.530
He took a SA tainted supplement, which is after a while almost comes,

75
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.290
becomes a joke. Right? Like people keep saying that, Hey,

76
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:20.320
stop taking supplements or even worse as someone spiked him. Yeah.

77
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.240
<v 2>The spiking thing, cuz it seemed like.</v>

78
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.240
<v 0>Uh, that would be crazy. Yeah. That would be crazy.</v>

79
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.440
You could do that to somebody though, for sure. I mean,

80
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.000
if somebody is around someone with nefarious intentions

81
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.000
or someone's around someone who's resentful and you're in some sort of pro fight

82
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.880
camp and someone just decides,

83
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.310
this guy and just dump some stuff on your chicken, steroid.

84
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.470
<v 2>Cream in your hand cream.</v>

85
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.990
<v 0>I think there's things they could do to get it into your system.</v>

86
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:47.870
You probably wouldn't even know what.

87
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.790
<v 2>The test that came up. Ne positive,</v>

88
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.030
I guess is the one that happened right there. It was after the weigh in.

89
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.110
<v 0>Right? Yes. And so urine test, he wasn't tested.</v>

90
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.190
<v 2>At any time before that.</v>

91
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.940
<v 0>Um, I'm sure he was, they were said multiple times in camp. Um,</v>

92
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.420
so wouldn't it have probably come up to no Don not necessarily.

93
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.860
Or you just took cause it's really like or something. Well, if you know,

94
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.140
I don't know like what kind of time period they tested him in and I don't know

95
00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:17.700
what kind of halflife this stuff has. Cuz uh, apparently chill sun was telling,

96
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.890
uh, Brendan Shaw that it gets outta your system quite quick.

97
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.610
And that's one of the things that guys like about it,

98
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.690
apparently that you could do it and it gets outta your system really quick.

99
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.130
You would have to find out like how much time do they usually have in between

100
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.630
visits,

101
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.690
by USADA mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and what are the odds they're gonna get busted?

102
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.370
Like how much, how many times during camp are they willing to roll the dice?

103
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.720
Say if they have a 24 or four, eight hour acting steroid,

104
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.040
how many times can you roll the dice? You Sawda visited you three times.

105
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:49.280
You gotta roll the dice this week. Roll it. Come on.

106
00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:51.880
I wanna have a hard workout Thursday. it. Let's roll the dice.

107
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.720
You roll the dice. 27 hours. No you saw at 28, you wake up at the,

108
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.320
all of the night sweating 30 hours. No you, you know,

109
00:05:58.321 --> 00:05:59.920
if they come you've you know,

110
00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:03.040
if they come your career's over and they take away millions of dollars,

111
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.840
40 hours. Whew. You're peeing. Ah,

112
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.920
no youadada the next day you Sawda oh, you start thinking 52 hours.

113
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.040
How many is that? How many hours is that? How many has it been?

114
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.190
48 for 9 50, 51 53 hours. 53 hours.

115
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.470
It's gotta be gone. Right? It's gotta all be gone. And you give them that.

116
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.670
Just wondering whether it's in there.

117
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.030
<v 1>And I'm sure there's stuff that you can take that supposedly washes it out</v>

118
00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:29.270
faster. Like any kind of drug tests, you know what I mean?

119
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:30.510
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like weed tests. I remember,

120
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.950
I think it was like cranberry juice or something. You just.

121
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.750
<v 0>Constantly drink or there's certain diuretics for sure. Certain diuretics can,</v>

122
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.700
uh, mask steroids. It's one of the reasons why they're illegal.

123
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.980
<v 2>I'm looking at this article that came out about an hour ago.</v>

124
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:45.700
It looks like on a bloody elbow. It, it,

125
00:06:45.701 --> 00:06:47.980
that's not like any updated news or anything. Really.

126
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.940
It's a P E D expert who's known, uh,

127
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.300
in the tracked field world as known for supplying performance,

128
00:06:54.301 --> 00:06:59.050
Nancy drugs to them. His name is angel Hernandez. Also his memo. Not that,

129
00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.290
that matters a whole lot, but um, if anybody knows him.

130
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.090
<v 0>Uh, what angel herridia herardia Hernandez. Yeah,</v>

131
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.970
but angel herardia is that the same guy that used to train mannypaco no. Or no,

132
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.370
it was a who the did.

133
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.090
There was a guy that was like a really popular God it.

134
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:19.320
I know I got his name wrong, but I strength and conditioning coach.

135
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.520
<v 2>He's saying that the test that they do text tests for six different, uh,</v>

136
00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:25.720
particular metabolites.

137
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.000
And one of those can last up to seven weeks and uh,

138
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.000
then it skipped on to here.

139
00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:35.520
He says that one of those metabolite can look like the same structure as the

140
00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.840
terraranib ball. Mm. And it may or may not.

141
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.790
It doesn't mean that's notran ball or whatever,

142
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:42.950
but it could have be from a bad supplement that he took during the training

143
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:46.910
period that lasted in his system and ended up looking like it.

144
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.030
<v 0>Ooh, interesting. But that's listen to this quote, listen to this quote.</v>

145
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.710
If he would've been using way before then he eventually would've been positive

146
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.710
on the 21 date testing before the fight, but he was negative.

147
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.620
Then he came out positive. Frankly, the testing itself, it lacks of cred, uh,

148
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:06.500
credibility for a lot of reasons. Uh, we could go on and on, but,

149
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.340
and I could be very specific in terms of chemistry,

150
00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:12.020
but I don't wanna mislead the people that listen.

151
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.860
It's just the fact that they're detecting six different metabolites.

152
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:19.500
And one of them stays there, um, longer than seven week.

153
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.450
But the most intriguing part is that some of those metabolites are not really

154
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.090
confirmed that they are actually coming from that. How do you say that?

155
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:32.250
Terrain ball, ball, terrain, ball structure. All right.

156
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.890
But yada, who's doing this.

157
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.010
They know what the they're doing and they're not,

158
00:08:38.011 --> 00:08:42.920
they're not going to come out with a result unless they're super,

159
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.560
super sure that that's what they're tested positive for.

160
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.840
I don't know if this guy's right. Yeah. That's why I don't know either. He's.

161
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.520
<v 2>Just sort of speculating. I would imagine. I don't know if he wasn't there.</v>

162
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.960
<v 0>Either, but I tell you, I talked to Jeff navitsky off stage. I mean,</v>

163
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.600
off Mike on Mike, I talked to him around the arena. He's

164
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.000
he's about as honest as it comes,

165
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.360
when it comes to like handling these situations with these athletes,

166
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.360
they're catching people and the people they're catching we're using there's,

167
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.360
you know, the way they're doing it is very thorough. The way they're,

168
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.870
it is very thorough.

169
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.710
And there hasn't been anybody with a credible story that came forth that didn't

170
00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:22.550
have something in their system that they weren't,

171
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.430
that were supposed to have in their system. We haven't had a case of that yet.

172
00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:26.264
As far as I know,

173
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:31.230
I think almost all cases have been either tainted supplements or someone getting

174
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:34.310
caught, whether it's taking a diuretic or someone getting caught,

175
00:09:34.311 --> 00:09:38.860
taking a there's a lot going on like that. And he's got,

176
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:39.501
you know,

177
00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:44.380
they have a team of people that are just constantly checking people that might

178
00:09:44.381 --> 00:09:45.620
be cheating. I guess.

179
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.260
<v 1>You have to also say it's where there's smoke. There's fire.</v>

180
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.220
How many fighters never have a steroid, you know, in him, you know.

181
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.090
<v 0>There's a few, um, you know, BJ Penn, uh,</v>

182
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.370
I'm sure there's uh, you know, I used to think it would be John Fitch,

183
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:04.210
but then John Fitch tested positive. He was, uh,

184
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.250
but he was getting older and he was fighting and um,

185
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.770
the world series of fighting wasn't in the UFC anymore. And you know,

186
00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:12.810
and he might have been dealing with some serious injuries,

187
00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:16.520
need to pay his bills for fighting. Like I don't begrudge anybody,

188
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.520
especially when they're not even in the UFC.

189
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.840
And the testing that they do in a lot of these organizations is like,

190
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.320
there's a lot of, uh,

191
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:28.000
there's a lot of organizations that have guys that are pretty much

192
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.760
openly using. And what they do is they have these guys fight,

193
00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:33.360
unlike Indian reservations or fighting weird, uh,

194
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.480
states that have an athletic commission.

195
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.230
It doesn't really adhere to the rules or it doesn't have to. And doesn't,

196
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.310
it's not very strict, but what, especially the Indian reservation thing,

197
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:47.070
native American reservations, they do whatever the they want, man.

198
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.310
They're a country inside our country, but youata, they look up your,

199
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.190
man. They look up your, they come get you.

200
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.900
They come get you and they wake you up. Hey man, Hey, how you doing? Hey, we,

201
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.700
I'm gonna look at your Dick and I'm gonna watch come outta your Dick.

202
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.780
It's gonna go in this cup and then you can go back to sleep. &lt;laugh&gt; it's uh,

203
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.380
it's no joke. And, uh,

204
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.780
to see a guy like John with just spectacular,

205
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.740
just spectacular comeback fight, you know, I mean like a Phoenix,

206
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.650
he rises from the ashes. He can gave this really classy post fight speech.

207
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.330
He won by just overwhelming

208
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.610
devastation. I mean,

209
00:11:27.611 --> 00:11:31.450
it was a beautiful combination with the left high kick and then a series of

210
00:11:31.451 --> 00:11:33.010
shots. Daniel goes down,

211
00:11:33.011 --> 00:11:36.130
he just beats him unconscious and a spectacular performance.

212
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.400
And then to find out that it's did by some gross

213
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.880
steroid that were, they were sneaking in.

214
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.240
Is it either that or again, the other one,

215
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:52.160
which is almost equally gross that somebody gave it to 'em like somebody gave

216
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:55.600
them some, Hey man, Hey champ, have some, uh, have this Gatorade champ,

217
00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.480
you know, Hey champ, I got you a Gatorade champ crack, you.

218
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.560
<v 1>Know, and they're very accessible these fighters, you know, they're, you know,</v>

219
00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:06.240
they're just going to the gyms. Like you go to a lot of times.

220
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.800
<v 0>If you're not fighting John, he's a great guy. Yeah. He's a great guy.</v>

221
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:14.830
Great guy. People love him. Um, I think that, um, we don't know,

222
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.950
you know, it just makes me sad. It makes me sad,

223
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.310
but one day, you know, one day they'll have it eradicated,

224
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.710
but by then I think there's gonna be some new methods.

225
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.110
I think they're gonna have genetic methods. That's the next one.

226
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:33.420
<v 3>I.</v>
