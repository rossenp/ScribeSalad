00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.570
This whole COVID and then the George Floyd protest,

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:10.350
and then the riots and alluding and everything that really highlights how

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.330
fragile our civilization is. Really, really shows everybody. Yeah.

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.213
Yeah.

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.910
<v 1>And how easily we are controlled through the media. Yep.</v>

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.240
Easily we're controlled. I try not to watch it anymore. Cause like,

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.780
it's you just getting brainwashed and once you realize you're just being

9
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:27.351
brainwashed,

10
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:30.560
like they just control how you feel about everything they control you.

11
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.770
You hate this guy changed the channel. Now that guy's a good guy,

12
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:37.010
this guy has this guy. It's just all misinformation.

13
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.490
The who and Fowchee one day they don't do mass.

14
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:44.630
You don't need mass the next day or you need mask. Como needs 50,000.

15
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.810
Uh respire venerate Vitor later.

16
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.360
Isn't it puts them all in the nursing homes and all the nurse people die.

17
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.400
But let's not talk about that. Yeah.

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.190
<v 0>That's the Cuomo nursing home things, a giant candle, man.</v>

19
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.100
He let those people go back to the nursing homes.

20
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.480
They infected and killed thousands of people because of that.

21
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.200
<v 1>And so it was numbers go straight up, you know? And then like,</v>

22
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.200
why are we incentivizing for even going into the co mean,

23
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.230
why are we incentivizing hospitals to say that there were COVID deaths?

24
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.890
What is the purpose of that? It makes no sense. I think.

25
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.780
<v 0>The idea was because this was a new disease and they</v>

26
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.160
required more fond of like financially,

27
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:25.880
it's more difficult to treat those people that they allocated more money towards

28
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:29.060
people that had COVID. But when you do that,

29
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.400
you do incentivize people to mark deaths.

30
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.410
<v 1>As COVID. Yeah. There's people that get shot. And they were like, well,</v>

31
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.960
he had COVID when he died, but D did they test over code a lot?

32
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.600
It doesn't matter. Just write it on there. And then the numbers come out.

33
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.350
Apparently.

34
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.290
<v 0>They've also been a bunch of people that died and weren't, COVID tested to,</v>

35
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:45.350
they do believe died because of complications for COVID too.

36
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.000
So the idea is that it could even possibly balance it out. They don't know,

37
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.400
but there are a lot of people that have like,

38
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.460
here's a deceptive one that I've read. It was really up.

39
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.890
They were talking about this kid who was a,

40
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.810
I think he was 17 who died from COVID. And they said, uh, he, he was, uh,

41
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.030
they were said he was healthy, no under no other health issues, they said,

42
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.870
but then you read the article deeper. It turns out he had diabetes,

43
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.150
he had type one diabetes and he was 400 pounds. And it's like,

44
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:21.740
wait a minute. The that's not no issues. These articles are full of.

45
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.880
And they write those articles just so that you click on them because they get

46
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:29.000
the ad revenue from clicks. That's.

47
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.810
So they're incentivized to trick you into being scared. Like, oh my God,

48
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:36.710
a 17 year old died, what happened? My 17 year old can die. Holy.

49
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.460
And then you click on it. And if you don't read, you know, six,

50
00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:42.140
seven paragraphs into the article,

51
00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:46.880
you don't find out that this was a 400 pound diabetic kid that,

52
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.050
you know, that's.

53
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.210
<v 1>What have died from the flu three months earlier.</v>

54
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.610
And it would have been the same. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

55
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.060
so the numbers are fudged. So I don't, I don't want to believe your numbers.

56
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:59.270
Don't come to me with more scare tactics about like the numbers are spiking.

57
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.130
Well, you already said that 50% of the positives or false positives. Well,

58
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.950
at least finely, they're saying.

59
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.030
<v 0>When they're sitting, the numbers are spiking. I haven't heard that 50% or.</v>

60
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.050
<v 1>I got a video. There was a, the chick that is with Fowchee.</v>

61
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.420
That other one, she was saying 50%. Yeah.

62
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.620
I don't know how old the video was with it. Our testing is we're coming up.

63
00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:23.040
And if you have 1% of whatever and we test it,

64
00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:27.120
then 55th year at about half of the positives or false positive Jesus,

65
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.540
and then don't wear a mask and you have to wear masks. And they said,

66
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.070
the whole reason we have to flatten the curve is because it can live on anything

67
00:03:35.071 --> 00:03:36.390
for up to like nine days.

68
00:03:36.391 --> 00:03:40.440
And even an asymptomatic person can still transmit it.

69
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.600
Then it comes out. They say the exact opposite.

70
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.600
<v 0>Yeah. Now they're saying asymptomatic people, very, very rarely travel.</v>

71
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.260
<v 1>I don't choose to believe that, Joe. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.</v>

72
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.970
We're going to believe what they told me the first time. Not the new,

73
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.300
not the new facts that they have now.

74
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.850
So we're still going to wear masks all the time. Yeah.

75
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.520
<v 0>People get mad at you. If you suggest differently.</v>

76
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.710
There's a lot of people that like being scared too.

77
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.110
<v 2>You love it. Your God mask loving to protect people. Love it.</v>

78
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.810
<v 1>But there's no police. Who's going to protect you in you.</v>

79
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.030
Who's going to protect your family. Me.

80
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.760
<v 0>[Inaudible] there was no BS people weren't freaking out.</v>

81
00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:17.760
When you seen these mass protests and the spikes.

82
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.430
Guess what happened right after the protest.

83
00:04:20.431 --> 00:04:22.140
And at least they're saying that now,

84
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.760
at least they're saying they're being forced into saying is probably

85
00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:29.130
connected to the protests. Well, of course.

86
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.790
<v 1>Or it's just one more way to get people to skate.</v>

87
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.270
Let's scare them to stop revolting. Let's get them. Let's get them chill out.

88
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.880
You got know. Now the numbers are spiking guys.

89
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.030
<v 0>That calculated that. That's what they're doing. I think there's a lot.</v>

90
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.820
<v 1>Of calculated going on. There's too many weird things going on.</v>

91
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.300
I'm like who's calculating. I think that it's Dr. Evil.

92
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.380
I think it is that they're there in like their thing.

93
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:56.300
And next we're going to launch the sharks with laser beams on their head.

94
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.880
<v 0>Or Hornets. They came and went real quick. I was really worried about it.</v>

95
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.780
No aliens.

96
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.710
<v 1>Bro. I'm putting out there and will come. Wetlands are coming before, before.</v>

97
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.960
<v 0>And Dave's like, listen, man, I got to do something. I got to figure this out.</v>

98
00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:12.960
It's all been approved by the governor. Everybody's you know,

99
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.790
distanced six feet apart.

100
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.870
They all maintain social distancing during the show they wear masks during the

101
00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:19.650
show.

102
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.260
<v 1>How long are we gonna, how long are we gonna keep doing this?</v>

103
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.970
<v 0>Texas governor urges people to stay home as states report surges of new</v>

104
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:31.710
COVID-19 cases. Yeah. You want to see the photo of the Austin protest.

105
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.710
You've seen it. It's crazy. You know, Austin,

106
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:39.150
which is the most progressive city in Texas had this insane protest,

107
00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:41.610
which listen, I think is great. I do.

108
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:46.380
I think it's great that people want to show solidarity that people want to, uh,

109
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.200
to get out there and, and let everybody know that they're,

110
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.950
they're not down with police brutality and that they're, they're,

111
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.680
they're down with racial equality and that you got all these thousands of

112
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:01.580
thousands of people together to have the same positive message. I love it.

113
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.550
However that COVID,

114
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.440
doesn't give a about racial equality or social justice.

115
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.410
If you're, if you're not healthy, it's going to get ya.

116
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.440
I don't know the case is spike,

117
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.320
but the other thing about Texas is a giant percentage of it.

118
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:21.440
I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% is actually in prisons.

119
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.980
So when they're talking about statewide, uh, issues, did you,

120
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.050
do you have an image? Cause I can get an image. I got a good one for you. Oh,

121
00:06:29.051 --> 00:06:31.660
that's good. Yeah. That'll cause problem,

122
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.140
all those people. But one thing they have found out if you guys,

123
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.600
if you guys are going to protest protest during the day,

124
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.520
and this is why there's been a new study that came out that said that COVID 19

125
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.520
dies almost instantly in contact with sunlight.

126
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.020
<v 1>Did Trump say that like two months ago and everyone said he was crazy? No,</v>

127
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:57.490
he was saying like [inaudible] said, when the summer comes, the heat,

128
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.480
the heat killed it.

129
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.800
<v 0>It's not, but it's not the heat it's actually light. So, um,</v>

130
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.580
the nighttime is just as dangerous in the summer. It is,

131
00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:09.220
as it is during the day, it's not heat. It's not a temperature issue.

132
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.780
I'm sure some temperature kills.

133
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.860
<v 1>It. The thing is not real, bro. This is not real real.</v>

134
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.480
It's not real. It is the flu. Yeah, let's do it, dude.

135
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.800
It's not real. You don't think it's real. I think that the flu is real.

136
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.740
I think that people get sick from the flu every year and die.

137
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.140
I think that it's a, it's a bad thing.

138
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.410
I don't think that all of this nonsense is going on and they keep,

139
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.110
keep perpetuating it and keep perpetuating, keep perpetuating. It it's come on.

140
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.100
Well, I just not buying it anymore. I just, you guys, you changed your,

141
00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:44.770
your views. It changed your opinions. It's like,

142
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.280
it's like if you were the writer of a TV show, say friends,

143
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.590
your job would be to write a 30 minute episode that was funny and

144
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.970
intriguing and dramatic and scary or whatever the. And like the,

145
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:01.090
the media just writes an episode.

146
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.300
And then the next day they're like write a new episode and write a new episode

147
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:08.350
and like change their. I understand why he's such. I understand.

148
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.420
<v 0>What you're saying. I'm going to give you a different perspective. Okay.</v>

149
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.100
This is the different perspective.

150
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:17.140
The different perspective is legit biologists have analyzed the actual virus

151
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:20.260
itself and they find all sorts of problems with this virus.

152
00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:22.900
I had Bret Weinstein on the podcast the other day, he's a professor,

153
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.370
a legit biologist.

154
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.260
And he was discussing all of the indicators in the virus

155
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.010
that seemed to point to the fact that this has probably been leaked from a lab.

156
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.400
And he explained it in terms of the way viruses evolve.

157
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.250
I'm going to do a terrible job of paraphrasing it because I'm more on it.

158
00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:42.640
And he's brilliant. But when he says in the long run,

159
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.270
what he's basically saying is this is a very legit virus.

160
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.840
It's very complicated because of the fact that it's been with,

161
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.990
because this is not a virus like, you know,

162
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:57.060
like a regular cold or like else that we've encountered before.

163
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.220
This is something that's really complicated and may have evolved because it came

164
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:06.570
from a lab, his perspective, as it may have evolved to transmit better indoors.

165
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.350
Um, and it's very vulnerable to UV light,

166
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.800
which also might be a part of, you know,

167
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.580
it being from a lab and not something that existed in the wild that actually

168
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:21.900
just jumped from a bat to a pangolin, to a person or what have you.

169
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.850
So legit scientists and biologists who are not a part of the narrative.

170
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.220
They're not working for any government agency.

171
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.750
They're not a part of the news media. That's trying to transmit propaganda.

172
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.730
They are concerned with it.

173
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:38.460
And they're concerned with it for very specific scientific reasons.

174
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.740
Now me as a person who doesn't know what the,

175
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.580
any of that stuff I just said means really? I just repeat it.

176
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.590
It sounds like I'm smart, but they, the,

177
00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:51.830
the smart people actually are worried about it for very specific reasons that it

178
00:09:51.831 --> 00:09:56.190
could explain to you. Now it's not vulnerable for a lot of people.

179
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.110
They're not going to be vulnerable like pro athletes.

180
00:09:58.111 --> 00:10:01.080
We were talking about those NBA players. Get it, listen.

181
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:05.340
Those are top of the food chain, stud athletes. They shake it off.

182
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.910
They're not experiencing any symptoms, you know, over and over and over again.

183
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.790
There's a lot of people that get Intercell bruh shook it off.

184
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.370
There's a lot of people that get it, shake it off. They barely get it.

185
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:18.540
They barely even know they have it, but they're really robust,

186
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.250
healthy people. The concern is people that aren't old people,

187
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.460
people that are vulnerable when they get it, man, they get it bad. And uh,

188
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.370
I was reading an article today about a woman who has been sick with COVID for a

189
00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:30.390
hundred days now.

190
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.900
And she still has days where she has like these horrible flu like symptoms.

191
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.040
And she gets real easy,

192
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.720
but I think she has multiple sclerosis and she's got some other underlying

193
00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:40.411
health conditions.

194
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:43.800
So those people have to really be worried about this because it's not

195
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:46.740
predictable and they don't know how to treat it. Totally.

196
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.700
Especially in the beginning, it turned out when they put people on ventilators,

197
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.020
my buddy, Michael yoga, got it.

198
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.010
And he got it early on and his doctor told him if I put you on a ventilator,

199
00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:59.280
you're probably going to die because your body's going to stop breathing for

200
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:01.880
itself. It's going to let, let the ventilator. I do all the work.

201
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.830
<v 1>The ventilator like, uh,</v>

202
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.730
90% of people put on ventilators for 80,

203
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.230
80% for anything ever die. Is that true?

204
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.760
I don't know. That's what I said, 80 to 80%. So when the question is like,

205
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.940
Como is like, we need 40,000 ventilators. Cause w who are you saving?

206
00:11:19.941 --> 00:11:21.740
When 80% of those people are going to die?

207
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.460
<v 0>Thing is though, like, I think the ventilator, one way you could look at it.</v>

208
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:29.390
The ventilator is such a last ditch effort. That by the time you get to that,

209
00:11:29.391 --> 00:11:30.020
what does that, what do.

210
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.110
<v 1>You want to do? I squad wise. It's cool. Delicious but heavy for you.</v>

211
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.610
<v 0>My friend. Oh good man. He brings his own beer. I come with.</v>

212
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.490
<v 1>All kinds of gifts. Um, oh, I brought you something nice stuff too.</v>

213
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.700
<v 0>Oh, nice dancing about the Dan Bilzerian.</v>

214
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.950
<v 1>Tommy's he's writing a book. He, I think he did write his book. Now.</v>

215
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.670
<v 0>There we go. This is dog stuff, right? Yeah. That one's for a Marshall. Oh, my.</v>

216
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.750
<v 1>Dog's been using it too. It's a really good stuff. Okay, cool. You know, Dan,</v>

217
00:11:58.751 --> 00:11:59.650
everything's the best.

218
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.880
<v 0>Yeah, no, I'm sure he's a,</v>

219
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.800
it's funny how he's jumped balls deep into weed and CBD. Right?

220
00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:10.050
Look at that dog CBD. It even says it on there.

221
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.640
I up with CBD MD and I took some of their dogs. CBD was delicious.

222
00:12:14.641 --> 00:12:18.150
Peanut butter flavor. I think it's fine. I feel sure.

223
00:12:18.151 --> 00:12:21.780
Why not just CBD, but they make it flavors for dogs.

224
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.120
WhatsApp is more

225
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:32.610
generous fellow. Alright. Okay. Cool. CBD and t-shirts and.

226
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.730
What is the bowl for? What is the, all that? What is the.

227
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.670
<v 1>I think it's a goat head Titanic.</v>

228
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.940
I asked him once about it and I can't remember what the answer was,

229
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.040
but I think it's always been like his thing. That's it.

230
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.410
<v 0>That's like a Satan. Right? What is the one? The devil that has the goat head?</v>

231
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.910
Is it Beelzebub? Sounds good. That sounds like that'd be correct.

232
00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.570
All right. Thank you, Dan. Thank you, Satan. No, what is it?

233
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.850
Which one? You gotta be careful. You know,

234
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.480
you get people so high that they get super paranoid and they look down at that

235
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.290
goat. Baphomet oh, Baphomet that's right. I've seen him on things before.

236
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.850
That's like something Duncan would know about.

237
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.400
<v 3>That's what I was trying to think of Dunkin to think of words.</v>

238
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.420
<v 0>Come on, man. Hey Dan, why is that guy on the cover your box?</v>

239
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.090
<v 2>Why is that goat dude with, with Eagle wings, dude ma'am.</v>

240
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.870
<v 0>Oh, that guy is creepy as with this pentagram on his head. Ooh,</v>

241
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.060
interesting.

242
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:37.590
Houston ICU capacity could soon be exceeded as COVID-19

243
00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:38.640
hospitalizations worse.

244
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.450
<v 1>Than, and then all the videos come out and it's like people in, uh,</v>

245
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.710
go into the hospitals and there's no lines that they're trying to make it out to

246
00:13:46.711 --> 00:13:48.030
be. You know, there's a lot of,

247
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.030
there's a lot of fuckery going on with this misinformation and that's,

248
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.260
there's a little bit of that of time. Just the newest of the new,

249
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.050
but there's also.

250
00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.500
<v 0>Real going on. Okay. Dr. Peter Hotez,</v>

251
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.700
he's been on the podcast before national school of tropical medicine diseases,

252
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.510
tropical medicine at Baylor college of medicine. He's a brilliant guy.

253
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.260
<v 3>Yeah. It says the city of Houston, which is known for its, uh,</v>

254
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.620
medical schools has a large concentration of beds and research,

255
00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:14.460
hospitals and whatnot.

256
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.070
And they're very close to running out of all of their ICU beds.

257
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.920
<v 0>He said he called on the state to reimpose more aggressive,</v>

258
00:14:19.921 --> 00:14:24.510
social distancing restrictions. So he's not a, um, he's not a foolish person.

259
00:14:24.511 --> 00:14:28.710
If he's saying this he's a legit scientist and a doctor and he knows a

260
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:31.860
tremendous amount about diseases. I met him many, many years ago.

261
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:39.690
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
