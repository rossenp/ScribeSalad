WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.680
<v 0>Steve a figured it out. He just, he just, that's also.</v>

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.960
<v 1>Steep a like we're getting how you friends a lot of, but that's steep.</v>

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.200
A he's best, the most com you know, accomplished heavyweight of all time.

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.200
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, you have to look at him, his accomplishments,</v>

5
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.600
you look at the guys that he stopped and the guys, he defended his title.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.440
Like Ray stop FIO wins. The title stops. Ster stops June.

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.870
Your do Santos. I mean.

8
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.110
<v 1>The only reason why Stevie doesn't get enough credit as he should is because all</v>

9
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.110
those guys are a step past their prime, right? Like to me. Yeah. The,

10
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.990
and I don't, I love Steve to me, what's more impressive when Kane beat JDS,

11
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.990
that was prime JDS, who was the,

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.060
and Kane put his head right in the middle of his chest and did work after

13
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:44.800
getting knocked out.

14
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.700
<v 0>In the first round Fox in the biggest fight in MMA history. That was.</v>

15
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.500
<v 1>Insane. Insane, insane. Like that, that, to me,</v>

16
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:56.180
that's a little more impressive than what, when, what, when Steve, a beat JDS,

17
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.340
cause that's JDS after an whooping by Kae rounds.

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.970
<v 0>It is more impress, but amount of an whoop been basical.</v>

19
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.290
But's almost as impressive as surviving that first round against Francis.

20
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.530
I don't know who would've agreed. Survived.

21
00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:11.810
There's not a lot of guys that would've survived that round the way steep a did

22
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.730
DC, DC, man. I wonder he.

23
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.530
<v 1>Ate that punch from Anthony rumble. Johnson. How about that kid?</v>

24
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.250
And popped the back up. Yeah. Oh God. Yeah.

25
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.480
<v 0>Jesus Christ. But John owed him.</v>

26
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.840
<v 1>Yeah. It's John Jones. Yeah. John Jones speaks everyone we're talking about.</v>

27
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.440
<v 0>But maybe see the thing about Francis.</v>

28
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.400
I'm very curious to see what he looks like. No, no, not, not what I'm saying.

29
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.720
I'm very curious to see what, what he looks like in this next fight.

30
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.440
Cause we're gonna find a lot about whether or not he's able to correct mistakes,

31
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.760
whether his conditioning is just one of those things with all that fast Twitch

32
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.390
muscle fiber. What, whether he is not gonna be able to go five rounds hard.

33
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.590
<v 1>I don't think he's gonna turn into Nate Diaz. No. You know,</v>

34
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:50.190
or something like that. I, I think it might be a tad better.

35
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.310
The way he could get better is not using all his energy on power punches. Like,

36
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.470
so maybe it's more of a experience thing.

37
00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:57.790
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but with Derek Lewis,

38
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.910
he also pedal to the metal and his hardest too. He does.

39
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.620
And he's been in know he's been in some serious trouble that Travis brown fight

40
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:08.140
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like he was in serious trouble.

41
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.300
<v 0>Man. Yeah. Yeah. He's uh, he's a warrior for sure. I mean,</v>

42
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:16.420
that guy has been in some crazy fights, crazy fights.

43
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.980
He's dangerous. Both are.

44
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.813
<v 1>Super dangerous.</v>

45
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.900
<v 0>I mean, he wants that fight too. Derek Lewis is asking for that fight.</v>

46
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.650
<v 1>They both wanted it. They both wanted that.</v>

47
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.650
<v 0>Fight. This is gonna be crazy. Super.</v>

48
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.483
<v 1>Crazy. I,</v>

49
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.210
I think the craziest thing on the car to me is how many people are riding off

50
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.210
DC. He's the underdog against DBA. Yeah. I have DC beating a man. Do you?

51
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.970
Yeah. I know you hate pigs, but when I, when I break down the fight,

52
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.410
I look at what that's terrible picture makes DBA look super small and DC look

53
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:45.600
giants. Yeah. That's crazy. We got small St. Bay looks.

54
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.560
<v 0>DC. Looks like he's like a gigantic he person.</v>

55
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:49.800
He looks like Brock Lesner D looks.

56
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.560
<v 1>Like five. What are they.</v>

57
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.040
<v 0>Doing? Steve pay looks like a Bantom weight. &lt;laugh&gt; it's hilarious. Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.480
One says 76 inches. One is 71 inches. None of that bothers.

59
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.040
<v 1>Me, man. Like the, the reach, the height,</v>

60
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.360
cuz DC's dealt with that entire career gust. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; John Jones.

61
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:05.400
Luke guys had even bigger.

62
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.080
<v 0>Reaches.</v>

63
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.760
I think also one thing to take into consideration is Steve a doesn't throw a lot

64
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.640
of kicks. He's not a big kicker. Bingo sir. Yeah. He's more of a boxer.

65
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.160
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and um, you know, he's,

66
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.430
DC's also gonna be able to get under him easier mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; than any

67
00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:20.350
guy's ever fought before.

68
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.870
I mean DC's what five 11 mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is he about five 11? If that yeah.

69
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.710
You know he's gonna, and he, he has top of the food chain wrestling, man.

70
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.390
Remember what he did to.

71
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.270
<v 1>Henderson dude and Barnett.</v>

72
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.790
<v 0>Barnett launch Barnett in the air, launched him in the air. slammed him.</v>

73
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.230
Barnett's up big fella. Yeah.

74
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.063
<v 1>And can grapple his.</v>

75
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.700
<v 0>Out. He can grapple his off. And DC took him for a ride son.</v>

76
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.220
But the Henderson fight was the most impressive to me because Henderson,

77
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:47.860
even though he is smaller than DC, he's a stud.

78
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:51.420
And he was an Olympic silver medalist himself and DC just raged.

79
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.060
<v 1>Dolled him. See? And, and people go,</v>

80
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.100
I see some people discredit DC a little bit when they go,

81
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.610
when he won the grand PR in Strikeforce, that was a different time.

82
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:04.130
Those heavyweights were older. And you know, those, the, the games evolved.

83
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.650
When I look at steep, a I'm like heavyweights haven't really evolved that much,

84
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.971
man.

85
00:04:07.971 --> 00:04:11.170
You don't see a guy throwing a lot of kicks and mixing up wrestling jujitsu.

86
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:14.810
Like you look at Steve A's game, it's boxing or wrestling, you know,

87
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.970
that's very similar to what DC's used to beating.

88
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.280
So the times when he is in trouble guy, like John Jones,

89
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.360
who mixes up and he's a nightmare. You're when youre just box.

90
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.160
That's what I'm saying. When you're,

91
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.320
when DC goes in a fight and you're just boxing or wrestling, DC's his,

92
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.440
the reason why DC's gonna go down is one of the greatest of all time is his

93
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:38.600
mental game, bro. He's so his, his fight IQs. Crazy. Yeah.

94
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.310
<v 0>He's tough as. And you know the, like, if you look</v>

95
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.110
who else does it the way John does where they they're really good at everything,

96
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.950
they win by submission. They win by knockout. They win by, you know, mighty.

97
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.790
<v 1>Mouth. You'd have to go all you'd have to go to a lighter.</v>

98
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.190
<v 0>Weight. Those are the two, right?</v>

99
00:04:58.191 --> 00:05:02.860
Because even KA Kane would Moai and Kane would

100
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.580
for sure wrestle in ground in pound, but he never really submitted anybody.

101
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.260
<v 1>No Kane's thing was wrestling to smash you.</v>

102
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.460
<v 0>Yes. Smash outwork. You and yeah. Outwork.</v>

103
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:13.500
You get you to get you exhausted to the point where you didn't,

104
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:15.260
you never even believed you could be that embraced.

105
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.820
<v 1>The grind. Yeah. Which DC has been training with Kane forever for this fight.</v>

106
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:19.900
Yeah. And, and who.

107
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.650
<v 0>Is Kane back now? He training.</v>

108
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.930
<v 1>Yeah. He's helping him. Wow. So, so when I look at that, I go, alright, a,</v>

109
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.570
a Kane style is almost identical to steep. A but steep has a little more power.

110
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.690
Yeah. As far as cardio wrestling. Yeah. Kane's better at those things, man.

111
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.170
Well.

112
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.530
<v 0>Kane was better than anybody that ever lived for like two years.</v>

113
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.810
There was a nightmare. Yeah. There was a Mo I mean,

114
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.800
and he just got injured so many times there was so many injuries with him.

115
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.200
But like when you look at what he was able to do with real

116
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.080
tough guys, just break them down. Real tough guys.

117
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.760
But you know, he's had shoulder surgery back surgery, knee surgery. I mean,

118
00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.761
after a while,

119
00:05:59.761 --> 00:06:04.280
everything was just given out because of the force of his will and his workouts

120
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.360
are so tough. Those guys at AKA, you know,

121
00:06:07.361 --> 00:06:10.440
like Dana was giving them a hard time at one point in time saying something

122
00:06:10.441 --> 00:06:14.040
about, you know, that they they're always getting hurt, but they win.

123
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.000
That's what,

124
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.830
how you get killer is like Kane to get a guy that's got that kind of mind.

125
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.270
He's used to being in that horrible misery of trying to break someone he's used

126
00:06:24.271 --> 00:06:25.510
to it does it all the time. So.

127
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.350
<v 1>Does DC, they all do it all the time. And then DC went all, go there and train.</v>

128
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.030
And remember DC before he went there, he trained with us in Denver. He didn't,

129
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.350
he wasn't that good. You know, lovey is wrestling was ridiculous,

130
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:39.540
but he moved there and then he just followed suit. You got John Fitch,

131
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.740
you got cost check. You got KIB.

132
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.940
<v 0>KIB you Rockhold. Yeah, man, when Rockhold gets people on the ground,</v>

133
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.020
smashes him. When he got Wideman on the ground wide was stuck under a building.

134
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.060
Same thing with Leo Maita. You, you look at him and you go, oh, David Branch,

135
00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:56.420
branch, same thing, black belt gets you down.

136
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.930
And his top game is just murderous. Oh dude.

137
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.890
I heard he's cuz of who he's training. With's training with.

138
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.730
<v 1>Those guys. I, I have friends who,</v>

139
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.090
who are watching him train down in Florida and they were just saying his,

140
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.530
his Jisu, they wouldn't gimme names. They said world class, Jesu guys,

141
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.530
he's up rolling. Like just destroying. No, he's a.

142
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.760
<v 0>He's a freak athlete. He's strong. And he's long. He's got like long leverage,</v>

143
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.040
but he's also got physical.

144
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.800
<v 1>Strength. He was supposed to fight Guin until he hurt his leg. What official?</v>

145
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.520
Uh, he got a huge gash in it. He has staples. I think he posted,

146
00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:29.880
it looks terrible. That would be.

147
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.713
<v 0>An interesting.</v>

148
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.620
<v 1>Gust.</v>

149
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.760
<v 0>Gustin post Amir, no.</v>

150
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.560
<v 1>Time, no time son. So you think.</v>

151
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.270
<v 0>Steve pay and DC goes to DC by decision? Yep. Think he out rustles him.</v>

152
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.630
<v 1>I just think he outworks him.</v>

153
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.430
I think he outworks him and I don't think it's a classic fight.

154
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.590
I just think hopefully more people appreciate DC after this. I,

155
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.750
I look at both of them. They both have to embrace the grind thing as, as,

156
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.950
and as long as DC can avoid that big power punch early on, he's gonna be fine.

157
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.470
And he's so smart, man.

158
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.020
<v 0>Well, I definitely think he's really smart,</v>

159
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.740
but I also think that steep a is a really good striker and he's a bigger guy and

160
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:08.900
he's got a long reach and he's probably one of the best heavyweight strikers

161
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:13.540
that DC's ever fought. He's got real one punch knockout power at heavyweight.

162
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.660
He throws clean shots. He doesn't have any fat in his punches.

163
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.420
He'll stand here like this and drop one in too. He.

164
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.810
<v 1>Credit is his best shot.</v>

165
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.610
<v 0>He's got a chin. He's tough as. He loves being champion. I agree. You know,</v>

166
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:27.970
he might, he might have a lot to prove here and you know,

167
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:30.330
he doesn't throw a lot of kicks, but it doesn't mean he can't.

168
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.850
He can throw 'em if he wants to,

169
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.490
if he thinks that's part of the strategy and he wants to throw head kicks.

170
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.970
I mean, it'd be cool to see. I don't see him kick. Yeah, I have. He can.

171
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.250
<v 1>Kick. He can kick it.</v>

172
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.200
It's a difference between kicking and practice and pulling off against a world

173
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:44.320
class. That's true guy like DC. He's a big guy, man, but,

174
00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:47.720
but DC has tendencies man. And that's where John, that's why John Jones goes,

175
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.680
I'm gonna knock him out by head kick. Cause if you look at the video, DC's here,

176
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.600
he's he's down there, man. He's susceptible to it. So that's why he sees it.

177
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.520
<v 0>But did John fake a right hand and then.</v>

178
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.400
<v 1>Throw that left eye kick. He was setting up, he was throwing to the body,</v>

179
00:09:01.401 --> 00:09:02.480
throwing the body. Yeah.

180
00:09:02.481 --> 00:09:06.000
And then threw it out and then you see DC go over and then it whack.

181
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.280
<v 0>Yeah. See if you could find that clip of John Jones,</v>

182
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.440
KA in DC here it is powerful. Jamie. Oh man. Just land it per

183
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.550
let me say that one more time. First one. Yeah.

184
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.510
<v 1>You, you know what's interest about this.</v>

185
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.870
<v 0>Right? Go, go back to, sorry, go back to the beginning. Watch this. How the.</v>

186
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.350
This only up dude. That was beautiful. The way he did that.

187
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.030
<v 1>That was God. I hope John comes back. It was.</v>

188
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.990
<v 0>Beautiful. There was like no fat in that at all, man. That was.</v>

189
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.460
<v 1>Beautiful. Oh, amazing. Boom. Think how good DC is and for him to do that.</v>

190
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.740
<v 0>Amazing. Ridiculous man. Smashed him. Dude. Look at this.</v>

191
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.313
<v 1>So ridiculous.</v>

192
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.500
<v 0>He took a couple extra shots there that he didn't need to take. Well.</v>

193
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.420
<v 1>There's a lot of. Now they're even going back at it on Twitter. But John Jones.</v>

194
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.100
<v 0>Here.</v>

195
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.970
<v 1>Here, he here's the perfect case scenario. If, if you're, you know,</v>

196
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.690
if you're screw McDuck and you're sitting down and you're looking at the UFC

197
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.130
roadmap, you're like, we love Steve a, he's been a great champion,

198
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.570
but if they could plan it, like you're Vince McMan and WW,

199
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.610
you want DC to win.

200
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.250
And then John to come back and at heavyweight you have DC,

201
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.720
John Jones fight for world title to heavy weight and they have bro gone.

202
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.480
I got next, wait in the back, going I got next

203
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.520
ratings, ratings, ratings, ratings, ratings, ratings, going snitch, take a hike.
