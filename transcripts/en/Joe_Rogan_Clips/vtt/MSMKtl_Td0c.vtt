<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.160
<v 2>Because with COVID,</v>

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.760
there was a sense there's this big,

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.040
bad thing from the outside, this virus, that's coming to get all of us.

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.240
We didn't know a lot about the virus, but the more we find out,

6
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.360
the more we adapt, the more you would think that some,

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.830
these intrusions into our privacy,

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.870
into our Liberty, that that would, you know,

9
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.630
it would stop. And we, we would be able to be free.

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.870
And in some countries, and even in some states here,

11
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:42.540
people are still insisting that the go government has those powers.

12
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.100
The government still has control of, uh,

13
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.020
my husband is from the UK and I just asked, you know,

14
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.780
who has been to see your mother? We call her granny who has been to see granny,

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.380
well, daughter and boyfriend, but they were sitting outside.

16
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.410
Why can't they sit inside? And he says, well,

17
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:11.010
the rules haven't changed yet, but there's something in me that asks myself,

18
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.490
who's enforcing those rules.

19
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.010
<v 1>Yeah. And why in the age of testing are those rules applicable?</v>

20
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.810
Why, why, when you can find out if someone's negative for the, the virus,

21
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.280
why can you keep them from them? Well.

22
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.840
<v 0>The fi so why initially I think we were all in agreement.</v>

23
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.840
It was to curtail yes, the virus,

24
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.400
but why the rules are still in place when the threat is gone.

25
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.480
That's a very good question.

26
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.080
<v 1>Well, why wouldn't we understand what the virus is now?</v>

27
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.310
The rules were put in place when we thought it was the, the black plague.

28
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.310
I mean, we thought it was going to be like the Spanish flu and, and kill a,

29
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.390
a vast majority or a large percentage. Rather the population. It's not,

30
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.830
it's not the same thing. It's still terrible for the people that get it and die.

31
00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:59.710
And the people that have poor health and the people that have underlying

32
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:02.950
conditions and comorbidities, but it's not what we thought it was gonna be,

33
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.380
but we're still treating it. Like we treated it a year ago.

34
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.260
We're looking at it the same way we looked at it in March of last.

35
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.700
<v 0>Year. I think what bothers me. You're absolutely right.</v>

36
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:16.660
But what bothers me now is that it's not even possible to have a debate about

37
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:19.540
that. Right. And, and that's,

38
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.420
so anytime people say you should be suspicious of go,

39
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.370
won't give government any powers because once they have that power,

40
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:27.850
they won't give it back. Yes.

41
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.250
I think those people are being vindicated in the sense that, uh,

42
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.130
and I would say in the past, and of course not,

43
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.130
if there's no need for government to have that power, they'll give it back.

44
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.690
But now there is government wants to just skip the power,

45
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.610
even though the threat is gone.

46
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.680
<v 1>It's just human nature. Yeah. You know, there there's a,</v>

47
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.320
a tremendous drop in cases in Los Angeles.

48
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.640
And yet you still can't go to the gym. You have to eat outside.

49
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.400
And they just opened up eating outside two weeks ago.

50
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.440
<v 0>Yeah. We, we never understood that. Doesn't make sense. It doesn't.</v>

51
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.360
<v 1>Sense spread outside. Well, it doesn't make sense. Uh, yeah. For, for a fact,</v>

52
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.000
I know that they did it for optics because I know someone who works with the

53
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:10.640
government who literally had this conversation with someone saying,

54
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.360
why are we doing this when there's no evidence whatsoever that it spreads

55
00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:19.070
outside? And they said, it's for optics. So they're closing business, sit down.

56
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.470
And they're denying people living for optics.

57
00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:25.910
But what they're doing is they're using power. They have power.

58
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.150
And these are just individuals, they're human beings.

59
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.070
And they're subject to human nature. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

60
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.870
it's human nature to exercise power.

61
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.550
You see that with bosses over employees,

62
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.350
you see that in the Stanford prison experiments,

63
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.540
you see just things that people do.

64
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.780
You give people power over people and they use it.

65
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.020
<v 0>But in this case, when you say optics, what will they use that power for them?</v>

66
00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:51.541
Because, well,

67
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:55.100
the optics is they will be out of power if they carry on like this.

68
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.100
<v 1>I don't know if they will. I don't know if they will,</v>

69
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:03.530
because there's so many people that are so their

70
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.690
cursory understanding of human nature and their lack of

71
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.650
real inquisition,

72
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.490
their lack of real questioning of the government's motives and

73
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.850
also this terrible fear of the virus.

74
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.240
The terrible fear of what it actually is. If you go to Los Angeles today.

75
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.960
And I, when I talk to my friends,

76
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.200
they have a totally different idea of what the virus is than if you're here in

77
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:34.360
Texas. It's one of the things that I noticed immediately, once I came here,

78
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.480
it's one of the reasons why I moved here.

79
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.360
People like they treat it like it's a bad cold. Yeah. Which is what it is.

80
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.750
Yeah. It kills people. But so does the flu,

81
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.430
but we never closed down schools for the flu. The flu actually kills kids. This,

82
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.710
this kills very few children, a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny percentage.

83
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.350
My kids both got it. And they, it was nothing.

84
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.270
It was like a headache was gone in a day.

85
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.180
This is what we're seeing with, with human nature.

86
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.260
When people have the ability to tell people, you can't work,

87
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.820
that's very dangerous. Or to tell someone, your business is not essential,

88
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.660
but target is, well, maybe you have a small store that sells goods.

89
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.250
Well, you can aren't open, but this big store, this big chain. Why? But, well,

90
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.370
they're, they, they're part of special interest groups.

91
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:31.970
They contribute to the politicians. You know, there's unions that are involved.

92
00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:35.290
Like that woman that we were talking about before the show who had a restaurant

93
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:38.730
in Los Angeles, and she had outside dining that she paid,

94
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.640
she paid thousands of dollars that she probably didn't even have

95
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.480
to set this up so she can keep her business afloat. And then they told her,

96
00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:50.640
you have to close down outdoor dining. And across the parking lot,

97
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.160
the television and, and movie studios were allowed to have outdoor dining. Yeah.

98
00:05:56.161 --> 00:06:00.280
Like literally she could walk 10 steps and she could be in their outdoor dining.

99
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.680
And her business is being forced to shut down. It doesn't make any sense. No,

100
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.800
cause it doesn't have to cause it's optics.

101
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.160
They're just giving the optics that they're doing something. The cases rise.

102
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.560
Because here's the thing about lockdowns that have been pretty clearly

103
00:06:13.561 --> 00:06:16.830
established. One of the things that first of all, they Don work.

104
00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:20.510
They don't really curtail the, what they don't really curtail the virus.

105
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.350
But what they do do is they force people inside.

106
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.230
When you force people inside and you force people to congregate,

107
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.950
it spreads easier. It spreads. And that's part of the problem.

108
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.230
<v 0>It's it spreads easier inside than it does outside. Yes.</v>

109
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.980
<v 1>It doesn't. There's no evidence, no real evidence that it does spread out. Yeah.</v>

110
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.020
But it does spread inside. And so you force people inside.

111
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:45.300
You tell people they can't work and they're all congregated together inside.

112
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.380
Yes. Inside. And they're more fearful.

113
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.060
They're not getting vitamin D they're not getting sun.

114
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:51.220
They're not getting exercise.

115
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.020
<v 0>You have more domestic violence. Yes.</v>

116
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.300
<v 1>And more mental health issues, more suicide and all that.</v>

117
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:59.970
Stuff's through the roof and, and more drug addictions and more drug overdoses.

118
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.163
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and all those

119
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.970
problems that they don't get calculated in,

120
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.370
in the risk assessment. When you're talking about the risk of the virus,

121
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.370
there's a lot of other risks. There's a lot of other problems. Yeah.

122
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.050
And the government doesn't give a about that. They,

123
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.240
they keep paid no matter what, when they close down these businesses,

124
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.720
I think the government, I think the state, I think the, the governor,

125
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.280
and I think the, the mayor,

126
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.480
they should be paid proportionately with the amount of money that's generated

127
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.720
by the businesses. Particularly the businesses that are forced to close.

128
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.750
You see how quick everything opens up. &lt;laugh&gt; it'll open up like that. Yeah.

129
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.750
See how quick everything opens up. If you give people the freedom to go places,

130
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.030
you don't have to go to these restaurants.

131
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.350
If you're worried about catching COVID, you don't have to go to the gym.

132
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.190
If you're worried about catching it, you can stay home. You can social distance.

133
00:07:53.191 --> 00:07:55.910
You can wear mask. You can exercise in the park, out in nature,

134
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.990
but you can't because the Park's shut because they're worried about COVID. Yeah.

135
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.540
Like these are some of the rules that the people have had to deal with over this

136
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:05.780
past year. Yeah. Nonsensical rules. Like you can't go to the park. You got,

137
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:07.980
you can't go to the beach. It's nonsense.

138
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.900
It's and everybody knows it's nonsense.

139
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.180
And it's not science based when they say follow the science. Well,

140
00:08:13.181 --> 00:08:15.780
you're not following the science. Cuz if you did follow the science,

141
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.260
you'd let people do anything they wanted outside because the science,

142
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.730
it shows it doesn't spread outside. Well.

143
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:26.010
<v 0>If you follow the sign, you would say, let us have a debate.</v>

144
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.850
And you would have an open debate where you let both sides speak out.

145
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.650
Yes. What we are now seeing.

146
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.290
And it is absolutely horrifying is that you let one side,

147
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.530
the side, that's speaking for lockdown,

148
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.920
invoke science and say the science says lockdown.

149
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.240
But the other scientists who are saying no, not so fast,

150
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.000
and those ones are not allowed to speak. I have a colleague Scott Atlas, uh,

151
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.320
at the Hoover institution.

152
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.160
And he's made a few points about why some of the things that we're being told to

153
00:08:57.161 --> 00:08:59.440
do are not actually supported by science,

154
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.320
but people like him can't get their voices out because they're demonized,

155
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.640
demonized shut out, kicked out of the whole, uh, debate. And,

156
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.800
and I think we can't go on like this. No.

157
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.430
<v 1>No we can't. And it's, it's, it's forcing a,</v>

158
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.950
a massive divide in our country and it's,

159
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.790
