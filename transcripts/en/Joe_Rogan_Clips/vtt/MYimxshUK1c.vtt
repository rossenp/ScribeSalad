00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.840
<v 2>And the other thing is, I don't know if you're familiar with this,</v>

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.640
but there's now a connection between quantum computing and black holes.

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.680
Yeah. Yeah. What's that connection? It's a weird one. So it's all weird. Well,

5
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.720
this is like hyper. This is like weird squared or, or something,

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.550
but work over the last 20 has established that when you have a

7
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:26.630
black hole, actually even more general systems, but talk about a black hole.

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.230
There's an alternate description of a black hole in terms of what's known as the

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.990
whole graphic description.

10
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.310
It's as if there's a two dimensional world that surrounds any given three

11
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:42.220
dimensional world that has exactly the same physics as the three dimensional

12
00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:43.340
world that we're familiar with.

13
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.700
And yet it describes it in a completely different language.

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.580
So a black hole gravity is obviously essential. That's how a black hole forms,

15
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.700
but in this dictionary that physicists have developed,

16
00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:56.540
there's a description of a black hole that doesn't involve.

17
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.420
<v 1>Gravity only involves quantum mechanics.</v>

18
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.050
And the beautiful thing is the quantum processes in that quantum

19
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.013
world

20
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.690
mimic the kinds of processes that people have been developing for quantum

21
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.170
computing, quantum error, correction code,

22
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.370
and there's a dictionary that people have proposed for that quantum language

23
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.730
on the holographic boundary with physics in the interior.

24
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.880
And the dictionary shows that the quantum error correcting code may be the

25
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.920
reason why space time itself holds together.

26
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.080
So there's this bizarre way in which everything that we know about in the world

27
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:39.000
around us has a translated dictionary version in a different world that

28
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.440
lacks gravity, but has quantum mechanics. And so people are,

29
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.390
are using some of the insights from quantum computing to

30
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:52.150
understand questions about black holes in space time. So as.

31
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.670
<v 0>Is that strange, that's so strange.</v>

32
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.990
So as quantum computing expands much like as computing

33
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.870
expands, if you go back to the early NASA, computers are filled up a whole room,

34
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.740
we can extrapolate that as we get better at this,

35
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.980
and you look 50 years down the line from now,

36
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.980
quantum computing will be the standard to be the norm. Yep.

37
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.260
And it would probably radically alter our understanding of.

38
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.100
<v 1>Everything, including black holes, including black holes. That's right.</v>

39
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.820
So there's a real possibility that the language that we use for

40
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.650
space time and black holes may bear a profound imprint

41
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.930
of the language that we are developing to understand quantum computing,

42
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:32.370
quantum computers. I was just.

43
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.410
<v 0>Reading some article about black holes roaming through the universe and that</v>

44
00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:37.970
some of them, some of 'em they're detached from.

45
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.690
<v 1>Galaxies, right? They can be, I mean,</v>

46
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.640
oftentimes people think about black holes as these Gargan S

47
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.040
that form from collapsed stars.

48
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.720
There's a big one in the center of our milk away.

49
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.920
Galaxy weighs 4 million times out of the sun,

50
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.320
the photograph of a black hole in the galaxy M 87 that got the world excited

51
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.600
a couple of years back, 55 million light years away,

52
00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:04.400
billions of times the mass of the sun. But the reality is anything.

53
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.560
If you compress it enough, becomes a black hole.

54
00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:11.320
If you take an orange and you squash an orange down sufficiently small,

55
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.640
according to Einstein, it becomes a black hole.

56
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.360
So these things don't have to be Gargan. When the flip side of it,

57
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.910
we also typically have an intuition that black holes are really dense, right?

58
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.550
That's usually the way we think about them.

59
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.630
But if you make something sufficiently large,

60
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.430
regardless of how low its density is, it will also become a black hole.

61
00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:34.870
So you can make a black hole out of air by just having enough air.

62
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.910
If you have enough air sufficiently large sphere of air,

63
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.220
it would become a black hole too, with the density of air.

64
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.700
So all the intuitions that we typically have about black holes,

65
00:03:46.701 --> 00:03:51.460
that they have to be dense and they have to be gargantuan, not right.

66
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.390
So.

67
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.060
<v 0>Black holes are just a part of the elemental structure of reality</v>

68
00:03:57.061 --> 00:03:57.490
itself.

69
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.810
<v 1>Yeah. When you look at Einstein's equation, right in his mathematics,</v>

70
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.610
there's a little formula that you can see where it says,

71
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.530
if you have any mass M whatever mass you want,

72
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.570
and you squeeze it into a radius, R that's less than two times,

73
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.290
Newton's constant two G times M divided by C squared speed of light

74
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:21.000
squared, a formula details. Don't matter. You take any mass.

75
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.160
If the radius within which that mass sits is less than two GM overseas squared,

76
00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:29.520
it is a black hole period. End of story. According to Einstein now,

77
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.040
Einstein left out quantum mechanics weirdly, right?

78
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:37.280
Because his Nobel prize was for quantum mechanics. It was for a paper.

79
00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:39.640
He wrote 19 to five about the photo electric effect,

80
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:44.230
but he never really believed that quantum mechanics was the true

81
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:46.150
description of the world.

82
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.630
And when he was developing the general theory of relativity,

83
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.150
he was just thinking about gravity and not quantum mechanics.

84
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.830
Stephen Hawking came along in 1974 and started to inject quantum mechanics into

85
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:58.430
our understanding of things like black holes.

86
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.020
And that's where Hawking proved that black holes are not completely black.

87
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.780
He showed that black holes allow a certain amount of radiation to leak out of

88
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:09.500
their surface, leak out of the event,

89
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.940
arrives and or leak out from just beyond the edge of the event horizon. And so,

90
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.980
yes, when you think about black holes, as far as we can tell,

91
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:19.740
they are a fundamental quality of the world,

92
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.810
but you have with quantum physics to truly understand them.

93
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.650
And that's the cutting edge of what's happening right now. So.

94
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.810
<v 0>They're a fundamental quality of the world,</v>

95
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.570
but they're also in the center of every galaxy.

96
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.050
<v 1>It seems to be the case.</v>

97
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.130
The Sloan digital sky survey did a wonderful study of

98
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.170
a vast number of galaxies.

99
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.080
And I've seen wonderful images where they put like a little red circle around

100
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.440
all those galaxies that have a black hole in their center.

101
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.200
And there are red circles all over that imagery.

102
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.920
So it seems to be a ubiquitous quality that black holes are at the center of

103
00:05:55.921 --> 00:06:00.120
galaxies. And those are typically gargantuan black holes, millions,

104
00:06:00.121 --> 00:06:03.520
or billions of times the mass of the sun. Do we know.

105
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.400
<v 0>Why they exist at the center of.</v>

106
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.800
<v 1>A galaxy? You know,</v>

107
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:10.840
there's still a lot of uncertainty about gala galactic formation. You know,

108
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.080
some have suggested that early stars,

109
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.630
which were quite compared to more modern stars when they

110
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.150
exhausted their nuclear fuel. And they collapsed in on each other.

111
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.110
They created black holes that were large,

112
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.710
and then they continue to suck in more material from the environment and they

113
00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:30.390
grew larger and larger still.

114
00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:34.070
So that's sort of one rough way that people think about how these massive,

115
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.100
enormous black holes may have formed, but it's uncertain and LIGO, you know,

116
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:43.180
this laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory, gravitational waves.

117
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.860
It, it took headlines a few years ago when it detected the first ripples in the

118
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:51.260
fabric of space, it detected them from two black holes.

119
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.140
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that were 1.4 billion light years away,

120
00:06:55.141 --> 00:06:58.810
like 1.4 billion years ago, rotating around each other,

121
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.850
going near the speed of light slamming into each other,

122
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.210
creating a tidal wave in the fabric of space that rippled outward at the speed

123
00:07:06.211 --> 00:07:08.410
of light. Part of it raced toward planet earth.

124
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.330
There wasn't anybody on planet earth to see it at that moment,

125
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.250
but it had 1.4 billion year journey to traverse it raced toward planet

126
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.120
earth. When it's about a hundred thousand light years away,

127
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.320
grazes the Milky way gala, he continues to race toward earth.

128
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.480
When it's a hundred light years away,

129
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.440
a guy named Albert Einstein writes down equations that suggest there could be

130
00:07:28.441 --> 00:07:30.040
these gravitational waves, unknown.

131
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:32.480
That one is already racing toward the planet, right?

132
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.600
And they continues to race on we two light days.

133
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.510
It's two light days away when they turn on the new fine version of the LIGO

134
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:45.350
detector. And two days later that wave rolls by planet or shakes two detectors.

135
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:46.184
One of the Louisiana,

136
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.550
they were Washington state giving us the first direct detection of ripples in

137
00:07:50.551 --> 00:07:53.350
the fabric of space and establishing that the story that I told you is true.

138
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.590
Wow. You know, so, so these things are,

139
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.740
are real they're out there that wild. And,

140
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.780
and before the direct radio telescopic imagery from the event horizon telescope

141
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.500
of the black hole in M 87,

142
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.100
that ripple on the fabric space was the most direct evidence that black holes

143
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.260
are real because when you took the way that the machine in Louisiana,

144
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:18.580
Washington, it twitched for just, you know, a tiny fraction of a second,

145
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.890
when you've figured out using supercomputers,

146
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.410
what the cause of the wave must have been.

147
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:29.370
You are led to two black holes that are 28 and 31 times

148
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.650
the mass of the sun are 36 times the mass of the sun numbers of that sort.

149
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.570
And that was the only explanation for the data. And so there's this beautiful,

150
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.200
indirect proof that stellar size black holes

151
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.120
are actually out there. And then of course,

152
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:47.000
we take a photograph of one in a nearby galaxy.

153
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.040
<v 0>So do we know why black holes would collide with each other?</v>

154
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.440
Are they attracted to each other because of their masks?

155
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.520
<v 1>It's a good question. Yeah. So certainly that is part of it.</v>

156
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.640
So binary star systems are not uncommon.

157
00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:04.040
They're fairly common where two stars will be orbiting around each other.

158
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.920
If those two stars exhaust their nuclear fuel,

159
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:11.080
they can each collapse to a black hole. That's one possibility,

160
00:09:11.081 --> 00:09:14.320
or could be a black holes wandering through and capture.

161
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.350
There's another black hole. It's a possibility too. I mean, the thing,

162
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.990
go ahead and ask you a question about it's one point I wanna make as well,

163
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.110
which is, well, wasn't that please go. Yeah. Well,

164
00:09:23.111 --> 00:09:27.030
it was just that many people have in mind that black hole sort of reach out and

165
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:28.510
grab everything in. Yeah.

166
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.470
But a black hole of mass M a black hole whose mass is the same as the sun has

167
00:09:33.471 --> 00:09:36.420
the same gravitational pull the sun. It's not,

168
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.820
it doesn't pull any harder than the sun.

169
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.540
It's just that you can get closer to it because it's so small.

170
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.860
And therefore you can experience the gravity more strongly, but you know,

171
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.020
a brick of mass M and a black hole of mass M they exert the same.

172
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.500
<v 0>Gravitational pull. Okay.</v>

173
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:56.930
So we have this misconception that black holes are always these super massive

174
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.650
objects that have incredible amounts of gravity. Yeah.

175
00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:02.810
And they're sucking in planets and stars and turning them out,

176
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.010
cuz we're thinking of massive black holes.

177
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:07.850
Like the super massive black holes are at the center of the galaxy. Yeah.

178
00:10:07.851 --> 00:10:11.530
Which is like, what, one half of 1% of the mass, the galaxy. Well.

179
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.250
<v 1>Let's see. So if, if our galaxy has say, uh,</v>

180
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.880
a hundred sons, you know,

181
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.880
and that guy is about 4 million times the mass. So the son, yeah.

182
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.960
You're talking about, you know, a thousandth or something of that sort.

183
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.400
<v 0>Isn't that crazy when you say that a hundred billion sons and you have to wrap</v>

184
00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:32.160
your head around the idea of a hundred billion stars and that's,

185
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.560
and that's just our little puny little galaxy. Well, that's a thing there.

186
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.310
<v 1>Isn't that crazy. At least a hundred billion galaxies, at least.</v>

187
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.830
And this is just in the observable of universe. I mean,

188
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:44.990
do you know if you take your thumb and you put your thumb on a nice clear night

189
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.550
and you block out a thumbnail worth of the sky,

190
00:10:48.551 --> 00:10:50.990
you're blocking at about 10 million galaxies. &lt;laugh&gt;.

191
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.380
<v 0>It's so crazy. It's so crazy. When, because those numbers, I,</v>

192
00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.820
I hear you say those numbers. I can repeat those numbers,

193
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.300
but I don't think I'm really internalizing them.

194
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.780
<v 1>You can because they're so non-human scale, right? Yeah.</v>

195
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.300
We've just never experienced anything like that at all.

196
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.740
And it could be that it's infinite space could go on infinitely far.

197
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.300
It could be that the galaxies continue onward infinitely far.

198
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.330
And therefore the numbers we're talking about could be minuscule on the scale of

199
00:11:22.331 --> 00:11:24.330
the fullness of reality.
