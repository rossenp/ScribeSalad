1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, I'm going to train hop. I'm going to hitchhike. Um,</v>

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.130
vice gave me like one of the first vice shows was thumbs up. I, uh,

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.780
Gavin McInnes, uh, Shane Smith, those guys I used to, uh,

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.300
I've been writing and drawing. So I found.

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.440
<v 1>Out about you really? Yeah. I found out about you from, well, from two places,</v>

6
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:25.550
one from Bordain, but two from a video that I watch of you going to the Congo,

7
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.930
looking for a dinosaur, that was the first thing I ever saw of you.

8
00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:34.610
I think that's like, then I talked to Bordain about you and he was like,

9
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:39.020
you got to talk to this guy, you got to meet him. And when I saw your show,

10
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:41.060
I was like, look at this dude, this is crazy.

11
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:43.850
He's looking for a Brontosaurus in the middle of the Congo.

12
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.030
<v 0>In 1994, I was living in Israel,</v>

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.230
in a farm called Vermont Hako Vish. And it was a kibbutz.

14
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.420
And to live on the kibbutz, you have to work.

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.130
And I was the illegal immigrant there. So I'm trying, I have no money.

16
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.520
So I'm making enough working on the farm just to live on the farm.

17
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.830
And at this point I'm 18 years old. I've been hitchhiking since I was 15.

18
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.740
And I've seen the whole world I've hitchhiked through Europe,

19
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:14.180
I've hitchhiked through the U S back and forth. And I'm bored.

20
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.030
This is in 19. I'm like what? You go to the Eiffel tower. You take that same,

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.260
like, right. Well, what haven't we done yet? We've, it's all mapped out.

22
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.070
We've been to everywhere. We've seen everything. We've done everything. I I'm,

23
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.880
uh, I have a heart of a, an Explorer. I want, I want to find new things,

24
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.190
you know? And so I'm living on this kibbutz.

25
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:37.940
Most of the other people that are from Australia and South Africa.

26
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.270
And what I love about them is they're so racist that they don't even know

27
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:43.760
they're racist. Like I'm the only Asian guy there. And they're like,

28
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.050
Nintendo second Genesis. Like, I'm like, I got a name and they're like, no,

29
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:49.670
your name's Nintendo. I'm like, okay.

30
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.920
And so I'm working illegally in a casino,

31
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.100
illegally at a wedding catering place, and then working on this farm.

32
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.790
So I have three jobs I'm making like, you know, under the table.

33
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.010
And there's a library on the farm of books that have been left behind

34
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:10.580
by past travelers. And of course there's a old, um,

35
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.850
from the seventies or eighties, national geographic catalog.

36
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.180
And I start reading about mocha and Monday,

37
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.560
I don't know if that's how you say it, but it's scientists,

38
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.570
national geographic people have spotted this Brontosaurus thing in the Congo.

39
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.640
And it's still there in the Congo is still it's the heart of darkness.

40
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.520
And I got to find this thing. I got to go there. Like I was, I was, how old.

41
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.100
<v 1>Are you at the time I was 18. You decided you were going to go there.</v>

42
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.770
I was like, I have to go there. How old were you when you went? Did.

43
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.880
<v 0>They teach you? Oh, it was no, no. And then vice I'll I'll,</v>

44
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.610
I'll bring it back to how that turned into vice. But so I,

45
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.290
I get on a plane and tons of lying and manipulating to get the visa,

46
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.830
because it was an open to tourism. It was only open for two business. And so I,

47
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.830
I make up this story that, uh, I'm, uh, a body guard to a toothpaste executive.

48
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.020
And I work day and night to get a ticket to the Congo. And there's no tickets,

49
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.430
it's this airline Aeroflot and I'm in Israel, which is close to Africa.

50
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.010
But because it's this Russian airline I get on this flight,

51
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.630
it goes to Moscow and then Malta and then like six other African

52
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:22.150
countries. And then it lands in Brazzaville. How long?

53
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.790
Like three days almost like, like, and like a shaky airplane, you know? And,

54
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:32.080
and you know, everyone in there is the ones that got to get out, right.

55
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:35.170
So when they're coming back to bringing chickens and goats and all kinds of on

56
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:40.150
the plane, and it smells like, and I don't know, this is pre-internet right.

57
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.240
I don't have any information on the Congo, except for,

58
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.340
I heard that there's a dinosaur there. What year?

59
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.870
94, 94, 95. I lost track of time,

60
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:52.750
but it was right after high school. So 18, 17,

61
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.210
you don't have a cell phone either. No cell phone, nothing.

62
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.760
And the second I get off the plane, it smells horrible.

63
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.620
Cause they're just burning trash everywhere. And it's hot and it's oppressive.

64
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.170
And I go, what the am I doing right here?

65
00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:13.650
And everyone there asked me, what are you doing here? They don't speak English.

66
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.970
They speak French. I didn't know that they're in the middle of a civil war.

67
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.660
Uh, I think the two factions were called the ninjas and the cobras,

68
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.450
like little kids shooting at night death.

69
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.900
Every third bullet is like a tracer bullet. So it looks like fireworks. I go,

70
00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:29.670
what is that? And they're like, oh, they're just shooting into the air.

71
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.790
First breakout of Ebola, malaria. And

72
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.110
people go, why did you do that? That's not normal behavior. And I go,

73
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.680
the LA riots happened in 1992.

74
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.750
I watched normal civilization, normal civil

75
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.270
manners. Yeah. This is how people are. You go to a story.

76
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.040
I saw that crumble overnight in one night, it went from, you,

77
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.660
everything. That's burned down. That's Rob pillage, steal everything. I go, oh,

78
00:05:05.661 --> 00:05:09.170
it could happen that fast. And once again, that same kind of, oh,

79
00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:13.490
I think I'm accepted in this country. I think people like me for me.

80
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.970
And it's like, no, we don't want you get the. Go back to where you come from.

81
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.030
So I think, you know,

82
00:05:20.031 --> 00:05:23.270
and I could go on and on about all the traumas I've experienced in my life,

83
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.030
but I hurt people, hurt people. I was in a lot of pain. I was like,

84
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.380
I didn't like Korean people. I didn't like myself. I didn't like,

85
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.250
I'd experienced a lot of, lot of abuse from black people.

86
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.450
And I just wanted to, I didn't know anything. There was no internet.

87
00:05:38.451 --> 00:05:42.410
I didn't like, I felt like an alien. I I'm like I don't belong anywhere.

88
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.880
I just, so I would go, everyone goes,

89
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:50.400
don't go to Bosnia. Don't go to the Congo.

90
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.880
Don't go to the Gaza strip and I'm to I'm going to go every place.

91
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.030
My life has been very reactionary. Right? My life has been,

92
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.920
you don't tell me what to do. You don't tell me how to podcast.

93
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:04.430
I'm going to stick a butt plug in my, you know, I'm going to do what you know.

94
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.720
So I'm in the Congo and

95
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.590
it's in a full blown war. There's people being, um, uh, we and everything.

96
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.090
One's.

97
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.540
<v 1>Like, who are you? Oh my God. Who is this Asian here?</v>

98
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.480
<v 0>Like I had my hair dyed then too. And they,</v>

99
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.670
and so I could go and tell a million stories about the Congo, but at some point.

100
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.540
<v 1>Why you were looking for this Brontosaurus for real,</v>

101
00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:32.550
or you just wanted to go to the condo one as well.

102
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.520
<v 0>What? I know the kids like to say 100%. I've heard you say it too. Yeah.</v>

103
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.900
Why? Why not? 99% just to leave 1% for 99%.

104
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.570
I was there for the dinosaur. Like,

105
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.010
like I was so young and dumb and stupid and ignorant where

106
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.290
I truly, truly thought I was going to find it. Like,

107
00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.270
I didn't know enough about like the everything made sense to me

108
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.320
because anyone listening to this right now,

109
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.300
we're talking about a story from 20 years ago. Right? Right. I was a stupid kid.

110
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.370
I believed in Santa Claus very late, you know, like, uh, I was a bed wetter.

111
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.260
I I'm up, man. So when I finally did get to the jungle,

112
00:07:19.261 --> 00:07:22.290
I got out of Brazzaville. I got up and I got to, um,

113
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.080
this jungle area called waySo.

114
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.990
Then I believed because the spiders are this big and the frogs are this big.

115
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.340
And how big are the frog? Just everything is, looks insane.

116
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.910
The snakes, they got snakes out here this big, like, it was like, okay.

117
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:43.410
Now I believe like every year scientists were finding a new species of something

118
00:07:43.411 --> 00:07:48.300
that they thought was gone and I'm like, okay, the, and it's. And then,

119
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.440
and then, and then I meet the Pygmies. Whoa. And that was,

120
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:53.880
ah.

121
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.700
I don't know what version of the story I should tell because it can get so dark.

122
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.460
I met a German guy named, named, ah. I shouldn't say his name.

123
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.750
I met a German guy there who was the same age as me. And he could,

124
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.960
this is in the city. And then he could tell that I was lost.

125
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.420
I didn't know who this guy was.

126
00:08:12.421 --> 00:08:16.260
He was being groomed to be like the next big politician in Frankfurt or

127
00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:19.530
something. Right. And so I didn't, I didn't get this until later,

128
00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:23.760
but he was here as his like sex vacation to as many black.

129
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.250
He liked black women. So he's going to as many

130
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.481
curb,

131
00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:35.310
your language days to have as many intimate relations with women as possible.

132
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.460
Is that better? No, I'm trying. I'm trying to be better for myself.

133
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.840
That's what I'm trying to do is better.

134
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.770
<v 1>You're explaining what it was. It's not a bad, that's.</v>

135
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.550
<v 0>What he was doing. So I figure it. So he sees me as another young guy.</v>

136
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.480
<v 1>To explain things accurately. You know.</v>

137
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.070
<v 0>You could use other words though. Yeah. But that's what it is, right?</v>

138
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.430
It is what it, it is. But I, I, I can, I can come off.

139
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.730
I can turn people off when I use that language. I want, who are these people?

140
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.950
People that don't like you? No, no, there, there are people that they want.

141
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.270
<v 1>Dave. No swear. Dave.</v>

142
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.740
I came here for G-rated days and I want my money to be G rated.

143
00:09:15.741 --> 00:09:19.910
I'm just trying to [inaudible] Dave. That's what I was signing up for.

144
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.890
Occasionally the word. PG 13. They have like rules. Right? Do you need like two.

145
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.980
<v 0>99%. Okay. So, um.</v>

146
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.890
<v 1>This author, there was a real dinosaur in there.</v>

147
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.210
And when you got there and you saw the big frogs and the big snakes, I'm like.

148
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.340
<v 0>Yeah, maybe it is. And what happens is we,</v>

149
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.860
we go to the last spotting of it. Right.

150
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.930
And then I meet any evidence at all. Like everyone I talked to.

151
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.790
Oh yeah, yeah. We seen it. Like there's no like, no, that's crazy.

152
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.090
Every person I meet is like, oh yeah, it's in the, in the last. So.

153
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.900
<v 1>Is it one of those things where realistically,</v>

154
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:01.940
there's not a whole lot of people look anyway.

155
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.140
<v 0>No, but there are scientists that go out there. And in the meantime,</v>

156
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.070
I've never seen anyone murdered before, until I got here. Right.

157
00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:11.180
I've been through the LA riots.

158
00:10:11.181 --> 00:10:13.760
I've seen things broken and burned down and guns pointed,

159
00:10:13.761 --> 00:10:17.960
but I've never seen anyone hung. I've never seen anyone stoned to death. And I,

160
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.120
and it's absolute chaos. I'm seeing people murdered. I'm scared for my life.

161
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.320
I got attacked one time. So I go, I need to find it.

162
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:28.970
Now I have to find this dinosaur.

163
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.050
And I also know that there's a chance that I might never go home again.

164
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.470
So I write a letter to my parents. They don't know where I am.

165
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.440
They think I'm in Israel on this farm. Like I didn't tell anybody.

166
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.970
So I wrote my parents this long letter of, I love you guys.

167
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.750
I'm about to embark on a journey to find a dinosaur.

168
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.550
And I sent it at the airport before I got on the plane to the jungle.

169
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.440
I have no money. I have only one change of clothes. I've blonde hair. And I,

170
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:02.570
I go into the jungle and we get lost immediately. I'm a city,

171
00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:05.720
boy, what the hell do I know about the jungle? What do I know about the jungle?

172
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.770
Where.

173
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.140
<v 1>Were you? Did you have any direction? Nothing.</v>

174
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.380
<v 0>I just, I just knew what, you know,</v>

175
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.810
you know what landed in the jungle.

176
00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:18.980
There was a guy that I think I want to say his name is Chris.

177
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.270
That was a peace Corps guy. And he was there to help build welds and uh,

178
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.320
this bond to village. And he said, the place, what you guys are looking for.

179
00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:29.270
And he's like, it's a, you're not gonna find a time. You know,

180
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:34.010
he was like the reasonable one. And I go, how do I know if you don't try?

181
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.240
You know, I still believed,

182
00:11:35.241 --> 00:11:40.100
I still wanted to believe I was willing to risk my life for it.

183
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.840
So we get, I haven't told this story in so long. So we get to the jungle and,

184
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.620
and we start walking. There's a minor trail. And then it disappears.

185
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.740
It's just gone. And I'm like, we're lost in the jungle.

186
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.330
We're lost in the jungle. So yeah,

187
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.960
I'm with this guy that,

188
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.900
that what we told people, he was here to as many women as possible.

189
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.400
But we went with the story of,

190
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:10.290
he is the toothpaste executive and I'm his bodyguard. That's a fake story.

191
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:15.030
Right. As we're lost in the jungle, he starts to think that story is real. Hey,

192
00:12:15.031 --> 00:12:18.780
go fetch me a pineapple. I go, dude, I'm not your he's like,

193
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.300
you're not a real executive bro. Like I'm not going to get.

194
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.230
And he starts like telling me like, like, I'm like, Hey, you know,

195
00:12:25.231 --> 00:12:28.440
that was a fake story. Right? Like he's like, and, and there's no one around.

196
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.650
So we get lost for days.

197
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.410
And he starts to really be like humiliating towards me and right on

198
00:12:37.411 --> 00:12:40.830
my nerves. And we had rations,

199
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.360
we went in with some crackers and some like tuna in a canned thing. And I go,

200
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.880
Hey, man, we're lost. I don't know how to survive.

201
00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:51.750
We need a rash in this food out. I come, he had it all. He ate it all

202
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.020
well. And, and, and, and now, like,

203
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.800
have you ever been in that kind of situation where you're like,

204
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.680
I'm going to die here? Like I'm never going to like hope is gone.

205
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.300
Like I'm in a thick, thick Congolese jungle. Like, I don't know how to get out.

206
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.600
And we've been lost for days. Like, I don't know how to survive.

207
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.950
I don't know how to like, I, this is it. You know?

208
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.510
And on top of it, I have this German. Who's like talking down to me,

209
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.850
making fun of me and eating my rations.

210
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.980
Like I would pump all the water and put the waterproof vacation tablets and he'd

211
00:13:28.981 --> 00:13:31.170
be like, thanks. And I'm like, dude, what the, man?

212
00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:35.760
Like I did all that work so we could share it. And so he was just,

213
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.580
he was a Dick. And so man.

214
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.730
<v 1>And you're stuck in that. You've been in a jungle like that before. No.</v>

215
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.430
<v 0>Dude. So we set up a tent, we have one tent. And so we're,</v>

216
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:49.050
we're in close quarters with each other at night.

217
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.890
The moon is like this big, like it's humongous.

218
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.510
And you hear the entire jungle come alive, like monkeys.

219
00:13:57.511 --> 00:14:01.620
And like things are bumping into the tent at night, like huge insects. And like,

220
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:06.900
and I'm like, I'm, I'm S I'm like, I'm gonna die here. I'm going to die here.

221
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:12.570
So the few times in my life where I've been in this kind of hopeless situation,

222
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.130
the only thing that's going to get me out of it is if I can control my mind.

223
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.050
Cause if I, cause I'm fat, I'm like falling into despair. And in the daytime,

224
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.550
I'm doing standup to the trees.

225
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.550
Cause we're just walking in like circles and I'm like, Hey,

226
00:14:26.551 --> 00:14:28.110
how are you guys doing all tonight? You know, you.

227
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.790
<v 1>Don't know where you are. I don't know where I am.</v>

228
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.270
I'm talking to the vegetation. Oh my God. And.

229
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.850
<v 0>This guy is riding my last nerve and he's.</v>

230
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.090
And so I could safely say I lost my mind.

231
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:44.250
And so we're down to our last food and he and I,

232
00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:48.840
and he did it again. And I said, bro, what the did I tell you?

233
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.240
We got to make this last I'm starving,

234
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.550
ate the rations that were supposed to that was it. And he's like, whatever.

235
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.010
And he's, he has a more like dissociated,

236
00:14:58.011 --> 00:15:00.800
like checked out like w like we'll get out of here somehow.

237
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.290
And part of, I dunno, his coping thing was to like talk down to me or whatever.

238
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.820
And so that night, and we're were lost at this point a week and a half.

239
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:14.840
Maybe we haven't, you know, I'm 90 pounds. I've lost all this weight.

240
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:20.090
I'm going to kill this guy. I'm going to murder him. I'm going to murder him.

241
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.290
Cause I don't like people talking to me like that. I don't like,

242
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:27.230
I've been a punching bag for this guy for four weeks now.

243
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.790
And I'm just going to kill him. And if I have to eat him to survive,

244
00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:36.110
I guess I'll do that. And so he's out cold. He's got crumbs on his face,

245
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.420
tuna juice from the food that was supposed to be shared. And I pick up,

246
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:44.360
I go outside the tent and I pick up, I pick up a huge rock,

247
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.590
like bigger than this. And I go, I'm gonna kill this guy.

248
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.660
I have officially lost my mind. Like I can't,

249
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.440
I'm barely going to survive. I can't do it here with this guy.

250
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:03.050
So he's Sal was looking at his face and I pick up the rock and I go

251
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.120
just like, I don't even have to apply any pressure if I just drop it, he's done.

252
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.620
Like, he'll, he'll be dead.

253
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.640
And I go off. Is there anything left? Is there any common sense?

254
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.950
Is there any light left in my, uh,

255
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.880
uh, I got to kill this guy. He has to go.

256
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.050
He has to, he has to, he has to die. He has to die.

257
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:35.560
He has to die. Uh, and then I just,

258
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.270
I didn't do it. I, I'm not a murderer. I can't. I like in the mind,

259
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.350
I'll do it. I'll do. I'll do what? Murder Dave, come to the front.

260
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.330
No one's ever gonna know. He does his family doesn't know he's there.

261
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.440
Your family, nobody knows. Who's who you are. This guy, Chris,

262
00:16:53.441 --> 00:16:57.880
the peace Corps guy. He's not going to say anything. You can kill him right now.

263
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.120
He has a ton of cash that he hasn't been sharing with. You.

264
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.500
You can get outta here.

265
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.050
You can get some of your pride in your ego back this guys treating you like a,

266
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.430
like, like a Chinese waiter or something. Do it.

267
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:17.320
No one will ever know. No one will ever find out you were.

268
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:22.630
You're probably gonna die too. You want to die? Like catering to this guy.

269
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.160
Just do it. And I'm sitting. No, I don't. I don't want to, I don't,

270
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.740
I'm not a murderer and I didn't kill him.

271
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.150
I woke up the next day and I'm just looking at him like, you don't even know.

272
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:39.370
You don't even know what almost happened last night. We're walking around. Hey,

273
00:17:39.371 --> 00:17:43.270
what's that? There's a pygmy up.

274
00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:47.320
One of those 200, 100 foot trees. He's just sitting there chilling.

275
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.240
And I go, what is that? That a person we've at us.

276
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.310
<v 1>200 Feet above you. Huge tree. Like just, I don't know. It's so high.</v>

277
00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.900
It's so high. Oh my God. It was so high. How did you spot him? He was,

278
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:02.510
he was like shaking a little.

279
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.900
<v 0>From the place he was to get in front of us was seconds.</v>

280
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.140
Is that high? It's like this short.

281
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.500
<v 1>What's this jungle. That, I mean, when you, when you're in there,</v>

282
00:18:15.501 --> 00:18:17.570
do you even see sunlight through it or is it just.

283
00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.890
<v 0>No, it's so dense. I mean like, yeah, there's some cracks, but it's just,</v>

284
00:18:21.891 --> 00:18:23.750
this was also in the national geographic.

285
00:18:23.751 --> 00:18:28.190
Why that the dinosaur would be here is because cameras can't see it because it's

286
00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:30.050
such a dense, thick forest.

287
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.810
And there's things in there that are like moving and you know.

288
00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.710
<v 1>Your description sounds terrible. It's terrifying to sleep in the tent.</v>

289
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.710
Oh my God, dude. I'm freaking out over here.

290
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.630
<v 0>So, so the, the, um, the guy comes up, he's this short,</v>

291
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.220
he's like tiny. He's like, you guys want some honey, what?

292
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.710
And um, this is,

293
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.600
this is where my skill as an artist has gotten me

294
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.060
out of so many situations. Right. Cause if you're in,

295
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.270
if you're in jail and you have any kind of skills, singing, dancing,

296
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.020
telling jokes, drawing, you're a celebrity. So this guy doesn't speak English.

297
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:10.130
We don't speak whatever language he speaks. So I start drawing stuff like food,

298
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.840
like, you know, in the dirt. And he's like, oh yeah, I got you. And he, and he,

299
00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:19.310
and he goes, and um, he brings us a meat. That's all charred. And I'm like,

300
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.820
I don't know what that is. You know? And,

301
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.030
and I took one bite and it tastes horrible. And I'm like,

302
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.210
I'm going to starve to death, but I can't eat that. Wow.

303
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.180
And so it was like a movie he's like, come on, come on.

304
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.960
And we're walking and you know, it's us like stumbling, machete, trying to,

305
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.860
he's just like, what are we doing? Like, we get around a corner,

306
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.900
entire village of Pygmies. They've never seen an Asian person before.

307
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:50.090
I'm C3 PO. And they're that he walks from blunt. They're coming,

308
00:19:50.091 --> 00:19:54.800
they're touching my face. They're like, yeah, look, it looks like, he's like,

309
00:19:54.801 --> 00:19:57.710
I don't know what the they're saying. Like, um,

310
00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:02.180
the kids keeps doing this thing. Like, ah, I go, what are you saying?

311
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.000
There was one older,

312
00:20:05.001 --> 00:20:08.990
older guy in the village that I guess spoke a tiny bit of a French.

313
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.600
So my, the German guy can translate. He's like,

314
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.470
they're saying you come from the stars. You're coming from the stars.

315
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.990
And I'm like, oh my God, that's heavy. So I'm like, so I'm like, we're saved.

316
00:20:20.991 --> 00:20:23.480
They bring us some honey. They bring us some fruit and I'm like, oh God,

317
00:20:23.481 --> 00:20:27.230
I'm like just devouring. They're laughing at us. And you know,

318
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.920
it's like the national geographic, the women's are like down to their ankles.

319
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.120
And um, this guy,

320
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:40.070
he's an alien. He's an alien told you 1995. I was, uh,

321
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:45.050
I was 19 years old. Yeah. 19 years old. Yeah. And,

322
00:20:45.051 --> 00:20:48.040
and they put that, um, they put clothes on for the picture.

323
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:53.020
They were all naked when I got in there. Wow. I'm looking at my Tivas.

324
00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.610
<v 1>That's amazing. That picture is amazing.</v>

325
00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:02.610
So I know I had any of these people seen it. Did you ever describe it? Oh yeah.

326
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:07.530
<v 0>I draw the dinosaur. I go, here's the dinosaur. And what were they saying?</v>

327
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.890
They go, oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. There was never like, no, it's always like, okay,

328
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.300
there's a dinosaur. And uh, they go, let's go.

329
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.010
And I go, they go, it's it's through wetlands. Like this,

330
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.620
there's going to be leeches. Like, uh, there's a disease called bill.

331
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.310
[inaudible] where, uh,

332
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.170
there's like a snails under like still moving waters. And the second,

333
00:21:31.171 --> 00:21:35.490
a mammal steps in the water, little parasites shoot off the snail,

334
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.080
like a heat seeking missiles.

335
00:21:37.081 --> 00:21:41.070
And they go in your Dick hole and then you and blood till you die. And I'm like,

336
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.540
okay, I'm done. Like I tap out.

337
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.530
So they're explaining like all the,

338
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:54.180
the Trek and the way to go find this dinosaur. And I'm like,

339
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.680
I went, I went up until the leeches. And then when I came out with the leeches,

340
00:21:58.681 --> 00:22:02.370
I go, all right, I like this. This is it. You know, I go,

341
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.190
can you help us get out of the jungle? And they're like,

342
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.330
it took less than a day. That's how close we were to like, really,

343
00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.830
we were probably walking in circles. So we get out in less than a day.

344
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.380
I get, I get back home. I'm 19 years old. I start writing for, uh,

345
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:24.180
for vice. I start drawing pictures for them. I do comics I'm writing. And uh,

346
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.570
oh no. I was writing for a magazine called giant robot. And, uh,

347
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.420
Gavin and Shane would read that magazine and they're like, they were,

348
00:22:31.421 --> 00:22:35.550
they were ahead of the curve, right? Like when all print magazine right existed,

349
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.050
they were like, we need to go to digital. Like,

350
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:45.480
like they were, you know, vices always been free. Everyone feels it.

351
00:22:45.481 --> 00:22:49.350
They go to those magazine shops or wherever. And, and they're like,

352
00:22:49.351 --> 00:22:53.250
we need to have online presence. The internet was brand new. And they said,

353
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.570
Dave, that is the, and I told you not the PG 13,

354
00:22:57.571 --> 00:23:01.800
but that story gets very dark darker than what I said.

355
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:06.450
And they go, will you go back with a camera and a camera crew?

356
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.733
And I said,

357
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:13.320
that was one of the most traumatic I almost died. I saw people murdered.

358
00:23:13.321 --> 00:23:18.060
There was a virus where people were bleeding out of their eyeballs. No. Okay.

359
00:23:18.061 --> 00:23:23.010
I'll go. I enough time had passed. It was 10 years later. Actually it wasn't,

360
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.870
it was, that was uh, 95. And then it was like eight or 10 years later.

361
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.310
And um, so that was the one that vise filmed. They're like,

362
00:23:32.311 --> 00:23:34.350
can you go back over the Mickey mouse shirt?

363
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.530
That was from when I went with the film, like just my camera.

364
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.380
So I go back and um,

365
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.410
how did we even get to this tiny dinosaur?

366
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.370
<v 1>They all see the same dinosaur. Oh. Look at that.</v>

367
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.200
<v 0>Dude. You're on fired Jamie. Holy.</v>

368
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:58.000
<v 1>Yeah. That one number three. Number three is bonkers. What is that?</v>

369
00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.430
Unless it's a log could be a log.

370
00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.030
<v 0>That's all my on my second trip back, I met the doctor.</v>

371
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.060
There was a doctor that lived in the village, close to that river,

372
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.100
look at the track. And he said, he'd seen it really. And he's like, not, uh,

373
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.173
you know.

374
00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:18.670
<v 1>I wonder if any, like real legitimate biologists have looked at those tracks.</v>

375
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.550
I mean, they could tell you, by the way, the footprint,

376
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.580
like they can kind of tell whether things are fake or real.

377
00:24:24.581 --> 00:24:27.820
Not based on like how, where the weight is distributed.

378
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.510
Like getting someone to really understand how these animals will walk.

379
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.200
I think it would be really hard to fake dinosaur footprints, right?

380
00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.800
Because the weight, it would have to have, like.

381
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:42.310
<v 2>There, the description, I just read this said it wasn't that big.</v>

382
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.090
I shouldn't say it's not big, but it's like 30 feet, 35 feet. It's pretty big.

383
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.590
It's like a big, big, giant elephant.

384
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.710
<v 1>How big those alligators were that we were just talking about.</v>

385
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.980
<v 2>So it might be a turtle they were seeing. That's what, I don't know if,</v>

386
00:24:53.981 --> 00:24:56.110
what they actually found a turtle through here.

387
00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.880
<v 0>Their were so big. Like when we went to the river to bathe that, you're like,</v>

388
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.700
okay, let me just take their clothes off. And I'm like, oh,

389
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:08.500
I'm going to keep my clothes on. And I go, they go, whoa. I go, dude,

390
00:25:08.501 --> 00:25:12.280
I have like a normal penis for like, I'm proportioned correctly.

391
00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.170
Like your is down to your knees.

392
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.980
And this was back in the city when I got back to Brazzaville and they're like,

393
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:22.000
bro, you know, our are so big. I'm like why? And he's like,

394
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.530
there's all these naked kids running around. He's like,

395
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.040
cause we never wear underwear. And I'm like, what? It's like,

396
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.440
see the girl whose are down to their, her stomach. Never wear a bra.

397
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.110
It's gravity, bro. Everything just droops. I'm like,

398
00:25:32.111 --> 00:25:33.700
that's why your digs are so big. I'm like,

399
00:25:33.701 --> 00:25:34.900
I'm still gonna leave my underwear on. It's like,

400
00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.950
this is too much time when you've never, you've never been Africa. No,

401
00:25:38.951 --> 00:25:42.130
never been to dude, please. I'm begging you.

402
00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.340
I know you're into the hunting and the bull hunting please. Like,

403
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:51.550
so when I texted, you have to do with anything, Africa, man hunting in Africa.

404
00:25:51.551 --> 00:25:55.390
You mean? So when I texted you the other day,

405
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.480
I saw that the last time I texted you was 2018. I was like, dude,

406
00:25:58.481 --> 00:26:02.140
I'm going to Africa. I'll see you when I get back. That's right. Yeah. And um.

407
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:07.150
<v 1>Okay, this is the, this is the yes. Yeah. You telling me this is very heavy.</v>

408
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.760
<v 0>So there's uh,</v>

409
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.960
there's hunter gatherer tribes in like the Arctic Papa, new Guinea,

410
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:18.700
the Amazon Africa. But very few, like they're almost gone. There's very,

411
00:26:18.701 --> 00:26:20.560
very few people that live off the land.

412
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.830
And I just,

413
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.300
whenever the podcast went off the air and I, and I, and I ghosted, I,

414
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.470
I just lost my mind.

415
00:26:29.471 --> 00:26:34.420
I hit my rock bottom and very similar pattern of

416
00:26:34.421 --> 00:26:37.540
what I always do when things get rough is I just go to Africa. I go,

417
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.460
it's a weird thing to be

418
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.200
like rich or be in a country that's rich or half stuff.

419
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.200
And some as an adult, someone has to teach you gratitude.

420
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.980
Like I hear you say it all the time. I thankful. I'm thankful. I'm grateful.

421
00:26:52.981 --> 00:26:57.810
I go, but I'm not. I have everything. And yet I complain like crazy. I'm like,

422
00:26:57.811 --> 00:27:00.480
I need to go. I need to get the outta here. I need to go someplace where,

423
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.770
where I can, I can learn humility. I can learn to be grateful.

424
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.990
So I get to I'm traumatized now by the con I didn't even go into my second condo

425
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:11.130
story. When I went with vice,

426
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:14.610
that was even crazier where the chief tried to kill us. But, um,

427
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:20.160
so Congo is the heart of darkness. I get why those books are written.

428
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.960
I get why people have these mind losing experiences out there because it is one

429
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:27.630
of the darkest countries I've ever been.

430
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.580
So I don't want to go somewhere different this time.

431
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:34.370
<v 1>Do you know the European settlers? They tried to live in the Congo for awhile.</v>

432
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.100
I met one. Did you see the houses that they left behind?

433
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:42.290
<v 0>Dude, when I got to this bond to village and uh, Chuck, his name was Chuck.</v>

434
00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.330
Chuck, if you're listening, I know it's 20 years ago,

435
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.090
long blonde hair from Oregon peace Corps guy.

436
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.050
He got a malaria while we were there and he goes,

437
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.510
please contact Francoise. And I go, who the is Francoise?

438
00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.520
And he goes, he's, he's in the jungle.

439
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.150
And this is this isn't in the Congo villages, the bond to village. And he goes,

440
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.380
you go down this tree and you go. So he's deep in the, in the,

441
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.930
but this is still near a village. It's not, you know, so we go into the, in the,

442
00:28:09.931 --> 00:28:14.510
in the jungle and there's like a giant Victorian French,

443
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.280
like European house in the middle of the jungle. And I'm like,

444
00:28:19.281 --> 00:28:23.090
how did this happen? And he's like, so we go in there and uh,

445
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:26.180
Francoise is just like, like, uh,

446
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.960
some weird French dude that just said, I'm going to stay here.

447
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.010
He had like 12 bond, two wives. There's all these like half black,

448
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.180
half white babies crawling around. And he has a ham radio and he's like,

449
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:43.130
what's going on? I'm like, Chuck is dying. Can he said to come contact you?

450
00:28:43.131 --> 00:28:45.920
And he's like, oh, okay. I'll contact the aircraft carrier.

451
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.760
And they'll send a chopper in for him. I was like, oh. But yeah,

452
00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:53.120
that's that's the one time I saw a French Victorian.

453
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.980
I don't even know how to describe the architecture.

454
00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.880
It was like a beautiful French home in the middle of the Congo jungle.

455
00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.300
<v 1>Yeah. Well, there was a website dedicated to, uh,</v>

456
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.550
those people that try to do that.

457
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.860
And it just detailed how it all went terrible for them.

458
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.950
The jungle just over cut, came to the house.

459
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.700
Like you can't keep the jungle back. It's too powerful. There's too much there.

460
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.230
The jungle grows so quickly. It's just, I mean,

461
00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:22.550
you'd have grass popping out through the middle of your floorboards and trees

462
00:29:22.551 --> 00:29:25.940
trying to grow through the side of your sewage system. Like they're just,

463
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.720
it's just too much. It's wild.

464
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:34.440
<v 0>When you just said too much. Like I just thought right now, every time in my,</v>

465
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.100
my, I hit a rock bottom in my life gets too much. I go back to Africa.

466
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.910
So when someone says, go back to where you come from, maybe it's Africa.

467
00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.060
<v 1>Well, we all do right. We all do. Okay.</v>
