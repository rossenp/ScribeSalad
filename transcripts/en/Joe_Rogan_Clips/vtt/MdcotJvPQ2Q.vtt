1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
<v 0>Wanna give too much of it away.</v>

2
00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:03.600
Cause I really want people to watch it because I mean, I've,

3
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.840
I've talked about cocaine Cowboys probably a hundred times in this podcast.

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.520
It's one of my all time. Favorite podcasts. You, excuse me all time.

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.160
Favorite documentaries. But this is, this is a story that almost writes itself.

6
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.320
It's so bonkers that and the fact that it all could have been avoided

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.350
if one guy paid another guy or just,

8
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:25.310
didn't try to rip him off for like four grand. Yeah.

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.750
Like nothing doesn't make any sense. It's crazy. Yeah. And the guy,

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.350
what a bizarre personality he was,

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.390
who would just tan every day and hang out at this doctor's office

12
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.540
in the waiting room, telling everybody how great it was.

13
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.980
Like the whole thing is so strange. Well.

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.860
<v 1>Like that's everybody remembers it as like the Arod or aoid scandal, you know?</v>

15
00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:52.100
And, and the truth of the matter is that Alex Rodriguez was collateral damage.

16
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.620
Yes. In this whole thing. Yeah. It was not about him. Don't tell Alex that,

17
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:59.420
but it's not about him, you know, it's it, it was really the highest,

18
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.090
the career of the paid baseball player of all time

19
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.890
effectively ended over a $4,000 debt &lt;laugh&gt; between

20
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.210
this cocaine addicted, fake doctor and his fake tan addicted steroid patient.

21
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.570
Yeah. And it's like,

22
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:17.890
that's why I said it's like a Florida fuckery story straight up.

23
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.040
It's just like this classic only in Miami absurd farce and the, well,

24
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:23.280
that's what.

25
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.113
<v 0>You specialize in.</v>

26
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.800
&lt;laugh&gt; sort of really do you specializeize you specialize in Florida fuckery.

27
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.040
I go to your Twitter feed all the time for current Florida fuckery.

28
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.200
It's just it's.

29
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.240
<v 1>Yeah. It's distilled. It's just like, it's pure.</v>

30
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.920
It's a hundred percent much youuck Florida fuckery. Yeah.

31
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.640
Is just it's and that's what this story is to me. Cuz like Miami is just, well,

32
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:44.150
I say the great thing about me is it's so close to the United States,

33
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.390
but like it's &lt;laugh&gt; it's also like it's,

34
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.470
America's casalanca mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like just people kind of

35
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.070
flee to Miami from like all over the country and all over the world.

36
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.910
Usually leaving some kind of criminality in their wake. Yeah. And you know,

37
00:02:00.911 --> 00:02:05.140
come here and kind of there and reinvent themselves, you know? Like it's just,

38
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.300
and then you have all of these criminals there who then kind of baking in the

39
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:12.660
sun, you know, in this kind of multicultural, paella,

40
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.860
you know that we have &lt;laugh&gt; and then they just like,

41
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.180
and then they start putting their,

42
00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:20.700
their minds together and brainstorming and they hatch just the most in name,

43
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.220
schemes and scams.

44
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:26.250
Like that's our primary export from Miami is just schemes and scams. Well,

45
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:26.690
it's just so.

46
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.210
<v 0>Amazing that it's still a cocaine culture too. After all these years,</v>

47
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.330
it still has a giant cocaine engine pumping out all this

48
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:36.164
chaos.

49
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.210
<v 1>We don't have any indigenous industry. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean,</v>

50
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.850
there's no factory where everybody goes to work and then 30 years later gets a

51
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.320
watch. Right? There's no, no business there. It's Carl Heisen says,

52
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.120
all we produce in Florida is oranges and machine guns. We don't,

53
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.720
we don't make anything there. We sell the dream. We sell the sunshine, you know,

54
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.400
it's lies that came true. Yeah. You know, and so,

55
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.840
and even more frightening is the Miami of today is the America of tomorrow.

56
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.640
So it's like, there's a lot of lessons to be gleaned from down there.

57
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.240
But it's basically at this point, a money,

58
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.880
a real estate hustle and a money laundering capital.

59
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.480
So it's really no different than it ever was. Everybody likes to tell me, oh,

60
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.600
it's changed. It's grown. I'm like just cuz you've built a bunch of.

61
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.920
Doesn't mean we've grown. Right. And Miami is just like,

62
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.870
Miami is one of the youngest cities in the country in,

63
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.510
in your parlansu it would be about one person old or one and a half people ago.

64
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.710
Wow. Like one and a half people ago, you know like &lt;laugh&gt;, it's just,

65
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.910
we're the, we're one of the youngest cities, right? Um, barely a hundred,

66
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.270
just over a hundred, you know, and correct me if I'm.

67
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.230
<v 0>Wrong. Cause I've said this before,</v>

68
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.780
but isn't there more banks per capita in Miami than anywhere else? Well,

69
00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:40.140
there certainly.

70
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.500
<v 1>There certainly was. Um, before the, you know, the, the, uh,</v>

71
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.140
the great recession when a lot of them started shutting down,

72
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.860
but most of them have rebounded. Uh, one of the clever things,

73
00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:51.980
some of the real estate developers did was they opened their own bank,

74
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.860
literally their own bank.

75
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:58.020
They had a bank where the entire board of the bank were all real estate

76
00:03:58.021 --> 00:03:58.800
developers.

77
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.570
And over no 90% of the loans the bank made was insider loans.

78
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.650
Oh, just to the board.

79
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.690
And then of course they went belly up in the great recession and what happened?

80
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.890
We bailed them out. Oh. So it.

81
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.690
<v 0>Was all their own. So he bailed out real estate, salesmen.</v>

82
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.570
<v 1>Real estate who loaned themselves money.</v>

83
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.000
That is wound up being backed ultimately by us, by the taxpayers. Yeah. I mean,

84
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:24.280
that's the old, remember the, I mean,

85
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.000
you hear that line all the time now that like, you know, um,

86
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.640
the people used to Rob the bank from the outside in now. It's yeah.

87
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.520
Now it's from the inside out, but no none could be trueer than, than,

88
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:35.040
than that story. And that's a Miami story.

89
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.600
And when the great recession happened,

90
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.190
the F D I C had to open an office in Florida cuz we had more bank closures than

91
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:45.630
any other state, uh, in the union. Cause we were like, you could go down there.

92
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.390
I mean, you could buy a mortgage for your dog at a drive-through in Miami,

93
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.110
in the, in like the, the late nineties, early Ts. And um,

94
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.670
I remember interviewing a guy, um, we were doing,

95
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.950
working on a project called Ponzi state, uh,

96
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:00.910
about the state of Florida as like a,

97
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.100
a case study in the great recession years ago. He never finished it,

98
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:09.100
unfortunately, but we're interviewing this guy and he says, um, you know,

99
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:11.100
we were, and this is pre like big, short,

100
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:14.140
like this before anybody sort of knew a lot about this. And he said,

101
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.500
we were down here in Miami setting fires and wall street was trying to read

102
00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:20.460
our smoke signals.

103
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.090
That's why I say like the Miami of today is the America of tomorrow.

104
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.970
<v 0>PH. It is such every time I go there, I always go,</v>

105
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.250
I forgot how crazy this place is.

106
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.810
&lt;laugh&gt; you really should have to have a passport &lt;laugh&gt; it's it's but I love

107
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:38.090
it. I really do love it. It's a crazy place to do stand up. You know, I, I, I,

108
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.970
I did this joke cuz I was doing a Netflix special and I was doing it a cup

109
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.360
months after I did this gig in Miami. And so I was using those yonder bags.

110
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.081
You know what those are,

111
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:49.640
where people have to put their cell phone into this magnetic bag.

112
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.000
You keep the phone, but you hold the phone in the, if you want to use it,

113
00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:54.000
you just have to step outside.

114
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:57.120
They open up the bag and they give you your phone in every other city,

115
00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.160
it made for a better show because people just sat down and watched the show in

116
00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:02.740
Miami.

117
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.720
It made for literally 40% of the crowd at any given time was getting

118
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.160
up and going to the back and using their phone and coming back in,

119
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.240
they were just constantly moving around and you presume.

120
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.400
<v 1>It was to use their phone. They might be a bit powdering their noses.</v>

121
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.950
They might.

122
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.470
<v 0>Have been, but it was, they, you know,</v>

123
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.230
there was because I had done gigs before that,

124
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:23.710
where they didn't have the yonder bags and this wasn't the problem.

125
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.070
But in Miami, just everybody needed to use their phones.

126
00:06:26.071 --> 00:06:28.670
They just kept getting up and coming back and it was just chaos.

127
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.990
<v 1>Well, it's also a selfish town. Like it's, it's a, basically a town, a town of.</v>

128
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.950
Yeah. I mean really. And, and so like I, I always say that, I mean,

129
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.420
it reflects in everything that we do in the way that we behave,

130
00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:42.780
certainly in the way that we drive, like believe it or not,

131
00:06:42.781 --> 00:06:46.660
like people are so much more chill and calm here in traffic in LA.

132
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.420
I swear to God and LA was famous for like road rage,

133
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:53.740
like LA like created invented road rage,

134
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.210
but like Miami's such a crazy angry, weird place. Cuz it's like when,

135
00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:01.410
when push comes to shove, we're in Miami, chill the out. Yeah. Like it's,

136
00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:04.450
it's all good. It's a beautiful place. Like, and it's a shared experience.

137
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.370
The traffic sucks for all of us.

138
00:07:06.371 --> 00:07:10.090
Just chill out and use your turn signal for crying out loud and just,

139
00:07:10.091 --> 00:07:11.890
but that's why they, I say that's why they call it.

140
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.890
My it's not our Ammy or your Ammy it's my Ammy and stay outta my

141
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.320
am. It's just, I don't.

142
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.600
<v 0>Are you seem to love it. You seem to thrive.</v>

143
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.040
<v 1>Yeah. I can't really function anywhere else. Uh &lt;laugh&gt; doesn't make sense.</v>

144
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.760
It doesn't make any sense. It's and it's so frustrating too. I, I was, you know,

145
00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:34.600
I'm, I'm a native Floridian and a lifelong Miami and, and I, for a while I was,

146
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.440
I was pretty determined, um,

147
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.110
to like leave trying a better Florida than the one I was,

148
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.310
I was born in &lt;laugh&gt; fail. They failed give up.

149
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.710
<v 0>Man. Like one of my Ture is like, so inexorably connected to cocaine.</v>

150
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.070
Um, one of my best friends, Steve Graham was an ophthalmologist.

151
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.270
He did his residency in Miami.

152
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.670
So he did his residency in emergency rooms in Miami.

153
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.980
And he was there in the eighties during like the height basically during when

154
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:08.740
cocaine Cowboys takes place. And he saw everything, just he,

155
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.240
I mean,

156
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.940
he had all these pictures of bullet holes and skull fragments and people with,

157
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.340
uh, light bulbs stuffed up their asses. And just,

158
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.810
he said every day was just CA chaos.

159
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.210
<v 1>So we call a Miami idea everywhere else.</v>

160
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:25.770
The light bulb goes off over your head in Miami. We shove it right up our asses.

161
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.490
He.

162
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.810
<v 0>Said they had to pull a light bulb out of a guy's in one of those, uh,</v>

163
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.850
ones that looked like a Christmas tree, those curly ones,

164
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.170
this guy stuck a light bulb off his and it broke in his. At.

165
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.890
<v 1>Least he was concerned about the environment.</v>

166
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:41.000
That's like one of those environmentally like sound like it is right. There.

167
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.520
<v 0>Was no environmentally sound like bulb in the, they were just thicker glass,</v>

168
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.640
like think, felt like he could get it in his better. &lt;laugh&gt;.

169
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.880
<v 1>Well, we like that was the era to cut your teeth.</v>

170
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.360
If you were a cop or a lawyer or a journalist or an ER doctor,

171
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.360
I remember talking to an ER doctor once he tells me a story 1980,

172
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.720
shortly after the marioiel boat lift started,

173
00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:04.200
which I think everybody's kind of pop culture.

174
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.640
Frame of reference for the marioiel boat. Lift is Scarface.

175
00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:10.360
Tony Montana was a Mario Lito. That's the beginning of the movie when you know,

176
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.160
Castro was ranting and raving that he's flushing the toilets of Cuba onto the

177
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:17.390
United States specifically to Miami. And um,

178
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.510
so he was working at the, uh, the, uh, trauma center, Jackson Memorial,

179
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:27.230
our emergency room, uh, in Miami. And he said he got a Marielle refugee.

180
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.670
These guys would stand on the beach. They would, um,

181
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.310
it looked like Havana in south beach, you know,

182
00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:34.950
like there's that like coral sea wall in his,

183
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.500
just like it had a really Havana vibe. So they would go,

184
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.540
they would chill mostly at these flop houses,

185
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.340
south of fifth street in Miami beach where like the cops would literally just,

186
00:09:43.341 --> 00:09:46.620
they would be leaving after a stabbing at one of these places.

187
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.260
And they'd be three blocks away. They'd get a call to go back.

188
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.340
Cuz now there was a shooting or something else.

189
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:54.420
They would be going there like a all around the clock. And so,

190
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.010
and they would just get in gun fights. Like literally it would just be like,

191
00:09:59.011 --> 00:09:59.251
they,

192
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:02.370
someone would cheat at dominoes and they would just pull out a gun and one guy

193
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:03.330
would shoot the other guy.

194
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.090
And so he has a mural refugee who comes in to the emergency room with a gunshot

195
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.690
wound and he knew Spanish. He was bilingual. He said to the guy, he said,

196
00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:14.410
you're really lucky. Cuz if this bullet had hit, you know,

197
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:19.320
a few centimeters or whatever, this way you would've died immediately,

198
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:21.640
you would've bled out right there on the scene, died instantly.

199
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.120
And guy splits a few days later,

200
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.960
another Muriel refugee comes in with a gunshot wound in exactly the same spot

201
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:34.240
where he had told the other guy that if he got hit there, he would've died.

202
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.630
Could never prove it never was able to trace it back.

203
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.350
But he was pretty well convinced that it was a revenge shooting. Oh,

204
00:10:41.351 --> 00:10:42.184
for the other shooting.

205
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.310
And the guy knew exactly where to shoot him and kill him because the doctor had

206
00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:50.070
told him, oh, where to do that. But that was like every day in Miami, the,

207
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:52.790
the lady who cuts my hair for Christ's sake, she said, Billy,

208
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.230
I was so naive in those days. You know, you, you, she, I cut people's hair.

209
00:10:56.231 --> 00:10:59.380
You know, they come over, kiss her goodbye and put a tip in her, in her pocket,

210
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.420
you know? And she'd go home, turn her pockets inside out,

211
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.380
have our little crumbled bills and everything.

212
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.020
And one day she finds a little baggy of white powder.

213
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.900
That's something that one of her clients had slipped into her pocket as a tip.

214
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.380
And she said to her girlfriend, she says, what, what the hell is this?

215
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.180
And her friend said, oh, that's worth more than gold.

216
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.090
That's the best tip you got, you got all day that little baggy.

217
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.570
But that was just like the culture and it's. And it's, I mean,

218
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.643
it's not imagine that.

219
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.210
<v 0>Anywhere else, like imagine that in like Nebraska,</v>

220
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.690
someone tipping you in cocaine, people would be like, what? &lt;laugh&gt; what the,

221
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.330
what are you? What the are you doing?

222
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:40.080
<v 1>Listen. It's just like, like I said, it's like, America's, casalanca,</v>

223
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:40.880
it's just like, there's no place.

224
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.960
<v 0>Like it. It's such a strange place. Yeah.</v>

225
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.520
<v 1>Everybody strange. Everything is for sale still. Yeah. Nothing. You know?</v>

226
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.373
And like I said,

227
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.240
we are about a person old that's how far back Miami goes. I was.

228
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.080
<v 0>Watching a video about, um, the.</v>

229
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.800
<v 1>Culture of renting super cars to people so that they can pretend that it's their</v>

230
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.720
car huge in Miami. Yeah. Yeah. We got all these brick,

231
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.120
brick east a thousandaires you know, driving their rented Lambos. Yeah.

232
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.280
You know, and blowing the engines out on south beach.

233
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:12.160
Cause they don't know how to drive 'em you know? So they just,

234
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.750
you getting towed down the street is just listen,

235
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.510
it's a fake until you make it kind of town.

236
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.230
And there's nothing really to make there. You can't really,

237
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.990
other than a real estate hustle, money laundering, drugs,

238
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.710
politics being a crop politician. There's really no other way to make it.

239
00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:29.230
There's not a real industry. No.

240
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.750
<v 0>Not at all. There's a lot of professional fighters come out of, uh, Miami,</v>

241
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.820
that whole area, coconut Grove and.

242
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.220
<v 1>A lot of aggression, a lot of poverty. Yeah. It's a,</v>

243
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.900
it's a third world economy down there.

244
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.820
The disparity between the haves and the have nots,

245
00:12:43.821 --> 00:12:48.660
the income gap is widest and getting wider in miamidade county than

246
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.940
just about any city in the country or any, any metropolitan area in the country.

247
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.450
Wow. So, and that's why I said that Miami of today is the America of tomorrow.

248
00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:01.450
If you want to know what challenges we'll face as a nation oramities

249
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:04.490
will befall us in the years to come. You need only look at,

250
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.890
at Miami TD Oman called it the Canary in the coal mine, the bellwether. And so,

251
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.410
you know, when, when, when the election was playing out the cycle in 2016,

252
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.320
I was like it, you know,

253
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:16.880
all my friends are just like this can't this Trump thing can't happen.

254
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.320
I was like, hang on. I was like Florida elected.

255
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.800
And in fact, reelected Rick Scott to be governor.

256
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.320
He is the biggest Medicare fraudster in the history of the United States.

257
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.520
Everybody knows it.

258
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:34.200
Everybody's aware of it very well publicized we've we reelected him. Okay.

259
00:13:34.201 --> 00:13:36.830
We've we, we elected him twice as the top

260
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.590
executive in our state.

261
00:13:39.591 --> 00:13:44.550
Like what makes you think that the United States of America wouldn't do that?

262
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.070
And I know it's fair to say, like, you know,

263
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.710
if you're gonna be the governor of the state,

264
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.030
you should know a little something about the largest industry in the state.

265
00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:53.390
Like if you're gonna be the governor of Michigan,

266
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:58.180
you should have some familiar with the automobile industry and manufacturing and

267
00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.980
in Florida, if you're gonna be the governor,

268
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.420
arguably you should know something about our biggest industry,

269
00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:05.420
which is Medicare fraud. Basically. I mean,

270
00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:08.740
you could argue that he's the most qualified man for the job. Oh yeah.

271
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:10.860
We got like Medicare fraud is, has,

272
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:13.620
is one of the largest industries has been for decades. I mean,

273
00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:17.290
we have billions and billion of dollars in fraud that just comes, comes,

274
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:18.650
they run it. So they run it.

275
00:14:18.651 --> 00:14:22.650
So you'll go into like little Havana or hieea for example, in, uh,

276
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.570
municipality, in, in miamiadee. And there'll be a little,

277
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.970
aunita sitting behind a desk,

278
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.090
half asleep and she'll be surrounded in this tiny little oneroom office

279
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.810
by little mailboxs, you know,

280
00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:40.440
like PO boxes mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and a mailman comes in every day and just

281
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.760
puts checks in the boxes.

282
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.800
And they're like, in some cases they've stolen, um,

283
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.920
uh, social security numbers and, and CR you know, uh, uh,

284
00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.400
stolen identities basically.

285
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.400
And some cases they're just old people who aren't aware that their mail is being

286
00:14:58.401 --> 00:15:01.720
forwarded to this location. And they've just got, they,

287
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.280
I think Miami for a while, we had more Medicare,

288
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.310
uh, payments for HIV and aids medication than every other part of the

289
00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:15.390
country combined. And it's all just old people. So it's like,

290
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.550
you would have to assume that a hundred percent of our elderly population

291
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:23.230
suffered from HIV had HIV were HIV positive. I means it's impossible.

292
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.190
You had female patients getting penis pumps that were paid for,

293
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.270
by what Medicare I Don didn't even know that Medicare covered that.

294
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:32.660
I gotta look into that, but, uh &lt;laugh&gt; but I know that was a thing. Well,

295
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.573
they had Obama.

296
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.820
<v 0>Did you watch the Oxycontin express? Did you see the doctor I' seen now,</v>

297
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.340
but that's all about how they would have the pain management centers and they

298
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:43.540
were connected to the pharmacies. You'd go to the doctor. Hey, my back hurts.

299
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:47.220
You'd go, well, you need this go right next door. And you just go, right.

300
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.180
All they would prescribe was Oxy. And.

301
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.610
<v 1>Sometimes it wasn't even next door. Sometimes it was like to that window. Yeah.</v>

302
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.090
Right next door. They say, show, show the doctor, your x-ray. Yeah.

303
00:15:57.091 --> 00:15:59.410
You'd have to get your x-ray done somewhere else. Cause they weren't doing it.

304
00:15:59.411 --> 00:16:00.410
So mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you'd hand the doctor,

305
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.410
your x-ray he'd look at it and go, oh. It was upside down. He wouldn't,

306
00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:05.330
he wouldn't even be like, oh yeah. Oh. You,

307
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:10.010
you know what you need go to that window over there and fill this prescription.

308
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:15.000
And we had more pill mills. They called them in Broward county,

309
00:16:15.001 --> 00:16:16.840
which is the county, just north of Miami Dade.

310
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.640
Then we had McDonald's locations and there was literally like the

311
00:16:21.641 --> 00:16:26.160
Appalachian trail. They were coming down. Yeah. They were stocking up on Oxy.

312
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.880
And we were fueling a death epidemic like in, in Kentucky.

313
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:35.390
And they were pulling over &lt;affirmative&gt; more cars with Florida plates than

314
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.550
in-state plates up there because Floridians were like, well,

315
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.790
we can't let them have all the action. We'll drive up. And we'll export the.

316
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.710
And at the peak of the pill mill epidemic, the Oxy epidemic in Florida,

317
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.750
seven people a day were dying and women in children and,

318
00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.950
and we subsist from hustle to hustle.

319
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.340
You wonder why didn't the government crack out on that?

320
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.500
Why didn't they regulate it? Well, first our governor and we,

321
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.220
we deal with this in screwball is the biggest Medicare frauds during the history

322
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:02.420
of the country. So he wasn't exactly.

323
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:06.780
Shall we say vigilant or interested in cracking down on

324
00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.060
medical related fraud? How does he get away.

325
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:09.893
<v 0>With it?</v>

326
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:15.210
<v 1>Magic ma Maga magic, I guess. I mean he, listen, he, he,</v>

327
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.610
he got, he pledd the fifth amendment,

328
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.610
like 75 times in a videotaped deposition that was used in a campaign ad against

329
00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:27.210
him and Florida was like, we're good. We're good with that. Uh,

330
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:28.890
and he just listen, white,

331
00:17:28.891 --> 00:17:31.410
rich men kind of walked between the raindrops in this country.
