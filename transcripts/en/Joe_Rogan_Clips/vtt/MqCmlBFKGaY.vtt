WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I talked to David for four hours. Um,</v>

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.150
yeah, whatever, bring that up because David.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.650
<v 1>Fravor, you were talking, let's explain who David Fravor was. Yeah, he's a, uh,</v>

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.790
um, fighter jet pilot for the Navy. And, uh,

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.830
he discovered a UFO off the coast of San Diego that when they

6
00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:22.371
tracked,

7
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:27.260
it went from 60,000 feet to one feet in a second

8
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.920
or less, they don't know how fast it went because it's, you know,

9
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:31.970
the blip of a radar.

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.220
But the thing traveled in an insane way that defies all of

11
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:38.660
our understanding of propulsion,

12
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.340
all of our understanding of physics and this thing also actively was

13
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:47.510
blocking their tracking systems, which is an act of war. If it, you know,

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.020
with the Soviet union or China was doing that, that's tactically inactive war.

15
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:55.580
So this thing was doing something that showed that it was intelligently

16
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.500
aware of the fact that they are using tracking devices to try to lock in on it.

17
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.570
And it behaved and moved in a way that defies all of our understandings

18
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.950
of propulsion systems. It didn't give off any heat signature, and, uh,

19
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.770
the people from the Navy that he was communicating with saying, yeah,

20
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:15.770
we see these every now and again. We don't know what the. Yeah.

21
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.710
<v 0>So the, the thing I was going to say, this is a lot interesting things to say,</v>

22
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.150
well, it was about, so just this,

23
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.400
I just remembered that it felt like from that entire experience,

24
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:29.390
that because it didn't have a Chinese or Russian flag on it,

25
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.690
whatever he saw is we tend to just,

26
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:36.410
the entire system is doesn't want to acknowledge it.

27
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.910
Like you just, you don't know what to do with it. So they actually, most of, uh,

28
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.930
like when you returned back to the ship and there's a bunch of pilots that put,

29
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.230
you know, that saw it, there's, there's a lot of people that witnessed it.

30
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:50.210
And then there's also the video, you know,

31
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:52.130
the majority of the people didn't know what to do with it.

32
00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:55.430
They just went on with our day, like nothing happened. Uh, you know,

33
00:01:55.431 --> 00:02:00.230
they kind of made fun of each other or whatever for, you know, uh, yeah,

34
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.290
yeah, sure, bro, you saw aliens, but like they didn't,

35
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.870
they didn't know how to comprehend it. That, that's what I meant.

36
00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:08.990
Like if we encounter in life from elsewhere in the universe,

37
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.580
we think we would be, uh,

38
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.540
as a population excited, but it feels like just like with book Bigfoot,

39
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.650
we want, we're excited by the mystery when they're like,

40
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.040
when they're just out of reach when they're like, um,

41
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.560
among us that just,

42
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:32.030
there's so many mysteries and incredible things among us that we just kind of

43
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:36.980
take them for granted. We don't even, um, or ignore them actually even worse.

44
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.400
We ignore them, we get used to things. And that, that was the weird thing.

45
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.880
The biggest mystery to me about, uh,

46
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:45.980
what David Fravor saw a lot.

47
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.420
And then also with the other videos in 2014,

48
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.450
something like that, the go fast is like,

49
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.740
it wasn't a bigger deal than I thought it would be like, well.

50
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.350
<v 1>The big deal was when the Pentagon came out and said that they have recovered</v>

51
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.720
some vehicles that are not of this world. Now they didn't expand on that.

52
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.380
There hasn't been more conversation about that. But my,

53
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.450
this is purely speculation.

54
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.610
My speculation is they are slowly spoonfeeding

55
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:22.960
us information to allow people to be more comfortable with the

56
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:27.490
inevitable arrival of something. They believe that something's coming.

57
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.110
They don't want it to happen all at once.

58
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:31.090
You see what happens just with the pandemic.

59
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:34.960
You see what happens with George Floyd and see what happens with any anytime.

60
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:38.320
There's a big shock to our system and there's chaos in the streets it's

61
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:42.340
unmanageable. And if the UFO's came in the middle of something like that,

62
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:45.130
like Jesus Christ, like who the knows what would go down.

63
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.660
If I was someone who was in a position of power, I would say, listen,

64
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:52.060
this information is going to get out. It's inevitable.

65
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.980
So why don't we let people know now just give them just

66
00:03:56.981 --> 00:04:01.060
in words, say we have recovered crafts that are not of this world.

67
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.150
Say something crazy like that, let print it in the New York times,

68
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.380
get it out there. And then slowly drip out more information.

69
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:10.870
When they see these videos, they'll get more and more accustomed to it.

70
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.200
And then eventually to be like, masks, like you walk down the street,

71
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:16.330
everybody has a mask on, you don't even think about it. Yeah.

72
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.880
<v 0>But okay. So let me, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I totally,</v>

73
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.250
and this is such a fascinating question.

74
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.170
If the government is in possession of an alien spacecraft,

75
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.860
what is the right way to release that information?

76
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.140
<v 1>The problem is if it, if it's more potent than any weapon that any,</v>

77
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.630
any civilization has currently on this planet.

78
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.320
So if the United States is in control of this vehicle,

79
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.470
that is more potent and can do things that like,

80
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.670
if you really do have something that can go from 60,000 feet to one foot in

81
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.960
under a second, that, I mean,

82
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:56.310
that's that defies all of our understandings of speed, right? I mean,

83
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.760
that's so fast if you could do that. Well.

84
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.360
<v 0>I there's arguments against, cause it could be human creative technology too.</v>

85
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:08.010
That's just 15, 20, 30 years out. Like the stealth bomber was developed,

86
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.640
uh, secretly. So what defies,

87
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.480
it's our perception of its movement capabilities defies,

88
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.630
but there could be some tricks on perception that, I mean,

89
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.870
that's the whole point with a stealth bomber is it's difficult to detect.

90
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.440
And so there could be same kind of tricks on perception that you could just be

91
00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:27.900
playing, uh, different kinds of, uh,

92
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:32.370
amazing secret human created technology that, uh,

93
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:34.620
is able to deceive the human eye.

94
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.950
<v 1>I mean, but the, the thing about it is they tracked it.</v>

95
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.630
It wasn't just that it was, uh, the human eye that saw this and it's deceptive,

96
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.360
but also like to tell Palmer, you know, the way it's designed it, it,

97
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.600
it blocks radar or it, uh, radar doesn't catch onto it.

98
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.070
I think it is possible that some human created

99
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.030
technology that's so far advanced from anything that we're,

100
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.070
uh, w w w we currently understand, like,

101
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.480
in terms of like mainstream propulsion experts and,

102
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.170
and fighter pilots like David Fravor and military people,

103
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.350
it is possible that some civilization, one of the,

104
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.730
one of the big civilizations on this planet,

105
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:19.790
whether it's China or Russia has come up with something that's, uh,

106
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.180
above and beyond what everybody knows, but it's not likely,

107
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.610
it's not likely that they've made that much of a leap.

108
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.980
<v 0>And your sense on the other side of fatality and technology, see,</v>

109
00:06:29.981 --> 00:06:34.210
I'm more optimistic to me as a scientist and engineer.

110
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.370
And actually David favor says, says this too, in this time of pandemic.

111
00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:43.030
And this time of like, just, just hard,

112
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.590
negative news everywhere,

113
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.130
there'll be nothing more inspiring than the government in an inspiring,

114
00:06:48.131 --> 00:06:51.490
like Neil deGrasse, Tyson way coming out and saying,

115
00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:54.640
we have not releasing the videos like they did, which is,

116
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.460
I don't know if you know, but they just put videos on the website.

117
00:06:57.461 --> 00:07:00.370
Like there's not, there's nothing. It's just videos. It's just like,

118
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.180
would like some boring documents that describe like nothing.

119
00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:07.270
They're not inspiring. We're not talking about like Neil deGrasse Tyson,

120
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.630
or like Carl Sagan, cosmos style, like a beautiful,

121
00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:15.550
inspiring what is more inspiring than an alien spacecraft.

122
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.670
Look, here's a fascinating mystery here.

123
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.620
There's nothing more inspiring to us humans than that. There was life out there,

124
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:24.640
intelligent life out there.

125
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.250
<v 1>How would you handle it? Like, let's imagine,</v>

126
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.140
let's imagine you are the leader of the United States and you find

127
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:32.951
out, or the, you know,

128
00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:36.280
whatever the head of the Navy military intelligence program, whatever,

129
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.143
whoever you are,

130
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.690
you're a person that's in a position where you realize that this thing is from

131
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:45.550
another world and you have this responsibility to try to

132
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.540
somehow, or another publicize this I.

133
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.100
<v 0>Would, I would, I would,</v>

134
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.230
I would approach it a hundred percent from the perspective of science.

135
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.540
Here's a mystery. So forget weapon,

136
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.990
like you're you mentioned there's this inclination to think like,

137
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.390
how can I figure out a way to use this as a weapon to destroy Russia or China,

138
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.240
as, as opposed to seeing it like,

139
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.350
like going to Mars, colonizing, Mars,

140
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.400
or going to the moon originally, there is some competitive element,

141
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:23.230
but mostly it's a human pursuit of understanding and human

142
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:28.210
pursuit of overcoming our limited knowledge

143
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.240
to sort of unlock mysteries of this universe from a physics perspective,

144
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:32.410
from an engineering perspective,

145
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.090
I would release all the information I have and, uh,

146
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.700
release it in a way that gets the new other guys,

147
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:43.240
Tyson folks in the loop. So it's,

148
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:48.100
it's almost like an inspiring effort for us as a humanity to understand what the

149
00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:52.150
hell this thing is versus let's keep it secret

150
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.380
and see if we can use it as a weapon. Well.

151
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.380
<v 1>I appreciate that you think that way, because you're a scientist,</v>

152
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.010
you're thinking about it in a very positive way to try to expand our education

153
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:05.820
and our understanding of this, this thing. And maybe we could, you know,

154
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:06.840
use it for good,

155
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.180
but you got to realize that anything that surpasses any and all

156
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.310
technologies that we currently enjoy in terms of fighter pilots and jets and

157
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.320
military superiority, if there's something that just is above and beyond all,

158
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:26.250
if everybody has a model T and you have a Ferrari or better,

159
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:30.750
yet you have a Tesla, you have a model S and everybody's got a model T you,

160
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.270
you are, this is in the you're in a race.

161
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.400
Like you have something that is so far above and beyond what

162
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:42.570
everybody else has. It's not really a fair race. It's a joke. You'll dominate.

163
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.130
If that, if you were in a,

164
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.460
you have a model T and the other person has a Tesla and your racing,

165
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:52.310
and the winner gets to decide who has all the food who gets all the women, who,

166
00:09:52.311 --> 00:09:55.830
who lives in the nice house. Like you're going to win every time right now,

167
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:57.330
if you have a UFO,

168
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:02.220
if you have a spaceship that comes from another planet where they're a million

169
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:03.510
years more advanced than us,

170
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.070
they've had a million years of evolution and technological evolution dealing

171
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:11.460
with elements that are common on their planet that have to be created on a

172
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.090
particle Collider here. And they only exist for a brief amount of time.

173
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.950
If they have something like that,

174
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.960
that's powered by something that we can't even imagine.

175
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.780
And you figure out how to use that here on earth.

176
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.390
You will have technical superiority, technological,

177
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:28.110
superiority over every other civilization, every other country.

178
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.530
<v 0>In that technological superior.</v>

179
00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:35.150
It's so funny as chimps are like still talking about our village,

180
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.580
we want our village could be better than the next village.

181
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.430
When there's an alien civilization,

182
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.350
that's a million years more advanced that would, can easily destroy us.

183
00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:46.190
If I wanted to,

184
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.320
or actually understands the nature of existence in this universe on

185
00:10:51.321 --> 00:10:53.440
levels that like we,

186
00:10:53.441 --> 00:10:57.080
we chimps talking about like meditation and finding inner peace, like,

187
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.710
and understands on, on such a deeper level,

188
00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:03.500
like the nature of consciousness, the nature of intelligence,

189
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:04.850
the meaning of life,

190
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.660
all the weird stuff that we're so obsessed with and understands on another

191
00:11:08.661 --> 00:11:13.640
level. And here we are thinking about what the Russians are doing,

192
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.220
uh, versus like understanding that mystery.

193
00:11:16.221 --> 00:11:19.640
I think in the face of that mystery of something,

194
00:11:19.641 --> 00:11:24.470
that's far more intelligent than us. I think we can't,

195
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:29.060
it's a ridiculous notion to think we're anything, but, uh,

196
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.200
one human village. And in terms of weapons,

197
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.460
cause you said the get all the girls or whatever. I think the weapons things,

198
00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:40.640
the key thing, and we're, we're we already,

199
00:11:40.641 --> 00:11:44.150
at least the major nations have all the weapons we need to destroy each other.

200
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.040
It's like, we don't need extra weapons. I, well,

201
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:54.310
I mean, it feels like, it feels like,

202
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.590
uh, your hypothesis would be like if an alien technology was here and we'd

203
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:02.650
figure it out, would be able to have something that, um,

204
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.330
destroys other Chimp villages,

205
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.810
an order of magnitude more efficiently than nuclear weapons,

206
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.730
thereby having an asymmetrical sort of from a game theory perspective of

207
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:19.030
power over other nations. And we can tell China what to do.

208
00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:20.320
We can tell Russia what to do.

209
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.560
That's that's the perspective from which they're thinking. I just.

210
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.250
<v 1>I'm not even saying that. They're thinking that way.</v>

211
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.390
I'm thinking a human would think that if they had control of this vehicle,

212
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.220
I'm not saying that the aliens would think this way.

213
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.510
I'm thinking also that we are constantly innovating when, when you,

214
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.740
when you talk to, uh,

215
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.560
people that are designing jets and planes and fighter pilots,

216
00:12:40.561 --> 00:12:44.100
and they were really talking about new systems that they've created in a new,

217
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.000
you know, new, new weapons,

218
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.610
they don't just sit back and say,

219
00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:54.210
we have enough weapons to destroy Russia and China and the rest of the world

220
00:12:54.211 --> 00:12:55.740
combined. So we're just going to stop.

221
00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:01.020
This is not how human beings innovate human beings are in this constant state

222
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.050
of wanting the newest, greatest innovations.

223
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.310
We want to improve upon every single existing invention

224
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:13.170
until we hit some sort of singularity point or whatever the we're

225
00:13:13.171 --> 00:13:14.490
striving for as a culture.

226
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.010
And that would be that propulsion system. If you,

227
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.520
if you do really have something go from 60,000 feet to one feet in less than a

228
00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:25.920
second, you're dealing with something that we don't understand.

229
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.390
We can't do that right now. And if we can,

230
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.490
and if you could figure out how to do that and propel people that quickly,

231
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.850
it would be a game changer. Now, how much of a game changer?

232
00:13:35.851 --> 00:13:36.930
What does that mean? Well,

233
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:41.850
we're in this weird place where we kind of agree to not use our best weapons,

234
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.440
right? Like when there's a,

235
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:48.400
there's a face-off between the United States jets and a Russian jet, and they,

236
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:51.150
they come close to each other, like over China or something like that.

237
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.610
It's weird because we're not shooting at each other,

238
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.600
but we're real close. And even the muscles that we have, they're not nuclear,

239
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.580
like we're w but we're involved in,

240
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.370
in a skirmish with another country, but it does,

241
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.810
we don't use all our weapons.

242
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.760
Like if we approached war the way people approached war in the

243
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.590
middle ages, we would just nuke the out of everybody. That talks.

244
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.000
Right. Anybody, anybody would have challenges say, what'd they just say,

245
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.750
launch those missiles. those peoples that have Twitter, the nukes. Yeah,

246
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.471
exactly.

247
00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:32.670
So we're already in this place where we don't use our best stuff we're already.

248
00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:37.260
So if we had something that made us fly better and fly faster,

249
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.400
the real question is, yeah. How much would that change the world? I don't know.

250
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.690
I don't know how much it would if we got in control of some UFO and were able to

251
00:14:45.691 --> 00:14:50.610
get to China quicker with how much of a difference would that make in terms

252
00:14:50.611 --> 00:14:53.690
of like the way they responded to our military.

253
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:57.950
We're in this position now where there's multiple countries that have the

254
00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:01.430
ability to destroy other countries. There's a,

255
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:06.080
Ron has some sort of a nuclear program. Pakistan has a nuclear program. Uh,

256
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:10.910
India has nuclear program, you know, of course the United States, Russia, China,

257
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.350
there's many countries that have the ability to wipe out

258
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.370
huge numbers of the population like that.

259
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.380
Just launched just one crazy psychotic leader who just

260
00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:27.170
decides to just listen, we're going to make our mark here,

261
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.040
everybody together on 1, 2, 3 go, boom.

262
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.400
<v 2>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

263
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.550
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

264
00:15:42.551 --> 00:15:44.950
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

265
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.670
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

266
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.660
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

267
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.490
That's all we're asking you. Just go download Spotify. Buh-bye.
