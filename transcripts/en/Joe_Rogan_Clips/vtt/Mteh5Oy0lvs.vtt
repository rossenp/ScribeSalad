00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 1>I knew a dude had llamas.</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.840
You got a giant spread out in the Cape and he had llamas on his lawn and.

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.320
<v 2>Dude, I entered, I had an entire TV show about the leaping Lama festival.</v>

4
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.910
You want to know the best part of it is the, the, the,

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.700
the crux of the competition is how much you can adorn your Lama with

6
00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:29.420
gear, like put stuff on and cover its eyes and how you can control it.

7
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.500
And you got to do a sketch Susan in front of the whole four H for all the high

8
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:37.240
schools around all the parents, all the kids. And I have no, I mean,

9
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:40.940
I'm not producing, I'm just a host. And I go, so what's it mean the Lama skit?

10
00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:44.090
And they're like, Rocky three. I go, oh, it's my favorite?

11
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:47.990
Rocky cupboard and Rocky. I go, I'm Rocky. And they're like. Yeah,

12
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.670
you going to come out? The music will be playing.

13
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.810
You get the Lama Lama is going to look just like Mr. T. So we get out to the,

14
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.820
I give it to the Lama and it was a white Lama.

15
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.130
So they had to put it in black face. So it had like red lips.

16
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.870
<v 1>Oh my God.</v>

17
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.000
<v 2>And like, let's part of the competition. Isn't pushing on his face. I go,</v>

18
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.973
do you have this race?

19
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.280
<v 0>I'll pick a black face. And I was supposed to go pick it up.</v>

20
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.270
<v 1>Whoa, settle down. You're breaking glasses.</v>

21
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.853
Neighbor's wall.

22
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.970
<v 2>And they play just some eye of the tiger. And I had to take punches at this</v>

23
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.880
10, 10, 10, and then the mom was just standing there. Cause it's a Lama.

24
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.190
Oh my God. And I'm like, you're hitting that in the face.

25
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.450
<v 1>Oh my, my friend, Steve Rinella and his brother, Matt use Lamas.</v>

26
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:54.200
When they hunt to carry out the meat, what are they dressing? Trained Lamas.

27
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.330
Have these trained llamas. They take them into like a cargo van.

28
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.820
<v 2>They'll spit at you. Oh yeah.</v>

29
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.120
<v 1>That's a rude animal man.</v>
