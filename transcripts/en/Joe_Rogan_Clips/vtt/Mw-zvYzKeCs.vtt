<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.080
<v 1>If I didn't know who you were and I ran in you, I,</v>

3
00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:10.040
would've no idea that you're the same guy. It's crazy. You're a,

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.480
completely different human. Yeah.

5
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.440
You went from this guy that looked like you were really in bad shape to a guy

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.880
who looks like a guy would avoid in jujitsu. I like, that guy.

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.790
Let me get away from man. He's too big. You look great. That's awesome.

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.910
<v 0>This is the greatest compliment I've ever gotten. Thank you very much,</v>

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.270
by the way. All I want is to, to look like a big dude.

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.350
Who's not just gigantic and fat. That's all.

11
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.150
<v 1>I want, dude. You look like a gorilla. You look like a dangerous human being.</v>

12
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:39.230
Like how did you do it? Uh.

13
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.820
<v 0>Well, over the past 20 years, I've gone back and forth with dieting.</v>

14
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:49.580
I've I've lost a little weight. I've gained a, little weight back. Um,

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.220
how did I do it? I think that the,

16
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.940
the thing that I've done that has been sustainable is

17
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.460
undoing kind of look a lot of diets, come in and say,

18
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.810
just do this and you'll lose weight,

19
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.890
but we're not focused at all on how we got to whatever point we were at that

20
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:12.250
we considered non-optimal that we want to change. And so

21
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.930
undoing the bad habits that I had that I would associate with allowing myself to

22
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:19.650
get up to 550 pounds

23
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.840
is really more important than anything that I could say.

24
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.000
This is what I did to lose weight. Does that make sense? Yes.

25
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.600
<v 1>Yes. Um, so when did the process start?</v>

26
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.440
So you kind of went back and forth,

27
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.720
but you've obviously been on a very steady course for how long.

28
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.760
<v 0>Now? 20 years. So 19 years,</v>

29
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.230
2002 was a first time.

30
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.710
I thought I really want to change my life.

31
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.150
And I started then. And.

32
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.710
<v 1>How much weight have you lost? Instead.</v>

33
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.830
<v 0>2002, I went from five 50.</v>

34
00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.430
I did a liquid diet for two months and lost 80 pounds that 80 pounds I've never

35
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:01.430
dipped backed into,

36
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.900
but so I was four 50 and I went down to

37
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.620
close to just under 300, then went back up to 400,

38
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.380
then went down to 200, then back up to three 50.

39
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.460
And for the past five years I've been around the weight I'm at

40
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.170
now. So I've, I've really gotten that under control.

41
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.490
<v 1>And what are you at right now? Two 70. That is incredible. That is,</v>

42
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.330
that is so incredible. So you've lost more than 200 pounds.

43
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.303
Oh yeah. Yeah.

44
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.610
<v 0>I mean, I solid, I've lost 200 pounds a couple of times.</v>

45
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.640
<v 1>But you've also put on muscle, like you different you're you're different.</v>

46
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.480
All like you're unrecognizable.

47
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.200
<v 0>Yeah. I think, listen,</v>

48
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.880
the other strange thing about weight loss is when you're building

49
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.520
fat and you're storing fat,

50
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.560
your body is naturally building lean tissue too, just to support that fat.

51
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.320
So under every obese person, there's a person with more than average muscle.

52
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.440
Mm. So, cause.

53
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.360
<v 1>They have to carry around all.</v>

54
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.193
<v 0>Their way. Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.920
You're you're naturally building muscle just by like raising your heavier arm.

56
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.760
<v 1>I totally say that to Ralphie may. Yeah. Cause Ralphie,</v>

57
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.830
Maye was so heavy and I was like, look at your legs, dude. I, I go,

58
00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:22.190
you'd be able to kick someone through a wall if he just lost weight. Yeah.

59
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.030
Like is the, the, just to be able to carry around.

60
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.150
<v 0>I have gnarly calves. I bet you do, dude. Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.870
I that's one of the few things that like, I,

62
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.310
I train sometimes with body builders now and my coach is a professional body

63
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.430
builder, Jared, Jared feather, shout out to him. Um,

64
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.620
and he has a lot of calf emphasis and I'm like, I don't really need to do that,

65
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.780
bro. &lt;laugh&gt; my cows are.

66
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.980
<v 1>Good. Yeah. You C carried around 500 pounds for years. Yeah. Let's go to a,</v>

67
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:52.980
can you show me a photo of Ethan when he was at his heaviest?

68
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.980
So finally, so has this affected your work because you know,

69
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.930
you were getting roles for so long as an actor when you were large. Yeah.

70
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.370
<v 0>I think so. Yeah, it has. There,</v>

71
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.770
there was a time if we go back to like 2015, um,

72
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.050
and I had been really thin and when I say really thin, I mean 200 pounds,

73
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.410
but for me that was extraordinarily thin. That's what I weigh.

74
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.120
<v 1>It was just crazy. And you're a lot bigger than me. It's crazy to see.</v>

75
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.280
<v 0>I looked, I thought I looked, um, gone, God.</v>

76
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.880
<v 1>That's in look at those two pictures. Like,</v>

77
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.440
like if a girl broke up with you,

78
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.200
&lt;laugh&gt; when you were on the left and then ran into you, uh, you know,

79
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:39.440
at the airport when you were on the right. I mean that is bonkers man. Yeah.

80
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.030
It's incredible. Yeah. I mean truly.

81
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.030
<v 0>Truly incredible. That's my favorite picture. And that's not even down lighting.</v>

82
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.990
I, I was an idiot and I'm not super thrilled with my hair and my

83
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.550
head and I wouldn't shave my head because I thought the hat looked better with a

84
00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:59.350
little bit of hair poking out and then it got in the way of down lighting. So,

85
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.460
oh, that's fun. That's not even as good a picture.

86
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.460
<v 1>That could have been down lighting. That's what everybody wants for abs. Yeah.</v>

87
00:05:04.461 --> 00:05:08.420
They want down lighting, see the guns. Um, so

88
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.260
your, your training regimen must be like pretty strict though.

89
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:16.980
Look at that picture. That is so bananas dude. Yeah. What, what movies.

90
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.420
<v 0>Ever wrong? Remember the Titans. Wow. Yeah, that, that,</v>

91
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.613
that wasn't even the heavy.

92
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.690
<v 1>That that's not the heaviest, I mean.</v>

93
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.170
<v 0>I was probably close to 500 there, but no, that's, that's not even the heaviest,</v>

94
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.850
I, I don't know what to point to like this picture down here is I believe after

95
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.130
remember the Titans and I'm certainly a little bit heavier. Yeah. Wow.

96
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.760
<v 1>When you look at that and you, how far you've come, I mean,</v>

97
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.760
it has to be incredibly satisfied.

98
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.280
<v 0>It's incredibly satisfying, but you know, look, the reality is that, um,</v>

99
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.160
I don't, I, I have mental illness and I can't,

100
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.920
I don't look at myself and think like, God, I look great. I, I,

101
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.040
I see nothing but negative stuff every day.

102
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.280
And I try to convince myself, I try to find something that I'm happy with.

103
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:10.200
Usually it's my traps. I can look at my traps cuz it's lean.

104
00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:12.280
There's not a bunch of loose skin hanging there.

105
00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:15.760
They're not all scarred up from surgeries. And I look at my trap and I go like,

106
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.430
okay, that looks good. And based on that,

107
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.830
I can then start to feel okay about myself, looking at those pictures.

108
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.830
You know, that's also a, a long time ago and I just don't,

109
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.350
I cannot relate to how I lived then. Wow. It,

110
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.070
it it's, it's, it's very bizarre. Now.

111
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.900
<v 1>When you say you have mental meaning that you're aware of this,</v>

112
00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:43.660
right? So you're aware you have a distorted perception of yourself. Yeah.

113
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.820
<v 0>Very.</v>

114
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.220
<v 1>Much so. And it, what it,</v>

115
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:50.060
what do you think is what's fueling that distorted perception?

116
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.020
<v 0>I, when I go back to like my childhood,</v>

117
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.530
I was put on a diet when I was five. And prior to that,

118
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.690
I had no sense of self.

119
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.090
There were I existed and clearly I,

120
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.490
I had fun and I played, but I was not aware of my body as a thing.

121
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.770
Kind of, if it is external to me as a separate component to me or,

122
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.480
or just as a thing itself, it just was. And at live,

123
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.440
I was put on this diet and all these, uh,

124
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.520
parts of me were pointed out as being super negative.

125
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.960
And so I just, at five years old. Yeah. And, and I really, and by the way,

126
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.800
in fairness, if you look at the average five year old today, I,

127
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.270
I wasn't like, I wasn't obese at five. I was a chubby five year old,

128
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.190
but I was super active and I wasn't eating junk food all day long. And.

129
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.030
<v 1>You're growing into your body too. Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.950
And it's the thing about five year olds. It's like,

131
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.390
I've seen kids that look kind of chubby and then you run into 'em a few years

132
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:57.550
later, like, look at you, you're a Beanstock yeah.

133
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.740
<v 0>You have four it myself and, and you watch them.</v>

134
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:05.460
They kind of go in different directions wide and then tall. And yeah,

135
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.100
there, there isn't a set thing. Um, but I,

136
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.060
I spent most of my life feeling wrong,

137
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.700
like literally that I was wrong or bad or there was some,

138
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.330
some just super negative about myself.

139
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.530
And so I still have to fight through.

140
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:24.340
