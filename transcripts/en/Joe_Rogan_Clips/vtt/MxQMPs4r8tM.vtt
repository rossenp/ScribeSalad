00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.400
<v 2>It's a perfect time to have you on, I mean, this is, uh, I mean,</v>

3
00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:10.280
when we're talking about free speech in the time when the president of the

4
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:13.760
United States has been banned off of Twitter and Facebook and it's right,

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.960
it's a wild time. What, what do you make of that?

6
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.120
<v 1>Well, you know, Facebook and Twitter,</v>

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.990
our private publishers, right? I mean,

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.270
whatev we don't exactly know what they are.

9
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:30.990
They're not exactly like the times or like, uh, NBC or,

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.830
uh, ABC. Um, but they're close. They're,

11
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:37.350
they're certainly in the private sector and,

12
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.380
and the private sector has always had, has always had the discretion.

13
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.940
It's their first amendment, right.

14
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.580
To decide who to publish and who not to publish. Um, you know,

15
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:53.220
it's different with Facebook and Twitter because they claim to be, uh,

16
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.060
platforms like the telephone company that, you know,

17
00:00:56.061 --> 00:01:00.220
anybody can use to have a conversations, but they're,

18
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.490
they're not quite, they, they really are a lot like a publisher and, you know,

19
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.850
the times decided to fire one of its columnists, uh,

20
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.450
cause it didn't like what he wrote. They have a first amendment right. To do so.

21
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.450
And they're not the government. So, you know, in that, to that extent,

22
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.323
um,

23
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.160
Facebook and Twitter did is perfectly legal and,

24
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.880
and not really different than what a publisher or a broadcasting company would

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.880
do if it decided to, uh, to change or,

26
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.760
or fire one of its one of its anchors or one of its, uh, columnists.

27
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.030
Um, on the other hand, the, they are sort of like a platform,

28
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.990
uh, like a, an electronic soapbox that they've erected in a, in,

29
00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:53.790
in a park and invited everybody and anybody to come.

30
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.750
And when they start picking and choosing, uh, no, you are not good.

31
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.430
You're not good. You're okay. You know, you know, they,

32
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.420
when they start being a gatekeeper, uh, you run the risk of them,

33
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.660
closing people out of, of, uh,

34
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.260
a national dialogue and depriving people of an audience basically.

35
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.380
And that that's a problem. And, uh, it's a problem.

36
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.500
We haven't figured out how to work out yet. Uh,

37
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.610
because this medium is infancy. You know, it's people forget that,

38
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.770
that the printing press started in the 15th century in 1400 and something.

39
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.970
And it took hundreds of years before, uh, uh,

40
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.970
uh, freedom of the press and, uh,

41
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:43.290
worked itself out in ways that we're familiar with now. And we are, you know,

42
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:47.920
we are right at the big beginning of this, um, internet, speech, um,

43
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.880
medium. And, uh, it's hard. It's hard. It's hard to say. Uh,

44
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.240
I, I,

45
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.000
I think Facebook and Twitter had the right to do what they did in

46
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.400
banning Trump. Um, uh,

47
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.320
but the question is if they start banning anything

48
00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:07.200
that they don't like,

49
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.360
then they're really closing off the public conversation to people

50
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.680
and what, what's the criteria? How do you do that?

51
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.280
<v 0>Yeah, it, it's also,</v>

52
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.750
it seems to me that what you using these outdated things to compare,

53
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.213
like, uh,

54
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.750
comparing it to the printing press or comparing Facebook or Twitter to

55
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.790
publishers, or even comparing them to something like a utility, like the,

56
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.310
the power there, there's something new, there's something completely different.

57
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.670
And we, I mean,

58
00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:40.740
I hope it's not gonna take hundreds of years to have some sort of a freedom of

59
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:44.420
expression online in these things, but they're monopolies.

60
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.260
It's not like anybody could have bought or made a printing press and printed

61
00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:49.940
their own books or printed their own newspapers.

62
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.260
Not everyone can make their own Twitter, you know, it's too,

63
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.180
it's so complex and there's so many users on it. It,

64
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.140
it there's very few places.

65
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.330
Or you could like legitimately get your word out in a way that you can with

66
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:05.970
Twitter or express yourself. Right.

67
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.570
<v 1>Well, but you know, and it's true that these,</v>

68
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.690
this medium is analogous to utilities in some ways

69
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.970
analogous, uh, to publishes in some ways, but they are new. Yeah.

70
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:21.120
And they're different. They that's right. But,

71
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.000
but consider this when I was growing up, uh, I was a teenager in the fifties,

72
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.713
um,

73
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.720
a big problem with free speech and the democratization of free speech

74
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.240
was that nobody had access to anything. I mean,

75
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.470
you had the times you had the Washington post, you had the newspapers,

76
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.470
you had NBC and ABC and CBS,

77
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.470
and that's where most speech occurred and nobody had access to that. Mm.

78
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.590
Um, so even with, even with the monopolistic bands, uh,

79
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.750
that Twitter and Facebook, uh, are doing these days,

80
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.900
or can do have the power to do, um, the fact is, is that,

81
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.860
uh, many, many millions, more of people,

82
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.220
ordinary people have access to huge audiences, uh, than did,

83
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.180
uh, 50 years ago. Um, uh, you know, if,

84
00:05:17.181 --> 00:05:20.260
if you couldn't get into the times and you couldn't get into the Washington

85
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:24.570
post, and if you couldn't get onto the television, um, you could speak,

86
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.490
you were free to speak, but nobody heard you. Yeah. Um, and so, you know,

87
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.690
it's a lot better now, even,

88
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.970
even with questions about abusing the

89
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:41.330
power of, of being a gatekeeper that Twitter and Facebook have.

90
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.880
<v 0>Yeah. It's, uh, it's just such a strange time for this cuz it's, uh,</v>

91
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.440
in the middle of the, like we're at the end of the president's run,

92
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.640
he's still in office, but yet he's, you know,

93
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.880
everybody wants him out as quickly as possible because you you're wondering what

94
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:03.720
he's gonna do. And he can't really express himself, uh, publicly anymore. It's,

95
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.760
it's just so strange.

96
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.720
<v 1>Yeah. Well of course, you know, he's still the president.</v>

97
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.600
If he held the press conference, uh, everybody would cover it. That's true. Um,

98
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.350
and he, you know, if, if, uh, I used to say, uh,

99
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.910
back in the day that, uh, you know,

100
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.750
my father was a construction worker with a fifth grade education and, uh,

101
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.750
if he had something to say, he could say it to me,

102
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.830
he could say it to our family at Thanksgiving, but, uh,

103
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.820
he didn't have access to an audience of the kind that Roosevelt had

104
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:42.260
when he went on the radio and he couldn't get into the times as easily as,

105
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.700
as the governor of New York,

106
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.900
if the governor of New York held the press conference. So, you know, it isn't,

107
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.140
it, it isn't different in that, in that respect,

108
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.140
I'm not too worried about a president not having access, uh,

109
00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.770
to a public audience. A president has tremendous power, uh,

110
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.090
to attract the tension and, and that, that was true a hundred years ago.

111
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.690
Um, what I'm worried about are ordinary people.

112
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.930
What I'm worried about are, are, are people like you, um,

113
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.640
uh, people, you know, who have something to say, um,

114
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.360
but their freedom is that they get to say it in the closet, you know,

115
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:26.920
where nobody hears them. Uh, you know, there, there's an interesting story.

116
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.560
Uh, a real case that happened in the sixties, uh,

117
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.800
when James Meredith, who was the first black person to, uh,

118
00:07:35.801 --> 00:07:40.550
enter the university of Mississippi, uh, was shot when,

119
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:45.110
uh, on his first day there. And it was a, it was a real outrage.

120
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:50.190
It was in the early sixties and a, uh, a man named Sydney street. Uh,

121
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.190
a black guy living up in Harlem in New York, uh,

122
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.910
was so angered that, you know, he, he,

123
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.540
he wanted to American ideals, uh,

124
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.900
American principles of Liberty and equal rights have just gone up and smoked

125
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:06.734
today.

126
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.060
And if he had stood on a street corner at 140 fifth street in Harlem

127
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.300
and stood up on a soap box and said that the only people who would've heard him

128
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.570
were a few dozen and people who passed him on that street corner.

129
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.290
So what he did is he got out on the street corner and he burned an American

130
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.170
flag. Uh, it was his flag. He owned it.

131
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.610
So he wasn't destroying anybody else's property.

132
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.290
He burned the American flag and by burning the American flag,

133
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.890
he attracted television cameras,

134
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.560
which his words by themselves ELs would not have attracted.

135
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.360
So the television cameras came and he got to say,

136
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.920
I'm burning this flag to symbolize the fact that if a guy like James America

137
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.680
could get shot just for going to school, uh,

138
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.680
America's ideals have gone up and smoke.

139
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.280
And he got onto the six o'clock news and,

140
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.520
and millions of people heard it, heard his words,

141
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.920
and he was prosecuted for burning the flag, which was a crime at the time.

142
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.360
And his case eventually went up to the Supreme court and the Supreme court

143
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.070
overruled it and said it was symbolic speech. Uh, but,

144
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:21.230
but the reason that I'm telling that story is that, is that it,

145
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.830
it, it demonstrates how before there was an internet,

146
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.670
people had to figure out dramatic things to do, uh,

147
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:34.790
to get their message, uh, to more than a handful of people. And that's why,

148
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.100
you know, Benjamin spot burn draft cards, that's, that's,

149
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.020
that's why Sydney street burned the flag. Uh,

150
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.620
that's why there were demonstrations, uh,

151
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:49.340
instead of just instead of just words and, and, uh, you know,

152
00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:53.580
it worked all right, uh, for some people, but for the most part, uh,

153
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:58.850
most people could not get their mess messages out to large audiences until the

154
00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.843
internet came.

155
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:04.730
And so even with Twitter and Facebook acting

156
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.370
as gatekeepers in ways that trouble us, uh,

157
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:11.810
because we don't know what the limits are. We don't know what the standards are,

158
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:17.000
and we don't know why we should be having these private people decide

159
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.520
who gets to hear what, uh, but even with that, um, this,

160
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.880
the ability of ordinary people today to reach

161
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:31.080
huge audiences with whatever it is they want to say is much,

162
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:33.800
much larger. I mean, by,

163
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.790
by orders of magnitude larger than was 30 or 40 or 50 years ago.

164
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.030
<v 0>Oh, unquestionably. Um,</v>

165
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.910
but it just concerns me when a corporation has the ability to dictate,

166
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.030
even if it's a, a problem president, even if it's someone is as crazy as Trump,

167
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.910
just when a corporation gets together and they decide,

168
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.580
decide that this guy can't use their platform anymore, uh,

169
00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.860
a platform that hundreds of millions of people use. It just,

170
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.540
it just seems very strange. Well.

171
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.620
<v 1>It, it is, it is, it is a problem because there are no standards. Right.</v>

172
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.581
And that's what,

173
00:11:07.581 --> 00:11:11.460
that's what I mean when I say we're just the beginning of thinking about how,

174
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.220
how to, how to do that. I mean, here's, here's what, what I see as the issue,

175
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.130
uh, um, if you allow Facebook and Twitter

176
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.660
to make these decisions in the same way that you allow the times in the

177
00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:32.500
Washington post and, and, and television networks, uh, to decide what,

178
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:37.900
what they publish, um, then you run the risk of,

179
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.450
of arbitrary exclusions, uh, from,

180
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.290
from people's speech, reaching large audiences, um,

181
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:51.530
not just the president who has alternative alternative means, uh,

182
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.480
but ordinary people, the only way to remedy that

183
00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.853
is by law.

184
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.240
The only way to remedy that is to give the government the power to regulate

185
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.960
what these corporations can do.

186
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.650
And all of our history shows that if you give the government the power

187
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:12.890
to regulate speech,

188
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:17.800
you're gonna in a lot worse shape than if you allow the private

189
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:18.840
sector to do it,

190
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:24.000
because who in the government are you gonna give that power to? Hmm. Um,

191
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.800
you're gonna give it to Trump. You're gonna give it to Giuliani.

192
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.960
You're gonna give it to Joe McCarthy. Um, you're gonna give it, you know, to,

193
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.150
to, to Roosevelt are in the war who might have, uh,

194
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.750
barred Japanese Americans from speaking to large audiences. I mean,

195
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.390
who are you gonna give that power to?

196
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.950
And our entire history shows that the only way to regulate

197
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.710
private power is through government power.

198
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.020
And if you regulate speech through government power and you give of the

199
00:12:55.021 --> 00:12:58.340
government, the power to decide who gets to speak and who doesn't get to speak,

200
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.740
we will be in far worse shape, uh, than we are in,

201
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.820
in having the private set to do that.
