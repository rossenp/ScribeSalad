00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.000
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. As a person who performs it.</v>

2
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.040
And also as an audience member,

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.120
when I'm an audience member and someone's killing,

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.680
I'm letting them think for me, right? I'm not even thinking.

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.440
I'm just like letting them take me down a trip.

6
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:17.560
Like say like David tell David tell was at the, uh,

7
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:20.280
improv the other night we worked together and he was amazing.

8
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.950
Like one of the best sets I've seen from him. And he's always been amazing,

9
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.110
but God, he was on fire and we were all, it was me, my friend,

10
00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:30.590
Owen Smith and Tony Hinch cliff.

11
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:35.190
We were sitting in the back room and we were watching Dave and we were in a tra

12
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.350
we were just laughing. We were letting him think for us.

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.830
&lt;laugh&gt; you know what I'm saying? Like, he's doing all the thinking.

14
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.660
We just on a little ride that Dave's taken us on this ride.

15
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.220
And as an audience member, I recognize that there's a mass hypnosis.

16
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.260
There's a thing that happens where we all get into this mindset.

17
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.900
And if someone has like really well crafted material, like David tell,

18
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.100
and they take you on a, you let them, you're like, we

19
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.220
Ted's gonna take us on a ride. You know what I.

20
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.250
<v 1>Mean? Think the same thing happened, uh, when a politician is speaking.</v>

21
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.850
<v 0>That's a good question for sure.</v>

22
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:11.450
Trump has a lot of elements of standup comedy in his routines, for sure.

23
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.403
A hundred percent.

24
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.770
If you watch his most recent speech where he is making fun of Joe Biden saying

25
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.290
150 million people were killed with guns. And he's like,

26
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:20.810
can I looked at the first lady? I mean, he's literally doing standup,

27
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.640
who does a very good job. The way I looked at the first lady. I'm like,

28
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:26.280
where are all these bodies? Where are all these 115 million people?

29
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:29.720
That's half the population. Like they just let him say, nobody talks to him.

30
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.520
He's like, uh, hello, Idaho. And you're like, you're in Iowa. Oh,

31
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.160
like he's doing standup.

32
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.240
And so someone took it and they made a video saying Donald Trump at the

33
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:41.060
Apollo.

34
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.830
And so they put him doing this speech with audience

35
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.590
reaction from people watching standup comedy and laughing and a laugh track over

36
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:53.430
it. And it seems real. It seems like he's a comic. So he's what about Bernie?

37
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.390
Bernie? Um, for sure is a powerful speaker,

38
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.870
but I don't think he's that funny mean,

39
00:01:57.871 --> 00:01:59.750
he'll say a funny thing every now and then. Right. But.

40
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.550
<v 1>Are the same when you talk about like going along for the ride,</v>

41
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:05.420
like there do win. The thinking for you is such an interesting idea.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.260
<v 0>Bernie is a trustworthy person. People trust him, they see him up there.</v>

43
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.940
He's not polished. Right?

44
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.300
The thing about Bernie it's like when he's saying things, there's,

45
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:20.580
there's ums and there's S and there's, you know? Yeah. Buts polished.

46
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.250
It's a different kind of Polish. What do you mean Trump is a polished per yeah.

47
00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:29.250
Like he he's like a comic doing scat, you know? It's, you know, he's like,

48
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:31.450
yeah. I'm telling you, that's exactly what it is. It's an amazing,

49
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.210
it's an amazing thing. He's like filling in the blanks,

50
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.890
loading up his weapon for the next line that he's gonna throw and called crazy.

51
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.850
Hillary lock her up lock it's standup. It's basically like he's doing standup.

52
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.960
That's why Biden is so. He's so. Cuz he can't talk. Right.

53
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.600
He has a really hard time talking. He keeps screwing things up. Yeah. And he,

54
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:53.600
and it's a real bad horse to bet on. Cause he's an older guy.

55
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.533
You're still a Bernie.

56
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.440
<v 1>Guy, this.</v>

57
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.040
<v 0>Bernie. Right. I love the guy. I love what he represents. Yeah. Like I,</v>

58
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.560
I don't know if he's gonna be able to get anything implemented. What I love,

59
00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:06.280
what he represents is a man who wants to do good for people that

60
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.760
don't have much. That's that's a sentiment. There's a,

61
00:03:10.761 --> 00:03:14.240
there's a quality to that that I think helps us as a community,

62
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.200
as a community of the United States. If we have this agreement, Hey,

63
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.870
let's see what we can do. Let's see what we can do to balance things out and to,

64
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.790
for the downtrodden, for the people that are hurting, concentrate on them.

65
00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:30.350
And he's made that a huge priority of his life and always has.

66
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.070
And to deny that it's like, look what he's trying to do.

67
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.670
I don't know if he can get any of this passed.

68
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.750
I don't think anybody knows until he gets in there.

69
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.540
But the idea is we're saying we want better for people

70
00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:46.940
who don't have much. Yeah. That's what he stands for.

71
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.340
And you can call it democratic socialism. But, but it's an idea.

72
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.340
The idea is like helping people, just helping people, helping people,

73
00:03:55.341 --> 00:03:56.000
you don't even know,

74
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.060
making the world a little bit better place for the working person.

75
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.970
<v 1>What's then the, a corollary. What's the Trump idea. And why did it succeed?</v>

76
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.410
<v 0>Bunch of pusies out there trying to ban free speech. A bunch of out there.</v>

77
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.330
Come on. America's number one. Yeah. Yeah. There's also,

78
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.010
he doesn't talk like a politician. You know, he talks about China.

79
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.610
You go to them listening when they charge you 25% and everybody's like, yeah,

80
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.120
more standup. It's more standup. Right? It's way more entertaining.

81
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.560
He's the most entertaining. Forget about value.

82
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.280
Judgment of who he is as a person, without a doubt.

83
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:31.960
The most entertaining president that's ever lived and not even close.

84
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:33.240
There's not even a close second.

85
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.680
He burs all of them and he drags him into his fight. He,

86
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.030
Hillary is now talking differently about other people she said about Bernie.

87
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.430
Nobody liked him. She would've never said that before Donald Trump.

88
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.230
She would've never uttered those words.

89
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.150
His victory over her is deep in her DNA now.

90
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.030
And she's starting to exhibit some of his patterns. Yeah.

91
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.630
By saying nobody ever liked him. How could you say that? What kind of crazy?

92
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.380
Of course, millions of people like him, they're voting for him. Millions,

93
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.460
millions of people to say nobody liked him or nobody liked him in the,

94
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.020
of course, course, people like him. And then they started writing.

95
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.060
I like Bernie, these hashtag I like Bernie start popping up.

96
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:17.820
Like that behavior is a direct reaction to her getting

97
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.700
pounded on by Donald Trump through the entire campaign they're.

98
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.811
<v 1>Losing. So let me ask you this.</v>

99
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:25.330
You've talked to a lot of people from all different realms in here, right? Yeah.

100
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.380
If we can agree,

101
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.930
let's say that being entertaining is not a great prerequisite

102
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.130
or qualification for being president. If we can agree on that,

103
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.170
which we can definitely seems pretty.

104
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.210
<v 0>Easy. Yes. Very easy.</v>

105
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.930
<v 1>Agree on, um, what can be done, whether it's in the political sphere,</v>

106
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.960
the media sphere, uh, putting, uh,

107
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:48.400
something in the drinking water to let people, to encourage people,

108
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.360
to have a little bit more of what you're after, whether it's compassion,

109
00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:56.680
whether it's understanding, whether it's balance, whether it's moderation.

110
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.560
In other words, why is the entertainment force winning right now?

111
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.440
And if you don't like that notion what can be done about it? Well.

112
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.640
<v 0>The entertainment force is for whatever reason is being</v>

113
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.320
portrayed through Trump only see he's not a politician.

114
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.910
He's a guy, who's a media star and he's been a media star for at gain.

115
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.590
He knows how to manipulate the media.

116
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.270
He knows how to sit on the Letterman couch and kill.

117
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.030
He's been doing it for a long time.

118
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.510
He's very comfortable being in front of cameras.

119
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.550
None of those people have those kind of skills and nobody thought of it as a

120
00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:34.070
skill. They thought of a politician being able to do their politician stuff.

121
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.500
When this guy's calling you crazy, Ted or lion, Ted, you know, lion Hillary,

122
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.900
he just makes up Danes, soya, sleepy, Joe. I.

123
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.660
<v 1>Mean, and I'm smiling because it's funny cuz he's at.</v>

124
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.940
<v 0>It's he's funny. He's good at it. Here's the problem.</v>

125
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.500
You shouldn't have a God popularity contest to see who controls Thermo nuclear

126
00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:54.420
weapons. That's stupid. It's stupid. They allow people to vote.

127
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.540
<v 1>It's but it's on a popularity, but it's the system we've got.</v>

128
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.170
So that what I'm I'm asking you is what now?

129
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.970
<v 0>Well, the system's only a couple hundred years.</v>

130
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.690
<v 1>Old. I know. Or even the, this kind of, I mean the way that these elections are.</v>

131
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:07.770
Cause I don't think it was. I mean, if you look at Lincoln Douglas debates,

132
00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:09.610
those were actual debates with two people.

133
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.650
<v 0>Hours, hours, and hours.</v>

134
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.970
<v 1>Hours. It has evolved a lot. But I mean,</v>

135
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:15.970
let's say that you're not happy with the way it is. And there's a lot of people,

136
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.691
even there,

137
00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:21.320
people who like Trump quite a bit on some dimensions who are very troubled by

138
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:24.880
other dimensions, there's a lot of people out there who are open to like, no,

139
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.760
let's, let's try to adjust the thinking. Let's try to change our minds.

140
00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:32.200
Let's try to not be influenced as much by what we're being influenced by.

141
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.440
Do you have any, uh, do you have any pointers? The.

142
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.110
<v 0>The real problem that we're having is this the battle of left versus</v>

143
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.790
right. And the, the strongest voices on the left,

144
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.590
the loudest voices and the most extreme,

145
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.270
oftentimes are the worst representations and the same with the right,

146
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.830
the loudest, most extreme team member.

147
00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:55.550
They're the people at the front of the line. Okay, we're gonna kick their.

148
00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.020
I'm like, is that guy with me? &lt;laugh&gt; am I on this team, are we in a war now?

149
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:03.060
We're in a war with the left. Like that's what it is, you know? And um,

150
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.620
and there's also these ideas that we have that are cemented in stone that,

151
00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:11.180
you know, if you are, uh, a left wing person, you believe in X, Y, and Z,

152
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:12.900
this is your doctrine. If you're right wing. Yeah.

153
00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:14.380
Where most of us have like a little bit of this.

154
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.220
Maybe you believe in the second amendment,

155
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.890
maybe you believe in the first amendment. Maybe you think that maybe you, uh,

156
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.330
maybe we should incorporate a lot of the things we do with the fire department

157
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.570
and you know,

158
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.210
and do that to schools and do that to housing and do that to make sure that all

159
00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:31.650
the, the stuff's covered make housing, like a,

160
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.010
an important part of a civilization. Like for everybody, we did a.

161
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.850
<v 1>Piece, uh, Freakonomics radio piece, uh,</v>

162
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.930
year or two ago called America's hidden doop.

163
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.680
And it was about the democratic and Republican party basically. Yeah.

164
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.080
Acting like pep Pepsi and Coke, right.

165
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.400
They kind of divide and conquer the market and they've built an industry that is

166
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.200
incredibly valuable. Yeah. The thing that's amazing to me is this, uh,

167
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.920
Trump won the presidency as the Republican that the RNC most wanted to get

168
00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:04.840
rid of Bernie last time around was the Democrat that the

169
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.600
DNC wanted to get rid of.

170
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:11.120
They lost by getting their candidate Hilary in this time,

171
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.360
Bernie who may very well become the candidate is again,

172
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.230
the party that the DNC is out to get.

173
00:09:17.231 --> 00:09:19.550
So what does it say that you've gotta duopoly,

174
00:09:19.551 --> 00:09:24.230
literally the machines running the system that we kind of let ourselves get

175
00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:27.510
manipulated into buying, like you said, I've never understood my mom,

176
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.630
my mom and dad were Democrats for a long, long time. Typical Catholic. Okay.

177
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.790
Maybe not so typical. Cause they were former Jewish Catholic,

178
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:40.020
typical Catholic working class, big family meat and potatoes issues.

179
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.220
No brainer that they're Democrats. Okay. And then, but my mom,

180
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.260
as a devout Catholic,

181
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.220
she started the local right to life chapter in upstate New York where we lived

182
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.500
New York state had legalized abortion before Roe V Wade.

183
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.890
So she was fighting that fight early when that happened.

184
00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.130
And the Democrats lined up against, uh, in favor, uh,

185
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.330
in favor of legalized abortion. She switched parties.

186
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.450
Everything else about her was still mostly democratic,

187
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.570
but she had to become a Republican because.

188
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.250
<v 0>Of life. And that's a, that's another powerful one that gets integrated.</v>

189
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.250
<v 1>Into the right. And it happens to all of us though.</v>

190
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.320
We take there's one issue that kind of sets people off and then they have to

191
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:22.120
join the team. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that they may, uh, yeah. You know,
