00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.840
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. John Jones versus Francis and Ghana.</v>

2
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.560
Why'd you have to go there, dude. What that's gonna happen for sure.

3
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.620
The only thing,

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.480
the only thing that I would hope if that ever happens is that we allow in

5
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:21.590
Ghana to get the press that he deserves. Like,

6
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.830
like to pump him up in a way that he deserves to make that fight.

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.950
You Don think gets it. People are terrified of that, man.

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.710
They are hardcore fans and hardcore fighters.

9
00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:32.190
Like everybody who's in the know and everybody in the heavyweight division has,

10
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:34.070
but he's not like a superstar. He's not a worldwide.

11
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:36.310
It's it's too tough to get superstar status. You gotta do some.

12
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.790
The thing is if he had beat Derek Lewis fight up. Yes. Yeah. That was a hard,

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.740
the Steve bay fight him up too. If he had beaten Steve bay, that would helped,

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.340
he would, he could be a national hero. He'd be a huge,

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.980
he would be a huge success story. Well, first of all, in his country, for sure,

16
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.540
for sure. Well, he's still a hero there, no matter well, for sure he is,

17
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:56.700
but I mean, in this country he would be a hero of like,

18
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.580
like the scariest guy in the world was an immigrant that barely spoke English a

19
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:01.021
little while ago.

20
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:04.130
And now he's me people and he's only been fighting for six years. True.

21
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.770
And he developed his strength by the way, in a sand mind when he was a child,

22
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.890
Jesus doing child labor. It's insane. Africa. What the man? Oh, any of,

23
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.010
be a really nice guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy.

24
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.970
He's from camera room and he's funny. He's like smiley, funny, happy.

25
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.690
Guy's great. He hits people and they go into orbit.

26
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.280
They go into orbit they're so, you know, what's crazy. You know, what's crazy.

27
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.200
I think John beats still beats them. Dude. What a fight that would be, he does.

28
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.600
Right? What a fight that would be. I think John would be the favorite.

29
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.560
Does John beats DPE, if you had gone to your head,

30
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.280
I think John beats everybody there.

31
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:39.720
There's not a man on this plant who beats John ju wow. We never seen John. Well,

32
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:43.470
he doesn't have to lose weight. We never seen John where, you know,

33
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.750
he's not cutting 25 pounds and just think how good he'd be watching his diet.

34
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:51.110
What if he's eating healthy, like good,

35
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.870
large portions and just hydrating as much as he wants all day long,

36
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.590
maybe he's 10% better. You know, we don't know.

37
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:00.630
Maybe John Jones is really the best 240 pound heavyweight in the world.

38
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.100
He's just been fighting. He walk at two. No, but he could get easily.

39
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.740
He's two 30 east. Right. And if he decided that look, his,

40
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.500
he comes from one of the best camps in the world, right.

41
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:14.940
If Javi Vasquez and crazy Bob cook get together and they,

42
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:18.060
they come together with like a, a physical plan, you know,

43
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.380
for like CA Velasquez. Right? If they're gonna, if they're gonna look at like,

44
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:25.290
what's the best weight for a guy like CA they're, they're probably gonna say,

45
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.570
you know, you don't have to lose any weight,

46
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.410
like 2 42 40 is the perfect heavy seems to like, yeah. Yeah. Jackson win John.

47
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:31.850
They're gonna do the same thing. A hundred percent.

48
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.210
They're they're one of the best camps in the world.

49
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.890
John Jones was raised in one of you look at the success,

50
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.290
just go down the line from Carlos con like even Yoel Romero went down to

51
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:44.400
Jackson. Winkel John. He was training John they're. It's gonna be like,

52
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:48.000
like AKA or like Rufus, or like any of the top camp they're gonna go.

53
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.920
Where do you think he's going? That they go, where he be at here? He said,

54
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:54.240
he's going. I know, but they're gonna, they're gonna figure out a wait for him.

55
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.640
The, about what is is even 2 35, you said Israel,

56
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.040
Sunday is way bigger than you thought.

57
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.880
<v 1>Way bigger. And he's, and he's definitely a better striker. I would imagine.</v>

58
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.120
I don't know about MMA, but he's, that would be an interesting fight.

59
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.240
He's just too small. I think isn't he? Isn't he too.

60
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.560
<v 0>Thin? Well, he's a solid 30 pounds lighter.</v>

61
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.640
I think walking around the John is that's it very, but that's,

62
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:18.280
that's why he's not, he doesn't wanna fight him. Now. He wants to get older.

63
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.070
Israel can gain weight. Israel can, you know,

64
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.470
if he decides like Canello Avarez when he went off to fight Cove, right? Again,

65
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.990
same kind of thing. Canello Avarez is a world class camp.

66
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.430
They figure out how to do this. They might is a little,

67
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.390
I was gonna say supplementary. There.

68
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.110
<v 1>Might. There's definitely might be. I'm just there's there might be.</v>

69
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.980
<v 0>But that's stopping argument. It's not true. It's not that outlandish.</v>

70
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.540
It's not that outlandish. If when you see him, you're like she,

71
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.820
if he can put on the weight and physically get up to a certain weight,

72
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.700
cause his skillset, his, his, his pure, his striking is better as John. Yeah.

73
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.180
Well he's legit world class, world, class, legit, world class, legit,

74
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:58.180
legit world class. He lost in the title fight to James wilderness.

75
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.330
And I thought he won. It was is, is a very close fight.

76
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.250
The way he did Robert Whitaker. Yeah. And he looks like he Whitaker on five.

77
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.450
He's a beast man. Six, four. But, but the thing about him and that whole gym,

78
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:13.330
they won, um, uh, Jim Kovski. Yeah.

79
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.850
VUL Kovski hook just became a world champion.

80
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.930
Dan who bounced back from the Barb. Boza fight looking like an, an looking,

81
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.040
they fight your boy, uh, Feld. Ooh. That's a crazy fight. And they're in,

82
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.880
I think they're in New Zealand, right? Yep. Woo. Yeah, dude,

83
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:30.880
there there's a bunch of killers in that camp, but they would have to have a,

84
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:34.720
they would've to formulate a game plan. They would've to say, okay, what,

85
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.160
what weight is the right weight? Is it you too big at two 30?

86
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.950
Cuz you'd be two 20 is two 20. Are you faster?

87
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.590
Like when you have the most cardio, when, what,

88
00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:46.190
what's the point of diminishing returns? Just like I paid,

89
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.710
I think with like my example with CA is probably not the best example,

90
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.590
but I still to this day think of him as like probably one of the greatest

91
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:56.390
talents of heavyweight divisions. That that's a great example. There's two 40,

92
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.230
it's a great example in his weight,

93
00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:01.420
but I don't think he ever concentrated on it. I think he was just like that.

94
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:05.340
He just went at it, just, just trained real hard and was two 40,

95
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.140
but like a two 40 an example, 2 38, but like, okay.

96
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:13.860
Like here's one like Marlon rise, like Marlon rise. When he went to, uh,

97
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.780
when he fought 1 35 against a judo and faded the next fight, he came in lighter.

98
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.090
Like there, you know, American top teams like, listen, let's let's,

99
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.770
let's bring your body weight down a little bit.

100
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.010
Let's figure out what's the right formula here.

101
00:05:26.011 --> 00:05:30.450
And that's why a big camp that has a lot of experience in world title fights and

102
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.650
knows like seeing so many different fights. Huge.

103
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:34.450
It's so important because they can look at you. They go, Brian,

104
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.250
I don't see you as a 70. I see you as a 55.

105
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.010
I think we gotta get in nutrition order. Like what they've done,

106
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.680
like think about what what's what's happened with all just with the introduction

107
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.640
of a nutritionist, 1 35.

108
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.680
<v 1>He used to have trouble with 45.</v>

109
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.680
<v 0>Legitimately made 35 and looked like a beast and took big shots</v>

110
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.960
from some people thought he won the fight. I thought he won the fight. Yeah.

111
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.840
That's fair. I thought he won the fight. He was no argument. It was close it.

112
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.520
<v 2>See both both ways. But I.</v>

113
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.760
<v 0>Yeah, but dude, that's,</v>

114
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.800
that's all about optimizing all your possibilities, you know?

115
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.120
And then there's guys like John Jones who don't have to do that. That's.

116
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.280
<v 2>He's so yeah. I just want him to get a heavyweight.</v>

117
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.310
I just want him to get a heavyweight cause he'll get up for it.

118
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:23.310
Can you imagine that the trailer for him for steep a then him versus Francis

119
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.590
and Ghana, him and Francis I'll think they announce that fight. Frank.

120
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.350
<v 0>You just.</v>

121
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.230
<v 1>Wonder though about his brothers being Allstar in the.</v>

122
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.190
<v 2>NFL. Hold on. When you say his brother,</v>

123
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.990
I think was second the league and sat Taylor.

124
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.260
<v 1>Jones. Think about that now, brother.</v>

125
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.740
And would you say his brothers are better athletes than John in one way or

126
00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:41.860
another? Or is it no. Can't say.

127
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.780
<v 2>That when it, when it comes to what the NFL requires.</v>

128
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.060
<v 0>Look at much bigger. His other brother is like a Chandler and this Arthur. Now,</v>

129
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.740
if.

130
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.540
<v 2>If that the one, the one on the rights, the pro baller, he's an beast in.</v>

131
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.340
<v 1>The NFL. If that guy's training, he might be the only guy who can beat.</v>

132
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.090
<v 0>John Johnson. 6, 5, 2 60. He ain't making 2 0 5 son. Oh no.</v>

133
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:02.810
He's not that dude's huge. Jesus, God, but that's phenomenal. But.

134
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.930
<v 2>John, John, those guys.</v>

135
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.970
<v 0>Brother that's the big thing is that they grew up beating each other's asses.</v>

136
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.730
I guess that's.

137
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.170
<v 2>What John's used to. Yeah. And then the, the one on the left,</v>

138
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:15.290
who's a tackle on the NFL. I think he's still in it, but he, uh,

139
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.000
would come in for John's camps and a whole John down. He would, yeah. Geez.

140
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.320
He would train with John. Oh, he did great.

141
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.200
<v 0>Guy. He's enormous. Yeah. There's video and pictures of uh, Arthur.</v>

142
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.520
Arthur training with John. He's so big. Look how big he wide hips. Oh my God.

143
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.160
He's 300 plus. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big fell anyway. Um,

144
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.560
so it's a great gene pool he's coming from. And you know, I,

145
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.190
I have this about guys who grow up with brothers that beat their asses,

146
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.870
like Matt Hughes, one of the greatest we weights of all time.

147
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.710
One of the things about him is he had a twin brother. That was exactly him.

148
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.630
Doesn't Aswin have a twin brother. I don't know. But Matt, I don't think so.

149
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.390
Matt and Mark Hughes used to beat the out each other. He does, you know,

150
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:54.910
check out.

151
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.830
<v 1>I think Ben ASIN.</v>

152
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.351
<v 0>Has a twin brother.</v>

153
00:07:56.351 --> 00:08:00.220
You ever see Joe lows on and his brother beating the of each other at a, at a,

154
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.980
like a family picnic, the DS brothers too.

155
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.260
They have an MMA fight in the grass at a family picnic. What? Yeah.

156
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.780
Family picnic. They're they're all hanging out in the backyard of a house,

157
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.700
all the families around with red cups, their hand drinking beer. And,

158
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.820
and these guys are beaten, scraping out of each other. Yeah. My.

159
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.500
<v 2>Brother had to go see a therapist. He'd beat me up. So.</v>

160
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.210
<v 0>I'm sorry. I never met. And max aspirin and not twins. Definitely not twins.</v>

161
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.850
Definitely not twins. No. Oops. Yeah.

162
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.170
It's like that thing about brothers. It's it's,

163
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.210
that's one of the ways to make tougher people. Yep.

164
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:34.170
Cause you don't get an escape every day.

165
00:08:34.171 --> 00:08:38.970
That big right next to you and you're like. And you have to learn like, um,

166
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.720
uh, Chris Whiteman, same thing as him, when he was younger, they did a really.

167
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.880
<v 1>Interesting study about the fastest people in the world.</v>

168
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.080
All were like either the youngest or secular. Let me guess. They're black.

169
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.400
Large families. Yeah.

170
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.920
And they had to keep up with their older brothers and the sisters.

171
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.400
There's there's some, that's a little bit of sign, but that is.

172
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.760
<v 0>Written up in the book. I think it's it's outliers sports Jean or outliers.</v>

173
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.440
I think it's in outliers. Yeah. It's in one of those. Yeah.

174
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.360
Would examine why people are hyper successful. That'd be a good.

175
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.480
<v 3>Name for a podcast, bro science where A's out there,</v>

176
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.920
Carlan car blanche to talk about. And you don't have to be an expert on it.

177
00:09:11.921 --> 00:09:12.754
And that's what we.

178
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.790
<v 0>Anyway, besides Joe, all of us. Yeah. That's what we do. But.</v>

179
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.750
<v 3>If you call it bro science, then you have a free pass.</v>

180
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.710
<v 0>Yeah, dude, I do it too. I don't know half what I'm talking about.</v>

181
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.590
If you like looked at it on a chart, how much of what I'm saying?

182
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.030
Do I actually know what I'm talking about? Yeah.

183
00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:28.510
But that's the difference is you'll ask questions &lt;laugh&gt; yeah,

184
00:09:28.511 --> 00:09:30.470
but that's ask them questions. We just, yeah,
