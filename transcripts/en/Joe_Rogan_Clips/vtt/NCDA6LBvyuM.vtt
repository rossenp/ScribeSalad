WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 0>Uh, so the goat really did fall over and die. Well, no.</v>

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.120
<v 1>Oh, well guys, severely. Um, so we tracked down the goat stair.</v>

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.520
This is to, uh, he now runs a dance studio in Ohio, uh,

4
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.880
the dance and martial arts studio. Jesus Christ. Yeah. So we tracked him down.

5
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.390
I said, I said to him on the phone said, do you still have, uh,

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.270
like kill goats just by staring at them? And he went, well, listen,

7
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:30.230
matter of fact, uh, just last week I,

8
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.830
I killed my hamster just by staring at.

9
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.710
<v 0>Them. Hamsters lived to be like three days old.</v>

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.990
<v 1>He said, he said, he, he said he called it on video. And I said,</v>

11
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.270
what can we come and watch the video? So we weren't. He said, okay.

12
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.100
So we flew to a high to meet GE. So like,

13
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:46.934
he's like,

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.500
so the hamster's like running around in its wheel and like guys off camera,

15
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.140
like staring at the hamster.

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.700
And then finally the hamster gets off the wheel and it's like all the so dust.

17
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.900
And then the hamster light drops like stops moving,

18
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.850
drops down and stops moving amid the so dust. So I'm like,

19
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.113
whoa.

20
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.850
And then the hamster gets up again and the video ends.

21
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.610
So I was like, that's not dead.

22
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.770
Like &lt;laugh&gt;. And a guy said.

23
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.210
<v 0>You flew all the way to Ohio. You see a video of hamster.</v>

24
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.920
<v 1>Yeah. So guy said, yeah, yeah. My wife, my wife told me, like,</v>

25
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.480
not to my wife said, don't show them the part where the hamster dies.

26
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.040
&lt;laugh&gt; so what? Yeah. In case I was like a bleeding heart li and I was like.

27
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.873
<v 0>Why? Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.880
His wife told him to not show you the video that you flew all the

29
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.833
way, the to a heart.

30
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.150
<v 1>To see. Well, I think it's possible that the hamster just doesn't die.</v>

31
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.510
<v 0>Um, no way, bro. &lt;laugh&gt; but.</v>

32
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.830
<v 1>It's true. But guy showed me like a hope I, is that him? Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:54.664
There's guys Elliot.

34
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.950
<v 0>Full screen, please.</v>

35
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.430
<v 1>You need to put a guy's belly in mind. Hey,</v>

36
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:01.110
what happens when you've got a guest who's on for three hours and they want to

37
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:02.110
use the bathroom? Just.

38
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.470
<v 0>Go ahead and use the bathroom. Good. Can you cover for yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

39
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:06.780
We'll we'll we'll turn the, all him here. Okay. Oh,

40
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:11.460
he's doing some fake martial arts too. Oh, is hilarious. Oh,

41
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:15.300
you don't understand. This is my favorite stuff. John Ronson, look at this.

42
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.620
This is my favorite stuff. It's all like pokes triangle of death.

43
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.220
&lt;laugh&gt; oh, it's called the triangle of death. Yeah.

44
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.810
I didn't define the oh. Back to that need. I need to watch that again.

45
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.970
This is hilarious.

46
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.850
<v 2>This light here behind there's aro artery. Ooh. The artery here.</v>

47
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.010
<v 0>Is the, uh, esophagus airway. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.850
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; and the, the ABC approach of helping a person or hurting a person,</v>

49
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.570
they need a clear airway.

50
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.520
They need to be able to breathe and they need have circulation of

51
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:50.360
blood through their body.

52
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.880
<v 0>Pause that for a second.</v>

53
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.880
What's one thing about artists is they always like use these real technical

54
00:02:55.881 --> 00:03:00.600
terms, like especially martial arts, artists. They always talk about like,

55
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.920
uh, like medical terms that they're like disrupting the, the nerve,

56
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.320
the vagus nerve that goes to the brain. And the,

57
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.920
this is your C six C seven, your cervical disc.

58
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.400
And I'm gonna attack the cervical disc through the carotid artery.

59
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.321
They're all like,

60
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:21.470
it's almost like they learn in all these technical terms to sort of make their

61
00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:24.150
horse, look more palatable. Good.

62
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.310
<v 2>In order to live in the poison hand technique.</v>

63
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.143
<v 0>Poison hands.</v>

64
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.870
<v 2>Although we're not showing you how to strike,</v>

65
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.230
to penetrate the skin of which we have a way to do that. &lt;laugh&gt; what the.

66
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.870
<v 0>Motion that we use. Please don't show anybody, sir,</v>

67
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.420
with your flabby grandma arms, he's gonna watch, he's gonna show you.

68
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.700
Oh boy. &lt;laugh&gt; how's he.

69
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.580
<v 3>Alive? It's.</v>

70
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.580
<v 0>Just the end part is my favorite where he does like the karate stands</v>

71
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:57.220
behind the, the guy's back. He sit your.

72
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.113
<v 3>Tap.</v>

73
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.170
<v 0>And looking at the end part. The little, little loop pan to the back. Uh, guys.</v>

74
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.073
Wonderful.

75
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.323
<v 3>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

76
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.410
<v 0>I don't know why, man. I don't know why,</v>

77
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.890
but this stuff gives me so much pleasure. I,

78
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.450
I enjoy fake martial arts videos.

79
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.640
I more than almost anything more, almost as much as hold this beer,

80
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.920
that Twitter account that I, every two days I have to retweet one.

81
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.320
Cause I find a good new one. I don't know why he's got new stuff. Oh,

82
00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:36.160
what's he gonna do? Mind development? Oh, mind development. Oh,

83
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.480
striking tickets. Let me see this. Let me see this. The guy's quote close.

84
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:42.270
He's touching him. He's about to touch him. &lt;laugh&gt;.

85
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.710
<v 3>What the. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

86
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.630
what the with that. The guy's about to touch him.

87
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.910
<v 4>Tun means that you can do whatever has to be done to protect. Not.</v>

88
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.150
<v 3>Hurt. He gonna hear this.</v>

89
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.643
<v 0>No, he's got this.</v>

90
00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.950
<v 3>Hold that back.</v>

91
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.220
<v 0>Development of the mine.</v>

92
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.700
<v 1>So you know, you know the better than me, right? Oh yeah. I certainly do.</v>

93
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.900
This is your bread and butter.

94
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.740
<v 0>This is well Chu town.</v>

95
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.620
This is something I've been doing more than I've been doing anything in my whole

96
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:16.060
life. Not hurt. This.

97
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.460
<v 4>Is the first real exercise towards that goal.</v>

98
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.770
<v 3>&lt;Laugh&gt; you gotta, you gotta see this.</v>

99
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.010
It's so stupid. So he's.

100
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.610
<v 1>He's the goat stuff and.</v>

101
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.610
<v 0>The minister goat. Oh, he's just gonna punch a watermelon, right? Oh,</v>

102
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:32.250
you're crazy bro. Solid watermelon. Oh, it's solid. Oh,

103
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.010
no way that impenetrable. That's basically a brick wall. His fingers.

104
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.930
He's gonna use his fingers. One, two.

105
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.510
Oh, I broke his hand. Son. You broke your hand kid.

106
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.750
<v 1>He's the first guy who told me about the dim Mac. The death.</v>

107
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.790
<v 0>Touch. Oh, he went right through that watermelon bro.</v>

108
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.390
I would let that guy do that to me. I'd be like, okay, the watermelon dude.

109
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.560
Let me tighten up my stomach. Oh yeah. I.

110
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.920
<v 1>I've seen these. Oh, I've seen this stuff. This is yeah.</v>

111
00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:02.720
This is guy doing military stuff. Right? This is, this is deep.

112
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.360
This is minister's goat. Not.

113
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.200
<v 0>Really military, but he's wearing a military outfit. Oh really? He.</v>

114
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.920
<v 1>I, I do know that guy like went to Fort Bragg and did the goat stuff.</v>

115
00:06:13.921 --> 00:06:15.640
Like he showed me documentation.

116
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.230
<v 0>See this right here. Listen, man, I used to do this. Look at this so stupid.</v>

117
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.910
Okay. He picked his leg up when he's doing it. Oh, this is hilarious.

118
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.550
This guy's gonna do it. His fingertips. Hi. I hand right through.

119
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.030
Here's the thing. When I was a kid like real young, we used to do these,

120
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.740
uh, demonstrations when I was like 15. Right.

121
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.940
When we would open up a new school, we'd do these demonstrations.

122
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.740
And it was the only time we ever broke boards. Right. We never.

123
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.340
<v 1>Broke. It's really easy to do.</v>

124
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.380
It looks harder than little bit like walking on hot colds. Right?

125
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.940
<v 0>It's it's way easier than walking on hot colds. Right? Because those things,</v>

126
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.130
first of all, the way they're cut is with the, like the grain, uh,

127
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.170
it's going, uh, in a, in a manner. How what's the way we describe it.

128
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.490
So like if you're holding something up, um,

129
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.330
the grain is actually going in the way that you want it to break.

130
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:11.290
So you're breaking it with the grain you literally can do with your fingers.

131
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.890
Like I could, you could take, and those are thin pieces of wood too.

132
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.880
You could take this piece of, if this would, if this pad was a wood,

133
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.400
you would just go like this with two fingers and just go snap. It would break.

134
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.553
Right. Break's like nothing.

135
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.360
I was 15 and we would do these karate kicks and punches and stuff and they'd

136
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.840
they always broke. Huh? They always broke. So what.

137
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.560
<v 1>Is, it's so easy to break. So here's a question.</v>

138
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.320
And what does it say about like special forces at Fort brag that

139
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:38.480
they would bring guy in to?

140
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.430
<v 0>They.</v>

141
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.550
<v 1>Brought that guy in. Well, I mean, it wasn't like, I don't,</v>

142
00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:44.030
I don't believe it was like an like sanction from the very top,

143
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.950
but he certainly went to Fort Bragg and, and stared at goats.

144
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.910
He stared at goats at Fort Bragg. Well.

145
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.190
<v 0>They probably just grabbed whatever dumies they could find like it gets on</v>

146
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:57.270
dudes, wanna stare at a goat. Like there's a lot of people though.

147
00:07:57.271 --> 00:08:00.180
Here's one thing that is a fact. There's a lot of people,

148
00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:01.740
particularly in the eighties,

149
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.780
in the nineties before the ultimate fighting championship came around,

150
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.700
there was a lot of fake martial arts out there. A lot.

151
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.180
I know people that were teaching fake martial arts that got into the military

152
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.340
that got into the police.

153
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.210
I knew the guy who was deep in the police force and he had fake martial arts.

154
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:23.570
Like his martial arts were completely useless. Hmm.

155
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.770
<v 1>And it tallies with the like us military credo of like thinking out of</v>

156
00:08:28.771 --> 00:08:31.690
the box, like if we don't try this stuff, nobody else will try this thing.

157
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.170
<v 0>What is going on here?</v>

158
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.570
They're blur the easy it is to break that his special forces special, special,

159
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.610
special ops.

160
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.960
<v 1>Okay. So yeah, they, you go and they were killing goats.</v>

161
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.320
<v 0>Ow. I've even heard of that one.</v>

162
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.040
<v 1>That's guy's thing, but you know,</v>

163
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:50.360
then general stub by general stub,

164
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.600
by who I'm sure would've been a fan of this show. Cause he was,

165
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:56.880
he was a big fan of Alex's and so on. So he was like head of army intelligence.

166
00:08:56.881 --> 00:09:00.800
He had 16,000 soldiers under his command and he like totally believed in all of

167
00:09:00.801 --> 00:09:03.480
this stuff. He believed in that stuff, that, what that guy was doing,

168
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.320
he general Stubbe would when he was head of army intelligence

169
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.000
in Arlington would try and walk through his wall.

170
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.830
&lt;laugh&gt; uh, he told me one time, he said,

171
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:21.550
like he said, what is the ATO mostly made up of space?

172
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.950
What is the wall mostly made up of atoms? I mean, to me the key word,

173
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.110
this is is mostly, mostly right. Mostly a big part of that, bro.

174
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.070
So he would like stand up from behind his desk and like, you know,

175
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:37.620
basically run into it. You should've asked him what's an Adam bomb made up,

176
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.940
you idiot. &lt;laugh&gt; he sent it. Let me show you a video. He sent even.
