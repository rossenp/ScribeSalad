00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.041
<v 2>Well,</v>

3
00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:05.920
this is what's going on right now where a bunch of fighters are upset because

4
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.560
Logan Paul and Floyd Mayweather just fought. And Logan,

5
00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:12.680
Paul made 20 million bucks and Floyd Mayweather made a hundred million bucks.

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.000
And they're looking at this like, Hey, what about me? Like,

7
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:17.560
how come I'm not making that kind of money?

8
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.310
And I think what they have to understand is whether you like it or not.

9
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.790
Even if you are an elite, the elite of the elite, a Camaro Usman or, uh,

10
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.510
you know, pick any style bender, some of the best fighters in the UFC,

11
00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:32.390
even the elite of the elite,

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.310
the money comes from people wanting to buy your paper view. It's real simple.

13
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.590
Yeah, it shouldn't maybe, you know, maybe in a, in a perfect world,

14
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:43.060
it's this most skillful fighter gets the most amount of money,

15
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.980
but that's not how it works here. In, in, in the world of combat sports,

16
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.500
professional prize fighting, it's all about how many eyes are gonna watch you.

17
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.020
And that Logan, Paul kid has a lot of eyes on him.

18
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.660
He's had a YouTube channel since he was 14 years old. He's been on Disney shows.

19
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.450
He's this controversial, larger than life. You know, internet,

20
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.410
celebrity and people are willing to pay a lot of money to see if he can box with

21
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.450
literally one of the greatest fighters that's ever lived in Floyd Mayweather.

22
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.730
Hey.

23
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.250
<v 1>Look, I'm not mad at it. I'm not mad at it either. Yeah. And you know what?</v>

24
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.610
The best fighters in some of the best fighters to ever fight Lennox, Lewis,

25
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.933
Andre ward,

26
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.400
these guys that I have had the honor of representing ne you never hear out of

27
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:29.040
these elites, that they're. &lt;laugh&gt; I could for them,

28
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.160
because I think that they get on a fundamental level that as human beings, we,

29
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:38.920
unfortunately, we're hardwired to watch the train wreck.

30
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.680
We wanna see carnage.

31
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.513
<v 0>Um, but we wanna see.</v>

32
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.710
<v 1>A freak show and we want, and we want it is a freak show. That was a freak show.</v>

33
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.550
It's a circus.

34
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.390
<v 0>It's I was looking forward to it. I really was.</v>

35
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.230
I was so excited before the bell rang for the first round. It's.

36
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.590
<v 1>Like going to the circus almost.</v>

37
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.910
<v 0>It's like a dude wrestle to bear. I mean.</v>

38
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
<v 1>Like Kenny wrestle a bear. If you never reminded me of it reminded me of when,</v>

39
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.230
uh, Rocky fought whole Hogan in one of the Rocky movies.

40
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.700
<v 0>Well, the thing, the difference though, is that Floyd, first of all,</v>

41
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.140
you gotta give credit to Floyd Mayweather for doing that because it's so crazy

42
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.260
to fight a guy 35 pounds heavier than you that's so big. It looked like.

43
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.780
<v 1>He, he looked like he was fighting a giant. Yeah. It was like, and,</v>

44
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.820
and to watch him look, I, people have a lot of opinions about Floyd Mayweather,

45
00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:23.890
what he does, how he spends his money. Listen,

46
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.570
the guy's brilliant in a lot of ways,

47
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.370
he's tapped into something that human beings want. Yeah. And wanna see.

48
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.290
But I was watching him in the fight.

49
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.690
The guy outweighs him by 40 pounds and he's walking to him. Yep.

50
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:39.370
Walking right to him with his, his hands up, hands up. Yeah. Crazy. I was like,

51
00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:44.320
listen, he is, he is a badass. And listen, the guy, the guy, Logan, Paul, all,

52
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.120
he's got balls to get in there and to do that.

53
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.800
How could you ever be mad at that? I mean,

54
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.520
you could take a step back and be like, oh God, what does society come to?

55
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.200
And right. I mean, it's come to watching the freak show.

56
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.680
<v 0>Yeah, &lt;laugh&gt; right. It's come to watching the freak show.</v>

57
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.840
And maybe not just that,

58
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.200
because there was some professional fights on the under car,

59
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:06.920
but no one's talking about those. You know, it's just the,

60
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.360
the big fight was the freak show fight. And.

61
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.760
<v 1>You wanna know what? I think that this is gonna continue until somebody,</v>

62
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.070
somebody shuts these kids up and like people wanna see now day one.

63
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.190
I think it's the same sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.

64
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.550
That Mayweather sort of tapped into mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it's like,

65
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.190
I realize the more I run my mouth,

66
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.430
the more I make people have end emotion towards me. Yeah. Love or hate,

67
00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:35.070
mostly hate. Right? Mostly they're gonna be at me.

68
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.950
They now they wanna tune in to see me lose.

69
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.940
And that's just as valuable if not more valuable than wanting to tune.

70
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.020
So I think that on a, on a, um,

71
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.700
he gets human behavior and human thinking more than he gets credit for.

72
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.780
Um, I don't, you know,

73
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.620
I'm not here to weigh in on his life or his lifestyle because I'm who am I,

74
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.940
I'm just another human being.

75
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.770
But I think that same thing is happening with these two people wanna see them

76
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.610
lose now and they realize how there's currency in that. Right? Yeah.

77
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.770
<v 0>No, there's a lot of currency in that. It's super valuable.</v>

78
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.330
People wanna see 'em get up. And you know,

79
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.930
we were at the UFC recently and Jake,

80
00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:20.280
Paul was in the audience and the whole audience was chanting. Jake. Oh,

81
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.720
Jake Paul. And he was laughing and holding his camera up and filming it and.

82
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.320
<v 1>And DC got in his face. Yeah. Which I love to see. That was so cool.</v>

83
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.280
But it was like, then the story became Cormier,

84
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.520
confronts Paul and aunt look, there's part of me that is like,

85
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.950
you spend your life racking, your brain. How do I make it in this world?

86
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.670
How am I gonna support my family? What am I gonna do to make a difference?

87
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.990
So there's a part of it that I get where people are like, and these two kids,

88
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.910
what did they do? What, how did they get famous? I don't know. They people.

89
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.910
<v 0>Off. Yeah. But they got famous first. This is what's interesting.</v>

90
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.420
They got famous first. And then they, it turns out they can fight.

91
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.500
Especially Jake, that kid can knock people the out. He knows how to punch.

92
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.513
Can he knock.

93
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.300
<v 1>Fighters out though? Well, we don't know.</v>

94
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.580
<v 0>I mean, we, we saw ASIN, right? But ASIN, first of all,</v>

95
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:16.460
coming off of a hip replacement surgery, he was say, it's a brilliant move.

96
00:05:16.461 --> 00:05:20.900
Right? You get a guy who's arguably the worst striker in elite MMA,

97
00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:23.730
which has been a, and that's no disrespect to Ben Haskin.

98
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:26.330
He probably admit to that phenomen, wrestl wrestler, right? Wrestl,

99
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.330
phenomenal wrestler, like elite wrestler, great guy. Not a good striker.

100
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.010
You make him box. It's like the worst thing that he does. And then Jake,

101
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:38.730
Paul starches him with one punch, but he looked, you know,

102
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:41.010
you looked at his body, he looked severely outta shape,

103
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:43.320
looked like he hadn't trained for a long time.

104
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:45.720
And then kind of got it in good enough shape. So he could compete.

105
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:49.000
The guy knows how to fight and knows how to win. But that's not his sport.

106
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.520
It's not his sport at all. He just took good paycheck. You know, I'd.

107
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.920
<v 1>Like to see this guy, Jake, Paul fight someone.</v>

108
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.040
<v 0>Who who's gonna fight Tyron Woodley.</v>

109
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.680
<v 1>Well, after he fight, can Tyrone wood like fight?</v>

110
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.240
<v 0>Can he box? I, well, I know he can punch. He punches really hard,</v>

111
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.920
but he doesn't punch like a boxer.

112
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.040
He throws big bombs and sets up takedowns and you know,

113
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:13.440
he can crack though with one shot, he can anybody up.

114
00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:16.440
But the thing is like the way he throws shots, he'll throw,

115
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.030
throw like a bomb and then set up a take down or set up a clinch.

116
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.310
He's not a guy who's like going out there with peekaboo style,

117
00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:25.910
throwing jabs and hooks to the body. That's not his style.

118
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.190
He's never been a guy who boxed.

119
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.270
He's been a guy who uses boxing in MMA, but he uses everything. Does.

120
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.070
<v 1>Jake Paul beat him? You think, oh.</v>

121
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.500
<v 0>We won't know until they get in there.</v>

122
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.220
The thing about it is he'll be the most dangerous guy that Jake's fought for

123
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.780
sure. Now if Jake, Paul not even close,

124
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.660
not even close and no one more dangerous than Ty was.

125
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.380
<v 1>Right. Well, if he, he beats an MMA fighter because there.</v>

126
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.980
<v 0>Tyron's not just an MMA fighter. Tyron is a multi,</v>

127
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.860
he's a UFC world champion. And one of the best we weights of all time,

128
00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.170
if you looked at all the UFC, we weights of all time, he's he's top three.

129
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.930
He's he's phenomenal, I.

130
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.051
<v 1>Think.</v>

131
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:07.530
But there is something fundamentally different about MMA fighters fighting a

132
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.890
boxer.

133
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.890
<v 0>Yeah. Because it's, there's other stuff that you incorporate into your movement,</v>

134
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.330
right? You're worried about leg kicks. You worried about take down defense.

135
00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:16.530
You're worried about all these different things.

136
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.400
So you have all these different variables on your plate.

137
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.320
Now you remove all those VA variables.

138
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.600
You give tire in a pair of shoes and you just let him punch. I, you know,

139
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:30.200
he punches really hard. And when he doesn't have to worry about wrestling,

140
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:33.880
doesn't have to worry about getting his tired and he can and pick his shots.

141
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.110
He'll be the most dangerous guy that Jake Paul's ever fought for sure. But, um,

142
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.030
it doesn't necessarily mean that he wins. And I think Jake, Paul can box.

143
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.950
If you look at that, Nate Robinson fight.

144
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.070
I know Nate Robinson didn't know what he was doing, but the way he landed,

145
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:52.390
those punches, he move, he cracked him and knocked him out, moving backwards.

146
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.750
He can, he can move backwards and then plant. So he is not,

147
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:58.230
he doesn't have like big wind up movements.

148
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.540
Like his brother has more wind up shots.

149
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.220
His brother was throwing more windmill type arm punches.

150
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.940
Jake throws things straight and hard. They're dangerous, much more dangerous.

151
00:08:08.941 --> 00:08:09.300
Here's.

152
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:09.800
<v 1>Why I, I,</v>

153
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.420
here's why I have more respect for the older brother for what he just did.

154
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.540
Yes. He outweighed by 40 pounds.

155
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.370
But he got in there with perhaps the best fighter to ever get in a ring.

156
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.730
I'd love to see how Jake Paul fares against someone similar in size.

157
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.290
That is a boxer. Yeah.

158
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.850
<v 0>Well, you know what, man, he's only got a couple of fights.</v>

159
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.130
Here's how you have to look at him.

160
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.570
Look at him like any other guy who only has a couple of fights.

161
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.530
If you saw a guy who was coming up and he didn't have an amateur career and he's

162
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:42.800
only had a couple fights, he'd go, man. It's got some promise. Yeah, no.

163
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.000
<v 1>But these guys aren't in it for the they're.</v>

164
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.960
Are they in it for the long haul to become boxers?

165
00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:50.440
They're because he is they're in it to become spectacles.

166
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.840
<v 0>But imagine if this guy gets all the way up to a world, title, fight. Imagine,</v>

167
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.200
imagine if he actually works his way through some professional boxers,

168
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:00.840
that would be remarkable. Wouldn't it? It wouldn't just be remarkable.

169
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.400
The money he'll be able to earn. Well, how about.

170
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.280
<v 1>Fighting a recently retire? You know who am mom right now.</v>

171
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.600
<v 0>Who'd him. I right now. And are you saying Andre? And.</v>

172
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.680
<v 1>Even because he can't fight,</v>

173
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.310
Andre can't fight professionally anymore because he's had some physical

174
00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:20.230
problems, but Andre's still in shape. He's recently retired.

175
00:09:20.231 --> 00:09:21.064
Maybe he'll.

176
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.590
<v 0>Get mad. Are you trying to set something up? &lt;laugh&gt; look at you looking away.</v>

177
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.390
You like the worst poker player ever. He's like, well maybe. Well.

178
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.830
<v 1>I just know, I know, I know. Look that's my brother. I mean,</v>

179
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.870
I know that he's like.

180
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:36.893
<v 0>Has he thought about it?</v>

181
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.300
<v 1>He's he's thought about it. He's thought about it.</v>

182
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.500
He he's thought about it and be like, we've talked about it.
