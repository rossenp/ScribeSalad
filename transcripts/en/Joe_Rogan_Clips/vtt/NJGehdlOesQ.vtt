WEBVTT

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And now we're just talking about it before,</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.430
like there's all these articles now about how doctors are saying that the people

3
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:12.300
coming to them are less sick than they ever were before because Alexa came in in

4
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:13.770
England or in, um, Italy,

5
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:16.650
rather they're saying there's such a small amount of virus.

6
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:19.590
It's almost undetectable. It's run through the country. Yeah.

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.120
<v 1>It's hot. Yeah. You think that's all it was. So Trump was right.</v>

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.970
<v 2>Um, said it was going to go away without any cure.</v>

9
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.620
<v 0>And then it did. It would, but it would have killed more people. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.330
I don't know how many more people though.

11
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.720
I don't know if there could have been a better strategy. I don't know, dude.

12
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:39.720
The problem is we're Monday, Monday morning. Quarterbacking. Yeah. Yeah. It's.

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.930
<v 1>Like, after the fact we're going, oh, this is what we should have done.</v>

14
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:45.230
And none of us wrote down. Yeah. I didn't think we were going to die,

15
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:49.130
but like I thought it could have gotten kind of bad a little bit.

16
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:51.110
I made a few phone calls of friends. I was like, you know,

17
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:54.260
go stock your fridges. We might be in the crib for a little bit. But Jonathan.

18
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.920
<v 0>Had helped me. It was interesting elbow. Why would he say? Cause he got it and.</v>

19
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.800
<v 3>He was fine. Yeah. I was like, what can I dress? Yeah. Do think they really got.</v>

20
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.550
<v 1>It? Yes. I do think it's weird that like the second it pops off,</v>

21
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.600
Tom Hanks is like, I got it.

22
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.210
<v 0>Well the whole crew got it. A lot of people are hospitalized.</v>

23
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.930
It was in Australia. It was a breakout in that area. Yeah. This is what.

24
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.180
<v 1>I would do if I want people to be afraid. Right. I'd be like,</v>

25
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:17.960
who's the most famous guy. He got it. Oh, you're going deep conspiracy. I'm.

26
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.010
<v 2>Just saying wouldn't you do the name of smoked any weed yet? Are we maybe.</v>

27
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.410
<v 1>At the end? But once I smoke it's over.</v>

28
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.900
<v 2>You know, itches, fall apart. I'll like start doing like,</v>

29
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.400
I'll start.

30
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.490
<v 1>Like doing like beatboxing maybe it just gets really bad. Yeah. It's.</v>

31
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.630
<v 0>Horrible. If we wanted to point to a conspiracy that you,</v>

32
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.400
I would say you would kill Tom Hanks.

33
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.050
I wouldn't say you let him walk away free because he gets it and he

34
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.920
kicks his them. We're tearing out that big. Yeah. I'm not scared of Tom Hanson.

35
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.920
Kick it. Yeah. Tom asking. Kicking. I can kick it for sure. Yeah.

36
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.980
<v 1>Yeah. That's true. Yeah. It was interesting. Like it was like, uh,</v>

37
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.660
only famous people got in initially.

38
00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.173
<v 2>It was.</v>

39
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.700
<v 1>Yeah. But it was like blue check.</v>

40
00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:04.190
That's what we were calling it because like I remember,

41
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.920
I didn't know a single regular person that had it,

42
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.970
but all these athletes had it. Every basketball team, a few people had it,

43
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.320
all these actors had it. Yeah. It was just like, how the are they getting it?

44
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.680
See.

45
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.990
<v 0>That the act, the athlete thing was like, okay,</v>

46
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:22.130
well these are super athletes and they don't have any, any form of what it was.

47
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.690
They were flying in bro.

48
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.900
<v 3>You know what? It was here. You come on. Dare.</v>

49
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.410
<v 0>You. Come on, dude. I feel like it was just using the wrong fountain.</v>

50
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.283
Those days are done.

51
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.160
<v 2>We can all use any fountain now. Okay. Cut the clip. Send it to CNN.</v>

52
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.850
[inaudible] we found out about eclipse.

53
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.250
<v 0>That we're going to give CNN this episode alone.</v>

54
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.980
55, 0, 0 problem. Let's talk about them. Let's talk about them.

55
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.010
I feel like the athlete thing was like, okay,

56
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.880
they're super athletes and they don't have any symptoms. Right.

57
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.950
But we're not super athletes. Okay. Yeah.

58
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.760
But then Idris Elba is just a really good shape in shape actor. Well,

59
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.250
he seems okay with Tom Hanks is an older gentleman who doesn't live.

60
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.590
He's in great shape. And he got through it. What is, you know,

61
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:17.830
and then you find out the flu numbers and they bite. It's not the flu. Okay.

62
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.010
Okay. It's not the flu. Okay. It's not the flu. Yeah. No.

63
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.630
Science is new religion, bro. Well, think about, is, think about it though. No,

64
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.860
but it's money. Money. I really believe this. I really believe same.

65
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.611
<v 1>With the Monday morning,</v>

66
00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:33.990
but like quarterback and think about like the way religion operated in the past,

67
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:37.050
right? The second you said anything against the church, they shame you.

68
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:40.290
They ostracize you. Who the are you? How could you say these things?

69
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:43.530
They put you in your little box so that you get ex-communicated any of us were

70
00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:47.040
like, you sure it really kills everyone, right? Like, are you sure?

71
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.530
Are you sure? It's that contingency?

72
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.570
<v 2>What the is Fowchee? Come out of the Keebler elf house,</v>

73
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.460
tell them what's going on. They just rail at you nonstop. And the second.

74
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.550
<v 1>And the second you say a single thing you are, what did they label you?</v>

75
00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:02.970
As I think Amazon even like took out a book heretic, right?

76
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.490
<v 0>Wasn't it, is that what determines? I think.</v>

77
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.640
<v 1>You were a blasphemy or something. One of these things. Right?</v>

78
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.660
And then all of a sudden this information starts to come out where it's like,

79
00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:15.270
okay, it's not that bad. The curve is kind of flattening.

80
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.290
Now the comes out today. That was, it basically said, if you're asymptomatic,

81
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.300
you can't transfer it as easily.

82
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.800
<v 0>As they thought it's almost right.</v>

83
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:25.620
So all that worry that we were about kids giving it to the grandmothers.

84
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.550
They're not gonna to. That was the.

85
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.560
<v 1>Only reason why stores are shut down.</v>

86
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.450
The only reason why comedy clubs shut down restaurants.

87
00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:33.030
Because if you're asymptomatic, you pass on. Now we know you're not.

88
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:35.370
If you have a cough, if you're sneezing, if you've got the flu, stay the.

89
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.550
<v 0>Home. That's it. Crank it open. Let's go crank it open. Yeah.</v>

90
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.743
Same all you have to wait mass.

91
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.120
No New Jersey just said they want another a month for.

92
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.800
<v 2>So this is where we get into like the more my moon. But you don't.</v>

93
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.540
<v 1>Think this is just people trying to get reelected.</v>

94
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.520
<v 0>Um, it could be,</v>

95
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.370
but it could be people who are scared of people dying on their watch.

96
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.210
<v 1>Now it's not the economy that gets reelected. It's people dying on your.</v>

97
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.340
<v 0>Watch. Well, if someone comes along and says,</v>

98
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:02.850
the reason why X amount of people died, it could have been much less.

99
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.290
If you had just done the right thing and kept those people safe and kept

100
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:11.850
everything closed for another month. Right? So I think it's that.

101
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.760
It's also a lot of these people are not healthy people, right?

102
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:17.700
I know a lot of really intelligent people that are not healthy and they're

103
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:20.610
terrified of this virus. And I would try to tell them, well, Hey,

104
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:24.440
let's look at the actual statistics, the actual statistics, sorry.

105
00:05:24.441 --> 00:05:26.610
It doesn't seem like it's fun to catch. Right?

106
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.440
But as long as you have a good level of nutrients in your body, you have, uh,

107
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.270
adequate sufficient levels of vitamin D zinc. You take care of yourself,

108
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.810
get in the sauna, drink a lot of water. Don't get up every night,

109
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.200
don't eat sugar all day. Like you're probably going to be okay.

110
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.530
And maybe what's devastating even more.

111
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:49.140
So is how many suicides we, we had,

112
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.680
how many people died because because of the depression.

113
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.090
<v 1>Did you hear that stat?</v>

114
00:05:54.091 --> 00:05:58.340
That like Corona actually saved lives because weren't driving so they didn't get

115
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:02.570
in car accidents. Oh, that's true. In a weird way, way less people.

116
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.960
<v 0>It's saved. Car accident, deaths, car accident, deaths. What else was there?</v>

117
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.340
I mean, there was a lot more domestic violence, but a lot more child abuse too.

118
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.460
Really? Yeah. A lot of child abuse, a lot of domestic violence.

119
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.180
And then what's really scary is the suicides because people who are already

120
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:20.540
barely hanging on, but might've pulled through. If they had a good job,

121
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.771
had a way to make a living.

122
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:25.940
Now they're broke and they have to beg for money and they get one $1,200 check.

123
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.040
<v 1>If they, it, everybody, I know that's a comic is making more money.</v>

124
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.890
How all these comics that were like, they're barely,

125
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.200
they were like middling on the road or they were barely doing it.

126
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.970
They get the $1,200 STEMI check. They get furloughed from their job.

127
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.420
So I think you get like 600 bucks or something a month when you're a week or

128
00:06:43.421 --> 00:06:45.700
something. When you're furloughed, they're making like a grand a week.

129
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.270
Like everybody had money, dude. This is the crazy about everything.

130
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.880
The stock market has him Majed.

131
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.980
<v 2>Well, that's how, you know, the stock market's fake.</v>

132
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.150
<v 1>Or this is fake. They price out everything. Joe.</v>

133
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.930
They price out every, the super bowl. They price it out. They price out the,

134
00:07:01.931 --> 00:07:04.360
what is it? The other thing we were just in the pandemic, they price out. Right.

135
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.270
And it dipped down the protest right now. They priced out.

136
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.040
They priced out the protest. There was MIT mathematicians. Really? I think.

137
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.620
<v 2>Call Blix Friedman. Let's get to the bottom. It is.</v>
