00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.650
If anybody sounded the alarm that all this madness was going to

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.970
come to fruition in the real world, it's user, you were,

4
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:14.220
you were the guy like you were the one who was saying,

5
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:18.360
this is what's happening at evergreen. And if you don't know, go Google it,

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.280
Bret Weinstein, evergreen. And now it spills out into the real.

7
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.560
<v 1>Just like I said, it was gonna, you did, I did.</v>

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.760
I said it and I said it in several different places and, uh, pretty clearly,

9
00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:34.040
you know, it could have been a tiny bit more precision,

10
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:35.270
but it was highly accurate.

11
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.770
<v 0>Highly accurate. And uh, often maligned and mocked. Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.100
People didn't think it was a big deal. They think you're much ado about nothing.

13
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.910
You making a big deal about some kids that are voicing their opinions on things.

14
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:51.530
But what you recognized early on was that there was an authoritarian

15
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:55.820
aspect of it, a forced compliance aspect of it. That's very dangerous.

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.510
<v 1>Yeah. It's all about force. And, um, you know,</v>

17
00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:04.280
I've started to get calls in the last week or two, the people who,

18
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.310
um, who mocked me and others,

19
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:11.810
including you for making too much of what appeared to be college kids going wild

20
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:16.520
on college campuses. Some of them have started to call and say, I got it wrong.

21
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:20.840
What do we do now? And actually, I, I appreciate those,

22
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.340
those calls and those contacts,

23
00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:26.240
because really that is the question because you want to do now to pull it back.

24
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.860
Yeah. The genie back.

25
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.320
<v 0>In the bottle, or as Douglas Murray says, how do you put the brakes on this?</v>

26
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.840
<v 1>How do you put the brakes on this thing indeed? Well,</v>

27
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:35.210
I have to tell you I'm not optimistic. Um,

28
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.930
I think that this is actually the people who are catching up to the fact that

29
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.410
evergreen has now spilled over into the world, um,

30
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.100
have not caught up to the fact that this is, um,

31
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.900
an unstoppable at this point with the current configuration,

32
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.160
the absence of leadership is going to prevent us from doing what we should do.

33
00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.560
And that means that the next set of predictions are far more

34
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.650
dire. One is your next set of predictions. Well,

35
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.810
I would say we are headed for a collision course

36
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.260
with, with history. I mean,

37
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:16.970
we're really staring at many scenarios that end in some kind of civil

38
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:17.804
war.

39
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.850
And while I do think it is still possible to avert that outcome,

40
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.210
I don't know the name of the force that gets in its way.

41
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.850
That's really troubled.

42
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.830
<v 0>What do you think these kids want? Not just kids. What do you,</v>

43
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:38.660
what do you think the people that are facilitating chaos,

44
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.430
what do you think they want? Well, I think.

45
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.240
<v 1>There's some danger in casting them as one thing,</v>

46
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:48.980
because I think we have several things fuse together and that until you

47
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:52.370
understand what has joined forces with what you're not gonna,

48
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.430
there's no way to answer the question. All right, let's break it down. Okay.

49
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:58.310
So one thing that we're seeing is,

50
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.350
and we really to take this back a number of years to understand why it happened,

51
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.470
but we are seeing occupy 2.0.

52
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.920
Now I participated in occupy.

53
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.710
Originally occupied made a lot of sense.

54
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.850
It was a complaint about the tarp program and too big to fail on the fact that

55
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:20.320
the American public was not protected when those who had created the financial

56
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.220
collapse were, and that was a legitimate, uh, gripe.

57
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:27.100
And it was also a legitimate gripe at the beginning of the tea party movement

58
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.330
occupied then morphed into a,

59
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.980
an anarchistic movement that was just simply hostile to civilization and it

60
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:39.010
became absurd. And so when I say this is occupied 2.0,

61
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.510
this is the anarchist version of occupy that has now re-emerged.

62
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.370
And it has fused with black lives matter, which as I've said,

63
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.310
lots of different places, if black lives matter,

64
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.690
just simply meant with those words imply I'd be on board with it. Um,

65
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.210
it doesn't, it means a great deal more than that.

66
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:01.240
And we're beginning to see that in the last couple of weeks.

67
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.520
So you think it means, well, let's put it this way. For some reason it means,

68
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.560
uh, abolish the police,

69
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.720
which is possibly the stupidest proposal I have ever heard.

70
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.020
And it's not like we haven't seen what happens when you do that.

71
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.270
<v 0>Don't you think that that's a,</v>

72
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:23.130
just a fearful response to the obvious police brutality that we saw in

73
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:23.701
Minneapolis.

74
00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:26.700
What's the best response we've got to do something we need to defund the police

75
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.080
and then everyone's like, good job. Great, great first step at least. Well,

76
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.370
no.

77
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.970
<v 1>It's a dishonest presentation. And I'm concerned that there is,</v>

78
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.100
as I've also said in many places,

79
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.830
the proposals that are coming out of this movement are quite foolish.

80
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.410
The strategy is incredibly smart.

81
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.240
And so that is confusing to people because when you hear folks in the street

82
00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:53.370
demanding that we abolish the police, you think, well, okay,

83
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:56.940
that's never going to happen. If it even started to happen,

84
00:04:56.941 --> 00:05:00.720
it would be so complex to make it happen that it can't possibly be.

85
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:04.080
They just need to blow off some steam. Nope, that's not right.

86
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.700
The fact is the police in some places can effectively be halted in their tracks.

87
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:09.360
And really,

88
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.620
if there's one most important lesson out of the whole evergreen fiasco,

89
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.230
it's that the police can be withdrawn from a situation.

90
00:05:16.231 --> 00:05:18.600
And chaos takes a matter of hours to emerge,

91
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.100
which we are also seeing in Seattle.

92
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.750
<v 0>Yeah. Um, the defunding of the police,</v>

93
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.610
which is happening in Minneapolis,

94
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.210
what are they doing in replacement of the police?

95
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.950
<v 1>Well, I don't know.</v>

96
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.450
And I will say that the thing that is trotted out as the example that tells us

97
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:39.840
that defund the police, which doesn't really mean defund the police.

98
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:40.920
It means abolish the police.

99
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.880
We are told that that's safe on the basis of something like the Camden example.

100
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.710
<v 0>Well, Camden just, they, they, they sort of broke the police down,</v>

101
00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:51.630
but then built up a new version of the place.

102
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.810
<v 1>Yeah. They shifted it to a different jurisdiction. And look,</v>

103
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.640
I'm not arguing that we don't need massive police reform. And frankly,

104
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.660
I'd be up for a discussion of a total rethink of the way we do policing.

105
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:07.600
But the idea that you could withdraw the police first is

106
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.400
absolutely insane.

107
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.460
<v 0>Marc Lamont hill had a, uh,</v>

108
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.960
a very good point about the guy who was killed. What,

109
00:06:15.961 --> 00:06:19.840
what is the gentleman's name that was killed in the drive in the drive through a

110
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.830
fast food place? Rashard so they say his name,

111
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.120
um,

112
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.070
who was just drunk and compliant and peaceful until

113
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.060
they were telling him they were gonna arrest him, even said, get me an Uber.

114
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.700
And what his point was is a very good point.

115
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.620
Why were the police even called for that?

116
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.400
This is a nonviolent person who just happened to be drunk.

117
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.770
Was he doing something he shouldn't have been doing? Yes,

118
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.560
but obviously compliant,

119
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.990
polite speaking legit,

120
00:06:49.991 --> 00:06:54.280
like very reasonably until it escalated into this tussle.

121
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.930
And then he lost his life.

122
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.940
If they had just had some sort of a program where they could,

123
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.320
we're going to park your car, sir,

124
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.420
or we'll have someone drive your car to your house,

125
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.480
we're going to call you an Uber, or we're going to take you home.

126
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.320
And we're going to just write you a ticket and work this out in court.

127
00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:14.020
You're not going to go to jail. You don't have to be arrested.

128
00:07:14.021 --> 00:07:16.480
You don't have to be handcuffed. You're going to be treated like a monster.

129
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.850
You up, you made a mistake, but you're not a bad person.

130
00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:20.740
You're not as a person who's trying to hurt people.

131
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.450
The police should be there for robbers, murderers,

132
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.440
rapists. That's, that's what we need the police for. And this is another,

133
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.940
none of those things. This is just a guy who up and he got drunk and he,

134
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.590
and then as they were speaking to him, clear, real clear,

135
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.880
not a bad guy, like the way he's talking to the cops, just talking to him,

136
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:45.040
very reasonably, even asked for an Uber.

137
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.010
<v 1>Well, look, I am no fan of this aggressive style of policing.</v>

138
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.220
I'm not a fan of the militarization of the police. I've actually, I mean,

139
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:56.830
I've had run ins with the police. I've been hit twice by cops.

140
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.650
So it's not that I happen. Uh, well,

141
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:02.290
one of these is a long story that goes back to, um,

142
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.520
my first research gig in Jamaica and the other one

143
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.420
was, uh, I was participating in a protest. I mean, I was very young.

144
00:08:10.421 --> 00:08:14.980
I was probably 20. Um, and there was a protest about homelessness in Berkeley.

145
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:18.070
And frankly it happened without my awareness that there was going to be a

146
00:08:18.071 --> 00:08:20.590
protest, but I happened to be nearby and I was sympathetic.

147
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:24.010
And so I joined it and I was coming down the street with the protest and the

148
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:27.940
cop, uh, hit me with the, with a Baton, knocked me down.

149
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.390
So anyway, I I'm no fan of this stuff. I'm not defending it,

150
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.570
but that's not what this movement is really about.

151
00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:38.230
And even if it is to the extent that it is, what this movement is really about,

152
00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:39.820
it doesn't deal with the root cause.

153
00:08:39.821 --> 00:08:43.600
We're dealing with a symptom and it's not a symptom that you can treat in

154
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:44.434
isolation.

155
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.160
<v 0>Well, I had Jocko Willink on the podcast on Monday and he had a great point.</v>

156
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:52.240
Obviously Jocko was a Navy seal commander and worked with, uh,

157
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.710
the Navy seals to create programs training.

158
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.050
And what he said is that these cops have the minimal amount of training.

159
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.660
It's the tiniest amount of training. And then they send them on the street.

160
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.670
He goes, 20% of their time should be spent training 20%.

161
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.510
It should be deescalation drills, simulation drills,

162
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.220
educating them on how to communicate with people in various situations,

163
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.600
educating them as if one cop is in a confrontation with someone.

164
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.900
The next cop should step in and say, let's, let's just calm down, Mike,

165
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.330
why don't you go, go, uh, deal with this over there.

166
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.420
And I'm going to handle this. And, uh, sir, let's, let's, uh,

167
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.570
let's take this from scratch. Like let's work, let's work this out.

168
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.650
And that having higher qualified police officers,

169
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:42.030
better trained police officers more well, better compensated police forces.

170
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:44.940
So they're not taxed out is really the answer to all this.

171
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:49.380
And these people are there. You know, nobody wants to be a cop right now.

172
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.760
So who's doing this right. Who's the new generation from now out.

173
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.570
When, when people sign up to be a police officer, who's going to do this,

174
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.513
this it's,

175
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.110
you have a few that are going to answer their call because they feel like it's

176
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:04.770
a, they have a duty, but you're going to have a lot of people that just,

177
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.590
they can't get other jobs. And so they choose that.

178
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.300
And maybe they're not the cream of the crop,

179
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.900
and that's very bad for people with guns that tell other people what to do.

180
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.790
<v 1>I hear two things in what you're saying. And one of them, I fully agree with,</v>

181
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.180
um,

182
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.690
the implication of what you just said is that less funding isn't the solution.

183
00:10:20.691 --> 00:10:24.020
If anything, more funding is so that we get better qualified people,

184
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.910
better training, train them, right.

185
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.520
We get people who are better suited to the job in the first place.

186
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:32.270
And then we train them better. So they know what to do. And I agree with that.

187
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.450
The part that I'm worried about is that I also,

188
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.960
I think I hear you grasping at straws and frankly, they're familiar.

189
00:10:38.961 --> 00:10:41.540
I hear everybody grasping at straws here.

190
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.790
And what I think is not getting said is that brutal policing is a feature,

191
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.110
not a bug, right? This is part of a system that is about something else.

192
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:56.150
And to the extent that I think we can all recognize that there is something

193
00:10:56.151 --> 00:11:01.010
absolutely organic about the anger that has caused people to spill into the

194
00:11:01.011 --> 00:11:02.510
streets in large numbers,

195
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.070
that anger is the result of a process that does not begin with policing.

196
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.270
It begins with economic phenomenon and political phenomenon.

197
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:16.580
And one of the things that spooks me is this movement in part,

198
00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:19.790
because it is leaderless and I would argue rudderless,

199
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.630
it is not correctly addressing the actual problem.

200
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:28.100
It is lashing out at things that it can see it's lashing out anecdotes,

201
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.650
but the only solution here,

202
00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:35.420
the only proper solution that actually saves the Republic is a solution that

203
00:11:35.421 --> 00:11:36.800
addresses the core problem.

204
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.680
<v 0>Economic despair communities that are filled with crime and violence and gangs,</v>

205
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.880
and the people that come out of these communities with very little hope and all

206
00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:49.470
the models that they operate under the what,

207
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:53.650
what they model themselves on is what they see around them, which is all crime.

208
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.780
And they, they don't have this sense that there's a very clear path out of this.

209
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.630
<v 1>Well, let's, um,</v>

210
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.110
I want to step back to something that will sound too remote to be useful,

211
00:12:04.111 --> 00:12:05.310
but I'm sure it isn't.

212
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.770
I would claim that this actually goes back to a shift in the democratic

213
00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:15.000
party during the Clinton administration, during the Clinton administration,

214
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.570
the democratic party effectively switched.

215
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.660
It took up the Republican party's business model,

216
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.590
moving away from defending the interests of common people,

217
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.330
as it's a reason for gaining power. And that created a problem.

218
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.950
So during the Clinton administration, we saw, uh,

219
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.430
the end to aid with family, uh, to families with dependent children.

220
00:12:38.431 --> 00:12:39.660
We saw NAFTA,

221
00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:44.580
we saw basically an abandonment of the core razon Detra for the

222
00:12:44.581 --> 00:12:45.420
democratic party.

223
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:50.580
Now the Republican party at that point was the party of business,

224
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.040
but that doesn't really mean the party of business,

225
00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:54.300
what the Republican party was,

226
00:12:54.301 --> 00:12:57.600
was the party of well-established large businesses,

227
00:12:57.601 --> 00:13:00.180
which frequently meant as it was catering to their interests,

228
00:13:00.181 --> 00:13:04.860
that it was preventing small businesses from rising up that would threaten its

229
00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:08.010
constituents. Now, the Democrats took up this model,

230
00:13:08.011 --> 00:13:11.490
they went into influence peddling as well during the Clinton administration.

231
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.670
And they became the party of other businesses.

232
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.930
So now you have two parties that are basically dealing with competing business

233
00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:20.460
interests, vying for power.

234
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.510
But what that does is it excludes the interests of regular folks.

235
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.750
And so regular folks have been getting the shaft ever since nobody is

236
00:13:27.751 --> 00:13:30.480
representing their interests, they're getting wise to it.

237
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.420
And they're feeling the effects on the street. They are feeling,

238
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.390
the system is rigged. It's rigged against them.

239
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:40.380
It's not even evenly rigged against them. So, you know, in black communities,

240
00:13:40.381 --> 00:13:43.470
there's a perception it's specifically rigged against us and you know what it

241
00:13:43.471 --> 00:13:46.020
is, but the way it is is very subtle, right?

242
00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:49.620
It's not a matter of racism being ubiquitous, you know,

243
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:52.430
inside every white head. It's not like that.

244
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.840
This has very little to do with modern racism,

245
00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.000
but what it has to do with is a property of our system.

246
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.690
So, you know, um, there's a cybernetic principle.

247
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.150
The purpose of a system is what it does.

248
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.860
It means that don't listen to what somebody says that the system is for.

249
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:13.020
Look at what it accomplishes. That's what it's for.

250
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:18.210
And our system basically has two things that it accomplishes. Um,

251
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:23.100
it basically keeps real change from happening.

252
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.430
And the reason it keeps real change from happening is because people who are

253
00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:29.610
winning in the present system will continue to win.

254
00:14:29.611 --> 00:14:33.240
If the system continues to do what it does and they may lose if the system

255
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.890
changes and starts doing something else.

256
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.180
So it creates what I would argue is a kind of organic

257
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.230
conservatism. Those with power don't want change because it threatens them.

258
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.540
And the other thing that our system does is it reproduces, present,

259
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.310
uh, patterns of distribution into the future.

260
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.380
And what that means is racism that has almost died out is still alive and

261
00:14:57.381 --> 00:14:58.310
well in a sense,

262
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.300
because all you have to do is take people who are born into a neighborhood that

263
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:06.620
is, uh, devoid of opportunity and continue that pattern.

264
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.270
If no opportunity shows up,

265
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.600
then people who were oppressed are now going to continue to be oppressed.

266
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:13.760
And so it feels personal, but it isn't,

267
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.010
it's just reproducing an existing pattern.

268
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.670
<v 0>And a lot of that emanates from these communities that have been</v>

269
00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:26.350
disenfranchised and economically distraught from

270
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.170
slavery, like literally from that,

271
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.950
where we're dealing with the echoes of slavery and it doesn't get addressed.

272
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.160
And when people do bring it up and they start talking about reparations,

273
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.090
people roll their eyes and people go, oh, that was so long ago.

274
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:44.410
But the results of that are still alive today in the south.

275
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.640
They're still alive today in many communities that were redlined as recently as

276
00:15:48.641 --> 00:15:50.290
the 1960s. Right.

277
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.520
<v 1>That's exactly right.</v>

278
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:56.470
And so we basically have set ourselves up for a confused

279
00:15:56.471 --> 00:15:59.350
response because there's a subtlety,

280
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.500
the fact that ancient racism, people who are dead,

281
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.120
their racism still haunts us today through mechanisms of the reproduction of

282
00:16:07.121 --> 00:16:10.360
patterns of distribution and mind you, when people hear distribution,

283
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.910
they freak out because they think you're talking about wealth.

284
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.750
I'm not talking about wealth and we can talk about why I wouldn't bother,

285
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.420
but what we're talking about is opportunity.

286
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.090
Opportunity has been hoarded.

287
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.110
It has been concentrated in some zip codes and almost totally excluded from

288
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:29.140
others at coats. And so you're right.

289
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.620
The patterns of slavery moved into Jim Crow.

290
00:16:32.621 --> 00:16:37.450
And now they've moved into a phase where they are very subtly infused

291
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.130
in into our system.

292
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:44.080
And so it is causing people to have the sense that there is an enemy and it is

293
00:16:44.081 --> 00:16:47.200
out to get me when it's not exactly an enemy that's out to get you.

294
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.620
It's a pattern, right? It's a pattern that definitely needs to be addressed.

295
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.250
And so the natural place would have been the democratic party,

296
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.230
but the democratic party,

297
00:16:56.231 --> 00:17:00.160
because it has taken up with big business is not going to do it,

298
00:17:00.161 --> 00:17:02.680
even though it would be a winning political strategy.

299
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.130
The democratic party is more interested in serving the political,

300
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.110
the economic interests of its actual constituents than it is serving

301
00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:13.060
the interests of its nominal constituents.

302
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.830
And so why are you seeing something that looks, uh,

303
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.510
like a communist revolution beginning in the streets for the natural reason,

304
00:17:22.511 --> 00:17:25.930
which is that people are feeling excluded from, uh,

305
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:28.360
from their share and they are being excluded.

306
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:32.980
But this revolution that is beginning in our streets is no more

307
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:38.200
coherent or desirable than, you know, then Maoism,

308
00:17:38.201 --> 00:17:43.060
and it's going to be brutal in the mouse way or possibly the way

309
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:46.900
that it unfolded in the French revolution. Or maybe it'll be some, you know,

310
00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:48.760
unique version and it'll get its own name.

311
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.270
But if we want the Republic to survive,

312
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.980
we're going to have to prevent this from happening.

313
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.940
And because it's a leaderless movement, who do you even talk to? Who do you.

314
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.540
<v 0>Reasonably? Yeah, that's, what's fascinating about it, right?</v>

315
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.660
Because it's emerging, not just in America,

316
00:18:02.661 --> 00:18:06.290
but it's also in England and it's in all parts of the world.

317
00:18:06.291 --> 00:18:10.400
People are protesting and in many ways I think that's,

318
00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:13.460
it's probably cause love it or hate it.

319
00:18:13.461 --> 00:18:17.690
America sort of takes the cultural lead for the world in a lot of ways, uh,

320
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.430
when it comes to, uh, movements and particularly art and,

321
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.820
and, and, you know, expression.

322
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:30.800
And I see this leaderless movement

323
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.870
and it seems so attractive to young people that do feel disenfranchised by the

324
00:18:35.871 --> 00:18:37.820
system. So I watched them, I mean,

325
00:18:37.821 --> 00:18:41.240
I've seen so many videos of these people out there screaming and cheering and

326
00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:43.940
chanting, and they feel like they're a part of something. Right.

327
00:18:43.941 --> 00:18:46.820
And they are right. But what is that thing that they're a part of? Like,

328
00:18:46.821 --> 00:18:50.540
what's the end goal that doesn't seem to have been really clear.

329
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.110
It's still like there's kids out in, uh, they were out in, um,

330
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.090
Woodland Hills out there chanting no justice,

331
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.120
no peace. And I'm like, okay,

332
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.770
what justice are you talking about? Are you talking about George Floyd? Well,

333
00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:08.210
that in that case,

334
00:19:08.211 --> 00:19:10.730
it seems like that guy is going to go to jail for the rest of his life.

335
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.370
And I don't know if that's justice or not,

336
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.360
that police department has been disbanded. I dunno if that's justice or not,

337
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.870
but what is justice and what is peace? It's just a slogan,

338
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.370
but they feel good saying it, no justice, no peace, but what,

339
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.660
I don't know what you're saying,

340
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.810
but you feel very passionate about what you're saying. And I agree.

341
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.930
I think if you pulled one of those kids aside and said,

342
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.690
what's your message and what are you trying to do?

343
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.840
I think a lot of them would have nothing to say.

344
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.440
And that's why that's very concerning to me.

345
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.040
I'm very concerned about that because it seems like they're very enthusiastic

346
00:19:46.041 --> 00:19:50.300
and passionate about an invisible enemy and an enemy that they can't,

347
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.580
they can't put on a scale.

348
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.270
They can't tangibly describe it in a way that I understand it completely.

349
00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:01.640
It just seems like the structure of things they feel

350
00:20:01.641 --> 00:20:03.470
like is, is unjust.

351
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.260
<v 1>It is unfortunately a zombified collective</v>

352
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:13.730
fighting a boogeyman that they have invented, which again,

353
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.540
doesn't mean that their frustration is not about something very real,

354
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.130
that does require a solution.

355
00:20:19.131 --> 00:20:23.870
But to the extent that these people have D individuated and they've become a

356
00:20:23.871 --> 00:20:28.580
true mob and they are pushing policies that make no sense and in dangerous all,

357
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:33.800
I mean, there is no neighborhood in the U S that is going to be safer for the

358
00:20:33.801 --> 00:20:34.670
absence of the police.

359
00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:37.460
And it really doesn't even matter how corrupt the police are.

360
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.000
The absence of the police is going to create a power vacuum,

361
00:20:41.001 --> 00:20:44.330
and we're going to get warlords as we're already seeing in miniature in Seattle,

362
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.040
as we already saw it, evergreen.

363
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.630
So it's not a coherent proposal,

364
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.730
but I have a concern that the reason that this is leaderless

365
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.200
is that something that I think is unrelated.

366
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.450
I really think it's unintentional,

367
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.920
but there is something about the way that influence happens in

368
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.230
this era that has taken all of the would be leaders and it has trapped

369
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:12.940
them in the gig economy.

370
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:18.190
And so we have a lot of people who would be in an excellent position to steer

371
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.390
this justifiable,

372
00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:23.950
anger at an enemy that is actually worth attacking to curb the

373
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:28.900
violence and to make this, uh, a moment of useful and necessary change.

374
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.550
I would argue overdue change,

375
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.690
but those people are instead of being leaders,

376
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.900
but they are as influencers and influencers,

377
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:42.430
don't have the kind of power necessary to shape a movement and they don't have

378
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.030
the position to negotiate on its behalf. And this is very dangerous.

379
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.620
<v 0>Where do you think this escalates to?</v>

380
00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:54.390
Do you have a map in your mind of where the territory is?

381
00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:00.030
<v 1>Yeah, I mean, I would say there are several ways it could go,</v>

382
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.590
but unfortunately the dynamics look

383
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.360
almost unresolvable.

384
00:22:06.361 --> 00:22:11.250
If somebody does not speak for the movement and with it being unresolvable,

385
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.140
you've got a conflict between rural people and urban

386
00:22:16.141 --> 00:22:19.740
people. You have a conflict between, um,

387
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:25.470
blacks and those who are self declared allies and ally doesn't

388
00:22:25.471 --> 00:22:27.750
really mean ally, but, uh,

389
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.670
foot soldiers on behalf of this movement and people who won't go along with it.

390
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.740
And what I'm trying to raise people's awareness of right now

391
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:43.560
is that there's something in us being raised in the U S there's

392
00:22:43.561 --> 00:22:48.390
something in us that thinks that the great leap forward

393
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:53.550
in China cannot happen here. That would happen in Cambodia, cannot happen here.

394
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.110
That Nazi Germany cannot happen. Right. Um, and you know,

395
00:22:58.111 --> 00:22:59.730
the Soviet union couldn't happen here.

396
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.230
I don't know what characteristic it is that people think makes it impossible.

397
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.610
I don't think it's impossible.

398
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.110
I think if there is a characteristic that makes it unlikely,

399
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:14.130
it is the structure, it is the constitution,

400
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.490
which I would argue is showing its age, but nonetheless,

401
00:23:17.491 --> 00:23:22.470
the values that America aspires to the reason that the world does pay attention

402
00:23:22.471 --> 00:23:26.820
to us and still even with all of our brokenness allows us to lead it.

403
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:32.250
That reason is that the values that were described were honorable.

404
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.020
Even if they, even if we didn't meet them,

405
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.600
but what we aspired to be was great. And, uh, I, you know,

406
00:23:39.601 --> 00:23:42.360
I resent Trump's make America great again,

407
00:23:42.361 --> 00:23:45.090
because there are populations for whom it has simply never been great.

408
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.180
All right. So I think that last a,

409
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.810
in manga is just a finger in the eye for people and it was designed to be,

410
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.910
but the structure,

411
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.900
what it aspires to be as great and heading in the direction in which it could be

412
00:23:56.901 --> 00:24:00.140
great for everybody is obviously the right thing to do,

413
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.440
but what we are now doing and the thing that troubles me.
