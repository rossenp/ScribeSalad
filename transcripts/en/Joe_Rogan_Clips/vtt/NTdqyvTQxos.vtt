00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Uh, that's why,</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.690
so I've been thinking about where are you going?

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.840
Uh, thing about going to Ghana for a couple months.

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.473
Oh.

5
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.680
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.970
<v 2>Show me the outfit. Come on, man.</v>

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.130
<v 3>You know, this, I actually, I got this in, uh, I got this in, uh,</v>

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.930
in, uh, you know, I don't get the go.

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.960
<v 0>Nowhere. So you, you know, it's Z put off some flat.</v>

10
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.860
<v 4>Every now and then actually, and don't, don't sell this part. So, so that part,</v>

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.410
make sure you don't catch that in the camera.

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.180
<v 0>Uh, but this is, uh, this is from, uh,</v>

13
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.770
Singapore, a random jacket I got over the holiday.

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.380
<v 3>I've been thinking about going to Ghana, just cause.</v>

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.520
<v 0>I took, uh, African ancestry tests.</v>

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.490
Apparently I'm Ghanaian on my father's side and I think

17
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.640
America is going to be,

18
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.790
it's very annoying now and it's going to be pretty annoying in November.

19
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.260
So if I can get out of here October, uh,

20
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.630
at least for two, three months,

21
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.190
just as an exploratory trip and get a different

22
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:23.730
perspective to, to live from right from work from,

23
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:28.560
and just a whole different zone for a bit and really dive in out there.

24
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:30.810
I think now is the,

25
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.810
is the time shifted and I love the idea.

26
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.360
<v 2>I love it, especially now. Right?</v>

27
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:40.780
You just released a special it's available free on YouTube right now. Yeah.

28
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.280
So like what better way to come up with new material than live in Ghana for a

29
00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:45.851
few months,

30
00:01:45.851 --> 00:01:50.050
right before the world explodes because it's going to explode no matter who

31
00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:53.380
wins, man, I'm nervous to be here no matter who wins. It's.

32
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.360
<v 0>Cause it's not a Biden is not a,</v>

33
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.930
is going to be weird. Cause it's not. It's something to really cheerful.

34
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.370
Even if the plan is for him to pass it off and step down,

35
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.000
that's still weird. Yeah. If that's not going to be,

36
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.230
that's not smooth to step. Hey, I'm old. I'm just, I won.

37
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.800
I'm stepping down. That's that's gonna create a whole zone.

38
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.660
<v 2>The only way that would ever work is if whoever his running weight was,</v>

39
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.630
was preferable to him and everybody was excited about it.

40
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.270
Like someone who you would have voted for anyway,

41
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.760
and we don't even know who their running mate is right now. As of today,

42
00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:32.440
July 8th, we don't know who that is.

43
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.680
But if the running mate is preferable to him and like, good,

44
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.440
he's going to be a woman. Good. Give it to her. Let her run it.

45
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.970
If it's like that, maybe it will be okay, but he's not even around.

46
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.010
He's hiding somewhere. He's in a basement.

47
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.870
<v 0>I, I just am skeptical of him just because he,</v>

48
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.760
he was vice-president as an old guy for eight years.

49
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.640
That means he was just jealous.

50
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.710
Just jealous. Look it over one day, one day.

51
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.770
<v 3>It's SU that's too weird. That's too weird of a wait.</v>

52
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.960
<v 0>It is weird to make that move at this age is it should</v>

53
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.310
be a cap 64 president.

54
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.370
Well, and I'm only saying 60 to be nice.

55
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.180
She really be 50 55.

56
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.243
<v 2>Well,</v>

57
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.570
when Reagan was president and he was the oldest president before Trump and then

58
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:35.100
dementia. Yeah. He wound up getting Alzheimer's right. Was it all time?

59
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.240
<v 0>Uh, I think dementia.</v>

60
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.140
<v 2>I'll just never forget when I was an open miker it was like 1988.</v>

61
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.140
There's a guy named Jimmy tingle who was a Boston comedy legend.

62
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.980
And he had this joke about Reagan on trial because reg was on trial and they

63
00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:53.550
asked him if he ever sold arms to Iran. And he said, he couldn't remember.

64
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.920
And Jimmy tin was like, Mr. President.

65
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.770
<v 5>If you ever sell arms to people who hate us,</v>

66
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.380
jot it down, make a note, put it on your refrigerator.

67
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.490
Yeah.

68
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.920
<v 0>You should. You should have some type of reminder.</v>

69
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.420
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. He went out and we thought he was bullshitting. Like we were like,</v>

70
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.460
she's just pretending he doesn't remember.

71
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.150
But then in the end he didn't remember anything like who knows if you remembered

72
00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:22.740
that. Yeah.

73
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.440
<v 0>Is that the age thing?</v>

74
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.300
Is it that needs to be a

75
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.130
sort of cap because why you shouldn't be, first of all,

76
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.953
your,

77
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.180
any ambitions you have in your seventies should be private

78
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:46.620
things like carpentry or fly fishing, music production.

79
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.820
<v 3>It should be price. Any,</v>

80
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.140
you sit have anything at 70 that has to do with.

81
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.130
<v 0>The larger populous. No, you go knit,</v>

82
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.080
you go read and pursue something you wish you did when you were 32.

83
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.600
That's not involving millions of people.

84
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.380
<v 2>I say that, but then I was, I was willing to vote for Bernie Sanders.</v>

85
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.430
I was a Bernie Sanders supporter before he lost, you know, in the primaries,

86
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.790
I felt, I felt like his policies were interesting.

87
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.790
It could be an interesting way to shake up the country. Let's,

88
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.440
let's put focus on human beings and people in communities instead of just

89
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.890
money and foreign interventionists wars.

90
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.960
<v 0>I think Bernie has some interest in policies and he should just,</v>

91
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.003
you know.

92
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.450
<v 1>Put them on a PDF. Is he the only one? I.</v>

93
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.400
<v 3>If they can't be that good, if he's the only one that can do that, no.</v>

94
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.000
Pass him off and be the advisor on the side, you know,

95
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.030
have a, you know, have, you know.

96
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.790
<v 0>Just give advice, you know,</v>

97
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.440
guidance be the wise Sage,

98
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.880
the wise Sage. But at that age, you know, it's, uh,

99
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.250
the travel is, the travel is tough on a young, healthy person.

100
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.440
Yeah.
