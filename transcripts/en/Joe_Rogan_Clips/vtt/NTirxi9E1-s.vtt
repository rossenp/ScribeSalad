00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.801
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:06.480
<v 2>You spent 200 days in space</v>

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.773
in a row.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.000
<v 1>I did, uh, my first flight was two weeks. My second flight was 200 days.</v>

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.160
That's insane.

6
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.640
<v 0>Yeah. What does that feel like?</v>

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.440
<v 1>Um, the two weeks was not enough. I got back to earth and I was like, my,</v>

8
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.270
and that was awesome. I need to go do this again. Uh,

9
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.510
and after 200 days it was awesome, but it was like, right.

10
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.830
I checked the box and you know, I've done all boxes, done everything.

11
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.150
I was a shuttle pilot, you know, station commander. I did space walks.

12
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.230
So I had a chance. I feel like I had a chance to do everything.

13
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:37.670
I made a IMAX movie while I was up there.

14
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.620
I feel like I had a chance to do you know, everything on the wanted to do.

15
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.940
<v 0>When you did two weeks?</v>

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.540
Is there a recovery period when you return after two weeks?

17
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.220
<v 1>Yeah, for sure. But it's pretty quick. Like when you land,</v>

18
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.260
I was super dizzy and I felt like everything was heavy. I,

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.020
I was the last guy outta the shuttle cause I was a pilot and, uh, they,

20
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.901
they came in all right,

21
00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:59.340
time for time to get out ver and I grabbed my helmet and I was like,

22
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.650
be careful this thing, mades 500 pounds. Um, wow.

23
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.330
And that night I was just like, I wanted someone next to me. I didn't fall over,

24
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.050
but I felt like I was going to, um, but after a day or two, I was fine. Uh,

25
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.730
but after the long duration flight, it was like that first day sucked.

26
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.570
I could do everything I could walk around and they make you do this torture

27
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:21.250
where you have to get on your stomach and do it was like burpees, you know,

28
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:22.320
get up as fast. You can.

29
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.360
They were trying to make you pass out from orthostatic intolerance.

30
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.240
So I could do all that stuff. I just hated it.

31
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.320
And then the second day was a little bit better.

32
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:31.880
First day was like a couple bottles of wine.

33
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.640
&lt;laugh&gt; the second day was like a bottle of wine.

34
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.040
The third day was like a glass or two. Um, and by a week later, they,

35
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.790
they make you do this balance test where they put you in this big B box,

36
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.190
you can't see anything. And then they move the box and you're like, Ugh.

37
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.510
And they have four sensors on your feet where if your feet are doing this,

38
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.070
you know, you have bad balance. And if your feet go and recover, you're good.

39
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.510
So I did my balance test before flight and after flight.

40
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.310
And after 200 days in space, a week later,

41
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.460
my balance score was than it was before I launched, which I couldn't believe.

42
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.540
But, um, I tell you that story just to say that, you know,

43
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:11.340
the human body's amazing. It can adapt, uh, pretty.

44
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.540
<v 0>Quickly. That's CRA. So what is the,</v>

45
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:17.220
like from the time you land after 200 days,

46
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.740
and then when you're a hundred percent, how, how much time is that? So.

47
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.490
<v 1>They there's some rule about driving cars.</v>

48
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:28.210
Like they don't want you driving cars for a couple weeks and the doctors gotta

49
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:31.970
sign off before you drive. Oh, wow. But like I said, after a week I was,

50
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.250
I had a better balance score. And after a week I did 20 pullups at the gym.

51
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.130
Really? I was not a hundred percent, but I was like 90% now.

52
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.370
<v 0>Is this because of exercises? They, they prescribe while you're in space.</v>

53
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.720
I absolutely. Yeah. What kind of, what kind of stuff do you have to do up there?

54
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.960
<v 1>So they give you two and a half hours a day.</v>

55
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.720
The Russians learned on me that your bone density,

56
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.120
it's like a linear progression down, you know,

57
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:58.080
about one and a half percent a month. You lose bone density,

58
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.600
one and a half percent of the month. It's, it's a straight line.

59
00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:04.440
It doesn't like bottom out. And they had a guy up there for 440 days.

60
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.040
He's the most ever time and space and one mission.

61
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.080
So to combat that we exercise and they found that like pounding,

62
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.360
uh, resistive exercise is what helps your bones and your muscles.

63
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.160
So we have a weightlifting machine.

64
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:22.350
That's kinda like a Boflex and a treadmill and a bike.

65
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.550
And I was religious about those things. I did 'em every day,

66
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.150
except for my three space walk days.

67
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.390
And we had this really big emergency where other than those four days,

68
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.350
I exercised every day. And are.

69
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.310
<v 0>You sweating up there?</v>

70
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.310
<v 1>You sweat a lot. When you exercise nor just doing this, you don't sweat at all.</v>

71
00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:42.140
You can wear the same underwear and shirt for weeks and you don't even notice.

72
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.500
But if, if you have your exercise shirt after a day,

73
00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:48.620
it's like drenched and stinky, like a stinky under armor shirt, because.

74
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.420
<v 0>There's no circulation of air. Like there's.</v>

75
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.700
<v 1>There's not as much. Well,</v>

76
00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:55.540
just like if you go to the gym and you get after it for an hour,

77
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:59.420
you're gonna be sweating. So it's the same thing in space, but on, on north,

78
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.730
even if you just walk around throughout the day, you know, you're, you can tell,

79
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.170
you gotta wash your clothes, but in space, you don't like,

80
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:08.770
for some reason you don't, you just don't stink on normal. Are they.

81
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.730
<v 0>Giving you like Marino wool clothes to wear or something? So.</v>

82
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.970
<v 1>We had under armored shirts. Okay. And after a day or two, it's like,</v>

83
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.320
they stink and you only got one shirt every two weeks. Oh boy. So those things,

84
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.920
they were ripe after a couple days. So I did this experiment with wool clothes.

85
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:28.360
Like you said, it was like a New Zealand company. I forgot the name of it. Um,

86
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.840
and I was kind of worried, cuz I didn't want to, I thought it'd itch, you know,

87
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.160
wool stuff. So I wore this thing every day for a month.

88
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.720
Got completely drenched sweaty every day for a month in it.

89
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.310
And it did not stink at all. Marino. Woo's amazing. It's amazing. It blew me.

90
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.030
<v 0>Away. Theres a company called first light. Uh, my friend,</v>

91
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:48.630
Steve Renell's one of the owners of it. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but it's a, uh,

92
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.430
a hunting company and most of their clothing,

93
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.990
particularly all their base layers and stuff is all made outta Marino wool.

94
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.430
And the first time I'd ever worn, it was on a hunting trip. You,

95
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.540
you realize when you go hunting,

96
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.260
like one of the big problems is it's freezing cold down. Right.

97
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.100
But you're hiking with a lot of gear. So you sweat. Right.

98
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.420
And then you have to sit down and you freeze your, so you get hypothermia. Yeah.

99
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.580
But you don't with Marino wool. Yeah. When Marino wool was wet,

100
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:15.060
it still keeps you warm. Right.

101
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.380
And so these guys started making hunting gear out of it and it's incredible

102
00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:22.410
stuff. Cause it really doesn't smell it bizarre.

103
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.090
<v 1>I sweated drenching,</v>

104
00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:27.130
sweat every day for a month and I did that twice and it didn't smell at all.

105
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:27.530
It blew.

106
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.170
<v 0>Me away. It's weird. Yeah. But I guess it's organic.</v>

107
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.490
I mean the fibers from the wool and just for whatever reason, it just shakes.

108
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.330
I don't, I don't know what scientific analysis they've ever done on it,

109
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:39.610
but they can't really seem to do that with synthetics.

110
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:42.840
They try it with synthetics, but they can't quite get there.

111
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.880
<v 1>You need a, you need a washing machine. So.</v>

112
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.680
<v 0>Did, were you the one who figured that out? You brought that stuff with you?</v>

113
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.040
<v 1>Well, the, I mean it was like a formal experiment, you know,</v>

114
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:55.000
NASA said that I was working on mice and doing astronomy and testing out

115
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.080
new wool fabric. It was just one, one of the 250 experiments I did.

116
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.320
But it was a good one to do. Um, cuz I didn't stink for a couple months,

117
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:04.400
which was nice. That's crazy that.

118
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.320
<v 0>Even in space, Marino, woos, the way to go, that's nuts. Yeah.</v>

119
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.080
<v 1>It, I, I was really worried. I was afraid it was gonna be uh, you know, itchy,</v>

120
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:15.920
but I got like X XL. I just, I wanted it loose.

121
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.470
I didn't want my like wool rubbing on me, but mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it worked.

122
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.830
It was good.

123
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.663
<v 0>It doesn't itch.</v>

124
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.790
You think of it as like being like that COE wall that like your grandfather

125
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.590
wore, that makes you scratchy. Right. But no, they, they get it down to,

126
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.443
it feels like cotton.

127
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.390
<v 1>It's very soft. They got it figured out, man, that stuff was awesome. So.</v>

128
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.470
<v 0>When you're using these machines, they're all resistance span machines.</v>

129
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.030
Is that what it.

130
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.900
<v 1>Is? Yeah. So the, in the, my book I have a whole, uh,</v>

131
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.780
I make fun of the acronyms. It's a red,

132
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:45.860
which is the NAS acronym for workout machine. Um, so it's uses vacuum.

133
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.500
There's like tubes like a cylinder. So, uh,

134
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.860
instead of compressing the air for your force,

135
00:06:52.861 --> 00:06:57.420
you're pulling against a vacuum and you can get the, a machine is 600,

136
00:06:57.421 --> 00:07:01.330
a hundred pounds. So you can, I can't bench or squat 600 pounds,

137
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.330
but you can put it on there so you could hurt yourself.

138
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.690
It's and they're really interesting about these machines is they,

139
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.210
they're not attached to the wall of the station.

140
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:12.530
They're on like Springs and moving devices.

141
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:14.370
They're called vibration isolation system.

142
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.320
Because if it was attached about like running on a treadmill,

143
00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:22.600
that's a lot of pounding, you know, 200 pounds pounding. Um,

144
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.320
and the earth doesn't really move that much when you do it on earth,

145
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.760
but in space, there's nothing supporting the space station.

146
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.520
So even though it's a million pounds,

147
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.400
the vibration from exercise would actually start to you, knock it outta orbit,

148
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.320
not outta orbit. You break it apart. Actually what really?

149
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.230
They told us in a couple minutes of that'll snap it in half. Yeah.

150
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.150
Cuz the whole thing starts to bend and flex.

151
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.990
And if you're doing it in resonance, it's really dangerous.

152
00:07:45.991 --> 00:07:49.070
They've got videos of like the, the solar rays and these things are big.

153
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:50.350
They don't fit in the football field.

154
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.550
They're hundreds of feet and they start moving. And if the astronaut forgets to,

155
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.540
if they leave the, if they forget to use the vibration system correctly, um,

156
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.660
the station starts flexing and Houston,

157
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.940
there's some guy that monitors and like the alarm goes off and they call you up,

158
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:08.740
stop doing what you're doing. Whoa. It kind of blew me away at it.

159
00:08:08.741 --> 00:08:11.180
It's a million pound massive spaceship,

160
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.300
but still there's nothing stopping it. There's nothing like supporting it.

161
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.020
<v 0>There's no like frame.</v>

162
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.740
<v 1>No it's just, just floating.</v>

163
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.290
So even the exercise of you running on a treadmill or you doing

164
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.650
squats, there's a lot of, if you're pushing 400 pounds this way,

165
00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:30.330
something's pushing 400 pounds that way. Right. So, um,

166
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.850
and if you're going up and down in the right frequency,

167
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.330
it'll it'll snap the station in half.
