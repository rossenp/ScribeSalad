00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.280
<v 2>Joe Biden owns. Come on, man, though. That is true. It really does. Come on,</v>

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.480
man. Crystal was just showing.

4
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.680
<v 1>Me a video that he flipped out on at some reporter today. Did you see this?</v>

5
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:13.760
He's at this summit with Putin and Biden lost his.

6
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.280
He was asked a question that he didn't like he turned around and started

7
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:19.080
yelling. No, yeah, no. He was very cranky,

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.750
cranky old man status in this dude. I think it's from Fox news. Jamie,

9
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.803
if you wanna show.

10
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.950
<v 0>Joe that I'm like he's legitimately falling apart and it's really sad. You know,</v>

11
00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:32.550
what's really weird though, is the media's first of all, the left wing media,

12
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.910
completely ignoring how odd it is, the way he behaves.

13
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.950
Like the one nine year old girl that was sitting there with her legs cross like,

14
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.220
oh, look at her over there. Look like I'm 19 year old girl. That legs crossed,

15
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:47.700
like, what the are you saying? Like, what is that? So there's the whole,

16
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.180
I'm sorry, go ahead. Yeah, but then they'll like,

17
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.220
pretend things are happening that aren't like Glen green wall called it out

18
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.300
today on Twitter. I was reading his Twitter feed.

19
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.730
Some guy was talking about how Putin and by Biden

20
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.050
shook hands and then how Putin looked away.

21
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.370
And then Biden's looking him in the eyes as if he's trying to say that

22
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.690
in any way, Putin is scared of Joe Biden.

23
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.010
That Joe Biden is like dominating Putin. Like what if bizarre,

24
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.600
like in Glen described to it perfectly like go to Glen green wall's Twitter.

25
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.760
Cause it's, it's so strange cuz they do this thing where these world leaders,

26
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:29.594
they shake hands.

27
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.000
They look at the camera and they shake hands and look at the press mm-hmm

28
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.360
&lt;affirmative&gt;. And so in that moment, Biden had forgotten a look at the,

29
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.160
at the press and he's making it seem like Biden staring him down.

30
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.230
He's showing him what a real man. It's like, it's like a bizarre fantasy.

31
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.830
Like almost like a pro wrestling thing.

32
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.830
Like you know that you can't possibly believe what you're saying is true.

33
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.390
That Putin who's a straight up killer literally.

34
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.750
And a judo black belt. Who's the head of the Soviet union. Well,

35
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.620
whatever Russia union Russia. Yeah. Forever and probably will be to dies.

36
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.420
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; killed a gang of people, killed a bunch of people.

37
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:08.100
Don't like 'em killed a bunch of people.

38
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:10.780
Talk about 'em made journalists disappear. Allegedly,

39
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:14.940
allegedly all those things I said allegedly, oh there's one. Okay.

40
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.580
Like they look at each other's shake in the eye and then Putin looks away to the

41
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:22.940
press and by they're making so mad mansion. Look at this. But look at this.

42
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.850
Look you scroll up please. Yeah. Click it the way you scroll.

43
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:29.250
No don't where you, where you had it so I could see it just my bad. Sorry.

44
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.170
No worries. Uh, Biden looked put in the eye. Putin immediately looked away.

45
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.490
&lt;laugh&gt; what?

46
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.570
But go to go to green walls cuz the way he covered it is hilarious.

47
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.450
The way green wall made fun of him. What a, well,

48
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.480
if you go click show this thread.

49
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.280
So scroll down there. Scroll right there. Nope. Back right there.

50
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.280
The obsession over who squeezed, whose hands hardest. Who led? Who? I meant,

51
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.040
I guess he meant let go. Who? Let go.

52
00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:02.480
First of the grip whose body language shows masculine authority and whose show

53
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.680
submission is demented.

54
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.200
A bunch of liberal professionals not allowed to speak this way except here.

55
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.680
So true. That's exactly what it is.

56
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.880
He said Joe Biden can barely complete a sentence.

57
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.040
Half the time he drifts off the middle of his words.

58
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.470
He's constantly bowing his head and muttering about how he'll get in trouble.

59
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.110
If he continues, nobody is afraid of him. Stop feeding liberal hoards.

60
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.030
This warped PLOM PLOM that's a weird word.

61
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.790
<v 1>PLOM yeah. So, um.</v>

62
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.550
<v 0>PLOM you ever use that word? Jamie.</v>

63
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.250
<v 1>PLOS. A good word.</v>

64
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.110
So it's interesting because this is why people hate the media, right? You,

65
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:40.220
everybody feels like they're arguing more from an narrative than they are just

66
00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:42.180
sort of objectively describing what's happening.

67
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.740
And with Biden it's particularly weird because early on in the democratic

68
00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:49.180
primary, when the media was convinced, it's not gonna be Biden,

69
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.980
it's gonna be Pete budgie or it's gonna be Kamala Harris or it's gonna be,

70
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.900
you know, whoever fill in the blank with whoever imploded and was terrible.

71
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.810
They actually were open and honest about the fact for a example,

72
00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:03.170
that Joe Biden sort of sundowning and he is not all there and he can't really

73
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.163
complete full sentences.

74
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.050
And so they actually were the ones who brought it up in debates with him.

75
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:10.330
For example, Julian Castro very famously was like,

76
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.090
do you even know what you just said? Like five seconds ago, this,

77
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:15.930
this was a big moment in the debate. And so the media would openly talk about,

78
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.210
I don't know if Joe's all there anymore,

79
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.560
but the second that he got the nomination, they stopped.

80
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.880
Nobody's allowed to say it. And if you say it you're, you're Trump.

81
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:26.520
You're a right-winger exactly. Even though, you know,

82
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.080
I'm I was the biggest Bernie supporter out there and I was like,

83
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.680
here's a compilation of Joe Biden, clearly having some mental issues. Yeah.

84
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.280
And so it was just incredibly dishonest. Um,

85
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.400
been to your point on Putin and Russia,

86
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.910
the narrow of that they're using for Biden is he's tough.

87
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:43.830
He's standing up to him.

88
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.750
It was the exact opposite for Trump where they were saying, oh,

89
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.270
he's a he's Vladimir Putin's puppet. Yeah. You know,

90
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.110
and they're actually incorrect for both of those things. So in terms of, uh,

91
00:04:54.111 --> 00:04:56.870
what Trump was doing, Trump, Bob Syria,

92
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.220
who's Russia's top ally Trump rejected pipeline called the Nord stream

93
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.020
pipeline, which would've greatly helped. Russia.

94
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.500
Trump armed Ukrainian rebels on the ground who are fighting Russia.

95
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.940
Trump did a NATO buildup on Russia's border.

96
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.820
Now I don't agree with those policies,

97
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.620
but those policies are incredibly hawkish and raised tensions with Russia. Now,

98
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:21.140
in the case of Biden, Biden actually just approved the Nord stream to pipeline,

99
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.530
which is a pipeline that's gonna greatly help Russia because it makes it so that

100
00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:28.450
Russian oil and gas is gonna be used in Germany now. And so that's a very,

101
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.410
that's a very peaceful move. That's not hawkish, that's not raising tensions.

102
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.410
So he's basically giving Putin something that Putin wants. Which again,

103
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.610
I actually agree with that. I see no problem with the pipeline,

104
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.400
but they're framing it as if like buck Joe Biden. He's so weak and, and he's,

105
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:44.400
you know, Vladimir Putin or excuse me,

106
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:47.080
Joe Biden is so strong and he's dominating Vladimir Putin.

107
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.760
<v 0>Mm. Yeah. I,</v>

108
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.800
I don't understand why they think that they can do that and that people

109
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.520
won't be more hesitant to believe the news dude, you.

110
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.600
<v 1>Would be surprised at unfortunately some of this stuff lands,</v>

111
00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:03.280
there is a backlash to it, but some of this stuff lands, I saw great.

112
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.880
Phole the other day when it came to Donald Trump,

113
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.920
it was like over 70% of the time they talked about him,

114
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.280
they would talk about his like character and leadership qualities or lack

115
00:06:14.281 --> 00:06:18.150
thereof. Yeah. And so when that, how you're talking about the person you say,

116
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.190
oh the you want. Cause what does that even mean?

117
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.990
Let me talk about this person's character. It's subjective. Somebody could say,

118
00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:24.350
I think he's got great character. Somebody could say,

119
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:25.470
I think he's got terrible character.

120
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.630
So it was always out of the realm of policy. Right. And then that same poll,

121
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.510
it was like 60 or 65% of the time when they talked about Biden,

122
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.630
they talked about policy. Mm. So it's it,

123
00:06:34.631 --> 00:06:38.020
there was this huge dichotomy, how they,

124
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.020
they discuss the presidents and obviously the ones who they, like,

125
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:43.980
they go a little softer on when it came to Trump and they despised him,

126
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.980
they would talk about, and the, the crazy thing,

127
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:46.900
the thing that drives me crazy Joe,

128
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.500
is that there are a lot of ways to go after Trump.

129
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.460
They're actually very intelligent that I would agree with.

130
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.620
When you stick to policy,

131
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.580
I disagree with him on almost everything when it comes to policy,

132
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.140
but they didn't do that. Right. It was all about he, you know, he's bad person.

133
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.050
Yeah. Character assassination all day long, which is gross.

134
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.770
<v 0>Do you think that Biden is making actual decisions? Um.</v>

135
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.650
<v 1>That's a good question. Um.</v>

136
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.610
<v 0>I don't think I would ever say that about any other president other than Trump.</v>

137
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.210
Some, some of the Trump stuff. I was like,

138
00:07:13.211 --> 00:07:15.570
I wonder like how much he like pawns off on the generals.

139
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.170
<v 1>Well, w Bush was also an idiot too.</v>

140
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.320
<v 0>You know? Well, but we all knew that Dick Cheney.</v>

141
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.680
<v 1>Was kind of, he was pulling the puppet strings. Yeah. So in the case of,</v>

142
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.480
of Biden, I think it's, it's 50, 50.

143
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.760
I think some of the stuff he probably makes in some of the stuff he doesn't,

144
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.161
I mean,

145
00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:30.200
he Def he clearly is having struggles mentally and he is getting very old.

146
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:33.040
And I think everybody around him knows that, but a lot of the big decisions,

147
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.720
I'm sure they have to land on his desk. Um, and what.

148
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.430
<v 0>Did they do D for him during the debates with Trump when he was sharp,</v>

149
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.310
but one debate they had to.

150
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.670
<v 1>And I said this too, with the Bernie debate as well. I really,</v>

151
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.910
and this is all speculation. I just want everybody to know,

152
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:48.470
I have no facts on this. I'm talking out of my, but yeah,

153
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.750
I think he was on some sort of upper that allowed him to be sharp.

154
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.790
<v 0>I feel like it had to be more than that.</v>

155
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.470
<v 1>So you think it's some like anti, I don't know.</v>

156
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.380
<v 0>Psychotic or, but he was, he was in the groove. Like he acted like a normal.</v>

157
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.500
<v 1>Person. Well, when he was younger, he actually, again,</v>

158
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.900
