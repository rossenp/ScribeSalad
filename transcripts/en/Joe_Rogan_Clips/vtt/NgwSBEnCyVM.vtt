00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 1>Experience, you know, you look at, uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.000
I don't know if you've been paying attention to what these senators did.

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.240
Uh there's uh, some senators,

5
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:13.800
they had a behind closed doors meeting about the coronavirus

6
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.280
and China and what it could meet at the United States and, you know,

7
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.190
the various impacts. And they went out and sold their stuff immediately, dude,

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.790
and then, but, but at the same time,

9
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.470
they were talking about how under control the government had it and how we're

10
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.710
prepared and how it's gonna be fine. And meanwhile, they knew,

11
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.230
they knew, so they had two faces,

12
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:38.470
they had a public face that they were given to us to try to keep us calm.

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.870
And then they had a private,

14
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.900
which realized that the stock market was gonna take a huge loss.

15
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.580
And so they sold everything and made immense profits based on the information

16
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.540
that they found out from these closed door meetings about the coronavirus,

17
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.580
how are they supposed to, how.

18
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.260
<v 2>Is that legal? How are they supposed to handle though? Out of like legally,</v>

19
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.580
what are they supposed to do? What that makes confusing.

20
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.450
<v 1>I, I don't know what constitutes insider trading. How does that work?</v>

21
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.810
Do you understand how that works?

22
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.930
Like if you have information that can allow you to make money well,

23
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:09.810
isn't that like what everyone's trying to do? Like if like,

24
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:12.170
what is the point of playing the stock market? If you don't know things,

25
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.370
and if you do know things,

26
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.890
if you know more because you know the guy who's the president and he tells you

27
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:18.450
something about something they're gonna do and you're not supposed to trade then

28
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.730
because of that information, like, all right. Okay.

29
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.200
I I'm sure there's a logic to it. I'm a moron. Don't run it by me.

30
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.600
But if that's insider trading, well, what is it? What the senators do.

31
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.760
If they knew that the coronavirus was gonna wreck our economy,

32
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.720
if they knew that it was coming down, like a storm of hail,

33
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.840
that no one could stop. If they knew,

34
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.840
and then they bailed out and made immense profits,

35
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.590
that seems so 80. Yeah.

36
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.270
It seems so shady that they didn't advise people like you're supposed to be a

37
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:50.550
leader, right? If you're in a position, an elected representative,

38
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.950
you're supposed to be acting in the position of a leader.

39
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.150
And if your way to lead is tell people one thing,

40
00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:58.870
but act in a completely different direction,

41
00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:00.030
tell people everything's gonna be fine,

42
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.420
but then start selling your stock at a profit.

43
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.740
And you don't tell other people to do it because you're worried that maybe that

44
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:09.900
information's gonna cause some ripple effect and it's gonna destroy the economy.

45
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.540
Even before the coronavirus hits just outta a panic and fear and people are

46
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:17.940
gonna act wrong, but you acted in a different way than the way you were talking.

47
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.700
You acted like this was gonna be real.

48
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.500
You acted like there's gonna be a real problem. And,

49
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.490
and then the question is like,

50
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:26.210
how much of a problem did they think it was gonna be?

51
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.850
Maybe they dumped their stock. They thought it was gonna be a little problem.

52
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.130
Would that be okay? Well, but if they found out it was gonna be a huge problem,

53
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:35.890
then it's not, well, that seems weird to me too. Like,

54
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.210
I don't know what should the rules be with information? And the stock market,

55
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.930
the stock market is gross. Like it's gross. The whole thing's gross.

56
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.880
Like what are we basing our economy on this madness? So.

57
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.040
<v 0>I saw an article where, um,</v>

58
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.840
the photographer who took that photo was like, ah, he was like, oh,

59
00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:59.840
it's so sad that people are using his image that way. Um,

60
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.480
because you know, he passed away and, and I, you know, he,

61
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.520
he thought it was kind of offensive that he was being used to,

62
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.360
to prank or whatever. And he said, you know, I, I,

63
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.560
I saw that people started selling merch with this guy's face on it. And he goes,

64
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.040
I just wish he goes, I own the photograph.

65
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.950
And I'm not trying to come after me when I just wish they share proceeds of that

66
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.950
merch with the family. So I saw that and I was like, oh, I wanna do that.

67
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.030
So I launched a shirt with that. Guy's face on it that says,

68
00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:33.710
wash your hands. &lt;laugh&gt; And then,

69
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.140
And then I go, Ugh, I go, I wanna give the proceeds to this man's family.

70
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.340
So cuz of that article, I reached out to people.

71
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.580
I was able to get in touch with the photographer, the guy who took that picture.

72
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.140
And then I found, I got in touch with his, the, the,

73
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.010
the models, uh, fiance, who, you know, his ex I mean,

74
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.650
whatever. Right. He passed away. So anyways, I contacted her, I found her,

75
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.530
I've learned a little bit about this guy in that photo and I'm giving them the

76
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.810
proceeds from, uh, the shirt sales, all of them,

77
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.410
all the prophets will go to them. And I also found that, uh, when he,

78
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.360
when he died, like the family wasn't, um,

79
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.840
prepared like financially for anything.

80
00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:27.160
So they had to set up a GoFundMe for his funeral and tombstone and all that.

81
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:30.000
So I'm, I I'm gonna blast it out and I talk to them. Oh, beautiful.

82
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:32.200
They're happy with it. So that's my breaking. News' awesome.

83
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:32.920
That's the breaking news. That's.

84
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.800
<v 1>The break. That's important news. Jamie told me as not really as big.</v>

85
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.800
<v 0>I didn't get into that with her. I, um, Jamie.</v>

86
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.200
<v 1>Said that it's photoshopped.</v>

87
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.510
<v 0>I've heard that as well. I've seen, I saw the original.</v>

88
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.590
<v 1>Blog post that came from you. Did let's see what the original hog was. I don't,</v>

89
00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:47.350
I'll have to find it now.

90
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.510
<v 0>Long, but oh, please don't tell me, that's gonna take a while.</v>

91
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.110
Did you pull that up? Someone on Twitter.

92
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.310
<v 1>I saw it on Twitter. Someone let's see the original hog please. Uh,</v>

93
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.790
I didn didn't Google it. So like I have to find the link, like just Google,

94
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.340
original, big penis guys on I'm. Sure. That'll come.

95
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.220
That's how you find that Joe. &lt;laugh&gt;.

96
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.780
<v 0>There's gonna be a lot of photos that come up.</v>

97
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.100
Show me the original black Dick &lt;laugh&gt;. Um pat&lt;inaudible&gt;. Yeah,

98
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.780
but she, uh, it was funny. She was like, you know,

99
00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:15.900
what was crazy is when I reached out,

100
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.700
I found it took me like I was doing like detective work. Right. You know,

101
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.890
to find her. And she was like, I found out of about this meme today.

102
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.010
She was like, I didn't even know this was a thing.

103
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.250
<v 1>How did she find, oh, people probably not sending it to her.</v>

104
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.490
<v 0>I think so. Yeah. Cause, and then someone was like, Hey,</v>

105
00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:32.650
have you checked out your neighborhood?

106
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.290
<v 1>Funny? Remember your dead husband hill O.</v>

107
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.010
<v 0>Well, yeah. So no. Yeah, yeah. Uh, but anyways, yeah. Oh.</v>

108
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.040
<v 1>Well, first of, of all she's engaged to a porn star. That's.</v>

109
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.760
<v 0>Gotta be weird. No, but she wasn't, she wasn't. No, she explained to me,</v>

110
00:05:46.761 --> 00:05:48.480
she goes, you know, he was, she goes,

111
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:51.400
he did those photos when it was a really bad time in his life.

112
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:54.440
He needed money to save the house that he grew up in. That was his now.

113
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.600
<v 1>Oh. So he just started sling that big Dick. Yeah.</v>

114
00:05:56.601 --> 00:05:58.920
Started sling that Dick around. And uh,

115
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.600
how much money can you make sling Dick as a dude though?

116
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.600
I think if you iunno 50 bucks. No, I think you can get more than that.

117
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.600
I think they make much money,

118
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.000
but we've never been in a situation where everybody's scared of one disease.

119
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.480
It's so strange, man. It's so strange.

120
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.230
And I don't think I could be able to get pat that and just do a show right now.

121
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.510
I'm 90% sure they're gonna cancel it. I mean, the,

122
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.390
the stuff that they're coming up with for treatment,

123
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.470
one of them is a malaria disease, an old malaria disease. Um,

124
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:31.670
there's some other different treatments that hold hope. And,

125
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.390
but there's so many people, man, that could get infected.

126
00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:38.700
If you've got a show of 12,000, 13,000 people, whatever it is,

127
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.820
how the are you gonna make sure those people are okay?

128
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.380
Is it your responsibility? Do you say, come at your own risk? You know? I mean,

129
00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:48.820
what if you get it when you're there? Like what, what are we doing?

130
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.740
What are we doing? You know? I mean the whole thing's crazy.

131
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.580
It's I think it's gonna be a long time before we feel comfortable doing shows

132
00:06:56.581 --> 00:07:00.810
again. It's strange at first, you know, but I also think, uh,

133
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.930
when the dust settles, it will settle. Hopefully,

134
00:07:03.931 --> 00:07:06.210
unless this is the first thing that falls.

135
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.570
And then all those other things fall into place that we talked about,

136
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:13.090
like natural disasters. We're gonna appreciate peace.

137
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.730
We're gonna appreciate freedom. You're gonna appreciate being a roam around.

138
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.640
Do whatever you want. Go out of three o'clock at night. You're gonna,

139
00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:20.600
you're gonna appreciate it.

140
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:23.760
You're gonna appreciate being able to go to a diner and, uh,

141
00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:26.200
have breakfast with your friend at two o'clock in the morning and laugh.

142
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.680
You're gonna appreciate it. Cars on the street, everybody acting normal.

143
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.440
It's gonna mean more to you now. It's like the sun after a rainy day,

144
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:36.320
it means more, it feels better, has more of an impact.

145
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.480
And I think we've gone through a long,

146
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.270
long stretch in this country where everything was static.

147
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.230
Everything was doing fairly well. We were on an upward trend,

148
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.310
no real tragedy, national nationally,

149
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:52.430
that changed the way we live our life other than September 11th.

150
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.150
So we got like September 11th and then all these years of war, of course, crime,

151
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.820
of course all these, but we're basically a business as usual for most folks,

152
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.380
not anymore. This is a wake up call.

153
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.860
There's a wake up call that you have a finite amount of time in this life

154
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.780
and this life, the way you're experiencing it right now,

155
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.340
it's this is just how it is right now.

156
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.980
There's a million different factors that are in play constantly.

157
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.300
And you've been real lucky that you've had this stretch of peace and harmony

158
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.210
&lt;affirmative&gt;, but that could change at any moment. It really could.

159
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.570
And we gotta use this time to be nicer to each other. We gotta use this time to,

160
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:32.570
to realize that we got, we got a little confused. We got crazy. You know,

161
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:36.090
everybody's just trying to acquire things and everybody's trying to, you know,

162
00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:39.090
move their way up the corporate ladder. Like, Hey, there's,

163
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.080
there's a end of this ride. Okay. This ride comes to a stop someday.

164
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.800
And it doesn't matter how much you've acquired. It doesn't matter.

165
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.360
You know how far you got up this ladder? You know, what,

166
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:53.880
what position of prominence you have in the community and, uh,

167
00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:57.600
how you're respected by the business world. Nobody gives a when you're dead.

168
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.400
It's not, you're gonna die. We are together right now,

169
00:09:01.401 --> 00:09:04.640
experiencing this thing in this like really distracted way.

170
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.600
The thing comes into focus when you're forced into a situation like,

171
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.280
like we are now where you literally are nervous about your survival,

172
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.990
then the thing comes in to focus.

173
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:20.550
And he only brought in tools to make tools and the big

174
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:23.830
tools like that. He made all of himself. That's.

175
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.350
<v 3>Amazing. And what, what, what did he live on? Just deer meat. I mean, yeah.</v>

176
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.830
<v 1>Elk, meat, deer, meat, berries. He got some oatmeal stuff. You know,</v>

177
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:35.500
some dry goods that he would, uh, he would get in barrels.

178
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.260
<v 3>So, so he'd come in and touch base periodically.</v>

179
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.940
<v 1>They would come to him. People would fly out to him with goods, God, but I mean,</v>

180
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.700
he built all this by himself.

181
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.380
He built his whole cabin by himself and he documented every step of the way.

182
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.320
Amazing.

183
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.540
His name is Prene P R O E N N E K E.

184
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.970
Dick preneke alone in the ness is the whole series on YouTube.

185
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.690
And he's on the side of a lake with this,

186
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.370
this cabin that he built living off of animals that he hunted

187
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.530
and firewood and you know, whatever food that he gathered.

188
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.090
<v 3>I'm I'm obsessed with this now. Yeah.</v>

189
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.690
Cause I got this Corona thing caught me with my pants down. Yeah.

190
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.360
I want here's what I want. I want a,

191
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.800
I want a substantial cabin made of thick logs or stone and then

192
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.200
I want it near a lake or a water source. Maybe preferably a, a, well, yeah,

193
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.320
that I can. Iregate my own crops.

194
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.760
<v 1>You gonna have crops. I'm gonna have chicken.</v>

195
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.680
<v 3>I need chickens.</v>

196
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.560
<v 1>You really only need a garden. You don't need crops. I.</v>

197
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.470
<v 3>You, I garden. Is it just you? Yes. Well, it might be me and my, my several,</v>

198
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.710
several of my friends, lady, friends, my lady friends,

199
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:46.190
because I'm gonna start my own colony. So I have to breed. Mm you understand?

200
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.670
Okay. And I need, I need a lot of hair and uh, beard dye.

201
00:10:49.671 --> 00:10:51.870
Cause I wanna stay looking young. What.

202
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.830
<v 1>If they come up with something that reverses you in age now you're talking my.</v>

203
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.460
<v 3>Language. How old would you David Sinclair actually have a cabin on the side.</v>

204
00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.620
&lt;laugh&gt; he'd be right next to.

205
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.660
<v 1>You doing experiments. Yeah. I'm.</v>

206
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.460
<v 3>Gonna have his lab and I'm gonna be his skinny pig. Yeah. You'd.</v>

207
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.293
<v 1>Be the guy. Yeah.</v>

208
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.260
<v 3>David come out, come on out. And I'll justentice him just out. I'llice him.</v>

209
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.060
<v 1>With all the girls he'd come well, he's not into that. He's a married man.</v>

210
00:11:11.061 --> 00:11:11.821
Leave him alone. All right.

211
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:14.820
But he'd like to come out just to hang out and Andal round for a few days.

212
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:16.820
He's a fun guy. He's a, he seems like a good.

213
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.653
<v 3>Guy. He's a great guy.</v>

214
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.130
<v 1>Yeah. And he's brilliant. Yes. And he's brilliant in the field.</v>

215
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.570
That's very important. He's what do.

216
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.450
<v 3>You mean? You're getting old.</v>

217
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.810
<v 1>That's right? Yeah. That's right.</v>

218
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.090
You wanna be Dick preneky where you had to escape your,

219
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.170
your wilderness paradise again.

220
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.250
<v 3>Again, I, again, cause you're too old. There are a couple things.</v>

221
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.890
One more thing I wanna do is I wanna split with,

222
00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:40.040
with my shirt off while I have women watch me through the window of my log cabin

223
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.480
as they're baking me a pie. Now I know this is a showveistic fantasy.

224
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.080
<v 1>It sounds like it don't worry. You sound like a real piece of. Right.</v>

225
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:46.560
Then the other.

226
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.320
<v 3>Thing I wanna do before I die is I want to have a horse I'm so attached to it</v>

227
00:11:49.321 --> 00:11:52.320
that I can go. And, and then it just shows up. Oh.

228
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.160
<v 1>So sort of like Brad Pitt's.</v>

229
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.040
<v 4>Pit bull in once upon a time in Hollywood, correct. I'd kill for one of those.</v>

230
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:03.120
That pit bull was perfect. That was great. That thing just,

231
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.920
that knew what to do when to do it. Yeah.

232
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:12.790
Thank.
