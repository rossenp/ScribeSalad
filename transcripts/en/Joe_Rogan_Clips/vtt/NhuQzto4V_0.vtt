00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So we wrap this up. I mean, listen,</v>

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:09.330
I don't think we're going to no one. And then you lost in this podcast.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.310
I don't think we're going to no jail. We'll never know. We may never know.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.000
People are going to be mad at both of you guys for not voting and me for voting

5
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.660
and in the Reltio Jorgensen. I listen, I did what I had to do.

6
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:22.920
I was going to vote.

7
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:25.020
I fought about it and I looked at the people doing it and they said,

8
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.680
I don't want to be associated with them. So listen, I just want to,

9
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.020
I want to reiterate this before we finish.

10
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.660
And even though I said it about 78 times tonight,

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.890
but we have the list of the states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia.

12
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.340
They don't count the mail in ballots as they come in.

13
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.580
So they're counting all the votes from today, which are going to skew pro Trump.

14
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.000
And then after they count the mail-in votes, which skew pro Biden,

15
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.170
can we see this? The states again? So those states I think, are, uh,

16
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.620
play. Now, let me ask you this is,

17
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.700
is there a path where if Trump wins Pennsylvania,

18
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.540
where he could still lose the electric? Um, let me see the map.

19
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.730
Let's see if he were,

20
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:10.680
if Trump were to win Pennsylvania and he wins Ohio and he wins Florida,

21
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.640
um, see his problem is he's not gonna win Wisconsin and Michigan.

22
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:18.690
I think he might eat out to 2 78 if he gets,

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.220
yeah. If he gets North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio.

24
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:26.240
I think that might get him there, but I saw.

25
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.260
<v 1>The way he could win or excuse me, Biden could win without getting Pennsylvania,</v>

26
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.980
but it would give them two 70. Exactly. Which is like a tough way though.

27
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.200
Would that Matt be, I'm trying to re I can't,

28
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.120
I can't check the tweet cause you guys are. I have to get.

29
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.450
<v 0>Rid of my screen that two 70, when we listen to them,</v>

30
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.250
it really adds up right now.

31
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:46.610
It really all rides on Pennsylvania because I'll tell you what Michigan and

32
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:47.720
Wisconsin are not going to stay.

33
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.810
pro-Trump they're a hundred percent flipping a Biden.

34
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.040
Cause he's up like eight to 10 points there in the polls.

35
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.630
And we haven't counted the male yet.

36
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.660
So Wisconsin and Michigan are gone for Biden. For sure.

37
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.280
So it's going to come down to Pennsylvania, Tom and Arizona to a little bit,

38
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:03.740
but it looks like Biden's going to hang on there, which is kind of surprising.

39
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.560
I'm saying he's winning it. That's what I'm saying. It comes down to PA.

40
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.980
Arizona is another state where the California's fled to.

41
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.290
They all went to Phoenix and Tucson, but it's more old. Suburban retiree is,

42
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.260
you know what I mean? And they like those muscles,

43
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.870
Arizona factor. If Michigan and Wisconsin scroll back up,

44
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.010
what's agreed that Michigan and Wisconsin go to Biden as a candidates,

45
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.340
campaigns have expected, then Pennsylvania takes center stage, right?

46
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:34.940
Not necessarily Biden could lose Pennsylvania and still win the presidency.

47
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:39.500
If he wins Arizona plus Maine to in Nebraska to where he's not going to win me.

48
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.980
Split those two main second district. That's not, oh,

49
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.830
it's actually much more likely to be two 70 on the nose. Interesting.

50
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.150
Yeah, but I, um, it's I think it's.

51
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.350
<v 2>Going to come down to Pennsylvania. Wow. What a tight race.</v>

52
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.480
<v 0>Is it tight race? You think Trump's not to raise hell if he's got 2 68,</v>

53
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.310
Trump's not going to let that go. He's gonna be like, can he do Supreme court?

54
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.130
He'll say, it, fraudulent. This that's fake.

55
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.230
This isn't real is where it gets ugly. Right?

56
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.380
That's that's where we have a real problem in this country. Yeah.

57
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.580
When it goes to the Supreme court,

58
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.270
you remember those people that tried to knock the Biden bus off the road? Yes.

59
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.970
Yeah. Imagine how they're going to react.

60
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.310
If they think the Democrats are going to try to steal it,

61
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.890
that drives a bunch of that was happening.

62
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.130
I don't know if you saw the violence in North Carolina today where people were

63
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.810
trying to block the polls.

64
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.490
There was a lot of chaos and police were pepper spraying people at the polls.

65
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.260
Trays. Yeah, it didn't look good. It doesn't look good. It looked awful.

66
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.180
It's like, God it. This is voting.

67
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.030
Is there a shot that we don't know the answer tomorrow? Yes.

68
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.680
There's a very good shot. We don't know the answer tomorrow.

69
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.860
Cause it might take a while. What do you think if you had to guess?

70
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.200
If I had to guess, I think it looks relatively close. I'd say three days.

71
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:59.410
Maybe we might know the answer. So the weekend. Perfect.

72
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.480
I'll tell you right now and slide the out. Listen. Yeah.

73
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.110
You're you're getting out onto the wire. I'm getting out tomorrow at 6:30 AM.

74
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.310
Perfect. Smart. Go right back to the desert. Pack your. Get ready to move here.

75
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.640
Yeah. It's common. Not immediately. It's coming. We'll see. It's coming.

76
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.400
I got to see this Michael blue. We'll see. No,

77
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:24.080
I think, I think Trump's hanging on [inaudible].

78
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.870
<v 1>It's probably very hard, but a potential tie of 2 69 each,</v>

79
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.580
it seems like to get it. That.

80
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.230
<v 0>Would be [inaudible] do happens. They're like no. Then they slug it out. Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.680
Then they fight dual do as if there was a way to tell you that comes out of the

82
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:40.350
basement of the white house rises up,

83
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.240
they climb in and duke it out with those on-body things.

84
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:47.760
There was only a 4% chance. It would end like that.

85
00:04:47.761 --> 00:04:51.060
And it seems like that might happen. Do you know what happens in what?

86
00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:52.230
In case of a tie? Yeah.

87
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.270
<v 1>They revoked goes to.</v>

88
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.710
<v 0>Congress. Hold on. Let me look.</v>

89
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.760
<v 1>This says that the it's, this is from 5 38,</v>

90
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.160
who is everyone's favorite account today because the polls,

91
00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:03.720
but it says in that case,

92
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:08.550
Biden would need to carry either Nebraska or Maine second congressional

93
00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:12.510
district to win. And I don't know why those two specifically.

94
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.780
<v 3>Um, I'm going to look.</v>

95
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.630
<v 0>I actually don't know what happens if it's a tie and I'm going to look now,</v>

96
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.610
this is Nancy Pelosi default or something

97
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.031
in the United States,

98
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:27.930
a contingent election is that is the procedure used to elect the president or

99
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.320
vice-president in the event that no candidate for one or both of these officers

100
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:33.510
wins an absolute majority of votes in the electoral college,

101
00:05:33.511 --> 00:05:37.200
a contingent election for the president is decided by a vote of the United

102
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.060
States house of representatives. Congress decides well,

103
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:42.810
a contingent election for the president for the vice-president is decided by a

104
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:44.670
vote of the United States Senate. Oh my God.

105
00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:48.900
That's interesting because that would mean the Democrats in the house would pick

106
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:50.010
Biden to be president.

107
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.970
And then the Republicans in the Senate would pick a Republican to be

108
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.660
vice-president.

109
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.180
<v 1>And then what the Supreme court picks does a default. I just go for.</v>

110
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.810
<v 0>During the contingent election, each house state delegation casts one vote, uh,</v>

111
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.500
to determine the president rather than a vote from each representative senators.

112
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:09.890
Instead cast votes individually for vice-president the contingent election

113
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:12.830
process was first established in article two, section one clause,

114
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.090
three of the us constitution.

115
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.770
It was subsequently modified by the 12th amendment in 1804.

116
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.710
The phrase contingent election is not found in the text of the constitution

117
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:26.450
itself, but has been used to describe the procedure since at least 1823.

118
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.420
<v 1>Mm wait. So I just, I read over that real quick and you kind of glossed over.</v>

119
00:06:31.421 --> 00:06:34.720
It says that the president and vice president are indirectly elected.

120
00:06:34.721 --> 00:06:38.020
So that means they pick them. They each are picked separately.

121
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.790
<v 0>Right? That's what I said. I know this is so fast. It's a very bad system.</v>

122
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.370
I said, I said, you have the Congress picks the president.

123
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.380
And then it's the Senate that picks the vice president.

124
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.150
The Senate is Republican right now. Uh, and Congress is democratic right now.

125
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.270
She'd have a Democrat at the top of the ticket and a Republican at the bottom of

126
00:06:55.271 --> 00:06:56.440
the tie. Then you'll have a winner.

127
00:06:56.441 --> 00:06:58.210
I think it's just kind of just somebody is going to win.

128
00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.560
Somebody is going to win these things.

129
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.690
I think it's gonna all come down to Pennsylvania.

130
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.960
And I still think it's very likely Biden, wind, Pennsylvania.

131
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.030
Cause they got to count all the mail-in ballots and they're overwhelmingly

132
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.440
button. But, but I will say this, listen, if,

133
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.450
if Biden wins this election and he's got less than 300 electoral votes

134
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.520
yet again, Trump outperformed the polls. He absolutely outperformed the polls.

135
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.820
Cause all the polls coming into today, if you just copied and pasted,

136
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.730
it would have been Biden 351 electoral votes.

137
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.550
So that means Trump outperformed the polls yet again,

138
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.560
if Biden only wins would like 2 78 or some.

139
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.540
So with Pennsylvania in the mail and votes,

140
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:38.020
like how carefully that was going to be monitored. The counting of them,

141
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.710
this could get really weird. It can get really weird. It can get really ugly.

142
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.230
We know Trump is probably already going to try to downplay them and get them

143
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:46.180
dismissed. Republicans are literally,

144
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:49.410
they're doing lawsuits in certain states to try to get the bells to dismiss

145
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.720
percent of the state voting absentee. COVID

146
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.640
COVID a lot of states have been doing it like that where people don't want to

147
00:07:57.641 --> 00:08:00.730
show it to seems odd to me. Cause you can go to the grocery store.

148
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.370
You can go somewhere else. I don't know why you can't.

149
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:04.960
<v 2>Pull a lever. Yeah.</v>

150
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.900
<v 0>That seems odd. It seems odd.</v>

151
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.740
There are there going to be lawsuits where they try to throw them out.

152
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.040
You won't finish counting absentee ballots till Friday at the earliest.

153
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.710
<v 3>Ooh. Oh, that's a long time.</v>

154
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.960
<v 0>They're busy dealing with Tuesdays. In-person voting.</v>

155
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.740
<v 2>Wow. Friday. That's nuts. So.</v>

156
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.580
<v 0>Here we are on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and then Friday.</v>

157
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.970
We'll say three days, like I said, oh my God. Wow.

158
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.720
When Pennsylvania proved so-called no excuse absentee male belts last fall,

159
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.480
meaning any voter can request one without citing and reason.

160
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.680
The law didn't allow officials to begin canvassing mail ballots until polls

161
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.610
close on election night. According to Lisa shaver,

162
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.540
the executive director of the county commissioners association of Pennsylvania.

163
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.051
By the way,

164
00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:57.870
if Biden loses the will immediately blame the voters as if the

165
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.140
voters let him down. Not that he wasn't a good enough candidate.

166
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.390
Cause this is exactly what happened in 2016.

167
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.000
They immediately started blaming the voters. Yeah.

168
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:11.020
Well they're going to be bitter. You know, people when they lose, they,

169
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.970
they blame all kinds.

170
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.480
<v 2>Of other things other than their own performance. Well, Hey.</v>

171
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.340
<v 0>We had a few filet of fish. Yeah. We tried. We had a few laughs.</v>

172
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.180
If people think that we weren't taking things seriously. You're right.

173
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.660
That's what we're doing, right, exactly what we're here for. Correct.

174
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.280
This is not a serious, uh, election show. Um, but uh,

175
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.460
thank you gentlemen. That was a lot of fun India.

176
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.370
Thank you for coming and splaining things to us. My pleasure way.

177
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:41.700
That's like you're welcome informed. No, that guy, uh,

178
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:46.650
thank you for mocking our system. Thank you Jamie,

179
00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:50.190
for being a big Snopes fan. Appreciate that shell.

180
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:59.120
Okay. Jamie's a, he's a COVID survivors. Give him some respect.

181
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.390
I know. I kinda, I kind of shimmied away from him when I saw him at the door.

182
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.350
I was like, all right, you good, bro, man, he's got the antibiotics.

183
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.950
He's the most safe person that's that's right. Coffin his mouth.

184
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.600
And he brush it right off. Um, all right, well that's it ladies and gentlemen,

185
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.310
thank you for tuning in. I hope it didn't disappoint you too terribly hope.

186
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.160
You're not mad at me for voting for someone to get with luck and enjoy the

187
00:10:22.161 --> 00:10:26.870
riots. Dylan and Kyle Kalinsky, not voting at all. Yeah.

188
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.900
Chaos. It's going to be chaos coming up in the next few days. I hope.

189
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.560
I really think it is cool. I hope we can get through this as a country and um,

190
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.490
and uh, but listen, on the bright side, more people voted than ever.

191
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.250
And I think we're aware now that's a great point.

192
00:10:40.251 --> 00:10:43.370
Importance of voting Tim Dillon show on YouTube. Good luck, Tim.

193
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.690
Dylan has a great show. You can watch his podcast. Secular song.

194
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.470
Talk on YouTube. Yeah, well that's I was going to get to that eventually.

195
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.510
That was not to cut you off over Tim. Dylan's plugged where uh,

196
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.240
Tim Dillon also was on the road. He's hitting the road again.

197
00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:01.370
Starting to throw the gags. Yeah, we're trying,

198
00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:04.010
we're seeing the cutting capacity. We're rescheduling some stuff,

199
00:11:04.011 --> 00:11:07.370
but we're going to win his fight through the Chicago show, just killing them,

00:11:07.371 --> 00:11:09.920
