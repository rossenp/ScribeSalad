00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. So my final point is,</v>

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.320
is the falsifiability one that is, uh,

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.250
what would it take to refute your hypothesis? Like for me,

4
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:13.140
the answer would be like, if go, go Beckley,

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.450
Tepi turned out to be what you think it might've been

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.780
the place where advanced ancient civilization once inhabited or they

7
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:24.690
used it. Where are the metal tools?

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.910
W w where are the writing?

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.020
The examples of writing the decision was made.

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.440
<v 1>Not to use metal, perhaps a decision was made that, uh,</v>

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.510
errors had taken place that, that, that in reinventing civilization,

12
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:43.190
we shouldn't perhaps go down quite the same route as before, uh, perhaps rating.

13
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.960
Isn't always an advance, uh, perhaps perhaps, uh, an oral tradition, which,

14
00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:49.370
which records in memory,

15
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:54.050
which enhances and uses the power of memory may be a very effective way of, of,

16
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.160
of dealing with information. We regard writing as a, as an advance.

17
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.700
And I can see lots of reasons why it isn't advanced,

18
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:05.660
but if we put our self into the heads of ancient peoples, maybe it wasn't.

19
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:06.080
I mean,

20
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.980
there's a tradition from ancient Egypt that the God thought both God of wisdom

21
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.150
was the inventor of writing, but we have, we have a taxed in which he is,

22
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.930
he is questioned by a Pharaoh who is, who is saying, well, actually,

23
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:20.600
have you really done a good thing by introducing writing?

24
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:25.220
Because then the words may roam around the world without wise advice to put them

25
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:29.120
into, into context and what will happen to memory when people do so,

26
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.460
so there might be a choice not to. Okay.

27
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.241
<v 0>All right. But,</v>

28
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:35.180
but then what do you mean by advanced when you say there used to be a last

29
00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:38.980
advanced civilization before 10,000 years ago, but.

30
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.430
<v 2>Let's just wait, pause here for a second,</v>

31
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.530
because what we know for a fact is that the carbon dating in all the area around

32
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:50.390
Gobekli TAPI is somewhere around 12,000 years, is that 11,600.

33
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.790
<v 1>Years ago, because the earliest they found so far,</v>

34
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:54.890
but a great deal of go back to the tap is still underground.

35
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.810
<v 2>Right? Right. So at least what we know is someone built some pretty impressive</v>

36
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:02.210
structures, 11,600.

37
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.580
<v 1>Years ago, 7,000 years before. So.</v>

38
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.720
<v 0>When, when that story broke, this is long before you came along with your book.</v>

39
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420
Uh,

40
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.130
it was controversial in the sense that we thought hunter gatherers could not do

41
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:14.930
something like this because to do that,

42
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:18.950
you need a large population with a division of labor and so forth.

43
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.940
And so what the response to archeologists was, well,

44
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:24.590
I guess we were wrong about hunter gatherers.

45
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.290
Maybe they can do more stuff than we gave them credit for.

46
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.490
So why is that not a reasonable hypothesis versus they were,

47
00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:32.630
it was actually advanced,

48
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:34.550
but we mean something completely different by advanced,

49
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.600
not rioting and metal and technology. We mean, I don't know what you mean.

50
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:39.770
What do you mean? Well.

51
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.510
<v 1>I mean, we have, we have a body of archeology which goes on for decades,</v>

52
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.780
which is saying that megalithic sites, for example,

53
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.290
[inaudible] in Malta or Hungary, MoMA, nidra, megalithic sites, uh,

54
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.620
date to no older than five and a half to 6,000 years old Gigi tier would push it

55
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.600
close to 6,000 years old. And there are no older sites than that.

56
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.110
And therefore the megalithic site is associated with a certain stage of

57
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.550
neolithic development. Then along comes, got Beckley Tappy,

58
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.020
7,000 years older than Stonehenge, incredibly sophisticated site,

59
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.380
very large scale. I mean, cloud Smith, sadly he's passed away.

60
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.950
I spent three days working the site with them. He was very generous to me.

61
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.240
He showed me a lot. He talked to me a lot and he said basically 50 times,

62
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.870
as much as they've already excavated is still is still under the ground.

63
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.170
That there's hundreds and hundreds of giant stone pillars that they've

64
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:39.010
identified with ground penetrating radar. He's not even sure if they're ever,

65
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.420
if they're ever going to excavate them, but by all accounts, we are looking,

66
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:45.610
if we take, what's still under the ground into account,

67
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:49.690
we're looking at the largest megalithic site that's ever been created on earth.

68
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.430
And it pops up 11,600 years ago with no obvious

69
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:59.110
background to it. It just comes down to me. That's rather well that we know of.

70
00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.951
But to me, that's a,

71
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:02.590
that's immediately a rather puzzling and interesting situation.

72
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:06.760
And I would be remiss as, as an author and an inquire into these matters.

73
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:10.120
If I didn't take great interest in that the sudden appearance,

74
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.100
7,000 years before Stonehenge,

75
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.350
you have a megalithic site that dwarfs Stonehenge to me,

76
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:17.160
that's a mystery and it's really worth inquiring. We love to.

77
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.180
<v 2>Put it into perspective.</v>

78
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.980
That's more than 2000 years older than what we now consider to be the

79
00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:27.090
building of the great pyramid of Giza in comparison to us to then,

80
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.410
so between our time now in 2017 and the construction of the great pyramid,

81
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.660
you're talking about 2000 years earlier than that.

82
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.490
And that is unbelievable when you're talking about 7,000 years before what we

83
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:39.630
thought people were.

84
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.850
<v 0>Okay. But, but my point was that instead of before we go down the road of</v>

85
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.390
constructing a loss civilization that was super advanced,

86
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.460
but different from our idea of advance,

87
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.200
why not just attribute to these fully modern hunter gatherers who had the same

88
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:58.740
size brains we have. And so on that they were able to figure out and do this.

89
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.530
We just under estimated their abilities.

90
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.410
<v 3>Y'all just tell us for so long hunter-gatherers couldn't do it.</v>

91
00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:07.770
And we needed agricultural populations that could generate surpluses that could

92
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:08.160
pay for them.

93
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.410
<v 0>Yeah, actually that was the theory, but that was it.</v>

94
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.570
So now with archeologists are saying, well,

95
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.090
I guess we were wrong about a hunter gatherer.

96
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.560
<v 2>Well, they might be wrong about hunter gatherers,</v>

97
00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:21.330
or there might be another civilization that they had not discovered that is been

98
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:22.470
unearthed by time, but.

99
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.930
<v 3>Not so much time lost.</v>

100
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.200
<v 1>Civilizations are not such an extraordinary idea. I mean,</v>

101
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.610
nobody knew that the Indus valley civilization existed at all until some railway

102
00:05:32.611 --> 00:05:35.430
work was done around ninja Daro. And in 1923,

103
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.760
suddenly a whole civilization pops up out of the woodwork.

104
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.970
That's just never been taken into account before the 1920s.

105
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.080
We still can't read it script. You know, the idea that we,

106
00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:49.440
that we come across that another turn of the spade reveals information that

107
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:53.550
causes us to reconsider, not just was it hunter gatherers or agriculturalists,

108
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.470
but perhaps something bigger than this is involved in that. Not,

109
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.960
that's not such an extraordinary idea. I get it.

110
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.920
That mainstream archeology doesn't want to go there, but that's fine. No, I.

111
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.860
<v 0>Don't. I don't think that that that's correct. They,</v>

112
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.290
they would be happy to go there if there's evidence for it,

113
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.400
by what you just said, they now fully accept the Indus valley civilizations.

114
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.140
How did that happen if they were dogmatically closed-minded and say that they

115
00:06:17.141 --> 00:06:17.260
were.

116
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.420
<v 1>Dogmatically closed minded about that? The evidence,</v>

117
00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:24.070
the massive amount of evidence that came up with the discovery of Mahindra Daro,

118
00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:27.850
her wrapper, dollar Vierra, and other and other such sides. It's very difficult.

119
00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:31.840
You have to be completely stupid to say that that's not a civilization got

120
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.330
Beckley. Tap is a bit more nuanced. You know, we have stone,

121
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.540
we have stone circles. We have some interesting astronomical alignments.

122
00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:40.570
The world's first, perfectly north, south aligned, built, maybe.

123
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.900
<v 3>No, definitely. Again, that's a patternicity thing like clash Smith.</v>

124
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.131
<v 0>Well, that's all right.</v>

125
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:50.020
But if any of us who read back into history 10,000 years ago,

126
00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:53.440
what we're thinking that they might've been thinking that's always a dangerous

127
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:54.670
for anybody, not just.

128
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.130
<v 2>You all. That's a good point. Who's Klaus Schmidt. Classmate.</v>

129
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.320
<v 1>Was the original excavator of Gabelli Tappy.</v>

130
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.600
He was the head of the German archeological Institute.

131
00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:06.220
Dig out to go back to Tappy. He kindly spent three days showing me,

132
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.060
uh,

133
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.710
around the site and really nobody's disputing the astronomical alignments I've

134
00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:13.960
got back. They tell me they weren't particularly interesting to Klaus Schmidt,

135
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.950
but they're there. And.

136
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.290
<v 2>What is the alignment like? How was it established when.</v>

137
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.310
<v 1>You have a perfectly north side, north, south aligned structure,</v>

138
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.190
perfectly north, south to true north, not magnetic north.

139
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.320
Then you are dealing with astronomy by definition.

140
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.510
And there are other alignments of the stones true north.

141
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.920
<v 2>As established today, or with the procession of the Equinox 12.</v>

142
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.110
<v 1>Okay. It's the rotation access of our planet.</v>

143
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.120
<v 2>Okay. So it, to this day,</v>

144
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:39.430
it points exactly in the same place where it was pointing. Oh,

145
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:40.910
it was points the true north. Okay. Yeah.

146
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.540
<v 0>But, but, but back to this, you know, they don't want to go. Sure.</v>

147
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:44.321
They want to go there.

148
00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:47.410
They would happy be happy to go there case in 0.2 weeks ago,

149
00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:50.380
in the journal nature, the most prestigious scientific journal in the world,

150
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.130
there was published an article that humans,

151
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.870
or maybe Neanderthals lived in San Diego area 130,000 years ago.

152
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.920
This is an order of magnitude older than the Clovis date. This.

153
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.230
<v 2>Was the Mastodon bones they found that were supposed.</v>

154
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.140
<v 0>To. So here's an example of how, okay,</v>

155
00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:12.580
so clearly there's not some conspiracy to keep alternative people or fringe or,

156
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.230
or radical theories out.

157
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.410
It was published in peer reviewed the most prestigious journal in the world.

158
00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:20.290
There it is, Tommy. And what happened? Well, wasn't.

159
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.810
<v 1>It, there'd been a massive reaction to that. And lots of,</v>

160
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.510
lots of scathing remarks, lots of academics. And.

161
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.090
<v 0>That's how, but that's normal. That's how science works. You get,</v>

162
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.670
you get pushed back it's you gotta have a thick skin. It's just the way.

163
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.770
<v 1>It goes. You've got to have a thick skin. That's that's for sure.</v>

164
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:36.640
But maybe sometimes your skin is so thick that you just can't sense anything

165
00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:37.110
around.

166
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.410
<v 0>It. Of course we don't want that either.</v>

167
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.700
<v 2>You think is going on. When you look at something like duel, Beckley, Tappy,</v>

168
00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:47.170
that's covered cupboard up purposefully, right? Yes. Deliberately.

169
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.320
<v 1>Buried again. I cite Klaus Smith. He he's the authority on this.</v>

170
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:51.340
He's the excavator.

171
00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:56.340
He absolutely adamantly insists that that site was buried and finally

172
00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:58.620
covered with a hill, which is what got back.

173
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.520
The TAPI means in the Turkish language, potbellied hill. Yeah. And.

174
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.630
<v 2>That you're talking about something.</v>

175
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.510
Give me the perspective of how large they believe it is. Currently.

176
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.760
As of current what's excavated.

177
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.240
<v 1>At the moment is on a scale of Stonehenge. What's under the ground.</v>

178
00:09:11.241 --> 00:09:13.790
Maybe as much as 50 times larger. Jeez.

179
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.100
<v 0>[Inaudible] there no one lived there. There's no tools. There's no. Well,</v>

180
00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:23.210
you're talking about [inaudible] but if it's buried, it should be,

181
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.580
there should be pottery. There's no pottery, no writing,

182
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.830
no articles of clothing, no one lived there.

183
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.840
<v 1>Nobody lived there. So why should they have pottery?</v>

184
00:09:29.841 --> 00:09:31.850
Why should pottery be in the field? But why would they,

185
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.640
why they go along and breaks and pots and stick it in the artificial.

186
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.770
<v 0>Flavors, something they're trash. When they,</v>

187
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.500
something that would indicate it's different,

188
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.340
a different kind of people than what we're used to seeing in the archeological

189
00:09:43.341 --> 00:09:44.900
record. It's just.

190
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.270
<v 1>Rubbish that they poured in. It's just stones in earth.</v>

191
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.800
<v 0>Yeah. In other words, grant for you to gain, uh, support for your theory,</v>

192
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.330
amongst mainstream archeologists,

193
00:09:53.331 --> 00:09:56.930
they want to see positive evidence to overturn the old theory. In other words,

194
00:09:56.931 --> 00:10:01.340
the burden of proof is on the person, challenging the mainstream in every field.

195
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.760
<v 2>There's some proof that the, the,</v>

196
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.960
the mainstream idea of these hunters and gatherers w never had anything in

197
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.470
what the theory was that would indicate these people were capable of building

198
00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:15.830
something, even remotely the size of go Beckley town. Yeah. To me.

199
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.780
<v 0>That's the stunning beauty of this.</v>

200
00:10:17.781 --> 00:10:22.640
Find it overturns ideas of primitive hunter gatherers that could not do this.

201
00:10:22.641 --> 00:10:23.660
Apparently they can.

202
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.450
<v 2>Is that possible? Yes.</v>

203
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.400
<v 0>That's right. So this, I call this somebody else,</v>

204
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.410
the bigotry of low expectations, you know,

205
00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:33.440
it's like we had this kind of low expectations for these hunter gatherers.

206
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.330
Maybe we should jettison that idea.

207
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.290
And in my own other field of the history of religion,

208
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.710
it also threw that off because this apparently was a kind of a spiritual

209
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:44.240
religious that's the wrong word they.

210
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.470
<v 3>Would have used, actually, nobody can, nobody can know that.</v>

211
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.560
<v 0>That's right. So, but if it was,</v>

212
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.250
this is the big national geographic article emphasize that maybe this is the

213
00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:53.540
very first religious,

214
00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:55.940
spiritual temple ever built because they didn't live there.

215
00:10:55.941 --> 00:10:57.290
So they went there for a reason.

216
00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.850
<v 2>Is it also possible that this is signs that civilization was more advanced</v>

217
00:11:01.851 --> 00:11:03.440
12,000 years ago than we thought?

218
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.930
<v 0>Okay. More advanced, what do we, again, what do we mean by.</v>

219
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:10.040
<v 2>Talking about the ability to be, to construct an amazing structure? Okay.</v>

220
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:10.490
How big.

221
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.670
<v 3>Was it like how tall are these stones? Some of them are 20 feet tall.</v>

222
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.940
Some of them with, with, with, uh, astronomical.

223
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.520
<v 1>Alignments, clash Smith called it a center of innovation.</v>

224
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.500
He was intrigued by the way that agriculture emerges around Gobekli Tappy.

225
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.330
At the same time that Gabelli TAPI is, is, is created. I mean,

226
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.980
he went on record with me, perhaps he's not right,

227
00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:34.340
but he went on record with me as saying that was the first agriculture.

228
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.150
These were the people who invented agriculture. Now to me,

229
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.530
the notion that a group of hunter-gatherers wake up one morning and invent

230
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.890
megalithic architecture, the world's largest megalithic site.

231
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.420
And at the same moment, invent agriculture, stretches credulity a bit.

232
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:54.370
And I think I would prefer to propose. And I have that.

233
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:57.730
What we're looking at is evidence of some kind of transfer of technology that

234
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:01.360
people came into that area who had other knowledge, but that was a plate.

235
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:04.510
And perhaps they mobilized the local population around this site,

236
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:07.240
perhaps that's precisely why we see agriculture developing there.

237
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.580
So perhaps that's the skill that's being passed on.

238
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:15.120
<v 0>But, but I don't see anything particularly, okay. The stone work is spectacular,</v>

239
00:12:15.121 --> 00:12:18.870
but that that's not any more advanced than a few centers,

240
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.100
a few millennium afterwards.

241
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.030
<v 2>But you're talking about something 20 feet tall made of stone that we know</v>

242
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.380
people that were hunter gatherers.

243
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.460
<v 0>A couple of hundred people can move multi ton stones, history.</v>

244
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.450
<v 1>And moving the stones still moving 20 ton stones in Indonesia today. I mean,</v>

245
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.250
megalithic culture, you also know.

246
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.640
<v 2>That the carving on the outside is extremely complex is three-dimensional</v>

247
00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:42.390
carving. Okay. But I mean, you know, that means, do you know what that means?

248
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.680
<v 0>Let's go at 30,000 years ago has magnificent cave paintings with three</v>

249
00:12:46.681 --> 00:12:48.000
dimensions, but.

250
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.300
<v 2>That's painting. You know, that, hold on a second. Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

251
00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:53.910
When I say three-dimensional carvings, the Venus,

252
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.200
the carvings were on the outside, meaning they didn't carve them into the rock.

253
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.090
They carved away the rock around them,

254
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.090
which is pretty sophisticated stuff for hunter gatherers.

255
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.560
And they're doing this on these 20 foot tall stone columns. I mean,

256
00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:08.790
it's pretty impressive stuff.

257
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.620
<v 0>Okay. But th there, the assumption is that,</v>

258
00:13:10.621 --> 00:13:12.090
that they couldn't have figured this out.

259
00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:17.070
We know from modern societies where say Australian Aborigines,

260
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.300
uh, in one generation, they go from stone tools to fly in airplanes.

261
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.600
The brains are quite capable of doing these amazing things.

262
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.410
[inaudible].

263
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.240
<v 1>Planes, without somebody introducing them to airplanes.</v>

264
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.670
<v 2>You're actually making his argument for them. No, no.</v>

265
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.690
<v 0>It's not that much of a reach to carve stone.</v>

266
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.530
People have been carving stones for that, the entire archeological.

267
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.820
<v 1>Opinion on megalithic sites for decades before this was precisely that it was</v>

268
00:13:44.821 --> 00:13:45.654
beyond their ability.

269
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.110
<v 0>And now the mainstream has changed. It's fine. Let's,</v>

270
00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:51.240
let's start at the very least we'll shift.

271
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.960
<v 2>Let's pause for a moment. Let's pause for a moment. So for sure,</v>

272
00:13:54.961 --> 00:13:58.110
we all agree human beings made this. Yes.

273
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:04.050
Even so the object, so the argument is not whether or not aliens made it.

274
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.970
The argument is whether or not humans made it that we're sophisticated.

275
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:14.430
Well, they're clearly sophisticated enough to make this incredible structure

276
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.110
that is,

277
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:21.150
is some sign of some sort of civilization. I believe so. Yeah,

278
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.910
it is. It's a gigantic structure. I.

279
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.450
<v 0>Agree with Graham that we we've, again, undersold who these people were.</v>

280
00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:30.720
My friend, Jared diamond goes to Papa, new Guinea. He talks at the,

281
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.880
in the opening chapter of guns, germs, and steel,

282
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.050
how smart these people are that live out there in nature and what it takes to

283
00:14:37.051 --> 00:14:39.840
survive. He wouldn't last an hour, you know,

284
00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:43.530
from LA he wouldn't last an hour with his pop into Guinea and friends out there

285
00:14:43.531 --> 00:14:45.430
in the, in the wild well that's.

286
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.310
<v 2>Because he doesn't know how to survive.</v>

287
00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:51.210
And they've been passing down the information for generation after generation

288
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.100
smart.

289
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.970
<v 0>Okay. So it's not a word, it's not a problem of intelligence. And is there, uh,</v>

290
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.181
okay.

291
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:59.090
So here's the other thing we don't know is that there might be lots more of

292
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:02.350
these sites and where there's the jar. I visited.

293
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.970
<v 1>One of them, Cara and taffy. You've got,</v>

294
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.730
you've got the T-shaped pillars sticking out the side of a hill in the farmers'

295
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.140
backyard. I mean,

296
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.980
I think we're actually at the beginning of opening up this inquiry,

297
00:15:11.981 --> 00:15:13.480
not at the end of it, but, but.

298
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.140
<v 0>Then it'd be before you. Okay. Why not just say, we don't know,</v>

299
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.260
this is a spectacular mystery. You leave it at that. Right? Why write a book.

300
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.300
<v 3>That says I'm going to fill in all the gaps.</v>

301
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.660
<v 1>On the mainstream side, won't speculate and word explore.</v>

302
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.110
I don't claim to be an archeologist. I'm not a scientist. I'm an author.

303
00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.950
It's my job to offer an alternative point of view and to offer a coherently

304
00:15:32.951 --> 00:15:34.840
argued, alternative point of view. And I must say,

305
00:15:34.841 --> 00:15:39.430
go Beckley TAPI strikes me as a gigantic mystery and a

306
00:15:39.431 --> 00:15:44.350
mystery that is worthy of exploration from a point of view that may

307
00:15:44.351 --> 00:15:47.830
not satisfy you. Oh, well, it doesn't, you don't have to satisfy me.

308
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.450
You and your, you and your colleagues. And I don't, I don't,

309
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.380
I certainly don't have to satisfy you or them. That's not my project.

310
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:57.490
<v 0>Like your opening chapter with Schmidt. I thought I really loved the, um, the,</v>

311
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.000
the kind of conversational style you had with Schmidt in the book where he's

312
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:05.140
dialoguing, where Schmidt goes and look at this. And then he says, but, but,

313
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.080
but what, wait, what's that again? Now he's like a little bit like Colombo,

314
00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:10.600
like what, wait, I have just one more quick, just one more question.

315
00:16:10.601 --> 00:16:14.170
And you know, the mystery kind of thickens. That's perfectly. Okay.

316
00:16:14.171 --> 00:16:15.250
That's great. I mean, that's,

317
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.970
that's what science is all about is uncovering mysteries that we then have to

318
00:16:18.971 --> 00:16:20.890
figure out. So there's always more mysteries,

319
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.230
but that doesn't mean that's not positive.

320
00:16:23.231 --> 00:16:26.920
And it's in favor of a particular theory, like a loss civilization. It's just,

321
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.530
we can't explain this full stop.

322
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.900
<v 2>Yeah, we certainly can't explain it.</v>

323
00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:35.560
And you can explain it by saying that we underestimated hunter and gatherers

324
00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:36.394
either.

325
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.940
<v 0>Well, why not? We know they made it whatever you want to call them. Well,</v>

326
00:16:39.941 --> 00:16:42.190
we know humans made it that's right. We know humans made it.

327
00:16:42.191 --> 00:16:42.820
So whenever you want.

328
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.220
<v 2>To, why,</v>

329
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.260
but why do they believe that people were only hunters and gatherers 12,000 years

330
00:16:47.261 --> 00:16:49.960
ago? It's because they didn't have any evidence. The contract, right?

331
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.820
This is evidence to the contrary. I agree.

332
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.330
So you agree that there weren't hovering hunter and gatherers.

333
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:59.200
<v 0>Okay. But there's, there's several stages in between just, you know,</v>

334
00:16:59.201 --> 00:17:03.070
12 people living out in the jungle by themselves versus us. You know,

335
00:17:03.071 --> 00:17:04.390
there's like a whole bunch of different.

336
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:09.070
<v 2>I would say that go, Beckley TAPI is a gigantic age. Well.</v>

337
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:13.000
<v 0>We don't okay. They didn't live there. So we have to figure out what, where,</v>

338
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:16.570
where were they living and what was there? So that, that has to be excavated.

339
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.590
Well, they only excavated 10%.

340
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.541
<v 1>Meanwhile,</v>

341
00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:22.180
what you're saying is that we shouldn't speculate at all because I mean,

342
00:17:22.181 --> 00:17:22.570
mainstream.

343
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.810
<v 3>Archeology speculating, archeologist speculating.</v>

344
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.450
<v 1>When saying it's definitely was hunter gatherers who did this,</v>

345
00:17:28.451 --> 00:17:29.530
that's also a speculation.

346
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.880
<v 0>Okay. But not okay. It may, they may be more than hunter gatherers. They,</v>

347
00:17:34.881 --> 00:17:38.440
they may have been partially settled there's you can have any kind of number of

348
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.450
state you can't apparently have is.

349
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.510
<v 1>The possibility of a transfer of technology from people who are really masters</v>

350
00:17:43.511 --> 00:17:46.270
of that technology already when they came in. But where are these people?

351
00:17:46.271 --> 00:17:50.140
Whereas when you're dealing with 12,000 years ago,

352
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.740
fingerprints now let's find their homes. I don't know.

353
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.360
I don't know that their homes matter,

354
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:56.850
would their homes even survive after 12,000 years?

355
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.810
<v 3>I'm not sure, but what survives, there's something, what.</v>

356
00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.980
<v 1>Would be trash and tools we've got go Beckley Tappy. It confronts us.</v>

357
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.410
It challenges the mainstream model.

358
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.820
I think it's reasonable to consider the possibility that there was something

359
00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:15.060
more than just hunter-gatherers involved here in creating this extraordinary

360
00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:17.250
place. But that's all I've done.

361
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.470
<v 2>It seems to me that too, to say hunter gatherers could build this.</v>

362
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.780
I'm not, I wouldn't be opposed to the idea that they're hunting and gathering,

363
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.430
but it does certainly imply a lot of leisure time. Yes. A lot of leisure.

364
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.130
<v 0>Time. We know a hundred yet. Sorry. That's okay. Let's see.</v>

365
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.550
<v 2>Well, again, if we place this back,</v>

366
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:42.380
particularly within that climate zone at 11,006 to 12,000,

367
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.900
13,000 years ago, whatever it turns out to be,

368
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:50.180
we're dealing with an extremely demanding and challenging climate, which,

369
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.760
which wouldn't necessarily to my mind,

370
00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.710
be conducive to the emergence of a settled culture that

371
00:18:57.711 --> 00:19:01.010
would be capable of undertaking a project on this scale.

372
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.970
And as somebody who's built a lot of things and moved quite a few heavyweights

373
00:19:04.971 --> 00:19:08.770
in my time, um, I find it just the,

374
00:19:08.771 --> 00:19:13.710
the idea sort of perplexing to me that they would be w

375
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:16.250
what I, what I would have to ask is what is their motive?

376
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.610
What is their motive for undertaking a project on this scale?

377
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.650
Because it's an enormous project.

378
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:26.960
And to move a 20 ton block of stone is really a challenging

379
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.850
task to undertake today today. Well, without, without, you know, uh,

380
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.010
you know, the infrastructure of, of,

381
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.850
of large machines and so forth, um,

382
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.010
but to do it by hand, it would be an enormous undertaking. And, and I,

383
00:19:43.011 --> 00:19:44.360
you know, to me, it's like,

384
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.410
when are they having time to hunt and gather when you're engaged in a project of

385
00:19:48.411 --> 00:19:49.244
this scale.

386
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.880
<v 0>But we know hunter-gatherers have way more free time than modern society people</v>

387
00:19:52.881 --> 00:19:54.710
do. That's the one thing we've learned is that it's,

388
00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.140
it's a pretty good way to make a living. Actually, they have a better,

389
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.590
very diet than we have. This is the, you know, the Neanderthal diet, right?

390
00:20:00.591 --> 00:20:04.040
They have a better, very diet and a lot more free time. Yeah. But that's.

391
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:06.920
<v 3>A lot less stress. We knew that all along.</v>

392
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.850
<v 1>About hunter gatherers,</v>

393
00:20:07.851 --> 00:20:10.880
when we were saying they couldn't build megalithic sites, but we're, we're,

394
00:20:10.881 --> 00:20:12.620
we're looking at time to do it.

395
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.640
<v 2>We're we're the environment is undergoing rapid changes to which</v>

396
00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.550
adaptations would be extremely challenging.

397
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.640
And we know those changes are going on all over the planet.

398
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:27.350
We know that sea levels are rapidly rising over a period of a few thousand

399
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:31.880
years from, from a low C stand low of about 400 feet up to the present level.

400
00:20:31.881 --> 00:20:36.620
We also know that that by Otis we're shifting dramatically all over the

401
00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:37.451
planet, they, they,

402
00:20:37.451 --> 00:20:40.550
the effects of the younger Dryas were global pretty much that is,

403
00:20:40.551 --> 00:20:45.230
I think the emerging consensus now that that both hemispheres north and

404
00:20:45.231 --> 00:20:48.160
south were being affected by the climate changes of the younger Dryas.

405
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.290
So what we're doing is replacing this, this phenomena, this, this project,

406
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:58.270
within this context of these extremely challenging times in which, you know,

407
00:20:58.271 --> 00:21:02.860
adaptation to the environmental changes could easily be the,

408
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:06.160
the all consuming challenge of the times.

409
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.860
I'm just finding it difficult to imagine it, a disconnect to,

410
00:21:10.861 --> 00:21:14.890
to see this disconnect between a project of this magnitude

411
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:19.240
and the motive for doing it during a time when

412
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.760
obviously the environment could be posing serious constraints upon

413
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:26.710
people's ability to function in that.

414
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.840
<v 0>Right. Random, we don't even know the motives of the Easter Islanders.</v>

415
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.620
We don't re raise these huge, but we know they did it, but.

416
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.760
<v 2>Isn't that become a central question? No. What something had to have motivated,</v>

417
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:43.220
but then let's get back to tobacco tippy. So we, so let's just be real clear.

418
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.590
We know that we're humans, we know that it's at least 12,000 years old,

419
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.920
and we know that the real dispute here, the real question is,

420
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.620
did these people have structures? And did they have agriculture?

421
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.220
We know that they were human beings. They were essentially modern human beings.

422
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.100
So, or they hunter gatherers, or did they have structures? Yeah.

423
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:00.263
Before I got exactly.

424
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:00.301
<v 1>Tappy,</v>

425
00:22:00.301 --> 00:22:03.210
they didn't have structures and they didn't have agriculture after going back a

426
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.313
Tappy. They did.

427
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.070
<v 2>The fact that they were able to build something so monumental,</v>

428
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.760
what kind of a leap is it at all to think that these people could figure out how

429
00:22:11.761 --> 00:22:14.130
to plant food and figure out how to make a house?

430
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.433
<v 4>Well.</v>

431
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.350
<v 0>I mean, again, if you look back 30,000 years,</v>

432
00:22:19.351 --> 00:22:23.280
40,000 years to these cave paintings, these are pretty sophisticated, beautiful.

433
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.530
Clearly they had abstract reasoning.

434
00:22:25.531 --> 00:22:28.530
They could think from the concrete to the abstract and so on.

435
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.040
It's not a big reach to go from that to moving stones around.

436
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.400
<v 1>I'd say there's a big difference between painting and engraving on cave.</v>

437
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.600
<v 3>Walls. Yeah. [inaudible].</v>

438
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.900
<v 1>Largest megalithic site that's ever been built on earth. Wait a minute.</v>

439
00:22:42.901 --> 00:22:45.120
I think there's a bit huge difference between those two. I mean,

440
00:22:45.121 --> 00:22:47.800
nobody would compare the construction effort on,

441
00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:51.570
on Stonehenge or Gigante or with, with cave paintings. I agree with you,

442
00:22:51.571 --> 00:22:53.490
the cave paintings are magnificent.

443
00:22:53.491 --> 00:22:56.490
I've had the privilege to visit many of the painted cave, stunning work.

444
00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.180
And as Picasso said, when he came out of Alaska, we have invented nothing,

445
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.060
right? I mean, they were this, that was that modern human mind,

446
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.660
symbolic minded work there, but this is another matter.

447
00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:10.350
This is a large scale construction project that's going on.

448
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.780
And it's not just a construction person. That's like huts,

449
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.650
it's hundreds and hundreds of very, very large megalithic pillars,

450
00:23:16.651 --> 00:23:19.410
which have to be mobilized brought to the place, you know,

451
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.350
organizing a workforce, uh, in order to do that.

452
00:23:22.351 --> 00:23:25.680
Even that requires preparation and time and learning and practice.

453
00:23:25.681 --> 00:23:28.320
It's not something that you wake up one morning and just can do overnight.

454
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.500
<v 2>You think that the paintings are more impressive than go Beckley Tappy?</v>

455
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.870
<v 0>Yeah. Or at least comparable.</v>

456
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.140
<v 2>I think that's, I think that's absolutely ridiculous.</v>

457
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.220
<v 0>To convey three dimensionality on a 2d plane.</v>

458
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.490
That that's what Picasso met is like, wow, that's a Crow.

459
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.170
It's like developing perspective and to use the natural shape, it's just,

460
00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.310
but it's not create a three-dimensional perspective. Look, is it,

461
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.900
that's pretty abstract comparing.

462
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.380
<v 3>Apples and pears. It's not a construction project, right? It's it's.</v>

463
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.530
<v 2>Not, I don't think it's parent, but I don't think it's even remotely. No.</v>

464
00:23:59.531 --> 00:24:00.040
What I'm saying.

465
00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.460
<v 0>Is that it doesn't take a huge leap of imagination to take these people were</v>

466
00:24:03.461 --> 00:24:04.480
pretty smart. They had.

467
00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.430
<v 2>It. No, that they were smart. We know what they were smart,</v>

468
00:24:06.431 --> 00:24:09.850
just because of the fact that those construction projects were done by who,

469
00:24:09.851 --> 00:24:12.880
by whoever we know that they were smart, whoever bill go,

470
00:24:12.881 --> 00:24:16.180
Beckley taboo was clearly intelligent. Whoever made those 3d carvings,

471
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.650
clearly they were intelligent.

472
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:22.060
But to think that someone drawing on cave paintings is more impressive.

473
00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:27.670
20 foot stone columns with three dimensional carvings on them of a lot of

474
00:24:27.671 --> 00:24:30.700
animals that weren't even native to the, to the region.

475
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:35.590
That's a debatable cause they could have been animals.

476
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.830
<v 0>But my point Joe is that these paintings are like say 30,</v>

477
00:24:38.831 --> 00:24:40.660
40,000 years old to go Beckley tippy.

478
00:24:40.661 --> 00:24:45.130
So there's tens of thousands of years to develop more that we were

479
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.620
very likely to find more archeological.

480
00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.540
<v 3>Sites up till.</v>

481
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.550
<v 1>Now. We haven't found that we haven't,</v>

482
00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.150
we haven't found all of that intermediate material, which is see if I,

483
00:24:55.151 --> 00:24:58.600
if I could actually see that intermediate material between the upper upper

484
00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:01.200
paleolithic cave art and go back to the TAPI.

485
00:25:01.201 --> 00:25:04.450
If I could see the gradual evolution and development of skills,

486
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.690
I wouldn't need to invoke a lost civilization,

487
00:25:07.691 --> 00:25:09.250
the survivors of a lost civilization.

488
00:25:09.251 --> 00:25:12.160
Who've mastered those skills elsewhere to come in and teach those skills that go

489
00:25:12.161 --> 00:25:15.430
Beckley Tabby. But it still looks to me like a transfer of technology,

490
00:25:15.431 --> 00:25:20.320
unless you can show me that evolutionary process whereby I can understand how

491
00:25:20.321 --> 00:25:24.670
this group of hunter-gatherers became equipped to create this giant site where

492
00:25:24.671 --> 00:25:27.220
they practiced, where they learn the skills to move the stones,

493
00:25:27.221 --> 00:25:28.210
to organize the workforce,

494
00:25:28.211 --> 00:25:30.640
to feed and water the workforce in a rather dry place.

495
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.820
All of that is actually quite a logistical challenge. Yep.

496
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.040
<v 0>And obviously somebody met it somehow.</v>

497
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.430
<v 2>Some humans. Yeah. So the real question is, did they have structures?</v>

498
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.840
Did they have agriculture?

499
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:44.050
Did they have some sort of a community where they lived in this established

500
00:25:44.051 --> 00:25:46.230
location? I would, I would imagine. So would,

501
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.320
that would push back the time where we thought that there was a civilization

502
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.330
that would push them back into a realm of at least stead stepping out of the

503
00:25:55.331 --> 00:25:56.680
hunter gatherer stage.

504
00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.560
<v 0>Schmid as you show in your book, he did not go as far as you know,</v>

505
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.340
but he admitted it's a mystery. Okay. Why that would be the scientific approach?

506
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.080
I don't know what it is. Great mystery. Let's just wait and see. Versus, uh,

507
00:26:11.081 --> 00:26:14.290
I'm going to postulate a lot of civilization, nothing wrong with that grant.

508
00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.830
It's a free country and scientists do this all the time. As,

509
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:18.730
as you've mentioned.

510
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.090
<v 1>A rather humorous thing, which I have to say, actually,</v>

511
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.880
I might even ask Jamie to pull up the, um, the, a couple of images of, uh,

512
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:32.590
fingerprints of the gods. That's the book I'm best known for. Uh, and when I,

513
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:36.610
uh, published fingerprints of the gods in 1995,

514
00:26:36.611 --> 00:26:41.170
essentially I was saying civilization is much older and much more

515
00:26:41.171 --> 00:26:42.400
mysterious than we thought.

516
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:48.240
And I was ridiculed for proposing that 2013.

517
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.340
One of the magazines that ridiculed me,

518
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:54.660
new scientist magazine in Britain publishes as a cover story picture of Rebecca

519
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:59.150
Tappy and the headline civilization is much older and much more mysterious.

520
00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:02.500
<v 0>Sorry. Fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. Fair enough. And, and,</v>

521
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.340
and scientists do do this. I mean,

522
00:27:04.341 --> 00:27:07.310
I've followed paleoanthropology for my whole adult life.

523
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.820
And one of the big mysteries is how did we get a big brain?

524
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.990
How do we get to abstract reasoning from, from say, what chimps can do?

525
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:19.130
<v 2>No one knows the doubling of the human brain size over a period of 2 million</v>

526
00:27:19.131 --> 00:27:20.600
years, right? No one knows.

527
00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:23.930
<v 0>Uh, every couple of years there's a new book out it's climate change.</v>

528
00:27:23.931 --> 00:27:28.130
It was throwing arm, cooking, cooking, meat, you know,

529
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.170
meat is another big one, a Harvard meat. Okay.

530
00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.750
And these books come and go and some of them have legs.

531
00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:36.200
Some of them don't and it's just the way it goes. And then there's Terence.

532
00:27:36.201 --> 00:27:38.390
McKenna was pretty obvious. It was psychedelics. Yeah.

533
00:27:38.391 --> 00:27:39.680
That's Terrence McKenna's.

534
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.710
<v 3>Theory, but that switched the brain. That's.</v>

535
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:46.980
<v 0>The old Julian. Um, the, uh, [inaudible].</v>

536
00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.800
<v 1>Mind. This is David Lewis, Williams.</v>

537
00:27:48.801 --> 00:27:52.820
Who's professor of anthropology at the university of Witwatersrand in South

538
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.480
Africa, his neuropsychological theory of cave art, uh,

539
00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.020
all kudos to Terence McKenna and food of the gods. He,

540
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.020
what a brilliant thinker, what a brilliant alternative thinker,

541
00:28:03.021 --> 00:28:05.960
but David Lewis Williams at the university of Witwatersrand had been working on

542
00:28:05.961 --> 00:28:08.840
this problem since 1973. And his,

543
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.950
his argument is that the remarkable similarities that we see in rock and cave

544
00:28:12.951 --> 00:28:14.750
art all around the world, uh,

545
00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.230
are explained that we're dealing with a shamanistic art shamanism involves

546
00:28:18.231 --> 00:28:19.460
altered states of consciousness.

547
00:28:19.461 --> 00:28:22.280
This is typical visions of altered states of consciousness.

548
00:28:22.281 --> 00:28:25.490
And it seems to have a company, a great leap forward in human behavior.

549
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.240
And you've covered this in your book. I covered it. It's natural as.

550
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:33.260
<v 0>Did, uh, you know, Richard rang them's theory. He's this is a highly regarded,</v>

551
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:39.290
um, scientists at Harvard. So he's the meat eating guy that cooking meat, right?

552
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:41.060
So by cooking the protein,

553
00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.330
that's what gives you the energy to build a huge brain? All right.

554
00:28:44.331 --> 00:28:47.510
So now this guy is starting with 10, 10 pluses on his side,

555
00:28:47.511 --> 00:28:52.370
he's Harvard and already respected. And even so his book was like, eh,

556
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:53.510
maybe probably.

557
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.110
<v 2>A series of different events and a bunch of different factors. That's right.</v>

558
00:28:57.111 --> 00:28:58.100
It could be a number of different things.
