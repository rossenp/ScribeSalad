00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.960
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. I found out about you several years back.</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.640
I, uh, I had heard something about toxelplasmosis. Am I saying that right? Yep.

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.480
Yeah. And I had seen, uh, uh, a speech that you had given on it,

4
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:19.720
where you were talking about how many people had been infected by this cat

5
00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:21.510
parasite. I, I of cats my whole life,

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.470
and I even had feral cats and I've always wondered,

7
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:28.110
like I should probably get tested. And I'm worried about the result, right?

8
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.390
Brad, it's not &lt;laugh&gt;. Well,

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.990
it was just fascinating to me that literally, I mean,

10
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:37.990
what is the number that you estimate in an Americans alone that might have been.

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.140
<v 1>Infected it's on the order of, I'm not sure with Americans,</v>

12
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.300
but worldwide it's something like 50% of humans is the best guess

13
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.380
50%.

14
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.860
<v 0>Of humans worldwide, something on.</v>

15
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.740
<v 1>That scale with, for people.</v>

16
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.580
<v 0>Who've never heard of this,</v>

17
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.500
would you mind explaining what this parasite is and how it affects rats and then

18
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:56.334
cats and then people.

19
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.860
<v 1>Okay. Totally bizarre. So it's this, this protisone parasite, uh,</v>

20
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.610
tox plasma Gandhi, and it's got one of these weird parasitic lifestyles.

21
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.010
The only place on earth where it could reproduce sexually is in the gut of a

22
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:13.970
cat. I don't know why there are people who know this,

23
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.210
but so it reproduces, there comes out in the cat, feces,

24
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.850
feces are eaten by rodents, and now toxos evolution.

25
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
A challenge is to get that rodant into a cat stomach.

26
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.440
So what tox has evolved is this ability,

27
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.560
it slowly migrates to the brain of rodents and

28
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.800
basically wipes out the innate fear that rodnts have of cat

29
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.880
smells like you take a lab rat,

30
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.950
who's be in like the descendant of lab Ratts for like a thousand years.

31
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.430
And they've never seen a cat and put like a little puddle of cat pee in its

32
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:51.830
cage. And the Ratt's gonna go on the other side of the cage,

33
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.430
just hardwired instinctual,

34
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:58.150
aversion to cat pheroones and then put tox in a rat.

35
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.390
And it looses that aversion. And in fact, in a subset of rats,

36
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.620
they like the smell. So out in the natural setting,

37
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.020
you now go and approach a cat and soon the rodents inside the cat' stomach and

38
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.100
tox was completed in its life cycle.

39
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.220
<v 0>Well, I had heard that it was, uh, so it's a subset of rats that,</v>

40
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.300
that actually are gravitated towards it.

41
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:22.820
Cause I'd heard it actually rewires 'em sexually, right? Yes.

42
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.090
<v 1>That that's actually work that we did in my lab,</v>

43
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.850
that it basically crosses some of the circuitry in the brain and the

44
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:31.684
hypothethalamus.

45
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.010
So that cat pheroones that used to be activating every alarm circuit

46
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.170
in your like limbic system and these rodents now instead sort of

47
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.480
taps into sexual arousal path ways. And in male rats,

48
00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:50.880
when they smell cat pheroones they increase testosterone production.

49
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.880
Um, so toxo has just figured out the most brilliant way of doing it.

50
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.880
It makes cat piece smell sexy.

51
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.440
<v 0>Do, is there any understanding.</v>

52
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.560
<v 1>At all of the mechanism of how a parasite can figure out</v>

53
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.280
how to rewire an animal's sexual reward system,

54
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.080
the fear of predators? Like how does that work? Well,

55
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.560
that's something my lab spent a bunch of years on, um,

56
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.230
trying to figure out mean, you look at some of these parasites, this,

57
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:25.230
this taps into this whole world of behavioral manipulation of hosts by

58
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.070
parasites and turns out they've like evolved unbelievably

59
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:34.030
brilliant mechanisms for manipulating hosts for their own benefit. I mean,

60
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.670
think about it. You get rabies, you get a rabbit dog.

61
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.620
And what that's about is a virus that has affected the nervous system of that

62
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.960
dog.

63
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.940
So that it's now rabbit and more likely to bite somebody with viral

64
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.260
particles in its saliva, which it now passes on to the next individual.

65
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.780
Like you take 10,000 neuroscientists and stick 'em in a convention on the

66
00:03:58.781 --> 00:03:59.530
neurobiology,

67
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.050
chief aggression and rabies knows more about the neuro wiringing of aggression

68
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:05.290
than we do. Wow.

69
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.210
And toxo knows quotation marks,

70
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.090
uh, something about fear and aversion and the neurobiology of attraction.

71
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.250
Part of what it seems to involve is toxo.

72
00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:23.920
Somewhere along the away has picked up a gene that is pertinent to the

73
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:27.120
dopamine system in mamals dopamine.

74
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:30.000
Is this neurotransmitter it's about pleasure. Um,

75
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.960
there's no protizo and parasite for billion years,

76
00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:34.840
that's had any use for this stuff,

77
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.120
except it's part of how toxo seems to be manipulating the reward system in

78
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.110
rodents. And then a couple years ago,

79
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:46.710
there's a paper showing that in chimpanzees,

80
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.670
toxo makes you less afraid of the smell of leopards. Wow.

81
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.190
So this appears to be a parasite that just has evolved like this

82
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:01.740
spectacular insight into fear circuitry and attract circuitry.

83
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.420
And it's all for its own benefit to wind up in a catscu. So.

84
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.620
<v 0>It's specifically cats,</v>

85
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.500
like do the chimpanzee still have aversions to snakes and other things that can

86
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:12.334
kill them? Yep.

87
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.280
<v 1>Yeah. Wow.</v>

88
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.260
And at one point my lab was full of like Bobcat key and Wolf P

89
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.570
and it's actually like a company you could buy a urine and for a, um,

90
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.570
I don't know why anyone would want it except for us. Um,

91
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.770
but they sell urine from actually what they use it for is you can go spritzs it

92
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:35.890
around your garden to scare the deer away. They're coming in eating stuff.

93
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.970
So there's, I don't know where they get the urine from, but it's like,

94
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.400
come certifiify all of that. Um, and yeah,

95
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.600
it's remarkably.

96
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.600
<v 0>Specific. So like other,</v>

97
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.320
have they ever done tests where they test like Wolf urine or anything like that

98
00:05:51.321 --> 00:05:54.600
around chimps? Do they have any aversion to that? Um.

99
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.280
<v 1>As far as I know, the Chimp study has only been with big cat urine. Okay.</v>

100
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.000
But the rodent studies exactly that showing it's a fair specificity,

101
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.920
the rodnts lose a little bit of their general skittishness.

102
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.160
Uh, they get a little bit disinhibited behaviorally. So just in general,

103
00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:15.400
they're out more and more exploratory, more likely to get eaten.

104
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.310
But the most selective lasering effect is they're not scared anymore

105
00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:21.470
of cat phones.

106
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.790
<v 0>Now what's fascinating to me is that I've also read that, um,</v>

107
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.110
there was a disproportionate amount of successful soccer teams

108
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.590
that are in countries with high rates of infestation of toxplasma.

109
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.940
<v 1>Okay. That, that one's, that one's new to me. But that,</v>

110
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.020
that sounds like exactly the sort of epidemiological studies that are popping up

111
00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:47.500
about humans. Okay. So what about humans? Um,

112
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.060
there's two branches of interesting stuff with tox and humans.

113
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.460
One is a literature that's been around for quite some time showing that tox

114
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.210
seemed to increase the risk of schizophrenia. Um,

115
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.850
there's a higher rate with schizophrenia of individuals who have

116
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.210
antibodies against tox. In other words, sometime in the past,

117
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.210
their body was dealing with it. Um,

118
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.930
who had cats growing up whose mother had cats during pregnant

119
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.440
and like anybody who gets pregnant knows you immediately get all anxious about

120
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.320
cat litter boxes because of the possibility of toxictopplasmosis.

121
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.560
It can attack the fetal nervous system and do all sorts of damage.

122
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.720
And a subtle version of it seems to be a sleeper effective,

123
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.870
increasing the risk of schizophrenia. Um,

124
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.790
the other realm is toxinfected humans get subtle

125
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.830
changes in personality, neuropsychology sort,

126
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:51.990
neuropsychological profiles. They get a little bit disinhibited. Mm.

127
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.230
If you are tox infected,

128
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.910
you are more likely to die in a car accident involving reckless speed.

129
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.020
If you are toinfected and clinically depressed for the same severity of

130
00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:09.860
depression, you're more likely to impulsively kill yourself. In other words,

131
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.700
to's doing something kind of similar. If you are a rat,

132
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.420
one of the hardest wired,

133
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.180
scary things in the universe out there is the smell of a cat. If you are human,

134
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.930
it's hurling through space,

135
00:08:21.931 --> 00:08:26.690
really fast jumping out of windows and toxo seems

136
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.370
to blunt a lot of those effects there in this.

137
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.850
<v 0>Um, the, the speech that I saw you give you were talking about your time, um,</v>

138
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.010
working in a hospital and that there was a disproportionate amount of motorcycle

139
00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:39.844
victims.

140
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.520
<v 1>This was actually something I heard from a, a clinician, uh, a, uh,</v>

141
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.200
an old, uh, sort of parapsychology infectious disease doctor,

142
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.161
who sort of,

143
00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:54.240
when I was first telling him about this sort of the merchant toxic story,

144
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.120
he had like one of these bolts of memory saying, my God.

145
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.560
I remember back when I was a resident, there was this old doctor saying,

146
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.280
you know, if you're ever harvesting organs from an accident victim,

147
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.920
I don't know why. I don't know why,

148
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.040
but if it's from somebody who was in a motorcycle accident,

149
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.550
make sure you check to see if they have toxics a plasmosis. I don't know why,

150
00:09:16.551 --> 00:09:18.070
but there's a high rate of that,

151
00:09:18.071 --> 00:09:22.510
that you find in organs from people who were killed driving

152
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.453
motorcycles,

153
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.430
recklessly totally anecdotal and equals one kind of thing.

154
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:29.790
But nonetheless, this,

155
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:33.990
this was a guy who like studies infectious disease and toxplasmosis,

156
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.500
and had not heard about sort of the behavioral findings before. And that, uh,

157
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.020
how are the recesses of his memory? So what initially seemed like, okay,

158
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.940
this is a parasite that's very selectively developed this life cycle between

159
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.860
cat stomachs and rodent brains and completing its life cycle

160
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.930
and weird wanting to gets into humans that have some behavioral effects. Also,

161
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.170
that's just kind of evolutionary spillover,

162
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:05.290
but then you see if it's doing something similar between chimps and leopards,

163
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:06.540
uh,

164
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.370
suggesting that that life cycle manipulation has been selected for in

165
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.410
primates as well. Very strange. It's very strange.

166
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:16.681
And for me,

167
00:10:16.681 --> 00:10:21.320
the strangest thing is the certainty with which there's a gazillion

168
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.440
viruses and bacteria,

169
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.240
and God knows what else out there that manipulate host behavior in ways

170
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.120
we just haven't figured out yet. Or we just haven't. Right.

171
00:10:31.121 --> 00:10:33.760
We haven't discovered the particular. Yeah. Uh,

172
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:39.190
what is it due to women of a similar effect seems to

173
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.750
have less severe effects on neuropsychological profiles of women.

174
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.070
Um, again, the literature on this is pretty scanty in humans,

175
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.270
but it seems to have some similar effects, but not as extreme. However,

176
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.310
this story now gets a little bit more complicated and this is actually this

177
00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.220
fabulous scientist, Aja vis, uh, who's my postdoc.

178
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:05.420
Who's now a professor in Singapore. Who's continued to study this. Okay.

179
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.860
So normally one of the things animals have evolved to be really

180
00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.340
good at is picking up signals that somebody else is unhealthy.

181
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:20.130
Like a potential mate is unhealthy there's sickness behavior.

182
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.690
There's very oldfactory cues. If you're roddent makes perfect sense.

183
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.290
The last thing you want to do is to be mating with somebody who's like ransod

184
00:11:29.291 --> 00:11:33.050
and infectious, um, and rodent equivalents of STDs.

185
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:38.010
So normally sick animals, parasite infected animals and such, uh,

186
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.200
are detected by other rodents and avoided

187
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.560
tox does something different.

188
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.840
You get a toxinfected male and now he smells more

189
00:11:49.841 --> 00:11:51.760
attractive to female rodents.

190
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.360
And when mating tox gets into the sperm and be,

191
00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.640
can be transmitted to the female. Whoa, so suddenly we've got a different story.

192
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.020
Here.

193
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.000
We start off with a parasite story where tox is just ruthlessly exploiting

194
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.360
the poorer rodents for its own like reproductive benefit and its own

195
00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:16.190
evolutionary selfish gene will be benknown instead it's got

196
00:12:16.191 --> 00:12:16.751
elements of,

197
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:21.630
instead of parasiteism symbbiosis so you're a male

198
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.870
rat infected with toxo downside.

199
00:12:24.871 --> 00:12:27.790
You're more likely to get eaten by a cat upside.

200
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:31.230
You're more likely to pass on copies of your genes by increased sexual

201
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:36.180
selection. So, so it might be in fact, more of a balanced,

202
00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.580
uh, symbiotic relationship between male rats and to, so,

203
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.620
you know, more research is needed, blah, blah.

204
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:49.500
It's just like cool sort of biology out there. It's crazy.

205
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.380
<v 0>And is it, is it transferred sexually with men and women too? As well as with.</v>

206
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.250
<v 1>I don't know. I don't think it's been looked at oh.</v>

207
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.450
<v 0>Wow. That seems like something I would want to look at right away. &lt;laugh&gt; yes.</v>

208
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.810
What about, um, organ donors?

209
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.090
<v 1>Um, other than again,</v>

210
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.810
pure anecdotalism that one elderly doc somewhere back when

211
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.840
saying watch it when you're getting organs from like people kill and motorcycle

212
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.840
accidents beyond that. I don't know. I mean, people are looking at it I'm sure.

213
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.120
But.

214
00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.160
<v 0>Do they even test like say if you got a liver and you know,</v>

215
00:13:23.161 --> 00:13:26.080
like you needed a liver transplant, would they test, I suspect.

216
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.960
<v 1>They do.</v>

217
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.040
And sort of in the clinical world of people who worry about to talk

218
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.063
pregnancy,

219
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.830
scary alarm going off to anything else after an acute period of infection,

220
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.510
you have a latent, toxic plasma infection. In other words,

221
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.510
the agreed upon sort of notion there is to has gone latent.

222
00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.990
It's formed sort of these cysts that are in, um,

223
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:56.540
and you got nothing to worry about then, but the whole notion that meanwhile,

224
00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.500
up in the nervous system there's effects happening there. You know,

225
00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:01.500
infectious disease,

226
00:14:01.501 --> 00:14:06.460
people are thinking about inflammation outside in the body, there for them,

227
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.900
chronic toxic infection is not something you worry about a whole lot,

228
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.140
but if it's, um, having behavioral effects up there in the nervous system,

229
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.890
it is something to worry about. Well, it's.

230
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.770
<v 0>Just, it it's, to me, it's unfathomable how this little thing figures out,</v>

231
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.850
how to hijack a, a whole, a whole body,

232
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.970
a whole biological system and work it to its own desires.

233
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.010
Just, it's very, it's very hard for me to grasp where.

234
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.440
<v 1>Know if you think of it in terms of, oh, I don't know.</v>

235
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.440
Talk has had like a hundred thousand more

236
00:14:45.441 --> 00:14:50.320
generations to evolve its ways of exploiting mammals than mamals have

237
00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:52.720
had ways of fighting it off. Um,

238
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.960
what's most remarkable is it turns out this is like a whole world of parasites

239
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:59.800
that do bizarre manipulative of things to their hosts.

240
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.560
Most of it's not in the realm of,

241
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:06.000
of mammals instead there's like some parasitic,

242
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:11.110
something or other that gets into barnacles and takes over their productive

243
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.750
system so that the barnacle digs a hole for them,

244
00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.550
them not the barnacle,

245
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:21.430
but the parasite to lay eggs into there's, you know,

246
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:22.420
the aquatic worm.

247
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.190
<v 0>That infects the grasshopper makes it commit suicide. Exactly.</v>

248
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.550
<v 1>That one's bizarre that one's bizarre.</v>

249
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.060
There's this wasp that gets into Cocker roaches into nervous.

250
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.940
It &lt;laugh&gt; see you, you.

251
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.660
<v 0>Know, about I'm fascinated by parasites beyond, but it's just,</v>

252
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.140
it's so confusing to me how something, I mean,

253
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.220
obviously you're dealing with hundreds of thousands of generations for it to get

254
00:15:45.221 --> 00:15:47.540
to this, this current state,

255
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.130
but like how something evolves to be so effective. Yeah. It's just,

256
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.890
it's so confusing.

257
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.690
<v 1>It's remarkable.</v>
