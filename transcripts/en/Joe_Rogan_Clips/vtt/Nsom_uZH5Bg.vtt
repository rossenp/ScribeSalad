00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.160
<v 2>There was a thing about golfers. I was like, these guys, you know,</v>

3
00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:07.840
obviously are very good at what they do,

4
00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.880
but they don't look like regular athletes.

5
00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:12.080
Like what if our regular athletes started playing.

6
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.040
<v 1>Golf? I think that was what tiger did. Yeah, exactly. Tiger. Tiger.</v>

7
00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:18.200
Changed the game on so many levels. He made golf an event.

8
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.430
I would watch golf with my dad on the, and we'd watch tiger play.

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.590
I gotta say this too though, is that tiger was so powerful.

10
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.630
He had so much torque that that's why he is having back problems now.

11
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.670
And so you wonder with guy like Bryon, by the way,

12
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:36.270
Bryon just lost a bunch of weight. He looks amazing. This is a video.

13
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.390
<v 0>Is this Australia when they're attacking the police,</v>

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.780
this is what tiger blocking the looks the same all almost. But yeah,

15
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:44.380
when he was walking up 18, the people were going so nuts.

16
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:46.060
That what kind of security is this? This is.

17
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.980
They tried what's that guy behind him with his arms out pitch.

18
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.233
Put your arms down,

19
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.100
this 40,000 people and one guy they're famous all drunk and they're all

20
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:54.934
hammered.

21
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.540
<v 1>And you gotta remember, he was luckily.</v>

22
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.380
<v 0>They're golf people, right? Oh, golf.</v>

23
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.213
<v 1>People move.</v>

24
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.970
<v 0>That doesn't mean much. Yeah. Golf, savages Domino's fans.</v>

25
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.130
Cause they're mostly just drunk guys. See.

26
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.250
<v 1>You got so, so rugby fans, John Daley came in first. John Daley came in first.</v>

27
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.930
He came in, in his amateur, in the us open. Correct?

28
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.050
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and came in and started hitting these monster drives like 3

29
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.650
50, 3 75 and everyone route. And he had a mullet. He was like Theo Von, but,

30
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.320
and blonde, right? God, man. He is.

31
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.240
<v 0>A with cigarette in his mouth. Look at this mother's cigarette.</v>

32
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.073
<v 1>In his mouth.</v>

33
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.800
<v 0>Dang. A real.</v>

34
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.800
<v 1>Gangster in golf. I mean, when you say, when we.</v>

35
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.800
<v 0>From Florida, cuz if he's not, I'll be depressed Oklahoma. Close enough.</v>

36
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.800
If you say yeah.

37
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.600
<v 1>If you say hero, that's one of my heroes right there. Right?</v>

38
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.440
So John Daley comes in,

44
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.750
All the way over all the way over. Yeah, no right there. Right above that one.

45
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.860
Oh my bad. Sorry back. Yeah. With the goofy, that one. That is, that is, that is

46
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.860
&lt;laugh&gt; look at that smile in Florida face God. And he was,

47
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.180
he was denied his true birthright of Florida. Dude, someone up,

48
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.020
you should have been born in.

49
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.300
<v 1>Florida. Someone came a sponsor, came to him and said 3 million. We want,</v>

50
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:22.340
we want send you to rehab though. And, and he looked at him and said, I'm good.

51
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.090
And took a dude. Can I tell you Joe,

52
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.010
when I say so TPC 1997, he's in, uh,

53
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.530
in St. Augustine, right? I think he went into rehab right after this.

54
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:34.364
If I'm not mistaken.

55
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.210
<v 0>Right. Should have taken the money. No.</v>

56
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.250
<v 1>It's timing. 1997. I'm about to come out and rolling.</v>

57
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.570
Stone is the number one party I in the country and we are in St. Augustine,

58
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.760
our balls off and John Daley's at a bar and we.

59
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.440
<v 0>Just see him, you there, you saw him where the bar.</v>

60
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.240
<v 1>And, and we were like, Hey man.</v>

61
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.160
<v 0>Daley seen drinking on night before he withdrew. We were.</v>

62
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.320
<v 1>There. We were, we, I almost jumped in that on, on a whole 17 naked.</v>

63
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.640
I almost jumped in. It was, thank.

64
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.560
<v 0>God. I didn't wait a minute.</v>

65
00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:06.200
So you are there drinking with John Daley the night before he withdraws.

66
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.520
<v 1>The night of event, the night, he's at a beach too drunk in St.</v>

67
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.760
A in Jacksonville. I, I remember we were pretty, we were pretty drunk also.

68
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.920
Jack's beach Jack's beach. And, uh, but the tournaments in St. Augustine,

69
00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:19.830
if I'm not mistaken and we all went out to see that,

70
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.830
and John Daley's there and every remember buddies hit me like that's John Daley.

71
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.390
And he, and all I remember outta that whole night was he was,

72
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.310
and I know that he withdrew the next day, but he was so accessible.

73
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:35.150
He was so nice. He was not being an. He was having fun.

74
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.590
He was having a good time. And he was a professional athlete.

75
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.820
And I remember thinking everyone. And I was like, I was like,

76
00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:42.860
that's the guy I want to be like, that's the guy.

77
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.460
<v 0>He says right here. He kept the crowd going. O'Neil said it was obvious.</v>

78
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.940
He was there to have a good time. By the time he left,

79
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.700
he definitely was feeling very little pain. &lt;laugh&gt;.

80
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.290
<v 1>This guy, man, this guy is he, he was like,</v>

81
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.490
I would go to golf tournaments with my dad to watch this guy play. Cause wow.

82
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.810
Because he would come in. I mean, he knows a little touchy go.

83
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.050
Sometimes he'd be a little shaky, you know?

84
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.370
Cause he hammered hammered the night before and sometimes he just destroy and it

85
00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:18.330
was nothing more fun to watch him. Just, do you think.

86
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.730
<v 0>That influenced your future choices?</v>

87
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.160
<v 1>100%. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean a hundred. My, you know why this is.</v>

88
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.380
<v 0>Funny.</v>

89
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.920
Do you know the story about you and Tom when you were playing tennis against

90
00:04:27.921 --> 00:04:28.760
each other? No.

91
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.823
<v 1>Wait, why.</v>

92
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.960
<v 0>Tom hired a coach. Oh.</v>

93
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.240
And Tom worked with his coach and he was practicing with this coach.

94
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.030
And the coach said, listen, you got your fundamentals down.

95
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.070
You're doing great. He goes, this guy's drinking all night. He's like,

96
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.630
unless he's some sort of John daily type dude and Tom goes, no, no, no.

97
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.190
He's exactly a John da type dude. He goes, then the coach goes, oh.

98
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.620
And then you showed up with a somewhere outta nowhere.

99
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.180
See we get video of this. The, the, the tennis match.

100
00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:11.860
It's gotta be online outta nowhere. You got a legit division.

101
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.780
One serve like whos. The fun saw this coming.

102
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.420
Burke Chrysler has a legit division,

103
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.420
one tennis serve.

104
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.690
And you just smoked those balls past Tommy buns. Oh my God.

105
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:27.770
He was in such.

106
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.130
<v 1>Agony. Oh, he was so bummed out. He was so sad.</v>

107
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
I remember his son showed up and they made him leave early.

108
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.170
Cause he didn't want his son to see it. Did you.

109
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.090
<v 0>At any point in time, think of yelling out to him,</v>

110
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:39.010
you should have stuck to the dance off?

111
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.560
<v 1>No, no, dude. I remember were watching him not be able to return.</v>

112
00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:45.640
It was like awkward. Like it wasn't,

113
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:47.200
it wasn't even hitting the strings on his rack.

114
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.720
It would hit the handle and shoot up in the air. You have a six serve.

115
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.680
<v 0>It's crazy. It's crazy. Like if you develop that thing,</v>

116
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:57.320
like some dudes are just really good at shooting three pointers, you know,

117
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:01.320
there's like guys just have this touch and you watch them doing like, what the?
