00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well, there's one thing that Bob talked about from,</v>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.420
uh, some of the,

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.560
the documents that he had been given when he was working at [inaudible] was that

4
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:15.060
they had actually taken apart in engineering, human beings.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.780
And that is to me, like, if you,

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.710
if you wanted to say, like, what's, what's the thing,

7
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:25.770
that's going to get people to roll their eyes the most. Well, you would say,

8
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:29.400
well that the aliens came down here and they, they, they,

9
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.480
they got ahold of the lower hominids and they accelerated the evolutionary

10
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:35.940
process and they created human beings. People,

11
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.960
a lot of people go get the out of here. That's crazy. But if you look at people,

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.700
one of the weird things about people's how much we vary, we're so different.

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.370
Like not like any other animal,

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.170
like other than dogs and dogs are the way they are, because we've with them.

15
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.210
Cause we've manipulated them. Uh, we are the dogs of the rest of the world.

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.740
You know what I mean? If you really think about it,

17
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.310
we're so different than every other primate.

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.110
There's not even anything close to us.

19
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.760
And I know there were some other human species, you know, was the,

20
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.730
how did he say it? [inaudible] right.

21
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:16.200
There's Neanderthals homo floresiensis, which was those little Hobbit.

22
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.150
People did a bit, a bunch of other humanoids,

23
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.530
but nothing that came close to what we are.

24
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.460
And if you look at ancient, uh,

25
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.590
ancient primates and us,

26
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.670
the leap between them and us is so quick,

27
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.640
the doubling of the human brain size over a period of 2 million years,

28
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.790
it's just bonkers. Like they don't know why they don't know what happened.

29
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.020
They have no idea. But if, if that really is what happened,

30
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.850
if they said, listen, they're going to get there, but we can help. Like,

31
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.250
what is it? Let's just jump in. Cause these things like, look,

32
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:53.370
chimps are still chimps, right? They're still murdering each other.

33
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.370
There's still tearing monkeys apart and eating them alive.

34
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.370
They're they're still doing the same things they've been doing for thousands and

35
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:03.930
thousands of years. Whereas we're living in condominiums and watching cable,

36
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.800
you know, it's like whatever has happened to humans has happened.

37
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.690
So the, the, the, the advancement is so unique.

38
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.180
It's so different than any other animal.

39
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.040
If we really have been visited since the beginning of time, since history,

40
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:24.450
if all those biblical stories and all the stories from the Bhagavad

41
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.430
Gita and all these ancient texts that do talk about vimanas and flying

42
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:33.000
crafts and beings that come down from upon high,

43
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.860
if all that really is aliens intervening

44
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.760
with the biological evolution of human beings,

45
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.830
how weird or way, you know, I mean, if you think about how weird we are,

46
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:47.611
period, I mean,

47
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:52.110
maybe that would kind of explain it that we're some stupid science experiment.

48
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.320
<v 1>Well, you know, people say, I want disclosure. I want to know we're ready.</v>

49
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:01.360
We can handle it. Are you sure you can handle the truth? I mean,

50
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.320
are you sure you can handle it because we don't know exactly what it is that can

51
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:08.560
be disclosed, but what if it turns out that we're an agricultural product,

52
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.310
you know,

53
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.180
that we are being harvested for something or we're being allowed to breed and

54
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:16.540
kind of science experiment, let's see where this goes.

55
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.730
And then when it's time to end the experiment, I mean,

56
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.520
I'm not sure people can handle it, look at how they've handled COVID.

57
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.420
<v 0>Well, if you would think about if,</v>

58
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.040
if aliens coming down and interfering with weapon systems and

59
00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:32.430
interfering with nuclear launch codes and things along those lines,

60
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.470
like if you think about the uptick in alien

61
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.100
sightings and activity posts, Hiroshima, Nagasaki,

62
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.940
that would kind of make sense, like, all right, these Dick heads,

63
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.990
they've gotten to a point where they can do some really crazy and they literally

64
00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:51.630
might ruin this whole thing. They figured out how to light the match.

65
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.590
Like if you, if you take this, uh, primate,

66
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.270
this animal and you embed it with the

67
00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:03.540
superior, or at least, uh, more, uh, evolutionary,

68
00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:05.640
advanced genetics,

69
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.540
and you manipulate it to a point where you make it weaker, but smarter,

70
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.640
far more curious and obsessed with innovation, we can just leave it there. Well,

71
00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:18.960
it's just a matter of time. Like how much is that time? Is it a thousand years?

72
00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:22.230
Is it 10,000 years over time? They're going to figure out some crazy.

73
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.540
Cause they're just going to keep working together like they do. And then boom,

74
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.100
bombs go off and they're like, all right,

75
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.080
we got to signal these crazy the figured out how to split the

76
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:38.250
atom. We got to get down there and, and keep a closer on these people.

77
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.130
<v 2>But into that possibility of that being the case, I mean,</v>

78
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.630
it's the craziest idea. No, there's crazy ones being put out today. The big.

79
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.440
<v 0>Bang is the craziest idea. We've all agree on that. That's the craziest thing.</v>

80
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:52.410
The whole universe came out of nothing smaller than the head of a pin

81
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.680
instantaneously creates everything you've seen in the night sky. Okay.

82
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.960
<v 1>The technology that shows up that may be reverse engineered or craft or bits and</v>

83
00:05:00.961 --> 00:05:05.610
pieces, you know, I, I sometimes equate it with, let's throw us we're aliens.

84
00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:09.270
Let's throw us a cell phone into a chimpanzee cage here, have at it,

85
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.500
see how you do it for a while.

86
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.900
I don't know that we're ever going to figure this stuff out.

87
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.510
<v 0>Nah, it, it would be like, let's,</v>

88
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.520
let's take a chimpanzee and let's manipulate its brain and leave him with a

89
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:22.410
bunch of tools, you know, give it,

90
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.930
give it some things and see what it comes up with.

91
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.770
And then come back and try again. I mean, maybe Neanderthal was like, well,

92
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:31.890
you know, they're not going to get any further past this, like this,

93
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:34.890
this project we need to scrap it. Start with something new.

94
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:39.810
I don't think that's not. Look, we do weird to animals. I mean, we studied them.

95
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.540
We, you know, I was just talking to a friend of mine about zoos,

96
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:47.190
about how bummed out I was when I went to this Wolf sanctuary because everyone's

97
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:50.070
like, oh, it's amazing. You get to see these wolves that they've rescued.

98
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.690
I got there. I saw a bunch of castrated wolves that were living in prison.

99
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.000
I didn't think it was cool at all. It freaked me. I got really depressed.

100
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.130
I, I think what you look at what we are willing to do to chimps.

101
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.600
I mean, I remember going to, um, uh, I forget maybe it was Denver.

102
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.130
I forget where it was, the, the zoo,

103
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.460
but there was a zoo where there was this monkey that was in a cage that was

104
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:17.060
screaming, just scream. Like he was going crazy.

105
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.090
It was a small cage and people were walking around and he's like,

106
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.470
just, and I was like, he's probably going mad.

107
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.560
This is not how a monkey supposed to live. They're supposed to be in the jungle,

108
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.400
in the wild, you know, harvesting food and living with other monkeys.

109
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:36.080
And that's supposed to be alone in a cage where these other weird primates

110
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.490
walk by and stare at it.

111
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:42.200
It just overwhelms all of its defense systems and survival

112
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:45.470
systems. We're willing to do that, to things that we know,

113
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.420
or at least slightly intelligent,

114
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.260
like what would be willing to do weirder,

115
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:56.150
more advanced experiments to primates. And.

116
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.090
<v 2>H how do you tell a population,</v>

117
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.060
if you do study UFO's as the government and you find out, okay,

118
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.900
they're a craft and they're coming in, they're probably studying us. Like,

119
00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:08.170
how do you tell people that, like, how are people gonna react?

120
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.510
And the way that it's so compartmentalized,

121
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.090
that's been the best proof to me as well.

122
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.930
If I've talked to somebody who's worked on a project and they're like,

123
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.410
all I saw was a super capacitor in 1974.

124
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.850
And I know this was not something we made. He was told nothing else.

125
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.770
He just saw a technology that was more efficient than anything he had ever

126
00:07:29.771 --> 00:07:33.610
seen. So the idea that people are funneling this information,

127
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:38.020
whoever is funneling it and protecting this information as we see

128
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.220
how all SAP and Atish didn't get special access permission,

129
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.630
that's a special type of program. They knew about crashed retrieval programs.

130
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.620
So they said, we want to compare notes and information with other UFO projects.

131
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.480
They were denied access.

132
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.520
<v 1>Yeah. The door, the door was slammed in their face.</v>

133
00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:56.710
When they tried to ask that Senator Reed, it was Senate,

134
00:07:56.711 --> 00:08:01.210
majority leader had asked for permission to create it as an SAP special access

135
00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:04.600
program so they could get access to other goodies. And they said, no,

136
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.493
like other.

137
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.070
<v 2>Retrieval programs, material program stuff that Bob has talked about.</v>

138
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.660
So just the fact that it's, it's so hidden even within its own mechanism,

139
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:17.980
that they won't allow this scientific team to work on this project. It tells me,

140
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.040
as Robbie says, something's up. I mean, something's up,

141
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:28.780
[inaudible].
