00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.840
Have you got everything that you could catch over there? Dengue fever. Malaria?

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.560
Yeah. What black, how do you say this new things?

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.440
<v 1>ITTO.</v>

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.120
<v 0>Soto STO and this is a.</v>

6
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.840
<v 1>Parasitic disease as well. It's like a,</v>

7
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.720
I think it's in the fluke family or it's a, it's a, uh, it's a worm. Yeah.

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.670
Yeah. Uh, and then hopefully I don't have anything else besides that,

9
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.990
but this toxicity stuff, Cipro or Quin that could be messed with,

10
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.990
could you change your diet as well? Yeah. Yeah. My wife meal prep. You eat?

11
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.750
I eat mostly I eat meat, but I eat mostly vegetables. Like more of that.

12
00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:38.710
Like the small portion is meat. Um, and it'll be chicken or fish,

13
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.780
um, or something lean a lot of nuts and a lot of thick,

14
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.790
um.

15
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.740
<v 0>Leafy green vegetables. And have you found that that's helped you that's helped.</v>

16
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.340
<v 1>Me a lot. Yeah. That's helped me a lot. You juicing at all? Yep. Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:55.300
Doing that, uh, juicing with the, uh, with the vitamin mix. Okay.

18
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.453
<v 0>So you get away all the fiber.</v>

19
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.500
<v 1>In there as well? Yeah, the fiber. Wow. So that's been really good. And then,</v>

20
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.010
and then I've been keeping of myself busy. If I can't go there,

21
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.170
we're really starting to expand our mission and vision here,

22
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:07.570
stateside mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

23
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.050
to bully prevention because Joe it's nuts right now,

24
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.370
the second leading cause of death. Um, so Butch,

25
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.610
um, is Raven's grandfather and he is an old bull rider. Um,

26
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.560
and Rayen lives with, with Butch and Claudia, his grandparents right now.

27
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.600
And they found him with in his forearm. He wrote,

28
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.360
I want to kill myself in Sharpie and he's 12 he's 12

29
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.520
Butch said the first time Rayen wanted to kill himself that he knew of when,

30
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.080
whenever Ray was nine years old.

31
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.750
So he is nine years old and already Sue his sidal. And Butch said, um,

32
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.430
that that just makes his heart wanna fall out of his chest. You know,

33
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.643
I'm his grandfather,

34
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.230
how does my 12 year old grandson not have enough to live for? And, um,

35
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.350
the leading second leading cause of death among kids from 10 to 14 is

36
00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:02.750
suicide. If you're between ages of 10 to 14,

37
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:06.020
that's the second reason and bullying is the cause of most of that.

38
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.820
Most of it's from bullying cuz bullying is linked to the,

39
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.500
the increase in depression, addiction, isolation.

40
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.020
<v 0>Do they think that the people who do it,</v>

41
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.740
is it because they were bullied at one point in time or abused physically.

42
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.140
<v 1>So they do think that, and the easy way to remember that is hurt people,</v>

43
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.770
hurt people, right? &lt;affirmative&gt; right. Hurt people, hurt people,

44
00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:27.530
whether that's an addict or a bully mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Um, but, uh,

45
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.770
here's a statistic from the CDC. It's funny.

46
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:33.410
The CDC found out that I had ding gay fever. Um,

47
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:38.250
and then also the CDC did the study on bullying and uh, the number three,

48
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.930
um, at risk of suicide is the bully. The person that acts out by being a,

49
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.400
um, number two, surprisingly is the victim.

50
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.360
They're the second highest risk. So then you think who's who's number one. Well,

51
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.000
number one is actually the one that does both.

52
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.200
They are bullied and then they act out by being a bully.

53
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.840
And so they're getting it on both ends, no problem, positive feelings.

54
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.520
<v 0>At all. It's just all a storm of negativity and awfulness.</v>

55
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.120
<v 1>It's a huge storm. Now what can do.</v>

56
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.360
<v 0>For, for bully awareness, right? Like how can you, how can you prevent it?</v>

57
00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:12.960
Or how can we mitigate it? Yeah.

58
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.360
<v 1>I think it's by promoting a culture of cultivating a culture, kind,</v>

59
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.950
this, and I know that can sound a little Wimpy's no, I don't think so at all.

60
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.310
Yeah, but if you look at Rafael, uh Lavato Jr. He was bullied.

61
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.990
Um, because he didn't look like everybody else was dressed. Like everybody else,

62
00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:32.910
George St. P so many guys, a lot of fighters are bullied. Yeah. Most,

63
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.110
most fighters I find were bullied. Yeah. Not being the bully. Right. Um,

64
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.060
and so I think to Cole cultivate a culture of kindness.

65
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:43.500
There's actually this school in Oklahoma, it's pretty awesome.

66
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.660
They're called Edmond Santa Fe. They selected us between a,

67
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.260
a 44 applicants. So we were up against like boys and girls club and make a wish,

68
00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:57.180
these phenomenal organizations, uh, uh, special Olympics and some really,

69
00:03:57.181 --> 00:04:02.090
really great, um, charities and nonprofits out there last year,

70
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.250
the school selected a foster home and they raised in a week,

71
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.010
this high school raised $234,000

72
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.130
a high school and their philanthropy week cuz they wanted to help these kids get

73
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.410
a new, um, like main center mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh, among the foster homes.

74
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.000
So this year they selected us because they wanna get our bully prevention

75
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:24.920
program into public and private schools.

76
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.160
<v 0>Now what is the prevention program? Like what, yeah.</v>

77
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.000
<v 1>So it's mostly character development with bully prevention inside of it.</v>

78
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:35.240
So it's a 12 week program and it's 12 weekly lessons.

79
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.440
So we have it online. It's digital,

80
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.560
it's on our website fight for the forgotten.org.

81
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.190
And if you click hero in waiting, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, you'll find it.

82
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:44.830
That's our curriculum what's called is heroes in waiting.

83
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.310
And what that is is there's a digital curriculum where I teach the teacher or

84
00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:51.750
instruct the instructor, how to instruct the lesson that week.

85
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.950
But then there's a video for the parents and for the students, um,

86
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:58.470
that's the weekly hero challenge.

87
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.700
And so they get a weekly lesson or at chat discussion and then they get a weekly

88
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:04.534
challenge,

89
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.740
which the challenge will be something like recognized when you're being a

90
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:12.620
bystander or my favorite is probably go out your

91
00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:16.380
mission this week is that your hero challenge is to go out and complete a secret

92
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.100
random act of kindness. So the rules are, you have to be safe,

93
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.020
you have to be smart,

94
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.010
but have to be completely anonymous and you have to go out and make someone feel

95
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.570
great. And so journal or report back to us, you know,

96
00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:32.730
what did you do? How'd that make them feel how'd that make you feel?

97
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.010
How can you build onto this for next week? Um,

98
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.850
and you go out and you complete these missions because I think first you have to

99
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:40.684
educate the kids

100
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.040
that they are part of the solution and part of the problem.

101
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.840
They just have to pick where they, where they're gonna be. Because, um,

102
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.040
in bullying, if you stand by and you watch, if you laugh, giggle,

103
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:56.880
like in that video, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, there's 12, 12 kids in the bathroom,

104
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.600
four or five are filming it. You filming it is encouraging it,

105
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.160
you standing by and not doing anything.

106
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.880
You're actually not a innocent bystander.

107
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.320
You're a silent supporter because you're standing there and you're not doing

108
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.240
anything. They're.

109
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.120
<v 0>Actually trying to pass laws about kids in schools, filming other kids,</v>

110
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:18.390
getting beat up and making them somehow like part of it,

111
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.790
a part of it, an accomplice or some way shape or form. Cause.

112
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.790
<v 1>You are, you're at least an encourager. Yeah.</v>

113
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.950
And then if you stand by and watch, you are an accomplice,

114
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:29.750
you're not doing anything. It, you didn't choose it.

115
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.230
It shows you what happened to those.

116
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.150
<v 0>Kids in the video that were doing those things to raid they're.</v>

117
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.870
<v 1>Beating. So they're minors. So I can't really talk about what's happened,</v>

118
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.640
but um,

119
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.580
the school has taken appropriate or at least in their eyes appropriate and swift

120
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.060
action. Um,

121
00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:47.340
the parents are thankful to the school and the school district for them taking

122
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.020
this, um, serious. Uh, I know that the,

123
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.660
the family has felt this has been going on since he was nine, at least. Um,

124
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.460
and now he's 12. So three years in the,

125
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.770
I say the only reason now something's being done is cuz it was filmed because

126
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:05.210
it's on video and it went viral. Um, but there's been some fun stuff.

127
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:06.810
If we can pull up some of those random pictures, I'll.

128
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.330
<v 0>Show you. There's another one recently where Dylan, Dan, Dylan,</v>

129
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.930
Dan got Jisu lessons. You pay for Jisu lessons for this young boy.

130
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.810
Who's also beat up in the bathroom and there's a film of that as well. Yeah.

131
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.330
You.

132
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.480
<v 1>Know what I'm talking about? Yeah. And Dylan, uh,</v>

133
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:22.600
posted this video too and it got over 10 million views. Yeah. Um,

134
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:23.434
which was awesome.

135
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.360
And Rafael now is actually going to scholarship Rayen

136
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.640
and his brother Brock with jujitsu lessons. Oh, that's amazing.

137
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.080
So they're gonna start doing martial arts training after Raven's done with his

138
00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:37.360
hyperbarics and his concussion is settled down.

139
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.310
He's gonna come into the mats and be part of the kids program,

140
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.310
the little warriors for, uh, for Rafael's school,

141
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.110
which are the best youth program in the state. That's awesome.

142
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.050
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

143
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.870
<v 1>That's awesome. Is there a way to pull up some of those pictures of,</v>

144
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.190
of Rayen um, and this is kind of cool.

145
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.430
I'm gonna give you this because uh,

146
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.900
Rafael really likes this and it's some 10th planet guys. Um,

147
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.020
there's Raiden after, uh, after a, uh, uh,

148
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.700
actually a press conference, all the news wanted to like post pictures of him,

149
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.980
um, or they wanted to get exclusives.

150
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.380
And so his parents were being chased all around town.

151
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:15.340
People are literally posting their home address online, docking them,

152
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.330
but docking the bullies mainly saying here's the 12 year old girl's address

153
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.810
and go, go find her. Um, you can go through a couple more of those pictures.

154
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.210
Uh there's some pretty cool ones where, um, eating Chick-fil-A yeah,

155
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.130
he likes Chick-fil-A a lot. &lt;laugh&gt; his dad says he is a chicken eating full.

156
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.890
Um, but there's at a football game that Edmond Santa Fe they've uh,
