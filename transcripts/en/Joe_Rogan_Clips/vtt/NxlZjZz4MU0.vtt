WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.680
<v 0>Yeah, the red bull don't through.</v>

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.120
<v 1>Dick. Hey, what do you think of this? John Jones. That's going on?</v>

3
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.360
Do you know what's happened? The UFC's moving from Vegas.

4
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.320
<v 0>I, I saw this last night Angeles. When I got home from the comedy store,</v>

5
00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:12.240
break it down for me.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.000
<v 1>I'm having Jeff navvisky come on and break it down. Scientifically on Thursday,</v>

7
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.360
a lot of people are calling, including Daniel Cormeier.

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.070
I talked to cor me on the phone. He was like, he tested positive again.

9
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.470
Can you believe this? And they're gonna let a fight.

10
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.910
I found out about it from Cormeier cormee told him they're gonna move the fight

11
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:32.870
to LA. I go, no, he goes, yes, Joe, they're moving the fight to LA. I'm like,

12
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.110
no, this can't be real. It didn't seem real. I'm like, I don't believe this.

13
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.790
I looked at his cormee's Twitter and I said,

14
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.860
it said he tested positive again. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then I looked,

15
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.260
I went what? This is like first thing in the morning. And he's like,

16
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.740
again again, but from what I understand from,

17
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.340
uh, reading Ariel hellwanney's, uh,

18
00:00:56.341 --> 00:01:01.260
transcript of his interview with Andy foster and hearing what Jeff

19
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:06.010
nav Visky has had to say about it, what it is is the numb.

20
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.510
The,

21
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.490
the amount of it is soinfiniteessimal and it's the exact same

22
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.050
metabolite that he had been screened for,

23
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.810
that he tested positive for a year ago.

24
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.970
And that this could stay in a system in those kind of size of

25
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.920
is of the molecule.

26
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.400
It's like some 500000000th of a grain of San or something like that. See,

27
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.320
forget Google, what the actual number of the, how small this molecule is.

28
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.400
So Andy foster has said again, through this transcription of this, uh,

29
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:39.680
interview that he did with aiel,

30
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:43.830
Halwani that it's the same metabolite for the same substance that he tested

31
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.430
positive for that this is the same instance that the,

32
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.870
the number of it and it,

33
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:53.070
it indicates that this is something he's already been punished for.

34
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.710
It's the same exact he's already gone through his, you know, his steps.

35
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.630
And this is just ainfiniteessimally small metabolite. That's,

36
00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:02.510
that's what I'm hearing.

37
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.780
So I would love to hear someone who doesn't think that that's the case that

38
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:11.020
thinks there might be some way to game the system. And the,

39
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:13.900
the big thought that people, uh, always bring up when it comes to this stuff,

40
00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:16.220
is microdosing someone microdosing,

41
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.180
like you're the one who told me about that first. You were telling me about, uh,

42
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.300
somebody Alex Rodriguez. Yeah. Who is taking.

43
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.730
<v 0>Tommy bears in the.</v>

44
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.930
<v 1>Seventh that were testosterone.</v>

45
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.690
<v 0>And he was so he would be up for the seventh, eighth, and ninth inning.</v>

46
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.490
But by the time the 10th inning came, if they tested him,

47
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.450
it would be out of his system.

48
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.770
<v 1>So I would imagine the testing is better now.</v>

49
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.970
And this is one of the things that newvisky wants to get into that the testing

50
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.880
is far superior in now. So you're able to pick up these metabolites in much,

51
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:49.800
much smaller quantities. Okay.

52
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.440
<v 0>So this is, so this test is from December 9th. Yes.</v>

53
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.360
I wanna see what his test here it is, was leading up to that. And everything.

54
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.360
<v 1>Was apparently was clean before that he said we were notified early this month</v>

55
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.200
of an issue he has had over his most recent tests where a very small amount I'll

56
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.040
I'll fact describe how small it is, uh,

57
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.240
of a long term metabolite substance called D H C M T known as

58
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.800
oral turibal turibal,

59
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.950
which is the reason for his most recent suspension a year and a half ago. Very,

60
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.830
very small amount. But there was a number that I thought he said it too,

61
00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:25.870
but I don't know why it's not there.

62
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.790
Where does it say the number there was a he's Mac rice or yeah.

63
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.150
Something like how much smaller it is in a grain of rice is it can't find it.

64
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.810
Yeah. Let'm try to find it. Um, yeah, look,

65
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.400
I get how everybody would be.

66
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.240
I get how everybody would think that he's a cheater. He's cheating again.

67
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.120
I get that. You would think that,

68
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.600
but I don't know if that's true and if it's not true,

69
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.760
it would be a shame to accuse him of it.

70
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.110
If it is the same stuff that was in his system that was ruled to be from a

71
00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:00.950
tainted supplement.

72
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.350
Here it is apiccogram is 1000000000000th of a gram.

73
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.263
Novitsky said,

74
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.230
if you put one grain of salt on a table and split it up into 50 million

75
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.243
pieces,

76
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.710
apiccogram is one of those pieces of that gram of salt,

77
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.980
which is insane. So that grain of salt,

78
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.860
it's a 50 million times large or smaller than that. It's crazy. So it's very,

79
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:27.780
very, very, very small.

80
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.100
So if this is true and they believe it's true,

81
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.380
and the guy runs California state athletic commission, uh, Andy foster, I,

82
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.900
I have a, a great, great deal, tremendous amount of respect for that guy.

83
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.050
Very proactive with weight, cutting very proactive with weight classes,

84
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.770
very proactive with a lot of the rules.

85
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.730
He's he's really good if he believes that this has scientifically been proven to

86
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:54.210
be from the same exact thing that he already has been punished for.

87
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.530
I agree with him. I just, that, that guy knows what the he's talking about.

88
00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.690
And he's legit. So is navvitsky.

89
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.400
So these people that are all saying that it's legit. Here's the question though.

90
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.680
Have other people been still punished for the

91
00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:10.920
exact same crime?

92
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.120
Have other people tested positive again for the exact same thing this I do not

93
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.080
know. And, uh, I don't know if people are looking into that,

94
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.990
if there's any preferential treatment that would be where the argument would be

95
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:24.430
with pre preferential treatment,

96
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.710
these tainted supplements are a legitimate problem. I mean,

97
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.150
Novitsky showed us hundreds and hundreds of supplements you could buy at any

98
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.150
store that has, you know,

99
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.470
vitamins and muscle builders and all those kind of things.

100
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.700
That test positive for steroids. There's a ton of amount there, man,

101
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.500
you can get a lot of stuff in these system,

102
00:05:45.501 --> 00:05:48.300
but then there's also people that are taking steroids.

103
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.980
So how do you know who's who the only way to find out who's who is don't take,

104
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.900
don't take anything. Unless it's third party tested,

105
00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:59.120
don't take anything controversial. Don't take anything squirrely. And uh,

106
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:02.680
sometimes people do and it's up that, you know, they,

107
00:06:02.681 --> 00:06:05.600
maybe they lack a supplement. Maybe they've had good results with it.

108
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.280
And then they get one bad batch. That's possible too. I just.

109
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.280
<v 0>Wanna know that this was from December 9th.</v>

110
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.760
I wanna know what the levels of that drug they found,

111
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.790
where before December 9th, it takes a long time to go away. And I understand so,

112
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.870
but every time you urine, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

113
00:06:22.871 --> 00:06:25.590
the levels should get lower and lower and lower.

114
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.870
<v 1>I think what they're saying is this is the lowest detectable number.</v>

115
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.310
So there's no lower than this.

116
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.670
<v 0>So they should have found this before. Maybe not this higher.</v>

117
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.620
<v 1>Maybe, maybe depending,</v>

118
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.980
see these numbers the way it's been explained to me again, I'm not a scientist,

119
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.540
but the way it's been explained to me,

120
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:48.420
this number is so small that it could conceivably be tested in one test

121
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.820
and not tested another test.

122
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.020
And then also as the testing procedures get more and more thorough,

123
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.460
they get better at it. They're detecting things they couldn't detect.

124
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.810
Maybe even just a year ago, like it's continu. The,

125
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.970
the technology is to continuing to grow and they're getting much better at

126
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:07.650
understanding how to use it and how to, how to advance it.

127
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.730
So it's not as simple as you test positive a year ago, you test negative today.

128
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.760
Like they,

129
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.410
they might have better methods of detection today than they had a year ago.

130
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.200
<v 0>You've gotta rested today, Joe, the judge is gonna say, Joe Rogan,</v>

131
00:07:22.201 --> 00:07:26.840
I'm releasing you on bail, but the da wants you to take a urine test, right?

132
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.040
And samples. And if you come back dirty, the first UA is free.

133
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.200
They know who Joe Rogan is.

134
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:36.400
You're gonna go in there and your THC levels are gonna be off the chain. Boom.

135
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.230
This is gonna be off. The chain is gonna be on the chain. When they come back,

136
00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:44.950
they're gonna call you and they're gonna go, Joe Rogan. This is what it was.

137
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.350
Now. This is this. The next time we test you,

138
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.590
it better not be higher than 26%. Cuz we know you're using,

139
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.390
this is 1987. The lady told me, right?

140
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.100
I'll know if you're using or not and stayed to the program. And I went down,

141
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.340
down, down, down, down,

142
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.900
and then I joined the voluntary group and my buddy sent me an eighth of

143
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.580
Thai weed. And I remember smoking a joint and going back and the guys like dog,

144
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.100
did you smoke a joint before you came in for the test?

145
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.380
&lt;laugh&gt; it was like levels. We've never seen.

146
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.770
This is I'm telling you about this. This is a funny joke and whatever.

147
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.730
But I wanna see the test before the ninth. And I wanna see the test,

148
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.130
the most recent test, those levels had to go down unless he, I.

149
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.610
<v 1>Knew I understand what you're saying, Joe, unless he's not necessarily.</v>

150
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.030
<v 0>Correct.</v>

151
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:43.000
Unless he did the steroid I during non-com competition season,

152
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.600
which they're allowed to do.

153
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.440
<v 1>Whatever the they do. No, they're not. That's not true.</v>

154
00:08:46.441 --> 00:08:48.240
They're never allowed to I, no, I don't know what the. No, they,

155
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.520
they can never take steroids.

156
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:52.320
There's a band list of things they can never ever have in their system.

157
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.200
They get, see if you are fighting, they'll still test you say,

158
00:08:56.201 --> 00:08:58.120
if you don't have a camp, you're not, you're not a camp.

159
00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:01.080
You don't have a bout lined up. They still still test you. They'll not,

160
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:04.040
Hey Joey Diaz, how are you? Come on in the bathroom. We're gonna get some,

161
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.560
get some fluids from you.

162
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.320
Now I don't know if they're using just urine or if it's,

163
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.320
if it's urine and blood I'm, I'm not sure with the protocol.

164
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.990
But I do know that it's very thorough and they're catching people or for things

165
00:09:14.991 --> 00:09:16.630
that they would've never caught 'em for in the past.

166
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.430
And this is one of the things about this test. It could possibly be,

167
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:26.590
as it's been explained to me that this, this number is so small,

168
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.830
that they might not even been able to detect it a year ago, that this number,

169
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:35.260
this insanely small number, there's new levels of detection out.

170
00:09:35.261 --> 00:09:38.900
Whereas he would be completely negative X amount of time in the past.

171
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.420
Now they can test it and they could find that insanely 50000000th of a grain of

172
00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:48.900
salt size particle it's it's so small that they

173
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.660
weren't able to catch something like that X amount of time in the past,

174
00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:54.820
whether it's a year ago or two years, but now they can.

175
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.250
And in the future gonna be even better,

176
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.090
they're gonna keep getting better at this stuff as they advance the technology.

177
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.250
That's as it's been explained to me, what you're seeing here,

178
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.690
what you're seeing here is not evidence of new drug use.

179
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.050
It's evidence that the testing is far better and that he has the exact

180
00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:11.851
same metabolite.

181
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:15.290
And he definitely did have it in the system cuz they're finding it a year later

182
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.800
in these TTT T tiny amount, his body hasn't completely gotten rid of it yet.

183
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.480
Still in there. The question is how long does that stuff stay in your system?

184
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.480
They've said through normal detection, I believe Google this,

185
00:10:28.481 --> 00:10:31.680
make sure this is correct, but through normal detection, what's not.

186
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.480
I mean from whenever the, the time they, they wrote this stuff out, I,

187
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.710
I believe they were saying it could be detected up to 18 months, but again,

188
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.990
as this technology gets better and they can detect smaller and smaller

189
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.430
particles, it's potentially possible that that might extend.

190
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.630
So it might not just be 18 months.

191
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.710
It might be 19 or 20 or who knows how long it takes for your body to get rid of

192
00:10:53.711 --> 00:10:54.410
that.

193
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.580
<v 0>Now the guys like corn Meir and gustasen and guys that, you know,</v>

194
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.500
they look at this as where they smoke this fire, Joe. Yes.

195
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.380
<v 1>You know, and there's, they have a point too.</v>

196
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.940
<v 0>And they have a Pointo song. I'm not mad at them for that. I'm a big fan of Joe,</v>

197
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.100
of uh, John Jones personally. I.

198
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.933
<v 1>Am too.</v>

199
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.460
<v 0>Uh, for what he does. I love him to definitely.</v>

200
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:19.130
I saw him an Albuquerque came to the show. We laughed.

201
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.530
I don't think, I don't know what to think anymore. You know, I,

202
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.290
I don't know what to think. This one really, you know,

203
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:35.170
and I feel bad at you. And I both know this is the card of the year. It's.

204
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.050
<v 1>A phenomenal card. This is.</v>

205
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:40.880
<v 0>The card when people sh in and they make plans around it,</v>

206
00:11:40.881 --> 00:11:43.240
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they do a bunch of stuff around it.

207
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.960
I feel bad for those people. I know what this is like for them.

208
00:11:46.961 --> 00:11:49.600
They just lost this Saturday night activity. Well.

209
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.000
<v 1>In Vegas it takes a big hit too,</v>

210
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:53.320
because this was gonna be taking place in Vegas.

211
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.760
All those people are gonna be in town.

212
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.520
It's gonna be a tremendous amount of money for the casinos. And you know,

213
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.840
I'm sure it was a lot of money for them there. It was,

214
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.080
it is a big thing to have there and a bigger arena.

215
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.760
So they're moving it to the forum, which is a smaller place.

216
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.080
The forum in Inglewood is I don't know how much smaller it is than the T-Bo

217
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.040
mobile arena. But he said.

218
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:12.990
<v 2>He was, uh,</v>

219
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.910
Dana was saying he could make about $6 million on the gate and T-Mobile arena.

220
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.790
And he is gonna be lucky to make a million in.

221
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.870
<v 1>The forum. That makes sense. It's just, uh, it's different prices to in Vegas.</v>

222
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.830
And also the fact that it's such short timing.

223
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.070
I don't know what they do with the original tickets. I don't know how it works.

224
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.630
This is what happened. The very first UFC I ever did,

225
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.500
the very first U ever worked was in Dothan, Alabama, UFC 12,

226
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.620
but was supposed to be in New York state. They canceled it in New York state.

227
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:39.900
They wouldn't let 'em do it. And they, they,

228
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:43.580
they switched the whole thing overnight down to Dothan, Alabama,

229
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.700
I take a one of 'em helicopter planes

230
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.620
and fly in a Dothan. It was weird. It was weird back then, man.

231
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.181
But that's uh,

232
00:12:53.181 --> 00:12:56.930
that it's the only time I've ever heard of something changing this close to that

233
00:12:56.931 --> 00:12:58.810
was one day. This is one week.

234
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:01.850
I've never heard of an event changing like this before. Not that I can remember.

235
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.650
I don't know what the is happening. I really don't,

236
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.690
but they seem very confident that you're not dealing with someone who's taking

237
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:11.883
a drug again.

238
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:16.480
You're dealing with the very same drug that he took X amount of months ago,

239
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.440
still in his system, the drug that he's already been punished for.

240
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.720
I understand that people get mad, but, um, you,

241
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.600
you don't want to accuse someone of something that they're not really guilty of.

242
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.360
He's definitely guilty of taking it.

243
00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:34.830
The first time people are accusing 'em of being stupid and taking it in.

244
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.710
I don't think that's true. I don't know for a fact,

245
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:44.430
but what I'm reading from actual experts leads me to believe

246
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.990
that they're making sense, but I would have to, you know,

247
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.710
I'd have to talk to someone who disagrees,

248
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:53.070
who knows more about it than me to really form an opinion.

249
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.900
So my opinion is like, well, if I had a bet,

250
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.820
I would say he probably didn't do anything,

251
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.860
but I would like to talk to someone who's like a real expert who could break

252
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.940
down exactly what the process is.

253
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.100
Who could tell you if it is even possible that this could be from another

254
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.980
ingestion somewhere along the line. And you.

255
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:15.850
<v 0>Want me to tell you what the sad, sad thing about this whole situation is?</v>

256
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.810
What that it really,

257
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.450
really from the bottom of my heart was a great card. Oh,

258
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:23.370
it's a great card. You know,

259
00:14:23.371 --> 00:14:27.530
when BJ Penn's on the card and nobody even talks about it. Yeah.

260
00:14:27.531 --> 00:14:29.210
Nobody even mentioned BJ Penn.

261
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.170
<v 1>Well, you know, BJ had some tough fights. I.</v>

262
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:35.410
<v 0>I was looking for carloslo and Michael Chase, you know, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh,</v>

263
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:40.520
Amanda Nuez andyborg I haven't slept for

264
00:14:40.521 --> 00:14:42.600
a week trying to figure that. Yeah. Flip the card, put the card on the,

265
00:14:42.601 --> 00:14:47.120
trying to figure that fight out. John Jones. Guason just to look at it.

266
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.440
Let's pretend it's still in Vegas. You know, you got a guy who's been active,

267
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.520
a guy who's been fighting, a guy who's angry,

268
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.200
a guy who felt he beat John Jones the first time against a very,

269
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.200
very talented, dangerous and rested John Jones.

270
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.480
Is there ring dust, you know, ring rust. Is there ring rust? I'm sorry. Ring.

271
00:15:07.481 --> 00:15:09.640
Dust. What the am I talking about?
