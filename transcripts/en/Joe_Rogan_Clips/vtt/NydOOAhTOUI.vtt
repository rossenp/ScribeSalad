8
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.960
They walk you all the way up to the guy or the gal who's working there.

9
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:26.910
They wave at you. Everybody walks right through and I have pre NTSA pre or TSA,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.410
<v 1>Nice. You you, well, you don't travel international enough to have global,</v>

12
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:33.870
right? You don't have global ditch. Why would you do it?

13
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:35.370
You don't even go to the country.

14
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.190
<v 0>I've been on the country every year. I know.</v>

15
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.060
<v 1>I know. But does everybody in your family have it too? They all gotta have it.</v>

16
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.190
Yeah. Come on. Global Clarence.

18
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.930
<v 1>Uh, I already got them in the same brand. I don't know that.</v>

19
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.450
I didn't know that you get one. You get both. How about that? I didn't know.

20
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.110
<v 2>You got to go everyone. If most states, I don't know, actually,</v>

21
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.800
I don't know how many states have this, but being at the DMV last few days. Um,

22
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.800
real ideas, a new thing coming through some states.

23
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.520
And if you want to travel domestically, yeah.

24
00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:08.200
You're going to have to get a new ID ID.

25
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.760
<v 1>Or your passport. Oh, because I already have the Fidessa.</v>

26
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.860
<v 2>Fly from here to Ohio. You need your passport.</v>

27
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.350
<v 0>For that. You don't have to have a passport. If you wanna go to Vegas.</v>

28
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.390
<v 1>Yeah. Shut up. That's so dumb. Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.290
<v 2>Or get you this new version of the California ID like it to go give right.</v>

30
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.010
<v 1>Another brother wants it, baby. Brother, just put something in my arm.</v>

31
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.050
Just give me my ID and what they want.

32
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.870
<v 0>They want you to give in, let them do what? Oh.</v>

33
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.000
<v 1>My God. I'm doing it. I gave in, when I bought these,</v>

34
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.790
when I bought this tracking device, that's listening to me 24 hours a day.

35
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:36.750
Your phone. Yes.

36
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.540
<v 0>What are you doing? What's the worst thing you do? That, that phone picks up.</v>

37
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.153
<v 1>Talk.</v>

38
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.703
<v 0>But that's normal.</v>

39
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.070
<v 1>That's normal. You think that somebody does? There's a file.</v>

40
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.700
There's a file of all the talking. What if they log your talking? And.

41
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.300
<v 0>One day you're going to say something bad about the government.</v>

42
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.170
I'm going to pull you aside.

43
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.850
<v 1>And say so many bad things. Whatever president.</v>

44
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.920
<v 0>Elizabeth Warren is going to bring you into a room, shut.</v>

45
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.780
<v 1>Your mouth. And she's going to show.</v>

46
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.560
<v 0>You all the.</v>

47
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.440
<v 1>Things you've done to be Peter Buddha judge. And you note at T2,</v>

48
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.780
[inaudible] some governor from some local, some local, uh, south bend, Indiana.

49
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.890
And she's like, we got our, we got a running in the office in mayor, Pete.

50
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.580
But he say some homo. We got some homo running for president dance.

51
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.840
Who said that? Some dude at some local government thing. Yeah. He was all mad.

52
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:25.440
He's like, and some woman left. She was like, I'm so offended. I'm so offended.

53
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.610
And then when people are like, can you believe.

54
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.700
<v 0>Doing a good job as mayor? That's ridiculous. Yeah. Remember when all the,</v>

55
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:32.670
there was a cop that shot someone and his response was inadequate.

56
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.440
And so they had all these people saying,

57
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.320
how the are you running for president while you're the mayor?

58
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.480
Which I don't understand either. No,

59
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.180
I don't understand how the you're going to have an incredibly time consuming

60
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:47.010
tax, taxing job, like being the mayor of a major city,

61
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.630
not major, but it's a city. There's a few people live in there.

62
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.220
You're supposed to be running that. And you're also running for president.

63
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.830
It sounds like you're slacking. Yeah. Right? It's like,

64
00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:00.370
if you had a job and you were the CEO of, um, whatever Heineken,

65
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.770
right. And then in the meantime,

66
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.790
you're out there campaigning to be the CEO of Budweiser. Yeah.

67
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.370
Hanukkah will pull you over. Hey. Face I talk to you for a second. What are you?

68
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.190
What are you doing? You're not even here.

69
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.050
You're eight hours out of the week. You're off going, doing Budweiser.

70
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.290
Yeah. Yeah. But that's a great gig. But otherwise it gets really good.

71
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.200
I like to keep the Heineken gig while I try to get the Budweiser gig.

72
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.370
If you don't mind, if you guys are cool with it. Yeah.

73
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.850
You guys are cool with it. How did you find it? You'll laugh. Even more.

74
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.350
Look at it. Widely spread video.

75
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.060
A community commissioner county county commissioner Warren Hurst can be seen

76
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:38.620
giving minutes long speech against what he sees as an American changing

77
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.680
America, changing towards liberal values, arguing,

78
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.300
arguing to make his jurisdiction a gun sanctuary,

79
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.620
meaning that resources would be diverted away from enforcing certain gun laws

80
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.670
in the speech, hers lamented. Well,

81
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.560
we got run for president in the democratic party saying that better

82
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:03.070
candidates could be found in jail. He continued,

83
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:04.840
we got a running for president.

84
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.920
If that ain't about as ugly as you can get referred into [inaudible] we're

85
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.670
running for prison openly gay. Wow. Ugly. As you can get,

86
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.440
what do you think would happen if you became president?

87
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:18.790
How bad would the homophobia be in this country? Through the roof? rolly.

88
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.130
It almost would be worse for gay people in the short run. Yeah, right? Yeah.

89
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.330
It's like the, the homophobes would make, they would be so adamant.

90
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.610
It would be so in be dangerous for Buddha, could you.

91
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.950
<v 1>What a judge, a judge would set it up,</v>

92
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.380
but he doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell. I mean,

93
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:36.640
he's not even remotely close.

94
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.800
<v 0>No. You know who kills me is that beta or rope or work? I go rock.</v>

95
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.130
And he seems like a joke. Like someone said, look, dude,

96
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.550
here's the sketch for the next 24 months.

97
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.410
You are going to pretend you run for president.

98
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.250
And I just want you to like skate board and say a bunch of dumb.

99
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.620
And you speak Spanish real clumsy with the way you talk about

100
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:03.220
things. But tell them you're going to take their guns. She'd say it openly, say,

101
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.360
the second amendment I'm taking your guns, beta,

102
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.620
beta or Rourke.

103
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.100
<v 1>I'm going to be alpha. Oh Santino. And the next time I run.</v>

104
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.120
<v 0>It's like, you know how you know, like, you know how, um,</v>

105
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.590
Ali G like ha he has these characters is Sarah

106
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.780
Sasha, Baron Cohen. You know, he has the bore out character.

107
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:29.260
He has the, the other gay character. It's almost like a.

108
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.990
<v 1>Character, like a fictional person, like a.</v>

109
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.910
<v 0>Super like emo sort of did Sam</v>

110
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.890
Tripoli had a picture of baito on his Instagram saying don't ever

111
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:43.630
forget this. When this guy runs for president,

112
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.250
it's him covered with letters like letters all over his body.

113
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:52.780
This is like vegan feminist. And it's like writing all over his body.

114
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.920
And I, and I said to Sam, I said, is that really him? He was like, it is.

115
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.090
But I don't know if Sam really knows. It's just going to say, oh,

116
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.500
Sam's done any research.

117
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.430
<v 1>Salmon, salmon. I have endless, endless arguments. I go nowhere. Perfect.</v>

118
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.260
<v 0>I almost hope it is him. Right.</v>

119
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.720
<v 2>I don't know. I'm looking for that exact picture that I was going to.</v>

120
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.440
The only thing I do know about them before this was happening was that he was

121
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.110
known to be in this thing called the cult of the dead cow,

122
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:19.460
which is like a hacker group back in the day. Oh, my first hat, hacker groups.

123
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:22.070
You know, like when the movie hackers is a thing like that, that time period,

124
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:24.500
I think it must come from.

125
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.940
<v 1>That. The cult of the dead.</v>

126
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.380
<v 0>Covered with all the.</v>

127
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.213
<v 2>Words. That's right.</v>

128
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.170
<v 0>Uh, no. It's like him in his underwear with writing all over his body.</v>

129
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.290
<v 1>Did you see that? They changed the ABCs?</v>

130
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.713
<v 0>Yeah. How'd they do that.</v>

131
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.020
<v 1>Now. They don't know. It's not, you know, cause our youth, you know,</v>

132
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:46.970
you learn a LMNO LMNO so now it's not. LMNO why they sing it.

133
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.770
Al M and they changed the rhythm of the song. Why did they do that?

134
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.270
Because they don't want kids to say elemental ticket,

135
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:55.940
confused that those are not separate. That they are separate letters.

136
00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.711
<v 2>I saw it yesterday.</v>

137
00:06:57.711 --> 00:07:02.030
Who who's the day that changed it to one guy recorded a new verse of the song

138
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:06.920
and it went viral. Was it like, was it, is it going in schools?

139
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:07.870
That's the one thing I.

140
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.930
<v 1>Don't know. It's everywhere.</v>

141
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.250
<v 0>But did you S did you find the beta for a picture? I don't know.</v>

142
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.200
I think I saved it in my favorites.

143
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.320
<v 2>I see a bunch of like older pictures of them for back then that.</v>

144
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.520
<v 1>Are on Samsung.</v>

145
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.130
<v 0>But did you save it on, did you look at Sam's Instagram? It's.</v>

146
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.113
<v 1>Not as grim, right?</v>

147
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.290
<v 0>Or you could ask Sam to send it to you. I don't,</v>

148
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.960
I didn't have it in my favorites. I probably was so disturbed by it.

149
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:30.803
I didn't make it a face.

150
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.610
<v 1>You know, it's Sam's wallpaper on his phone. I'm sure. Wallpaper.</v>

151
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.593
<v 0>His cows.</v>

152
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.563
<v 1>Send a.</v>

153
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.660
<v 0>It's pretty far back. Okay. Yeah. It's like a six months ago.</v>

154
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.900
Oh yeah. Maybe too far back because he posts every day.

155
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.890
It might not be worth it. I was just going to say it just Instagram,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.390
Sam Tripoli.

157
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.440
Baito put a weird name to Bedo.

158
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.480
Bedo is so close to beta.

159
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.830
<v 1>Beta. Oh, Roke.</v>

160
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.410
<v 0>He's just, he seems like such a silly.</v>

161
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.040
<v 1>And then that girl, Katie hill announcer, uh, resentment.</v>

164
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.211
<v 1>Well,</v>

165
00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:18.800

166
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:23.540
about their work sexual relationship that they never hooked up at work or some

167
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.650
like that. What's.

168
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.483
<v 0>The problem.</v>

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.110
<v 1>That our husband, that's probably part of it that she's married,</v>

170
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.200
but that her husband comma it problem.

171
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:37.670
One that he's being emotionally abusive to her by like

172
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.810
releasing all this information about her cheating. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah.

173
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.500
<v 0>And he's being emotionally abusive, man. If it was a wife doing that about a.</v>

174
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.730
<v 1>Male come up.</v>

175
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.750
<v 0>Maybe it wouldn't no one say that you would never say that she's being</v>

176
00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:55.230
emotionally abusive about her cheating husband. Nope. That's the.

177
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.410
<v 1>She said, but it's our,</v>

178
00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:01.170
this article that I read said he's being emotionally abusive about her past, uh,

179
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:06.060

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.240
Cause they got video, you know, there's video of her for.

181
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.210
<v 0>Banging girls hooking.</v>

183
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:15.390
some comic had a funny tweet this morning. That was like,

184
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.360
I just like the idea of a up kind of hot.

185
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:20.940
But when you saw the picture of who she hooked up with, you're like, oh bummer.

186
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.863
Wow.

187
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.690

189
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:31.020

190
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.180
I caught it before. It was upstate for it to.

191
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.960
<v 1>Damage that. No. Nevermind. Okay. Not.</v>

192
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.830
<v 0>What I was going to think. I didn't think I was going to find that either.</v>

193
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.820
But imagine if it was real, put the picture up. I want.

<v 1>Not a beta, but it looks exactly.</v>

202
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.700
<v 0>Like, it looks a lot like him. I think Tripoli thought it was him.</v>

203
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.790
He was hoping the old days you could just say it's him. Yeah.

204
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:12.900
