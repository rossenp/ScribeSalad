00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>Uh, did you find them about the women with investments? Oh, good.</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
From a Newsweek in July. Okay. What does it say?

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.500
It's like right here, upper echelons of money and power, blah, blah,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.880
blah. According to Forbes, the world's 15 wealthiest people are men.

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.080
Women only make up 10% of the top 100 separate wealthiest women in the world.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.980
Most of their money comes from their male relatives or husbands.

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.450
Yeah. The top 10 wealthiest men made the fortunes themselves.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.070
<v 1>Now who are the top 10 wealthiest woman that isn't that from? Divorce.</v>

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.710
<v 0>Hold on a second. Yeah, she's up there.</v>

10
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.770
The first self-made woman on the list is, wow.

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.000
I don't know how to say this woman's name.

12
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.010
Z H O U that's one word Q U

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.080
N F E I Xu Quinn fee who was born to a poor

14
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:54.510
family in China, dropped out of school at 16.

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.400
She went on to found in an enormously successful

16
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:03.840
technology company. Uh, but if you put men back into the equation,

17
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:08.130
she's only 198th richest person in the world. Hmm.

18
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.380
No matter how you feel about the concept of few people,

19
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:11.490
hoarding enormous wealth.

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.240
The notion that women can only access money and power through their families,

21
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.180
or husbands seems medieval at best yet.

22
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:22.500
We see it occur at the very top of many professions outside of the business

23
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:26.880
world. Yes. Um, most people.

24
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.280
<v 1>Can you read the next step? Yeah. A recent.</v>

25
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.390
<v 0>High profile examples. Hillary Clinton during their presidential campaign,</v>

26
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.210
the first female major party nominee.

27
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.520
She campaigned on a ticket of empowerment yet.

28
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.620
Although she is accomplished in her own, right.

29
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.240
She entered politics as the wife of bill Clinton and is undoubtedly benefited

30
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:49.290
from his prestige and connections. Yeah. Well, that's true. But she's.

31
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.080
<v 1>Also a lawyer. If you read that.</v>

32
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.900
<v 0>She was a lawyer and uh, you know, she was a Senator.</v>

33
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.790
<v 1>Now Oprah's up there as the world's richest women period. Like that amazing.</v>

34
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.800
<v 0>Because they're saying I'm not a big fan of Hillary Clinton,</v>

35
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.840
but by saying she definitely entered because she was, you know,

36
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.010
she was married to him, but she was a lawyer. I mean, she's,

37
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:16.530
she's an accomplished person. She's she's educated,

38
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:19.260
accomplished who's was a Senator. I don't think that makes sense.

39
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.920
I hate when people.

40
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.150
<v 1>To say to them,</v>

41
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:24.060
should they know what you're at the right place at the right time.

42
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.610
I know you jumped and you jumped. Yeah. You jumped. So that's a problem.

43
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:33.030
I'm not mad at nobody. You can't say she got into bro. Yeah.

44
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.110
She may be a little help push here, a call here, but she jumped.

45
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.790
<v 0>There's a great book. I'm reading right now.</v>

46
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.810
It's called outliers by Malcolm McDowell. It's great.

47
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.610
And it's all about what makes people successful and why they were successful.

48
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.190
And there are a lot of factors, man.

49
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:54.060
There's a lot of factors in when you were born. Like what, like a lot of it,

50
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.230
he goes on about hockey players, about professional hockey players.

51
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.130
That almost all of them were born at a certain time so that they were at the end

52
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:07.690
of the age cutoff. So like say if you know, you're between 10 and 11,

53
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.080
when you go into, what is that fifth grade you are,

54
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.090
if you're one of the oldest kids,

55
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.050
you have a way better chance of being successful at hockey,

56
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.130
because your body's more mature than whether you're one of the youngest kids

57
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.220
that goes into sixth grade. So whether you're fifth grade or sixth grade,

58
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.850
like what year you were born is a big factor.

59
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.570
So the kids that were born later, so that they're older,

60
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.960
rather the kids over there that are older when they enter into the fifth grade

61
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:35.794
or sixth grade,

62
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.360
they're like across the board unanimously,

63
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.130
all the top level professionals were all older kids in

64
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:49.240
younger grades so that they're playing against smaller kids. They get more time.

65
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.820
They they're better. So they get more coaching,

66
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.500
they get more hours playing there's.

67
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:58.120
A lot of factors has a lot of factors in like one of the things about bill

68
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:01.720
gates, that there was, there's a whole great chapter on bill gates.

69
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.390
And about when bill gates was young, the,

70
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.710
the school that he went to had a computer class that, uh,

71
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.970
allowed him to do coding. And then he got into the university of Washington.

72
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.800
They would let him get into their, their computer room from 3:00 AM to 6:00 AM.

73
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:18.970
They had this open block.

74
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.120
So him and his friends would sneak into that place at three o'clock in the

75
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:23.590
morning. So all these,

76
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.790
all these different factors that lead to someone being like super successful,

77
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.950
it's not just that you work hard.

78
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.850
It's sometimes you get these weird advantages in life.

79
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.320
There's a bunch of things like for sure hard work, plays a factor.

80
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.460
If you don't do nothing,

81
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.380
you just sit around and woe is me and cry and think the world's.

82
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.700
You're not going anywhere. But the people that make it to the very top,

83
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:52.210
the bill gates, the Steve jobs, they have a bunch of things going for them.

84
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:56.200
It's not just hard work. It's also circumstance, fortune,

85
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.800
where they are, what, you know, who's around them. Who, who,

86
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.180
who encourages them? This there's a bunch of what time they were born in what,

87
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.320
you know, what age they were when certain things happened in the world.

88
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.650
There's a bunch of factors. But for all those checks,

89
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.670
it's just marrying the right dude, divorced,

90
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.020
getting, I know a lady who, uh,

91
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.610
just got paid from a divorced and she's just

92
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.970
shooting into her. Face a bagging 20 year olds. Now it's hilarious.

93
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.630
She's in her late forties banging at 20 year old dudes.

94
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.540
<v 1>Mr. Funny man, to cut that check.</v>

95
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.580
<v 0>For the guy. Yeah. I've known guys.</v>

96
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.170
I knew a guy who, uh,

97
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.240
he cut a check for somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million. Yeah.

98
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.793
To his ex.

99
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.210
<v 1>The check for 30 grand a month G</v>

100
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.340
dirty grant a month. He said.

101
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.563
<v 0>A couple guys.</v>

102
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.460
<v 1>And that was, that was not beside the half million up front.</v>

103
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.770
Oh yeah. The house two cars. Like he just walked away.

104
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.450
<v 0>I know it goes paying close to that. And he hasn't even seen his wife.</v>

105
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.130
He's been married to a new woman, a different woman for 14 years,

106
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.070
at least. Yeah. 14 years. And he was only married to that lady for 12.

107
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.200
And he's still cutting her checks and no kids. He's got kids with a new woman,

108
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.161
the old woman,

109
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:35.810
no kids still cutting her fat checks tries to bring it to

110
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:39.350
court, try to reduce the amount of money. She fights him tooth and nail.

111
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.430
Either side of my bed. She left me. He left her 14 years ago, man.

112
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.790
They were only together for 12 years. It's like, she doesn't want to work.

113
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.120
He is. He her so hard. She can't work anymore.

114
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.350
It's crazy if it was a man,

115
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.310
if the situation was reversed and a guy was dating a girl and they were dating

116
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:01.700
for 12 years and she was like, I'm tired of this. I'm going to go some new dude.

117
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.080
And the guy took her to court,

118
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.130
got money from her and then wanted money still 14 years later,

119
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.080
what kind of a man would that be? Like, get a job,

120
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.830
go do something with your life. You are a human being.

121
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.620
You met another human being. You spent some time with them.

122
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.060
They don't want to be with you anymore. It's over like this. There's no,

123
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.930
there's no children.

124
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.200
<v 1>And you're going to wait until the judge that you want your lifestyle, right.</v>

125
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.880
Lifestyle, that you were accustomed to.

126
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.150
<v 0>Maintain my lifestyle, judge. I like to buy nice purses.</v>

127
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.420
I like to walk my little dog. I like to put them in a little, a little purse.

128
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.970
<v 1>Now in California. There's different factors. Also.</v>

129
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:41.270
You have to be with that person for 10 years or something, right?

130
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.970
There's a little factors, a couple by the ways.

131
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.960
<v 0>This factors and they change, you know, depending upon the laws and they,</v>

132
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.320
they change depending upon how much money you make. And you know, this,

133
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.360
my friend was pretty wealthy. He did well.

134
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.080
But the guy who I know that had to pay $50 million, he's real successful.

135
00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:58.730
Obviously. I mean,

136
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.010
you've got to make a lot of money to give your wife 50 million,

137
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.410
but he still had to give her 50 million. Okay.

138
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.980
<v 1>You see the kid? Listen, I see the kid 0.0 baby. I see the,</v>

139
