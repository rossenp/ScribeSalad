00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.850
<v 2>When did all this come to light?</v>

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.440
When did people start understanding the negative consequences of plastics

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.693
and your food?

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.730
<v 1>Um, well, I came to understand it first in animals.</v>

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.970
Um, cause that's the way science works. You know,

7
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:24.450
first you do animal studies and then you try to replicate them in humans. Right.

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.460
And so, um,

9
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.900
in around 2000 they did some experiments where they fed

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.220
a rat food contaminated with valleys,

11
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.980
and then they look to see how the offspring developed. Right.

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.640
And what they saw was that the males were born

13
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.460
different than the females and different from unexposed males.

14
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.420
Do you want me to tell you how, how different yes, please.

15
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.760
So this will really interest you. I think what, um, what happened is,

16
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.100
so let's go back. So before the salary,

17
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.690
it's the, you know, early in pregnancy,

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.140
the genitals are just a single Ridge,

19
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.880
same in males and females undifferentiated. Okay.

20
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.860
And then at a certain time, and in mice, rats,

21
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.350
it's 15 to 18 days of gestation,

22
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.740
the testicles start making testosterone.

23
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.930
And then that gives the signal to

24
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.720
produce the male typical genitals.

25
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.220
So if they don't have the testosterone,

26
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.710
there will be ovaries. And if there is testosterone,

27
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.950
they'll be testicles and so on and so forth. Right.

28
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.020
And that migration requires testosterone at exactly the right time

29
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.370
and the right amount. It's very delicately programmed. Okay.

30
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.540
So if that happens, if everything goes well,

31
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.930
then the penis will develop, it will have a certain size.

32
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.310
And then there's something which is very key to, to my research,

33
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:07.830
which is something you might know by the name of the taint

34
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.150
that taint or we call it Aina genital distance. Yeah.

35
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.810
<v 0>It's not a real, it's not really a technical term, is it?</v>

36
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.970
<v 1>But I know genital distances. Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.300
<v 0>That's hilarious listening to a PhD. So.</v>

38
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.710
<v 1>I'm saying that because I'm talking to a lot of people who might not know.</v>

39
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.603
Yes.

40
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.020
I'm known on the street as the pain and um,

41
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.130
or the or the Grundle, or.

42
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.090
<v 0>That's never, you know, about the goods.</v>

43
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.000
I just saw some seven the other day didn't know what a tank was and they're

44
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.030
like, oh, you mean the? I've never heard the. Yeah.

45
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.210
I thought the goose was like a baseball player in that. Well,

46
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.240
it could be that also, but isn't there a guy named Pete he's named after.

47
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.520
<v 1>Sorry. I also ABC. Have.</v>

48
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.360
<v 0>You heard of ABC, ABC? No, I have not heard that. How's that going to go?</v>

49
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.360
Asphalt connector. Oh, the asphalt connector. Okay. Yep. Okay.

50
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.440
What about for a woman?

51
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.120
<v 1>Yes. You can measure. Yeah. It's not called, it's not called the ABC. Okay.</v>

52
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.840
So here you got this distance and um,

53
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.730
it's been measured in animals for like a hundred years and what they use it for

54
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.200
was first to just sex the animal. So the litter is born.

55
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.400
There's a lot of little pups.

56
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.830
They want to separate the males in the females because they're going to do

57
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:26.860
different things from them and they just hold them up by the tail and they look.

58
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.360
And the reason you can do this is because in the male, it's much longer,

59
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.210
it's 50 or 100% longer. Now this is stop and think about this.

60
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:38.710
There's nothing else in the body.

61
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:43.480
That's that different between males and females in terms of size organs. Yes.

62
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:48.430
But size, no, you know, our Heights don't differ by 50 to 100% or weights.

63
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:51.970
Nothing, nothing. It's this is it. This is the,

64
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.090
the mark. It's not in all animals. It's almost all mammals. Really?

65
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.800
The hyena is a little different. We could talk.

66
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.980
<v 0>A.</v>

67
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.040
<v 1>Whole bit about them. Yeah. Um, so, you know,</v>

68
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.870
they're ma the females are masculinized, so they have a longer AGD. Right.

69
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.970
But most, for most mammals, it's this way. Okay.

70
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.990
Including humans.

71
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.940
So here's this little pup that's born and he's,

72
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.460
if he's unexposed, he'll have a good, you know,

73
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:27.550
a standard penal size and AGD,

74
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.720
and he won't have any malformations of his penis and so on, you know,

75
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:36.040
he'll be normal. But if his mother was exposed to salads,

76
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.410
everything can go south.

77
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.540
And what happens is the penis is smaller and the AGD is smaller

78
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.070
and the scrotum is smaller and the testes are maybe not descended.

79
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:53.050
In other words, it didn't finish the process. It was arrested if you will.

80
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.050
So we say that that, that pup is incompletely masculinized. Now.

81
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.030
<v 0>The amount of ballots that get into the pup system in,</v>

82
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.270
in Veeder, in, in utero, is that the same?

83
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.870
Is it possible to achieve those levels in the modern world with human beings?

84
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.560
<v 1>And I'm going to tell you what I did to show that I showed that,</v>

85
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.240
wow. So when I heard this story,

86
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.680
I was flying on a plane to Japan to go to a conference.

87
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.270
I was with a friend who was a chemist for the centers for disease control.

88
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.830
And he said, Shauna, you should study fallates and I'm going,

89
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.280
why I'd never heard of them? [inaudible]

90
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.280
. And he said, well, we have been measuring them at the CDC. And they're in everybody, 

91
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.280
they're

92
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.280
 in pregnant women. And this group of scientists in the national toxicology program has shown that they altered the development of the male newborn. And they called that the salad syndrome. That's what it's called. That collection of changes that come about after the mother has 

93
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.280
salads is called the salad syndrome. So I thought, well, does that happen in

94
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.113
 humans? Same question us. Right. So how do you, how would you, how would you answer that question then? I'll tell you what I did.

95
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.820
<v 0>How would I, well,</v>

96
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.980
you would hope that you're not running experiments.

97
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:33.830
Like you're running them on animals, right? Um,

98
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.750
are you measuring the blood of the people that are

99
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.430
having children that have issues like with, with,

100
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.780
uh, development,

101
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.690
development issues and the way the children look when they're born?

102
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.033
Is that what you're doing?

103
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.190
<v 1>It's really close. So</v>

104
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.280
that lights have the property that they dissolve in water and water soluble.

105
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.620
And so they go into the urine. So for this class of chemicals,

106
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.840
if you want to know how much is in your body and my body,

107
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.030
we got to measure the urine, other chemicals, um, like flame retardants,

108
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.060
we would look in the blood. So it depends what, what the chemical is, but,

109
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.390
but you're the right idea. Look inside the body. Okay.

110
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.990
Then rather than looking at kids with problems,

111
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.010
what I did was I just took a whole population of pregnant women

112
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.900
and I got their urine, measured, their salads,

113
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.320
got their kids, measured their kids.

114
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.250
So then I had the problem of what to measure in the kids,

115
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:42.080
because nobody had made this translation from an animal

116
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.450
genital development system to a human.

117
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.650
And so that was kind of a challenge, you know, figuring out how to do that.

118
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.840
But we did that and we developed this system for this exam for measuring

119
00:07:56.841 --> 00:08:00.350
all these things that you measure in a rat. We measured it at our children.

120
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.410
And then we showed,

121
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.780
and this was big news when it came out that the mother's salads did alter

122
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.150
the generals of the boys.

123
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.120
So that was the first evidence that was 2005.

124
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.410
And then we published some more in 2008. And then we,

125
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.650
fortunately I got money to do it all again.

126
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.640
And age doesn't like to pay for replication. It's very expensive.

127
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.770
These things are $5 million a study by the way.

128
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.260
<v 0>Well, it seems like it's very important.</v>

129
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.670
<v 1>Though. Yeah. So they gave it to me. They gave him my money to do it again.</v>

130
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.590
So the second time I did a better, because I really knew what I was looking for.

131
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.880
And I got urine actually in three points in pregnancy.

132
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.850
And I measure the kids exactly when they're born.

133
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.990
So everything was much more precise. And I found it again.

134
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.180
So now there's no question.

135
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.680
I don't think anyone questions that at least this class of chemicals,

136
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:06.060
which we know lower testosterone alter the

137
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:09.150
development of these boys.

138
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.870
And then I asked, well, what does that have to do with sperm count?

139
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.400
Cause actually for a long time, we haven't talked yet about sperm count,

140
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.390
but I've been studying tracing, you know, what's happening with sperm count. Um,

141
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.560
I'll tell you the history of that in a minute. But so then I thought, well,

142
00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:27.510
is this related to sperm count? Well,

143
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:29.340
these are babies that don't have a sperm count,

144
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:35.790
but in rats it looked like the AGD was permanent.

145
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.200
So if you were had a short and just like, if you have a small hand, you know,

146
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:44.280
your stature's certain set it at birth, right? So the AGD,

147
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:48.420
if you're born small and my friend Earl gray, who was a toxicologist said, AIG,

148
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.550
do's forever. We don't know that for sure about humans by the way. But,

149
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.410
um, cause we haven't had the 20 years yet. But um, if you believe that,

150
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:03.360
then a sensible thing to do was to take a group of adult men who could give

151
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:07.200
you a sperm count and measure their HED. Right.

152
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:12.960
And then you could see whether those with a shorter AGD had a lower

153
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:17.820
sperm count and then you would have one pretty solid piece of evidence that

154
00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:20.550
chemicals in the environment, lower sperm count.

155
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.950
<v 0>Are you with me? Yes.</v>

156
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.650
<v 1>Ma'am. Okay. So I did that study too.</v>

157
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.560
So I got students in Rochester,

158
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:33.420
New York to volunteer for seventy-five bucks to

159
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:37.740
participate and they gave us a semen sample and they gave us opportunity to

160
00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:39.960
measure them also a questionnaire.

161
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.810
<v 0>How does one measure kids taints?</v>

162
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.170
Do they just bend over and you bust out a ruler? I happened.

163
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.910
<v 1>To bring it, bring you something to.</v>

164
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.400
<v 0>Show this. I noticed you had this measuring device.</v>

165
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.170
Jamie's volunteered to let you measure his tank by the way.

166
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.410
<v 1>So, um, this is not for a baby. This is for,</v>

167
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.190
this is for our Rochester young men's study. Um,

168
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.930
and it's looks kind of fierce. Um,

169
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.770
but we had the points taken down and I.

170
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.830
<v 0>Use one of those to measure a pool. Q-tips there you go.</v>

171
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.530
<v 1>All right. So you know all about it. It's true.</v>

172
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.890
<v 0>You want 13 millimeters? That's what I like, but only for.</v>

173
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.690
<v 1>So look, um, I also brought you a little diagram,</v>

174
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.610
so you see where we measure. Okay. But we can't show this to.

175
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.610
<v 0>So the calipers are in there in millimeters or inches or bolts. Yes.</v>

176
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.480
<v 1>Both. You can come. Yeah. Yeah. And, and so what you do.</v>

177
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.750
<v 0>Oh, you got a diagram chart online. I could look up like a, a,</v>

178
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.350
how would I just hold this up?

179
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.870
<v 1>Yeah. Yup. All right.</v>

180
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.360
Can we have a selfie with you and me in that picture?

181
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.590
Okay. All right. So what I wanted to,

182
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.720
so when I publish this, the, uh, the headlines were size matters,

183
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.820
but it's not what you think. Right. And so I got all these people asking me,

184
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.690
what should it be? What's good enough. What's big enough.

185
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.100
So I did this translation from the millimeters for you. So here it is,

186
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.640
the two inches is, is the media

187
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.760
okay. And in this population and, um,

188
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.983
here's the kicker.

189
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.760
If it was less than two men who had less than two inches were

190
00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:46.510
seven times more likely to have a sperm count in the

191
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.780
subfertile range. I can tell you what that is.

192
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.770
As men who had an AGD longer than two inches.

193
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.370
Wow. Seven times

194
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.480
it's certainly is related to sperm count.

195
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.460
And then another study in California showed that infertile men in an

196
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:08.920
infertility clinic versus men who had come had born,

197
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.890
a child had smaller

198
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.280
taint length. When.

199
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.380
<v 0>Did this stuff start getting into our food supply? Does that,</v>

200
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:21.970
is that been estimated?

201
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.340
<v 1>So the growth of these chemicals,</v>

202
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.760
um, tracks with the growth of

203
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.240
the petrochemical industry, because they're made from petrochemical byproducts.

204
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.310
Okay. So if you look at a curve of the growth, it starts around the 50, 19 50.

205
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.490
Okay. So back in 1950,

206
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.430
you have people loving science,

207
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.800
jumping on the science bandwagon.

208
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.970
There's this better living through chemistry that everyone's talking about.

209
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.740
And it's everybody is just wanting everything made of plastic.

210
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.490
You know, it's the new, it's the new craze, it's the new, you know, and,

211
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.210
and it just took off. It went faster than a straight line, you know,

212
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.720
exponentially up. And so somewhere in there,

213
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:16.000
it started having an effect, but where we're not sure,

214
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.290
but I did look at the decline in sperm count over time.

215
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:25.150
So we could look at that as an indication that this is not the only

216
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:28.000
thing that's affecting sperm count by the way, these salads.

217
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.690
But that's one where I feel,

218
00:14:31.691 --> 00:14:36.430
I can say this with confidence because I measured those babies. And I, you know,

219
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.340
I did it, I did the science and I did it again. And I, you know,

220
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.020
and other people have done it. And, and so it's, it's,

221
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.350
I believe it's solid. And, um,

222
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.040
that's just one example of the many chemicals that can affect our hormone

223
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:52.874
system.
