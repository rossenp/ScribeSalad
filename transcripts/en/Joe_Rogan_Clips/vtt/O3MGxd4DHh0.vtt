00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, uh, Georgia,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.700
I think that you're probably like one of the most important figures when it

3
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:13.320
comes to journalism in UFO's. And when you, uh, broke the bog,

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.900
bizarre story was that, is that 89? When was that?

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.560
19 89, 89, 19 89. Um,

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.100
I remember reading about it. I remember hearing about it.

7
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.160
I remember watching clips on television and,

8
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:29.850
and watching countless Bob was our interviews. It all came out of you. I mean,

9
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:32.000
did you think at that time,

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.690
what was your thoughts about UFO's before you had met Bob Lasar and how much did

11
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:40.050
it change while you got to know him and hear his story?

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.520
<v 1>Uh, changed quite a bit? I had not really given it much thought at all. Uh,</v>

13
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:46.460
you know, probably the same level of curiosity. As most people,

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.550
you go about your life, you pay your bills, you go to work, you,

15
00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:52.940
you love your family. Uh, and it's always out there somewhere. Hey,

16
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:54.230
I wonder what the deal is on that,

17
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.270
but not had not really dwelled on it until it was a day in 1987

18
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.570
into the studio comes a guy named, um, John Lear.

19
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.590
And I had heard sort of a little bit about him. His family was famous.

20
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:09.020
His dad developed the Learjet, the eight track tape.

21
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.490
John had run for the state Senate and he had a certain amount of credibility

22
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:15.860
with our news organization, Kaylee STB,

23
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.560
because he had helped us break a really big story.

24
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:21.440
And the story was the stealth fighter, the F1 17.

25
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.720
He had told my boss Ned day,

26
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.370
managing editor about this amazing plane that was invisible to radar flying up

27
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.180
and Tona pie and area 51. We had an interest in area 51,

28
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.410
not UFO related, but Ned broke that story. It went national.

29
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.040
So John Lear comes into the station one day with a stack of what turned out to

30
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:43.850
be UFO documents. He plops them on Ned's desk and says, Ned,

31
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:46.580
this is going to be the next biggest story. The biggest story in history,

32
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:50.750
it's a UFO coverup aliens are here. Technology has been recovered.

33
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.940
Ned takes a look at it and says, I'm not doing this story. If it was true,

34
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.460
I'd already know, know about it. Ah, this is crazy.

35
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.320
Well I'm eavesdropping as I tend to do. I'm a curious person. So I,

36
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.320
as he's going out, I said, Lear, let me take a look at this material.

37
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.360
And I looked at it, I thought, well, this is kind of interesting.

38
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:12.610
I was at the time I was producing and hosting this little public affairs show,

39
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.100
30 minute interview show. It would air Sunday morning at six o'clock.

40
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.520
Nobody watches it. It would be, uh, interviewing a city, councilmen,

41
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:23.420
a county commissioner. What the heck I'll put Lear on there and I let them go.

42
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.310
And he told me this big scenario about secret treaties with aliens and

43
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.830
recovered technology and a giant coverup.

44
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.680
Some of the information sounded outrageous.

45
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.080
Some of it seemed like it would be worth checking out.

46
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.660
Suddenly the phone starts ringing off the hook.

47
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.510
I'm getting calls about people that w who was that guy?

48
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:44.870
What was the deal on that UFO stuff? Is it real? I had him on again,

49
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.600
six months later, the response was bigger, Adam,

50
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:52.340
on a third time with a guy named bill Cooper, I regret that. Um,

51
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.100
and he told him, and even more elaborate conspiracy.

52
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.130
<v 0>Here's the behold, the pale horse guy. Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.210
I read that book and halfway through, I was like, what in the is this? Yeah.

54
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.760
<v 1>We tied in the JFK assassination.</v>

55
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.790
<v 0>Bases on the moon. Aliens are there right now. He.</v>

56
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.190
<v 1>Had,</v>

57
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.890
he had this scenario where he had seen these documents when he was in the Navy.

58
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.430
And he's going to tell the world about it, then he's going to go away. Well,

59
00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:18.090
every time he told the story, the documents got bigger and bigger.

60
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.960
And anybody who criticized bill Cooper became part of the secret government,

61
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.823
including me.

62
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.360
So we do this third show with Lear and he hints that he knows a guy who might be

63
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.720
going to work out at area 51 and know something about alien technology.

64
00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:32.790
That guy turns out to be Bob Lasar,

65
00:03:32.791 --> 00:03:36.240
but Lear didn't give me the name at that time. A couple months later,

66
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.590
I am anchoring the five o'clock news on KLS. And, uh,

67
00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:44.940
we have a nightly or evening, uh, interview segment,

68
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.650
five minute segment live interview.

69
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.760
Our guests doesn't show up and we're scrambling to find somebody to fill that

70
00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:53.220
hole. And I thought about Lear. So I called him up,

71
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.060
not knowing what had been going on in Lazard's life or Lear's life. And I said,

72
00:03:57.061 --> 00:04:00.210
Hey, is your, uh, that UFO guy you told me about, is he around? What do you do?

73
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.230
An interview just turned out that Bob had been through the ringer and a lot of

74
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:07.680
stuff going on in his life. He felt threatened. And he said, yes,

75
00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:10.140
we had a blackout his face. We do this interview.

76
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:12.030
And he spills the basics of the story.

77
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.460
I worked out there at a place called [inaudible]

78
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.460
. I saw nine flying saucers and an underground base. This is technology that came from somewhere else. I'm in fear for my life. Holy cow, the 

79
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.460
phones

80
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.293
 start ringing off the hook. My news director comes rushing in the station manager. Is that for real? What's the deal on that? And we realized we had touched the pulse of the public in a way that I didn't really understand.

81
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.530
We arranged to go meet Bob. Lasar my news director, Bob Stonewall,

82
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.430
and I that following weekend and put it through a paces where we would ask him

83
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:43.770
questions about his background and how he got the job.

84
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.560
And we spent a couple hours with him when we walked out of that meeting,

85
00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:50.700
thinking, holy, what if this is true? Um, you know,

86
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.250
this is really risky for us as journalists.

87
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:55.800
It risky for our personal reputations.

88
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.240
If it blows up in our faces and we do this story and it would really damage the

89
00:05:00.241 --> 00:05:03.840
reputation of our news organization, which is KLS is a Juul.

90
00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:06.540
It's always been a leader in, in Las Vegas,

91
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.240
one of the best TV news operations in the country.

92
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.770
We're putting a lot on the line. Well, look, we decide, let's take our time.

93
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.640
Let's look into this guy's story. And then in order to understand, Lasar,

94
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.970
we'd have to look at the bigger picture of UFO's.

95
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.320
So I started a cram course on euphology and I read everything and I spent eight

96
00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:29.370
months like cramming for a final exam that never happened. I read everything.

97
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:34.110
I interviewed people that same year move on had it's it's entered international

98
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:38.700
symposium in Las Vegas, and they're all the world's UFO people came right to me.

99
00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:42.750
I got to interview them, traveled around, went to Los Alamos of Lasar,

100
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:46.800
took us into the lab. We took cameras in there. He walked us around,

101
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.760
waving to people. We didn't even have to stop for security,

102
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.400
took us into the, the lab, like, uh,

103
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.030
it was a rabbit going through its own burrow. He knew his way around.

104
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.830
We were allowed to take a camera in there. We put those stories together,

105
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.330
put them on the air in November. And man, it just went through the roof.

106
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.430
Um, every night of these nine, this nine part series people got, uh, the,

107
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:13.550
the audience got bigger phones ringing off the hook. People calling,

108
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:16.790
giving us information, suddenly it's on something called para net,

109
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:21.260
which was a sort of a precursor to the internet. And it was huge. And, and, um,

110
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.250
it changed my life for sure. I had no idea that, uh,

111
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.450
there were so many people out there interested in the topic and I was hooked and

112
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:34.280
I really got hooked on Lozar not only because his story, um, uh, personally,

113
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.500
you know, I was interested in him. We became friends.

114
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.390
I saw what happened to him after that live interview and in the seven and a

115
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:44.450
half months before we went and I revealed his identity.

116
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.840
People really messing with them. I mean, there were,

117
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.300
you cannot convey what it was like,

118
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:54.080
how weird it was then breaking into his house, leaving the windows, open,

119
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.800
messing with things in his, in his home, breaking into his car,

120
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:00.800
leaving the doors and windows down, just messing with his head.

121
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.070
And you think that was the government that was doing that? I do. I think so.

122
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:06.800
And then, so I had put out a call to people, Hey,

123
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:10.600
I want other people to come forward before his identity was revealed.

124
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.660
We should explain. Yes. I am actively seeking information from the public.

125
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:18.710
If you ever worked at area 51 or S four, you know anything about this,

126
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.810
you're at Nellis air force base reach out to me.

127
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.200
So I started getting calls and six people,

128
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:28.160
right in a row who had talked to me on the phone and offered to give me

129
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:31.340
information were visited right after the call. Um,

130
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:35.150
one of them was a guy who did tax returns for people at Nellis air force base.

131
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:39.500
And he got to know these guys really well and got information about crashes.

132
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.540
There was a guy who was a golf pro at Nellis who had gone on our road

133
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.340
road trips with officers and told them about this weird stuff out at area

134
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:52.280
51 that seemed to be from somewhere else. Uh,

135
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.990
he gets visited and told to shut up.

136
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.490
There was a lady who worked in the court system, a cop, uh, told me about her.

137
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.060
And I talked to her on the phone. And, uh, she had worked at the court system,

138
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:05.810
but before she had worked for a company called homes and Narbor,

139
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.000
which is a defense contractor. And she said,

140
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:12.560
she sat in as a stenographer in these meetings and heard these conversations

141
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:15.380
between the government contractors and, um,

142
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.180
air force officials about crash saucers. And they would, after the meeting,

143
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:22.430
they, uh, took, take the tape, uh,

144
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.340
out of the typewriter and destroy it and take all the notes.

145
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:29.690
And she agreed to tell me this story. It was just a tiny piece of the story.

146
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:34.460
The next day, she's visited by these two guys in suits. They tell her,

147
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.760
um, look, you are still subject to your security clearance.

148
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.590
I hope you know that. And then they said,

149
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.060
we know you traveled to LA to see your daughter. And we know she comes here.

150
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.370
It's a big desert out there. It'd be terrible.

151
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:49.280
If something happened to either one of you, this lady is scared shitless.

152
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.780
She didn't make that stuff up.

153
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.230
So six people who had offered to give me information on the phone one,

154
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:57.300
right after another get visited. And it, it made me mad.

155
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.480
It also made me mad that dealing with, you know,

156
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:04.350
trying to fill in pieces of Bob bazaars life. I know there's some gaping holes.

157
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:08.400
I know it better than anybody. I've had to deal with it for 31 years,

158
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.200
but always thought if,

159
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:15.000
if he worked at Los Alamos in classified projects and a scientific or technical

160
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.133
capacity,

161
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.730
then it would make sense that he could get hired into a program like us for, um,

162
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.620
as somebody who thinks outside the box,

163
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.950
despite personal shortcomings or whatever,

164
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.580
they might bring somebody like him in to help them crack a problem that they

165
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:32.880
hadn't been able to resolve themselves. So I focused on Los Alamos.

166
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.620
I knew he had been there.

167
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.810
I talked to people who remembered him from being there,

168
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.050
but the lab kept telling me no, no record of him. He's never here.

169
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.280
And then I showed him, well, look, I've got the Los Alamos newspaper.

170
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.330
It's a small town paper. There it is on the front page, front page story.

171
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.840
Bob Lasar physicist, Mason facility, Los Alamos lab.

172
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.460
It's a story about his jet car. Nope. Still have no records of him. And,

173
00:09:56.461 --> 00:10:00.090
and then I found his name in the phone book from the era when he was there.

174
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:03.870
He's in the lab phone book, he had been hired by a company called Kirchmeier,

175
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:05.220
which is a company that's, uh,

176
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:10.170
a head hunter that fills positions at Los Alamos and places like that. So great.

177
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.230
I'll reach out to Kirchmeier. They said, yeah, we hired him. Yeah,

178
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:14.700
we've got records. Can I get it?

179
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.360
Can I get his employment records that would show where he went to school,

180
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.890
whatever information you guys had. Yes. A couple of weeks go by nothing.

181
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.970
Um, a couple more weeks go by. I call him again. I start writing them.

182
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:30.390
I've got a stack of letters that, that went on for two and a half years.

183
00:10:30.391 --> 00:10:32.730
And finally, by the end of it, they said he was never here.

184
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.560
We don't have any records that, that me off. It made me mad. And I think that,

185
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:40.470
that is really what got me hooked in the story, um,

186
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.900
is that I was being jacked around by government and national facilities that.

187
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.090
<v 0>We should explain the Los Alamos thing.</v>

188
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.100
Cause the Los Alamos thing coincided with him doing work at MIT. Right.

189
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:52.970
Is that correct?

190
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.630
That's how he's explained to you explained and the way he explained it to me,

191
00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.220
I don't think I'm at Liberty to say what the project was because the project,

192
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.250
the way he was describing it is, uh,

193
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.360
essentially internationally illegal, like what they were working on.

194
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.720
And that's one of the reasons why he was saying,

195
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.400
he explained what the project was. It sounded very feasible, also very evil.

196
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.030
And then it was, it was basically a weapon.

197
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:25.250
And then he said that this was the reason why there was no actual record

198
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.210
of him studying at MIT. It wasn't important that he got a degree.

199
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:34.190
It was important that he understand that the technical specifications of what

200
00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:35.600
they were attempting to accomplish.

201
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.970
<v 1>That's my understanding as well. And you know,</v>

202
00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:40.880
it's always been the most problematic part of his background.

203
00:11:40.881 --> 00:11:43.460
And it's where a lot of people in the Bob, those are story.

204
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.360
That's where they stop.

205
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.100
<v 0>But th the thing is when you listen to him talk, and when he describes thing,</v>

206
00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:50.510
it's very clear. He's educated.

207
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:55.630
<v 1>All, he's a brilliant guy, but here's, I'd always told him. And you know, Bob,</v>

208
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.381
you're my friend.

209
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:59.170
I want to have a conversation with you about these claim degrees.

210
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.660
Cause I didn't believe that he'd ever sat down. You know,

211
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:05.560
in those days you go to a college like MIT or Caltech and get a degree.

212
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:08.440
You've got to take classes in something other than science you'd have. Yeah.

213
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.340
I could not imagine Bob was, are taking an English lit class to save his life,

214
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.670
but he is a brilliant guy. He I'll give you an example in April. COVID thing is,

215
00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:20.440
is raging. My wife and I are staying at home.

216
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.680
We're getting packages delivered for food and things of that sort.

217
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:26.290
I'm a little worried. They didn't know about contact.

218
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.110
Whether you can get it off at cardboard boxes or whatever.

219
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.480
And I mentioned to Bob in a phone conversation,

220
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.530
I'm thinking about buying one of these UV screener systems. He goes,

221
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:37.690
wait a second, don't buy one.

222
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.870
I think I've got the parts that I can make you one in my garage.

223
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.560
And a week later it arrives this thing. He's got it in his garage,

224
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.370
handmade this big scanner with these UV things that don't work.

225
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:50.050
So he just whipped it up in his garage.

226
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.670
<v 2>Remind you, you got the scanner. I got a laser gun. You got a laser gun.</v>

227
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.480
Did man. It is super powerful.

228
00:12:57.481 --> 00:13:00.690
So it's like a handheld toy that he retrofitted with a superpower.

229
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.090
So I'm like lighting on fire in my house. Well.

230
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.610
<v 0>It looks like a handheld toy, but it's actually.</v>

231
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.860
<v 2>A real, it's a toy with full noise,</v>

232
00:13:07.861 --> 00:13:12.240
but he put a diode in there and it's super powerful. Like it can light on fire,

233
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.940
but why pay such? So I got the laser gun. You.

234
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.490
<v 1>Also got the flame thrower though. Lozar made a flame thrower.</v>

235
00:13:17.491 --> 00:13:21.150
This is before your buddy Elan made Flint. Well,

236
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.580
I made a flame through massive.

237
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.620
<v 0>Yeah, he's obviously a very intelligent man. Um, when you listen to him talk,</v>

238
00:13:28.621 --> 00:13:31.410
there's no bullshitting going on. When he talks about very,

239
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.420
when he talks about undeniable concrete things, when it comes to science,

240
00:13:36.421 --> 00:13:40.080
when it comes to elements, when it comes to propulsion systems,

241
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.970
he clearly knows what he's talking about.

242
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.620
And the really confusing thing for people that are

243
00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:50.790
detractors is he really hasn't changed his story in 31 years.

244
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.540
It really is the same story and that's really hard to do. Right. Okay.
