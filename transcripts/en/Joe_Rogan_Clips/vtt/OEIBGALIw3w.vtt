00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.600
<v 2>I wanted to have you on, first of all,</v>

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.840
cuz I really respected that you made this change of opinion

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.520
publicly when you were first talking about marijuana, uh,

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.240
you were talking about it as if it had no medical benefit and it was really just

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.950
a recreational drug that was possibly or probable harmful.

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.670
Is that a assessment that you agree with? Yeah.

8
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.030
<v 1>I, I, I think it certainly didn't seem to have any medicinal benefit. Right?</v>

9
00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:28.700
Yeah. But.

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.470
<v 0>Then upon further examination you publicly changed</v>

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.910
your position and, and you in,

12
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.860
in doing so you actually examined all the scientific evidence that pointed

13
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.860
to for many people with diseases, many people that are on chemotherapy,

14
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.660
many people with, um, you know, some serious ailments,

15
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.420
marijuana can be very beneficial.

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.820
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you talked about that and I really admired that cause

17
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:57.020
that takes a lot of courage cuz a lot of people when they, um,

18
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.050
have an idea and they proclaim it publicly, they double down and just,

19
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.410
you know, use confirmation bias and whatever, you know,

20
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.210
echo chamber news sources,

21
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.250
they can get to sort of confirm their initial position and you didn't do that.

22
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.250
And I, I thought that's a real,

23
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.010
a real thinking person who is trying to

24
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.600
honestly figure out what's going on instead of just working on being right.

25
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.960
<v 1>Well, I look, I, I appreciate that. And I have been very, very,</v>

26
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.760
it was very illuminating for me because I think the way that we become a more

27
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:39.640
knowledgeable society, I think sometimes surprises people. Um,

28
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.001
I do think,

29
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.950
and maybe this will dovetail even to a little bit of what's going on now, but,

30
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:47.870
but the thing is that when, when you looked at the,

31
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.390
so if you were just to look at the bulk of evidence around cannabis

32
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.750
at that, and I'm talking, I wrote this time magazine article back, you know,

33
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:57.584
this is probably 12,

34
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.430
13 years ago and I looked at the bulk of evidence and you say, okay,

35
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.340
I'm gonna just look at the 400, most recent paper. I'm gonna read the abstracts.

36
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:07.740
I'm gonna dig in deep on some of them. And 94% of them were,

37
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.780
were basically the hypothesis was where's the harm here? Show me the harm.

38
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.940
Right? The hypothesis was not show me the benefit.

39
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.820
That was only true for about 6%. So right away,

40
00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:22.340
you're dealing with a sort of very biased sort of set of data.

41
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.890
And that's one stream 'em up. Now, if you're just looking at papers,

42
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:27.770
you're like, well this one potentially long harm, this one possible addiction,

43
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.770
this one gateway, you know, you're seeing all those individual studies,

44
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.970
but at a broader level, one step upstream,

45
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:36.290
you realize that most of the studies that are getting funded are designed to

46
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.850
look for harm, right? Yeah. So when I saw that,

47
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.890
that was the first time I thought, well, why,

48
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.570
why are the studies that are getting out there?

49
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.200
Why are they all all designed to look for harm?

50
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.840
Then I started looking at other countries and some really good research out of

51
00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:54.400
places like Israel in particular guy named Roth Ulum who's 91 years old.

52
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.000
Now he was the first guy to I ever isolate THC and then synthesize it.

53
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.680
He's been doing this work forever.

54
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:03.040
He may get the Nobel prize before he dies for, for his work in this.

55
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.160
They were talking about the use of cannabis for all sorts of ailments,

56
00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:10.960
including refractory seizures in kids. Hmm.

57
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.760
And that one really, that really got to me for a couple reasons.

58
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.120
One is that I think when you're trying to do studies on things like pain,

59
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.910
it it's hard. It's a subjective thing. Right. And so you think is, is how,

60
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.370
how do you,

61
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.990
how do you really have conclusive proof that this is working the way that you

62
00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:29.590
think it is? Someone says their pain is better and that's important,

63
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.030
but how do you measure that a little child who's having 300 seizures a week and

64
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:37.590
is now not having seizures is a much more specific sort of metric.

65
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.140
And it, it seemed to work really well in,

66
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.780
in kids who did not respond to existing seizure drugs, which,

67
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.140
which was kind of amazing to me.

68
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.020
And I think I told you when we've spoken before that, that to me,

69
00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:54.740
in some ways that wasn't just a, a medical issue at that point,

70
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.620
it was a moral issue because nothing worked for these kids.

71
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.170
They were thinking about even compounding veterinary medications for them.

72
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.890
And these parents are like, you know, in their kitchen sinks, stirring up,

73
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.170
you know, cannabis, trying to get the formulation, right.

74
00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:12.090
To turn it into an oil or a tincture they could put underneath the kid's tongue.

75
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.490
And, and it was working. And, you know,

76
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:17.730
I did stories on these kids and they were emblematic of thousands of more kids.

77
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:21.400
These weren't just anecdotal stories. And that's when I said, you know,

78
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:23.760
there's something here, but I gotta tell you, um,

79
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.720
when I wrote the article saying, I changed my mind on this, you know, you know,

80
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:32.680
you hit send at night and then you wake up in the morning and,

81
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.040
and I work at a university, I'm a, I'm a practicing physician. You know,

82
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.550
I live in that world. And part of me did wonder, like,

83
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.110
what is the response going to be?

84
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.870
I felt very comfortable with what I had written,

85
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.790
what I did not know was how it would be received. Yeah. And that, and that's,

86
00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:53.390
that's always a challenge, I think. How was it received? I think, well,

87
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.150
I'm still employed. So that, that part of it was good. You know, I, I, yeah.

88
00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:59.750
I didn't know if my chairman would say, Hey, look, you know, uh,

89
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.900
I may agree or not agree with you.

90
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.540
That's beside the point you shouldn't have done this or whatever. I, I, I,

91
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.260
you know, I had no idea how they were going to respond.

92
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.060
I think it was received well, Joe, I think that, um,

93
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.340
it added to the knowledge tree of,

94
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.620
of how we advance the society.

95
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.340
<v 0>There's a sign of the times. I think,</v>

96
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.820
I think if you had done that a couple of decades ago,

97
00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:23.530
maybe there'd been a lot more pushback. I think people are coming to, uh,

98
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.410
much more of an understanding and, and, and also the logical

99
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.010
aspect of it. Like when,

100
00:05:31.011 --> 00:05:36.010
when people look at all the things that human beings are allowed to consume

101
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.290
and including this, uh, that you gave me here,

102
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.880
this looks pretty spectacular.

103
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.640
<v 1>I'm pretty proud of my gift that I've given you here. Some serious.</v>

104
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.560
<v 0>Bourbon here. Well.</v>

105
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.600
<v 1>But thank you for that for the man who has everything.</v>

106
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.600
<v 0>This is, um, legal, you know, I mean, we can enjoy a glass it's normal,</v>

107
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.720
it's a normal thing. And we all agree to that. It's, it's a, you know,

108
00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:01.920
it's a longstanding tradition for people to drink alcohol,

109
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.880
socially marijuana, for whatever reasons.

110
00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:07.200
And we could go into that if you want,

111
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.120
but it's been demonized unfairly.

112
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.160
And people know that it's not like heroin or crack or things that you've seen.

113
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:18.390
People eyes fall apart on it on a regular basis.

114
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.670
And I think most people are aware of that now. So in the,

115
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.030
the era that you publish that it's people have come to an understanding that

116
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.870
it's not, it's not one of the hard drugs.

117
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.190
It's not the most dangerous thing in the world. It's not good for kids.

118
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.230
It's not good for some people it's not good for some people maybe with, uh,

119
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.540
possible schizophrenic tendencies. I think, uh, there's a real concern there.

120
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.733
Yeah. And, uh.

121
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.020
<v 1>No, I, I mean, yeah, I, you know, it, it's, it you're,</v>

122
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.460
you raise a really important point. You know, one thing I,

123
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.420
I tried to stay away from whenever I wrote about this was I felt like was a

124
00:06:51.421 --> 00:06:55.380
little bit of a trap to get into the moral equivalency of things. Mm-hmm,

125
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.460
&lt;affirmative&gt; like, I think things should just stand on their own two feet.

126
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.410
Yeah. You know, well, it's better than this, right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it,

127
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:01.290
what you're saying is true.

128
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.570
I feel like alcohol can be a sledgehammer to the brain. I really do.

129
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.130
If you think about the way alcohol affects the brain,

130
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.370
very different than the way cannabis affects the brain. Um, and that,

131
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:13.290
that part of it is true,

132
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.600
but the idea that it could be a medicine in particular I'm mean, you know,

133
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.320
I, I think that that, that is really quite striking and it's a plant,

134
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.760
you know, and there's all these things. And I listen, like I said,

135
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:28.360
I listen to your podcast and I listen to Brett and I listen to others and I get

136
00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:30.440
the points that they're making about that in terms of,

137
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.200
can you look to the earth to heal? And oftentimes you can, you know,

138
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.160
we've been given a lot of things, but I think that with,

139
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:40.710
with cannabis in particular, the, the evidence,

140
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.270
I'm not the first to say this.

141
00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:45.150
Obviously people have been saying this for a long time.

142
00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:47.670
Maybe the timing was right. But two decades ago,

143
00:07:47.671 --> 00:07:49.710
people were saying this three decades ago, people were saying this,

144
00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:51.710
this was on the formulary in the United States,

145
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.310
in the 1940s post re reefer madness,

146
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:59.940
which I think was like 1936 or something like that. People were already saying,

147
00:07:59.941 --> 00:08:02.420
Hey, wait a second. This could be used to treat addiction.

148
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.060
This could be used to treat, you know, even, uh, Parkinsonian like symptoms.

149
00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:08.860
There was all these things that they were putting out there.

150
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.980
And then it went through this cultural sort of assassination for a while,

151
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:15.900
which was, which was wild to sort of reflect on historically.
