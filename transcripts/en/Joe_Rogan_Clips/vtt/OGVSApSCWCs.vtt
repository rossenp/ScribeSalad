00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now the Russians got a bunch of them for their rocket,</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.170
probably all.

3
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 1>The Egyptians did. Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
The Egyptians were trying to create a delivery system to drop bombs into Israel.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.750
And then Ben-Gurion started having these Nazi scientists try to have them

6
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:18.750
assassinated. They were mailing the massages. How are you familiar with this?

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.880
The Masada was mailing packaged bombs into Egypt and throughout Europe trying

8
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:28.290
to kill these, these German scientists. And they were all German Nazi

9
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.670
rocket guys that were working for Egypt, Egypt,

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.150
and Egypt wanted to go blow up Israel. This is into the sixties.

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.120
So they're still trying to find ways to kill the Jews. And they're like,

12
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.740
oh yeah, we'll go work for you Egypt. You know? So it sounds crazy.

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.260
<v 0>Is how technologically advanced the Germans were so far ahead of us.</v>

14
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.320
It's so amazing. And to this day you drive a BMW and you go, whoa,

15
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.530
you mother are on point like.

16
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.340
<v 1>Chevy Malibu right now. And I'm like, you, yeah.</v>

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.870
<v 0>Drive a Corvette, get a new Corvette. They're pretty. It's on what you buy.</v>

18
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:07.730
But I mean, you mean there's German engineering in the eighties is phenomenal.

19
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.061
I mean,

20
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:11.660
if you drove a German car from the 1980s and an American car from the eighties,

21
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.580
it's like, there's no comparison.

22
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.100
Now I have a 1991 Porsche and it's a piece of

23
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.990
engineering, man. It's a Marvel of engineering. It's not fast like a modern car,

24
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.070
but when you compare like the build quality and how they constructed it,

25
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.410
how it was put together in comparison to a, you know,

26
00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:35.660
a Dodge Daytona from 1990, that's a hunk of.

27
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.850
Nobody wants one of those. Yeah.

28
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.360
<v 1>Well, unless you're going to build a VB ID, then you want it. Oh,</v>

29
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.420
that's the only time you'd if you could blow it up. Yeah. Again.

30
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.400
<v 0>It's you, the way you think is different, you know,</v>

31
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.980
13 year old child trafficking, counterfeits. Yeah.

32
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.700
<v 1>Yeah. It's, we'll be,</v>

33
00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:56.600
we'll be in some country and I'll be walking by and I'll look at a car and be

34
00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:00.460
like, that would make a great bomb. I just swear to God,

35
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.770
she'll go through my head. Oh, you know? Yeah.

36
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.330
<v 0>Yeah. Well, that's how the business works. Yeah. Yeah. We'll grow up someday.</v>

37
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.400
So when you're over there in Argentina and you're meeting with these people

38
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.360
and you know that they're the descendants of Nazis and they'll,

39
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.070
they bring out this grandfather's chest of things and

40
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:25.940
war metals and all this jazz, like, what is this feeling like?

41
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:29.060
Do you feel like these people got away with something and then they kind of did,

42
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:30.800
but these aren't the people that did it,

43
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.010
but they're the descendants of the people that did it.

44
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:36.140
And they're still worshiping those people in some way.

45
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.790
<v 1>Yeah. I ha I had, um, I had a lot of soul searching,</v>

46
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.530
um, trying to figure out what is the, the appropriate thing.

47
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.780
What's the appropriate spots? What am I suppose,

48
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.500
what am I supposed to be feeling right now? And I think I'm a pretty, um,

49
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.700
exposed person. Like I'm in tuned with what I feel.

50
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.170
And, um,

51
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.350
one of the hardest days we're in Chile. And, um,

52
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.960
I interviewed this, this man, a woman and,

53
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.610
uh, they are both, one of them is a second generation.

54
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.680
So she was born on a Colonia Digna dad on this compound as a Nazi,

55
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.390
um, separated from her parents.

56
00:03:18.391 --> 00:03:20.400
She didn't know who her parents was and I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

57
00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:22.800
She was brought there at like age three or four,

58
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.440
but she grew up there and sh and they're separate from her.

59
00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:26.580
Parents didn't know who her parents was.

60
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.000
Her husband was a Chilean boy that was local.

61
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.790
And he heard about this new hospital. That's,

62
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.180
that's built by Dr. Mengele and, um,

63
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.630
how everybody has food there and he's a porch lane kid. So he,

64
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.520
he was able to get on to the, the compound. Um,

65
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.290
well, the locals and the Germans aren't supposed to be together.

66
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.830
So he was kind of kept separated. Well, because he was local.

67
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.060
They started testing him. Um, and

68
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.210
it got really violent and disgusting by the time he's a teenager he's been

69
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:05.910
thrown out of, out of windows, having his bones broken,

70
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.280
being nursed back to health, being set on fire,

71
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:12.120
be nurse back to health for like 10, 15 years.

72
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.450
He finally talks his,

73
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.460
what will be his future wife into escaping with him. And they sneak out on,

74
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.780
in a cheese truck because one of his friends, when he was a Chilean kid,

75
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:26.640
grew up to be a police officer in a nearby.

76
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.850
And he was able to get a letter out to them and be like, please come help us.

77
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.430
And they came in and do a health inspection and they hopped inside of this

78
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.290
cheese, cheese truck and they got away. So I'm,

79
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.210
I'm talking to this guy and he's telling me about the things that happen to him,

80
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.310
and I'm not going to get into it. I mean,

81
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:44.880
but they were the most horrible things that could happen to a little boy that

82
00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:49.470
you could imagine, you know, beyond rape, beyond being burnt, alive,

83
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.130
beyond being broken. I mean, for, for years and years and years,

84
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.350
and I'm shaking. Cause I, I, man, I'm an Afghanistan and you know,

85
00:04:58.351 --> 00:05:02.310
they threw some acid on some kids and I found those guys in the killed those

86
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:06.960
guys. Cause that's what you do when you, when you hurt little kids. Um,

87
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.460
you know, I got a soft spot for people that can't take care of themselves.

88
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.100
I can protect them.

89
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.150
So that's like every real human isn't going to let anything weaker them ever get

90
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:19.890
hurt in front of them. And so I'm shaking listen to this story, you know?

91
00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:23.430
And I was like, um, and I know I have to go back to Colonia,

92
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.560
digging down the next day and, and put on like,

93
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:29.010
I'm a tourist guy hosting a travel show. And that's was,

94
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.980
that's always our disguise to get in. There was like, oh, you know,

95
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:35.040
this is a beautiful Bavarian village. You can come here. That was the,

96
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.590
our little way in.

97
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.990
And I was just going to go in and destroy that whole entire place.

98
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.640
That was my plan. And the guy's looking at me and he's like, I,

99
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:48.810
I see your anger, you know? And I was like, yeah,

100
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.800
I'm going to go hurt all of them. He's like, no, no more pain.

101
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.950
Okay. What do you, what's going on?

102
00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:59.000
And he looks at his wife and he goes that's.

103
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.000
She saved me every time that I was burnt. Every time that was broken,

104
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:05.420
it was just love. That's how I got out. That's why we're alive today.

105
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:09.020
And we're going to die of old age together with the woman that I fell in love

106
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:13.250
with on this colony. The only thing that matters is love. And I was like, God,

107
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.000
I like you, but I still want to go hurt all of those people. You know?

108
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:17.834
So it was like.

109
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.380
<v 0>So these people that were doing this to him, what was, what was their objective?</v>

110
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.950
They wanted.

111
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.731
<v 1>To understand? I mean,</v>

112
00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:29.230
so the same test that Josef Mengele was doing in Germany in 1943,

113
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.350
he's now doing in Chile in 1953,

114
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.960
he just has a different population to test. They're not Jews,

115
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.640
they're Chalene boys. They're strong and they're wirey.

116
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.760
They need less food. They're not like the amusing quotation marks,

117
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:49.450
the cockroach Jews that you just couldn't kill. You know, these were,

118
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.220
these were young, strong Browns.

119
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.240
Like these are their words verbatim that I'm using, you know? And it was like,

120
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.210
yeah, I want to tear your guys' faces out and, you know,

121
00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:01.030
stick soldering irons in your ear because you guys are so evil,

122
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.310
but then I'm the same as them. So I was just really torn.

123
00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:04.720
I didn't know what to do. I just want to kill them all.

124
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.951
<v 0>Well,</v>

125
00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:10.690
it's the worst aspects of human beings is that this desire

126
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:11.440
to.

127
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.140
<v 2>Hurt people that are weaker than you would torture.</v>

128
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.110
<v 0>Them. And this is just coming into contact with that.</v>

129
00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:20.650
And then some guy who has this most beautiful response to it. Yeah. You know,

130
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.470
I'm a love saved. Got, I just want to die. Oh.

131
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.820
<v 1>Yeah. I'm a better human than I, so I never knew how to respond to these things.</v>

132
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.380
I wanted to, every time I'd see a new SS metal or I'd see, you know,

133
00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:37.120
like this, the, the cross that they won for valor, like crazy,

134
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.280
the equivalent of metal of honors these guys have in their parlors. Like

135
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.760
these were Nazis. You were, were you realized your grandpa. Yeah. Yes, yes.

136
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.890
Total pride swelling in their chest. You know, I was like, oh no,

137
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.210
cracking the face. Yeah. So.

138
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.370
<v 0>How did Mangola died? Did he die of old age?</v>

139
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.590
<v 1>He died on a beach in Brazil. His journal was found on the beach in Brazil.</v>

140
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.840
Yeah. Married a beautiful Brazilian girl. Wow.

141
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.460
Adolf Eichmann. He got snatched by, um, the,

142
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.780
the massage in Argentina scores and ski.

143
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:20.980
He died of old age actually in 19, uh, in the sixties,

144
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.090
the Egyptians, when they're trying to build that rocket plug program to,

145
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.960
to nearly the, uh, to Nayeli Israel scores,

146
00:08:28.961 --> 00:08:31.930
NC started working for the massage,

147
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.990
but he didn't really know it for they're paying him millions of millions of

148
00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:39.640
dollars to hold these parties for what he thought was the rise of the

149
00:08:39.641 --> 00:08:43.510
forthright. Whoa. Yeah.

150
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:48.250
So he was bringing in like CRA, um, Mercedes and, um,

151
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.080
crews, crews, steel, Cushner steel, crushed steel, these,

152
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.090
these massive billion dollar for the time he was hosting these

153
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.340
soirees and talking and having other high level Nazis that were still alive come

154
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.060
in.

155
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.560
And he was just really being used by the massage to try to figure out who was

156
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.360
facilitating this Egyptian rocket program.

157
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.820
<v 0>So they've just,</v>

158
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.180
we're putting on these parties to kind of get everybody together so they could

159
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.100
keep tabs on everybody and figure out who's who.

160
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.420
<v 1>That's, what the Mossad was doing.</v>

161
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.850
He was doing it with the intent of making the forthright. Yeah.

162
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.640
<v 0>So the massage did this and then what did they do once they figured out who was,</v>

163
00:09:25.641 --> 00:09:26.474
who.

164
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.270
<v 1>Finally they,</v>

165
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.560
I don't like this part cause I liked just getting killing bad people. Um,

166
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.360
they figured out that the,

167
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:40.130
the big problem with the delivery system for the Egyptians in their

168
00:09:40.131 --> 00:09:43.910
missile program was the navigation system.

169
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.340
And they are trying to hire a whole bunch of these experts, um,

170
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.710
to come work for this program.

171
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.960
And they diplomatically kind of went behind the back and they got all of

172
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.690
this, really the only experts in the world,

173
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.460
they prevented them from going and traveling to and work for Egypt. Um,

174
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.460
so they kind of diplomatically ended the,

175
00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:10.760
the development of the delivery system for their, their warheads.

176
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.590
<v 0>So that's how they handled it.</v>

177
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.000
<v 1>After they poisoned some people and they sent some mail bombs,</v>

178
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.220
they kidnapped a guy and tortured him and killed him. Yeah.

179
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.040
Re real torture, not, not fake torture.

180
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.900
<v 0>It's amazing how few people know about the Nazi</v>

181
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.690
escapees that went to south America. It's amazing how, when this,

182
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.020
this comes up, it's, it's relatively unknown. I mean,

183
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:43.370
your show has done a lot to shed some light on it and I've read some articles

184
00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:47.600
about Nazis that escaped to south America, but it's not common knowledge.

185
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.490
<v 1>No, by design. I mean, when you're down there, there is a,</v>

186
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.480
there's a shroud of silence. You, you,

187
00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:58.520
you're not supposed to talk about these things. The,

188
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.750
it takes a long time for me to get an interview with a guy.

189
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.410
It takes a long time for building rapport. I mean,

190
00:11:06.411 --> 00:11:10.220
we're talking like we, I have some pretty high level people working with me,

191
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.640
special operations from every single branch, um,

192
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.070
to include the CIA army special forces.

193
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.600
And we are pulling out every trick in the book to try to get these people,

194
00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:25.460
to talk to us, to include bribing them and the, um,

195
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.130
it's hard. So they, they still don't talk about it to this day. Do.

196
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.210
<v 0>You, did you have to bring in German speaking people? Yeah. A lot of time. Wow.</v>

197
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:43.160
I mean, what can be done? I mean, obviously there's not the same people.

198
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.860
Right. There's the people that benefited from the people that went down there.

199
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.180
So you're talking about like third generation removed, but what could be done?

200
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.760
Uh, the it's kind of the damage is right. Yeah. But.

201
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.540
<v 1>That's a lot of damage. Um, what can be done is the ideas can die. The,</v>

202
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.000
the ideas of, of fascism, the ideas of racism, the, the, those,

203
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.790
those things we can kill. Right. Um.

204
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:12.240
<v 0>But are, are those ideas, are they those ideas being fostered in these,</v>

205
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.660
these.

206
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.330
<v 1>Communities? Yes. Yeah. They're being cultivated.</v>

207
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.360
Yeah. Cause like you experienced it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if I'm a white guy,

208
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.520
white guy walking down the street, I am,

209
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.810
I am a higher degree than the locals, you know,

210
00:12:27.811 --> 00:12:30.810
like I can, I can go and shop in some places that they can't.

211
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.100
I can go in and sit down and have a meal in some places that they can't, I can,

212
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.700
I'm being greeted on the street and good Morgan, you know, like, um, not,

213
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.110
not the brown dude next to me. He's not. And his kid definitely can't date.

214
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.920
The blue-eyed blonde girl at the high school.

215
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.870
That's not allowed. So.

216
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.140
<v 0>They basically created these little colonies. Yeah.</v>

217
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.540
Yahtzee colonies in south America. Yeah.

218
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.900
<v 1>Did you Google, Google Clooney, Digna dad. Yeah. Did you,</v>

219
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.020
you will have nightmares, dude. I'm freaking out right now. It's time.

220
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.370
It's crazy. How many people.

221
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.780
<v 0>Got away with it that Josef Mengele died on a beach [inaudible] wife.</v>

222
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.880
<v 1>I mean, th that, that, that one hurts me.</v>

223
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.980
Cause he's a guy like me just on the ops.

224
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.580
Cause he he's a special operations guy. He was an SS. Um, he, he was,

225
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.490
he was a physical specimen, especially for the time, you know, like we didn't,

226
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.020
we didn't understand. I mean, he was,

227
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.330
he was very early on into the one of the first real

228
00:13:24.331 --> 00:13:28.170
Nazis like this isn't okay. All of Germany's going this way.

229
00:13:28.171 --> 00:13:32.280
The chancellor is Adolf Hitler. This is where we're going.

230
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:36.590
I kind of just have to go along and you see some of that in the third and the

231
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.040
like 43, 44. Um, now it's okay. We might be losing this war now.

232
00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:42.090
It's not so invoke.

233
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.920
But when you got guys like 1939 that are talking eugenics

234
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
and um, you know,

235
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:54.570
higher calling for breeding and segregation,

236
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.410
um, early on you're like, eh, I don't like that guy,

237
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.370
Kona beat him to death with my hands, but he's massive.

238
00:14:02.371 --> 00:14:07.170
So it'd be a pretty good fight. Yeah, it was uh, there we go.

239
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:07.620
Warm.

240
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.110
<v 0>Nazi cult, trying to, what does it say? Jamie was the.</v>

241
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.630
<v 1>Nazi Colt. What is the, uh, so that, that, that's just a marketing thing.</v>

242
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.250
Cause it's still the same place.

243
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.630
<v 0>Roughly warm Nazi cult, trying to open its colony to tourism. And where's this.</v>

244
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.250
<v 1>That's in Chile. Yeah. I S I spent a lot of time there, right there.</v>

245
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.400
<v 3>Oh, they made a movie about it.</v>

246
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.230
<v 1>So that's current day right there.</v>

247
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.870
<v 0>Jesus Christ.</v>

248
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.910
<v 1>That later in range is freaking gorgeous though. It's I mean, it is,</v>

249
00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:43.020
Shangri-La a German flag flying. Wow.

250
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.340
They've tried to hide the Nazi things. They've had I dinner right there.

251
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.540
Look at them all I know. I know that guy on the left do really? Yep.

252
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.100
What's that, bro. We talked in the Bertram butchery. There.

253
00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.260
<v 0>He is right now. Jacuzzi. Hi.</v>

254
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:04.810
<v 1>Yeah. Um, so I had this guy with me, Mike Simpson. He is a,</v>

255
00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.160
he works with me at sheep dog response. He's a doctor.

256
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.660
He was a ranger that became a green Baret that then went to medical school and

257
00:15:13.661 --> 00:15:18.160
then came back to special operations, um, for the rest of the war.

258
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.130
And he's our director of training for sheep, dog response. He was with me,

259
00:15:21.131 --> 00:15:22.990
he and I both speak Spanish when we were down there,

260
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.540
but they didn't know that he was a doctor and they didn't know that we spoke

261
00:15:25.541 --> 00:15:29.890
Spanish and they didn't know that our translator that looked very Chilean could

262
00:15:29.891 --> 00:15:34.360
also speak German, perfect German. She translates for Porsche. Um,

263
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.710
so they thought that they could have all these little conversations with the

264
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.730
stupid, hairy handed. Um,

265
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:44.590
Irish guy hosts from the tourism channel that, and they could get away.

266
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.980
Well, we understood everything that they're saying, are they saying,

267
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:53.140
so one of our tour guides was formerly a nurse in the hospital that they closed

268
00:15:53.141 --> 00:15:57.580
down and we stole one of their, their little ID cards to get into that hospital.

269
00:15:57.581 --> 00:16:00.400
And we stole a bunch of documents of them documenting them,

270
00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:03.610
torturing little kids in the hospital, in the hospital.

271
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.620
None of this made the air because it's, it's,

272
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.580
there's so much litigation going on where all of these victims of colonial Digna

273
00:16:09.581 --> 00:16:11.470
dad are suing via Bavaria.

274
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.830
<v 0>Time period. Are you talking about when they were torturing kids?</v>

275
00:16:13.831 --> 00:16:16.140
Like when was this sixties to nineties?

276
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.350
Wow.

277
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.960
And so this is essentially Nazis and the ancestors of Nazis carrying on those

278
00:16:24.961 --> 00:16:29.520
practices. Yeah. In secret. Yep. Jesus Christ.

279
00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:32.430
It's crazy, man. This isn't, this isn't just people that got away with it.

280
00:16:32.431 --> 00:16:35.250
And then their ancestors moved during the evolved and changed.

281
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:40.710
<v 1>Plus she saw the pictures [inaudible] that place is worth maybe a hundred</v>

282
00:16:40.711 --> 00:16:44.610
million dollars. And they bought that with Nazi money.

283
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.080
What do you do with that? Where does that go? Where does that go? I don't know.

284
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:50.760
I mean the Nazi money we're talking,

285
00:16:50.761 --> 00:16:54.870
we're talking melted fillings from Jews mouths.

286
00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.020
We're talking wedding rings off of juice fingers.

287
00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.480
They bought that land with that money

288
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:07.560
and it's gorgeous. Jesus Christ. And they have a German colony there.

289
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.660
What? Wow. I don't know. I don't know what the right answer is. I mean,

290
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.280
how does chili feel about it?

291
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.810
Chile has been in a tough position because of the amount of power that they have

292
00:17:15.811 --> 00:17:19.140
had their nobody. So in the, um,

293
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.940
in the sixties, they were at behest of the president.

294
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.850
They were bringing in, um,

295
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.980
people that disagreed with the dictator and they're torturing them and they're

296
00:17:31.981 --> 00:17:35.430
getting that information and giving it back to the president. Um,

297
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.500
well that went on for like 10 years.

298
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:42.510
And so the Nazis were doing that for yes. Okay.

299
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.480
For, um, oh my God.

300
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.390
<v 0>Whoever the dictator was at the time, but I'm so.</v>

301
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.721
<v 1>Embarrassed.</v>

302
00:17:48.721 --> 00:17:50.820
I can't remember name right now because it's around the tip of my tongue

303
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.910
anyways. But that information they also had.

304
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.040
So not only the information went back to the president that

305
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:02.370
he could use against his rivals, but they also had it.

306
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.950
So they know all the dirt about everybody they know who is having sex with who,

307
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.680
who has a kid with who, who went to this prostitute place,

308
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.760
who has a deal with the CIA. Who's working with the Venezuelans,

309
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.500
who's working with the Argentinians.

310
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.800
Like they have all that dirt because they gave it to the president.

311
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:20.963
They have it too.

312
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.830
So they had been untouchable politically for, you know, 30,

313
00:18:25.831 --> 00:18:29.970
40 years because they had so much power because they had so much information

314
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:35.130
because they had so much dirt on every single high ranking person

315
00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:37.450
