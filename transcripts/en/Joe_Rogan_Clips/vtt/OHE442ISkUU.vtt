00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.680
<v 2>What is going on today, where this is such a hot topic? Like what has hap,</v>

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.080
I mean, what has been the shift in our culture is,

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.520
is can you find a patient zero? Was there an,

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.880
an initial explosion that led to the domino effect? Like what,

6
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.070
what is it that's leading to such an utter fascination

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.310
culture wide about gender and sex.

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.830
Now it's like these, these hot, these are the big, hot topics of today.

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.670
It's gender sex race. And those, those things seem to, I guess,

10
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.820
also sexual orientation, gender, sex, race, sexual orientation, those three,

11
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.540
I mean, those four,

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.700
it is just unprecedented in our time that these are the most

13
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.580
widely talked about subjects across the board with young people and

14
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:57.620
people that are virtue signaling and people that want to be, you know,

15
00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:01.180
air quotes woke, like what's, what's causing this Colin help us out.

16
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.610
<v 1>You know, it's something I've been tracking for for quite some time,</v>

17
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:09.490
like a bounty hunter. Yes, exactly. Well, I, I was always,

18
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.530
so I started off in like the new atheist movement and I was arguing against

19
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.610
creationists and stuff and defending biological realities. And then that kind,

20
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.090
that movement kind of anticipated and,

21
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.730
or at least as not nearly as prevalent and they don't hold what happened with

22
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.960
new.

23
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.840
<v 0>There's I think is AISM plus.</v>

24
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.800
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

25
00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:30.400
there's an actually an interesting segue between atheism plus and the,

26
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.080
the modern social justice movement, as we see it now, I mean,

27
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.960
for sure atheism was the first movement to be infiltrated by all the language

28
00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:41.680
we're hearing now of, you know, appropriation and the whole, um, you know,

29
00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:43.230
check your privilege. And, well, I.

30
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.430
<v 0>Remember that, all that stuff. Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.590
I remember to watching atheism plus conferences online going, yeah,

32
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.750
this is like the,

33
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.750
the craziest virtue signaling event that I've ever seen in my life.

34
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.230
Cause it's people that don't just want to talk about the concept of agnostic

35
00:01:58.231 --> 00:01:59.750
thinking or atheism,

36
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.100
they wanna also attribute a bunch of values to this

37
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.300
movement that makes it kind of like a religion.

38
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.220
<v 1>Have you heard of elevator gate yes. With Richard Dawkins yes.</v>

39
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.660
Involved in that home. Yes. Yeah. That was sort of the,

40
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.380
the thing that sparked off in a big way, the,

41
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.900
the rise of a lot of social justice stuff and the fall, could.

42
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.820
<v 0>You explain to don't know what it was about?</v>

43
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.170
<v 1>Yeah, it was a while ago. Let me see if I can outline it a bit here.</v>

44
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.970
So there had been some complaints at a lot of atheist conferences where,

45
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.290
um, there had been, uh,

46
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.530
people complaining of sexual harassment and there was one specific example.

47
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.090
There was a speaker, her name was Rebecca Watson.

48
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.880
She went by skeptic and she was giving a, got this conference,

49
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.680
uh, specifically addressing sexism in the atheist movement. And she,

50
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.400
I think she might have said that she wasn't interested in, in, you know,

51
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:55.040
hooking up at conferences or whatever.

52
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.000
And then on the way back to her hotel later that night, uh,

53
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.720
she went into the elevator and then someone went into the elevator with her.

54
00:03:02.721 --> 00:03:05.080
It was the guy. And as they were going up in the elevator,

55
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.320
he looked over at her and just asked her if she'd like to come back to his room

56
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.200
for a cup of coffee, I was like, that's literally what he said. Um, but that's,

57
00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:15.520
you know, that's a euphemism for you wanna come back and Netflix and chill,

58
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:20.350
Netflix and chill. Yeah. And so she said, no,

59
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.390
he didn't pursue anymore. If they went off to their separate rooms,

60
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.990
everything was fine. The next day on social media,

61
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.630
she blows up the internet trying to say that how terrible this was,

62
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.430
how she felt so uncomfortable in the elevator. It was a, was a tight, uh,

63
00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:37.670
tight spot, you know, small elevator. And this how threatened that she was.

64
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.900
And it became a really big sort of Fisher in the atheist movement because some

65
00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:44.540
people were saying like, nothing really happened. He,

66
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.020
they just used a euphemism for, you know, they, they asked you politely,

67
00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:49.820
if you wanted to come back and do more, you said, no,

68
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:50.780
like that's the end of the story.

69
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.820
And then there was this atheist named PEY Meyers who since sort of lost his

70
00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:56.820
mind. Um,

71
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.890
and on his blog was talking about this event.

72
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.930
And then Richard Dawkins in the comment section wrote,

73
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.730
what's known as the dear mu Lima letter. Yeah.

74
00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:11.410
Which is he was writing a sarcastic response to this. As he,

75
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.570
as though he was addressing some random Muslim woman saying like, you know,

76
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.600
dear mu Lima, you have no right to complain about how you're treat, you know,

77
00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:23.320
having your genital mutilated or whatever, because haven't,

78
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:26.960
you heard this one woman, her name is skeptic chick. You know, she was offered,

79
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.720
copied an elevator. And she said, no, and the guy didn't do anything after that.

80
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.920
So it was a very sarcastic mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; way. He, he approached that.

81
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.040
And then that just made the whole athe woman just in getting engulfed in flames

82
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:38.740
immediately.

83
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.630
It was all the factions split up between the super woke people and the classic

84
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.390
skeptics and yeah. That it never recovered really.

85
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.150
And right after that is when atheism plus came out,

86
00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:52.510
which was atheism plus social justice,

87
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.110
which really just was woke Democrats who happened to be atheists

88
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.930
basically.

89
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.500
And all the new conference topics were just like intersection and maybe some

90
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.980
vague reference to, you know, disbelief or something.

91
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.980
So the athe movement never recovered from that. It was it's gone downhill.

92
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.020
And now we've seen how the same type of activism has moved in and taken over,

93
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.661
you know,

94
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:19.100
evergreen state college and has led to what Brett and Heather have gone through

95
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.890
and then sort of erupt all over,

96
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.210
erupt it all over the country and what we're seeing now. So that was sort of a,

97
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.490
the Canary in the coal mine for a lot of what we're seeing now. And what.

98
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.610
<v 0>Do you think is causing it? Like what, I mean,</v>

99
00:05:31.611 --> 00:05:34.410
a lot of people have theories on this, but I want to know your personal one.

100
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:37.690
Like, what is, why is this a thing today?

101
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.010
<v 1>Yeah. Well, there's so many different aspect to thel.</v>

102
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.640
So in the specific area of, I guess the whole sex denial thing,

103
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.760
I think there's this sort of this allergy to,

104
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.880
to the word discrimination in a way where we've been told that discrimination is

105
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.400
a terrible thing, always, but I mean, it might sound controversial,

106
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.000
but discrimination just means that we're distinguishing between two different

107
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:06.000
things in a certain context.

108
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.280
<v 0>Right. We think of discrimination like.</v>

109
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.680
<v 1>Yeah, we can prejudice. I'm, I'm discriminating in this certain,</v>

110
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.640
this certain thing. I mean, if you, if you have a,

111
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.440
a children's sports league that discriminates against adult,

112
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:17.910
so most people would say that that's a good,

113
00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:19.670
that's a good type of discrimination, right.

114
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.070
But we've just sort of adopted this idea that discrimination is really bad.

115
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.550
And so now when we talk about, uh, trans women in sports or something, you know,

116
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:30.030
they think they're being discriminated against.

117
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.510
And what you'll see in the headlines is, you know,

118
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:36.950
women and girls are not able who are trans are not able to play in sports for,

119
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.053
or women and girls.

120
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.660
What they fail to mention is that it's not the fact that they're trans &lt;laugh&gt;.

121
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.900
That is the reason why they're not being able to compete.

122
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.460
It's the fact that they're, you know, biologically male and that's the,

123
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.340
the thing that's being kept, uh, that we're trying to discriminate against,

124
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.900
not the fact that they're trans because trans is just like a state of mind that

125
00:06:55.901 --> 00:06:58.410
they can have. They declare that they're trans, you know,

126
00:06:58.411 --> 00:07:03.330
you can't verify it empirically in any way. And, um, so there's this,

127
00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:06.450
there's no reason to segregate sports by just a,

128
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.850
a state of your mind basically anymore that you would wanna segregate sports by

129
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.010
political ideology or something else that's completely irrelevant.

130
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.520
So I think an aversion to the, the concept of, uh,

131
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.400
the idea that discrimination is bad just across the board is,

132
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.360
is holding us back from having more productive conversations.

133
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.200
And then I know you've had people like James Lindsay on, and they,

134
00:07:28.201 --> 00:07:31.320
they talk about just the, the critical theory,

135
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.880
the theory that's out there, where it's just meant to just pick apart anything,

136
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.320
anytime there's, they see a binary,

137
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.150
they need you to deconstruct it and deconstruct it. And there's,

138
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.350
it's based on this, uh, epistemology of, of relativistic, um, you know,

139
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.350
relative truth, um, blurring borders between other things, systems of power.

140
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.830
This is sort of the ideology that has,

141
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.550
has taken a root in a lot of different areas in society. And,

142
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.820
and it's really been coming to a head in the last few years on,

143
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.300
on many topics too, on the whole sex and gender debate.

144
00:08:03.301 --> 00:08:06.500
We have the critical race theory stuff. We have the postcolonial, you know,

145
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.540
decolonize the curriculum and, you know, it is just,

146
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.660
it's spreading outta control. And then people who, who are not, who are,

147
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.500
who are not the postmodern type people who are, you know,

148
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.130
have the enlightenment use and,

149
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.170
and we're modernists in the way we approach the world. We think that, you know,

150
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:26.090
if something's true, if it corresponds to reality,

151
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.930
and there's certain truths that, uh, can't really be denied by anybody,

152
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:32.570
a lot of us are pushing back.

153
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.610
And because we've seemed to have lost a lot of a foothold in the institutions,

154
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.010
it's now resulting in, you know, people getting cancel.

155
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.640
<v 0>Yeah. It's a strange time in that regard where it just,</v>

156
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.480
it seems like no one knows exactly what our,

157
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.880
our cultural framework is anymore for discussing things.

158
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.120
And every time the, the, it gets pushed further and further along,

159
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.000
you have to kind of catch up with what you're allowed to say and what you're

160
00:08:58.001 --> 00:09:01.480
allowed to talk about. And wh what's okay. Like it,

161
00:09:01.481 --> 00:09:04.760
didn't used to be controversial to say there are two genders,

162
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.840
there's only two genders, but if you say it today,

163
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.320
you could get fired from your job. I mean, that's a real thing.

164
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.880
You can get discriminated against.

165
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.190
You can not that discriminations pat as we've discussed,

166
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:20.310
but you know what I mean? It's like, it's, this is a new thing to, to,

167
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.990
to get to a position where talking about biological facts,

168
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.630
you really shouldn't, you have to discuss the societal agreement,

169
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:36.060
the cultural agreement we have about like how we view or, you know,

170
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:39.620
this is what, what the, the push is or what, you know, this idea of, uh,

171
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.780
the compliance force compliance into this ideology. You have to,

172
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.060
you have to accept what we view now as sex

173
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.300
and gender. Yeah.

174
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.420
<v 1>There's like a language takeover. Yeah.</v>

175
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.530
And even when you said just earlier second and go that there's, you know,

176
00:09:56.531 --> 00:10:00.050
there's two genders. Well, they've just, co-opted the, that word,

177
00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:02.330
gender mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And so what used to be the case,

178
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.650
and this was something that I was on board with. I was a good, you know,

179
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.331
considered myself.

180
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:11.130
Progressive was a lot of people would say that sex and gender are

181
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:13.530
different things, sex referred to your reproductive anatomy,

182
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.320
your biology and gender referred to just the way you identify, you know,

183
00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:21.520
you can identify as a man or a woman, or, you know, if they wanna expand that,

184
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.920
whatever that means, um, it has to do with identity.

185
00:10:23.921 --> 00:10:28.400
It's sort of like sex is your hardware. Uh, gender is your software, right?

186
00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:30.400
Where you can be a male and identify as a woman.

187
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.520
And that was something that I was sort of willing to get on board with.

188
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.190
And I was like, okay, why do we need to have the, you know,

189
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.430
we already have male and female to refer to sex.

190
00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:43.750
Why do we need to also use man and woman? Maybe we can just let you know, the,

191
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.710
those people have have that because as a biologist, it didn't really

192
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.470
my, my,

193
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.590
my defense didn't really go up because as long as we're we know what sex is

194
00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.580
then fine, I can, I'll be willing to manage that. And then slowly over time,

195
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.020
that distinction became more and more blurry where now they would say,

196
00:11:06.021 --> 00:11:08.460
instead of that, identify as a man or a woman, they say,

197
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:10.580
I identify as a male or a female.

198
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.780
And they're using the sex terms where they used to use gender terms.

199
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.860
And then I'd started seeing on my Facebook,

200
00:11:15.861 --> 00:11:19.570
popping up people with P HDS in biology, sharing articles,

201
00:11:19.571 --> 00:11:21.370
like there are five sexes,

202
00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:26.090
or there are seven different sexes or sexes as social construct. And this was,

203
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.570
as I started pushing back against that, I,

204
00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:31.610
I thought there must have been talking about gender identity,

205
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:36.410
but it became very clear that know they're talking about actual sex itself and

206
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.610
that there's, you know,

207
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.600
every different chromosomal arrangement that someone can have.

208
00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:44.600
Like if you're a client filter male or something, you have X, Y Y uh,

209
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.680
chromosomes that you're a, your own unique sex now, rather than just, you know,

210
00:11:48.681 --> 00:11:51.280
a variation within, within the male, the male sex.

211
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.880
<v 0>Do you have a theory as to what, what caused all this? Or as to why it's,</v>

212
00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.360
it seems to be progressing. It's not,

213
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.960
it's not like they reached a point and they went, okay.

214
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.120
I think we made our point. Let's, uh,

215
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:08.160
let's sort of normalize this and have it be accepted into the, the common,

216
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.680
you know, thoughts of people, but it's, that's not what's happening.

217
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:15.270
It's says like it, can he getting weirder and weirder and weirder it's like,

218
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.990
think he pushed the envelope about what it means.

219
00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.790
<v 1>Yeah. There's no one to put on the breaks really. I mean, they've,</v>

220
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.270
they're within the institutions and the people who would normally wanna speak

221
00:12:27.271 --> 00:12:31.910
up, um, like, like I did, they get called names. They, you know,

222
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.460
I was looking for tenure track positions and I had people post on,

223
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.740
on job boards in my field that thousands of biologists look every day that I was

224
00:12:39.741 --> 00:12:43.700
a transp and a race scientist that they just threw in on top of things, just to,

225
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.300
you know, throw a bunch of slurs at me and see what sticks and try to, uh,

226
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.740
poison the well for my, my, my potential hiring.

227
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.330
And so people see that that happens. And then they just,

228
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.290
they just don't wanna do it. They stay quiet. Right. And then,

229
00:12:57.291 --> 00:13:01.170
so all you hear is the, the loudest voices, the most activists, uh,

230
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.930
they come out and they'll, they'll just say this type of stuff.

231
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.490
And then a lot of people don't wanna say anything because they're generally

232
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:09.210
confused because of the jargon that's being used. Um,

233
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.810
and then they're kind of do a human shield aspect where they're,

234
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.560
they're portraying themselves as sort of the next evolution of L G B T

235
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.880
rights or in the terms of critical race there where the,

236
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.280
this next civil rights movement.

237
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.840
And so no one wants to be on the wrong side of history,

238
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.280
even though they don't understand what people are saying sounds nuts,

239
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.520
but who are they to really judge what this is? They just,

240
00:13:29.521 --> 00:13:31.760
they don't wanna be called a racist because that's the worst thing you can be

241
00:13:31.761 --> 00:13:32.150
called.

242
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:36.830
They don't wanna be called a trans because we're wanna be accepting people. And,

243
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.750
uh, fortunately I think a lot of people are,

244
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.190
&lt;laugh&gt; sort of beginning to see that,

245
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.950
and they're willing to stand up a little bit more now and at least call it like

246
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:50.790
it is saying that these people have a really bad concept of what biological sex

247
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:55.500
actually is. No, there's not seven sexes, no sex. Isn't a, you know,

248
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.300
a bimodal distribution where we're just varying degrees of maleness and

249
00:13:59.301 --> 00:14:03.900
femaleness. You know, we can, we can definitively say for, you know,

250
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.700
4,999 people out of, out of 5,000,

251
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.140
that they are unambiguously male or female. Uh, and you know,

252
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:14.820
we can account for the 1% that's not, but, um, that,

253
00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:18.610
doesn't all of us sort of in question of what, what our sex is.
