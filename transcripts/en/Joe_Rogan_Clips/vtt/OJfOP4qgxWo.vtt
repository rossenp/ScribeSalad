00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, you know? Well,</v>

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:05.320
there's people that wanna forgive people though,

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.960
for a thing like RO remember when there was a lot of Roman Polansky a apologi.

4
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.400
Oh, I don't.

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.400
<v 1>I don't think I caught of.</v>

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.080
<v 0>That. There's quite a few. Yeah. I mean like, wait in Hollywood. Yes.</v>

7
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:17.680
Like legitimate actors and actresses that were saying, you know,

8
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.310
it's time to let it go leave. He's an amazing artist. And if so,

9
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.750
he's rap a 13 year old.

10
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.950
<v 1>I'm good. Rosemary's, baby's great movie, but I think he's, he he's done it.</v>

11
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.870
It's a wrap, but there are people like, you know, Stanley cubrick who is yes.

12
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.270
Arguably the, I mean, my.

13
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.230
<v 0>Favorite, you know, one of the greatest geniuses ever in, in filmmaking, which.</v>

14
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.580
<v 1>By the way, uh, I was reading that, um, uh,</v>

15
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.620
the guy that directed ex machinkinna kind of loosely based the guy on

16
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:48.580
Stanley cooperrick. Oh, wow. Did you ever see,

17
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.340
and then as soon as I thought about that, I was like, oh yeah.

18
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:53.740
Tell Alex Garland, I think is, uh, the guy's name. Yes. That, that wrote it.

19
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.693
I thought that was interesting.

20
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.940
But have you ever seen like the videos of Rick directing Shelly law and all the

21
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:03.050
stories about how he terrorized her throughout the Prada to get her into a,

22
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.970
I mean, he didn't want her to sleep. He wanted to have bags under her eyes. Wow.

23
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:09.610
He would wake her up in the middle of the night and he'd scream at her and call

24
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:13.450
her a and then be like, action &lt;laugh&gt; and then he'd be like, action.

25
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.090
And then she'd be like. Like it was her performance is unbelievable. And I, wow.

26
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.410
And it's like was terror today. That would be a hostile and work.

27
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.200
<v 0>Environment.</v>

28
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800
That to being olive oil in the Popeye movie with Robin Williams and then she

29
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:25.634
just quit.

30
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.280
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, &lt;laugh&gt; my, I mean,</v>

31
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.950
I, she doesn'.

32
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.280
<v 0>Fire her agent, but she was so good in the shining and then she didn't do a lot.</v>

33
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.920
Does emotional.

34
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.760
<v 1>Movie abuse make great art? I don't know. It's I'm not, you.</v>

35
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.480
<v 0>Know, the same thing happened with Ricky Schroeder in the champ. Oh,</v>

36
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.390
John John Voyt was like really with him. He was a little kid. He was like six,

37
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:49.750
seven years old. Yeah. He was really mean to him before the scenes.

38
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.230
So you start crying. Yeah.

39
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.990
<v 1>I mean, there's also, there's a, and I, um, there's a director who, um,</v>

40
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.750
there was an explosion in a movie and the actor, you know,

41
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:01.590
it's a fake explosion and you're going, ah, and then one take, he was like,

42
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:05.380
just make it a real, just don't tell him. And the take was amazing. Boom.

43
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.340
And the actor got all off, but the work, you know,

44
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:11.900
you get to get credit for that. So it's, &lt;laugh&gt;, it is this tricky thing.

45
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:16.100
Like I was, uh, I did a, a show called, um, Adam ruins, everything, you know,

46
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.740
that show mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's, he's just a smart dude.

47
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.260
And he just asked me to do a little guestbo and I had to play a flight attendant

48
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:24.930
in the fifties who was getting sexually harassed. I, that was the scene. Right.

49
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.610
And because that's what I guess airlines used to do that they would sort of pimp

50
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:30.410
out their flight attendants. If you were engaged,

51
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:32.770
you weren't allowed to wear your ring. You had to fill really? Yeah.

52
00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:33.370
It was like the.

53
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.450
<v 0>Episodes really interestinging well, itn't supposed to be really hot. Right.</v>

54
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.250
It was the whole thing about.

55
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.770
<v 1>Flight attend. You had to be a certain size and you had to be young.</v>

56
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.170
And then you had to kind of like, boy, did they let that.

57
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.570
<v 0>Go? It was kind of a &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

58
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.000
it was a last flight 10 I had was you've been playing Delta.

59
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.000
He weighed 235 pounds. He was five foot, four

60
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.480
nice guy.

61
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.640
<v 1>Though. But it was like a dating surface back then basically.</v>

62
00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:02.600
And Adam did the whole thing on it and I was in there and it felt very much,

63
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.960
everyone was like, okay, whatever you feel comfortable with. And it was like,

64
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.400
no, we have to do, we have to make this feel uncomfortable. You know, mm-hmm,

65
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.600
&lt;affirmative&gt; like, don't worry about my feelings right now. Right. You know,

66
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.040
it's like, you know,

67
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.520
so there is just this conversation about like a no hostile work environment and

68
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.920
everyone needs to feel emotionally safe. Like, well.

69
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.510
<v 0>Can you, could you make the shining today? Yeah. Well,</v>

70
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:22.310
can you get to that place without being harassed?

71
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.390
If you're a really good actress, like if you're really crazy.

72
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.550
<v 1>Of course, but I just, you know, you still have to do it, you.</v>

73
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.790
<v 0>Know, you go for it. You kinda, I mean,</v>

74
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.750
isn't that the argument about great actors that they kind of have to be crazy,

75
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.710
like a Daniel Day Lewis type act, right? Like you have to kind of be like,

76
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:37.350
that's why they're method actors. Right.

77
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.260
They stay in that mindset because to maintain that mindset is really the only

78
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.061
way to achieve it.

79
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:45.180
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like you almost kind of have to be there all the time.

80
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.800
And also.

81
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.580
<v 1>The being in character thing, like when people like, you know,</v>

82
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.100
about like when Christian bale had his, you know, meltdown, meltdown and stuff,

83
00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:54.460
it's like, I mean, it's just,

84
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:58.340
there's so many people on a set and there's so many distractions. Right.

85
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.490
And you know, you at to some point, you're just like, I have,

86
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.010
it's impossible to focus.

87
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.650
<v 0>Well, and there's also there's losers on set.</v>

88
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:08.890
Sometimes that things up and they get in the way that's, that does happen.

89
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.370
And the fact that they recorded him screaming at that guy, I was like, well,

90
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.850
I wanna know what that guy did. And who was that guy? That guy might be a moron.

91
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:16.490
Hadn't he been.

92
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.370
<v 1>Starving himself for like seven months or something? I don't think.</v>

93
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.560
<v 0>That's the mechanic. I think it's the same movie. It's just like, you know,</v>

94
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.200
he's the mechanic, is it, um, the machinist machinist.

95
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.760
<v 1>Right? It's like, I'm the face of this movie. &lt;laugh&gt;,</v>

96
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.160
I'm under all this pressure. I have to get this thing we're losing light.

97
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.280
And this guy cell phone goes off or I don't know exactly what happened.

98
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.920
It justhappened, you know, but I do think when Daniel Day Lewis is like,

99
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.480
I'm call me Mr. Lincoln or nobody talk to me.

100
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:42.910
It might just be his way of being like, I just stop asking me if I want hummus.

101
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:46.230
Like just &lt;laugh&gt; let me focus, you know? But I think.

102
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.270
<v 0>For like really intense roles, which I've never done.</v>

103
00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:51.790
So I'm just completely talking outta my.

104
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.670
I would think that you might have to maintain some really crazy state of mind

105
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:56.830
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to get there.

106
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.750
So it doesn't look fake because you know how you know how, like you see,

107
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.900
you ever see the movie movie punchline with Sally fields. Yeah. And to Hanks.

108
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:08.060
Yeah. Yeah. It's an interesting movie. But when Sally fields is killing,

109
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.820
I'm like, get the outta there. Like that's no, one's laughing at that.

110
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.100
Like it's not real when.

111
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.540
<v 1>People do, when actors do stand up, I think real standups. They're like, okay.</v>

112
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.770
<v 0>What? You know, who nails it though? That lady who plays the marvelous. Mrs.</v>

113
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.610
<v 1>Mrs. Masel um, she's amazing. I love her. Brosn yeah. I love her. I love her.</v>

114
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:29.570
Her she's legit. It does. Well, it's also in the fifties. Yes. You know,

115
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.450
I think right. But.

116
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.290
<v 0>Even the guy who plays Lenny, Bruce is great in that. I agree. I agree. I mean.</v>

117
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.410
<v 1>That show rather, and there was, you know, but like the one on Showtime cast,</v>

118
00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:39.970
real comics, remember Eric Griffin was on it and Al magical was on it.

119
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:43.440
That one on Showtime. Oh yeah. Dying up here. Up here. Yeah. You know,

120
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.760
just like castole comics.

121
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.600
<v 0>Yeah. But the writing, when that was like a little shotty.</v>

122
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.680
<v 1>I see. But, uh, but I I'm sure it's different for everyone,</v>

123
00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:54.120
but I do think though, sometimes, you know, you've been on sets.

124
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.480
Like if you have to do a scene with somebody where you're screaming,

125
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.800
you hate each other. If you're hanging out all day on Instagram. Right.

126
00:05:58.801 --> 00:06:00.360
And then it's just like, you it's hard.

127
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.800
Tofa like chemistry or knowing someone mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so yeah.

128
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.480
I just think it's interesting. Like, you know,

129
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:08.000
Stanley cubrick probably would be canceled today.

130
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.360
<v 0>Probably. Yeah. Well,</v>

131
00:06:10.361 --> 00:06:14.320
especially by people who don't understand what's required in order to achieve

132
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.510
what he's trying to get. Yeah. Cubic was a mad man though. I mean,

133
00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:21.790
he used to do complex mathematics in his spare time.

134
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.750
<v 1>Yeah. Like as a hobby, right? Yeah. Like, but.</v>

135
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.310
<v 0>He would do complex calculus and stuff like that. He would do.</v>

136
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.350
<v 1>Where he would, uh, you know, I think on eyes wide shut,</v>

137
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.150
he did like do 80 takes of Tom cruise,

138
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:33.670
walking through the door and then I'll show up.

139
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.300
Like he didn't want actors acting mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like he wanted them,

140
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.300
he wanted them in the actual state of mind mm-hmm instead of acting like they

141
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:42.860
were in that actual state of mind, like he wanted that.

142
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.820
So he really wanted Tom cruise to be like exhausted and off and annoyed.

143
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:49.940
So he is like, go him off. And then lemme me know when he is in that state.

144
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.580
I mean, he would like terrorize shelllly dualts like kind of famous and it,

145
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.980
she looks terrified. Yeah.

146
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.730
<v 0>You know, and also working with Jack mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; Jack nickholon,</v>

147
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.690
there's a great video of him preparing for one of the scenes. Oh.

148
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.570
And he's jumping up and down and throwing his arms in the air and going, ah, ah,

149
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.130
he's like, like freaking out, you know, what's that guy,

150
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.130
you could see him working himself up before the scene. I mean,

151
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.170
he it's like those scenes that he did,

152
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:19.000
especially like the act through the bathroom door.

153
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.360
You can't just go into that cold. You've.

154
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.800
<v 1>Got some of that in here. Yeah. You worked up. Yeah. It's wild. Like I'm,</v>

155
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.960
I'm so obsessed with that movie.

156
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.960
Cuz like the little things he did to make you feel uneasy in a subliminal.

157
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.793
<v 0>Way. Yeah. It is.</v>

158
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.160
He's getting ready for the scene and he's like jumping her up and down,

159
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.630
he she's just like, she's like, okay. I'm in here. And he's yeah.

160
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.270
Ah, who's this guy.

161
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.830
<v 1>I don't know. Yeah.</v>

162
00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:47.030
There's nine people that wanna like ask him if he needs any handstanded oh,

163
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.873
touch out.

164
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.870
<v 0>Yeah. That's a guy with the walkie talkie going in there.</v>

165
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.390
<v 1>Ad's really dressed up like golfers back then. &lt;laugh&gt; the?</v>

166
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.910
What preppy. It's.

167
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.740
<v 0>A great God movie. You know what? That movie?</v>

168
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:02.660
Stephen King didn't like that movie. Well.

169
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:02.941
<v 1>Be yeah.</v>

170
00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:06.780
Well that's why they say that the car on the road that's crashed on the road.

171
00:08:06.781 --> 00:08:08.380
There's a red car in the beginning of the movie.

172
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:09.700
That's crashed on the side of the road.

173
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:12.260
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then Stephen King's version, there was a red car.

174
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.660
So cubic crashed that car and then it was a yellow car. Oh.

175
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.810
So he actually put in the movie to like troll Stephen King &lt;laugh&gt; to the kind

176
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:23.490
of amazing. That's hilarious. But he did. That was so fascinating.

177
00:08:23.491 --> 00:08:27.050
Like little things to make you feel uneasy, like continuity errors.

178
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.890
Like he'd cut to a scene.

179
00:08:28.891 --> 00:08:31.450
There'd be a like if there was a chair behind you cut away,

180
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.730
cut back and there'd be no chair.

181
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:37.290
You wouldn't really notice in case you were like dissecting it. But there's.

182
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:39.850
<v 0>Also a lot of weird references in that movie to the Apollo moon.</v>

183
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.920
Like that's right.

184
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.680
<v 1>Like saying he did a lot of weird. He was and um,</v>

185
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.120
the native American genocide is apparently a pretty big theme in it. Um,

186
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.080
but yeah, it's great movie and the way that he, um, I mean,

187
00:08:52.081 --> 00:08:55.440
there's a whole documentary about this, but that the carpet,

188
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.120
when the kid is riding the bicycle around the carpet that he shot at both ways

189
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.160
and intercut them. So the continuity's not working and it just makes you feel.

190
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.320
Yeah, he's.

191
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.680
<v 0>There's a great documentary about the guy who followed cubrick around.</v>

192
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.840
He was like his assistant.

193
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.750
He was an actor and he was acting and something that cubrick did.

194
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.950
And cubrick wind up hiring him as an assistant.

195
00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:21.670
And then he just did all cubrick's movies and hung out with him all the time.

196
00:09:21.671 --> 00:09:25.190
It's really strange. She's still alive. Yeah. Yeah. Should get him on. Well,

197
00:09:25.191 --> 00:09:28.150
the documentary's really good. It's what is it? See? Do you know what it is?

198
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:28.510
It's.

199
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.510
<v 1>Not the, uh, room 2, 3, 6 1. What.</v>

200
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.470
<v 0>Is it? The lost tapes. I think it's on, uh, was that Netflix? I believe right.</v>

201
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.980
I thought no, no. The Netflix, a guy who hang, hung around with Stanley.

202
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.100
Cubrick cool. It's about him. I think it's film worker life pictures.

203
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.500
Is that it? Oh, maybe that's it a life in pictures, 2001. No, no, no.

204
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.380
I don't think so. Just Google. The guy who worked film. Yeah. That's it.

205
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.700
Filmmark right. I Don' see that. So this,

206
00:09:54.701 --> 00:09:58.490
this guy sort of realized somewhere along the line, like, oh man,

207
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.290
I'll never be able to make a movie.

208
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.490
Like I'll never be able to do what he's doing.

209
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.010
So I'm just gonna start working with him. So he's his personal assistant.

210
00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:11.370
He started out as an actor and he just worked with cubrick through all of his

211
00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:15.330
movies. Oh wild. Yeah. I mean somehow or another, they just clicked together.

212
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.400
So he wanted working for him. So it's like, you probably don't know the name.

213
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.880
Leon vitalal scroll down. Please stop you. Right. You don't know the name,

214
00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:26.760
Leon vitalal but the up upcoming documentary film workerer hopes to change that

215
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:29.640
forever. Yeah. British actor. Yeah. His hand,

216
00:10:29.641 --> 00:10:34.120
hand by Stan Stanley cubrick to play the world of Lord bowingdon in barrylendon

217
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.330
yeah. It's a,

218
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.600
it's interesting because this guy sort of devoted his life to like to

219
00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:42.440
work with cubrick.

220
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.520
<v 1>It's interesting. Like, and that was also back in the day.</v>

221
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.440
I think cubrick would do like a movie every like five years or something.

222
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.240
It's like that's back when you made a movie when it was ready. Yeah.

223
00:10:53.241 --> 00:10:56.440
Now everyone's like movie every eight months. A new.

224
00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.230
<v 0>Well, you know the apocalypse now story, right? The movie took forever.</v>

225
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.150
Oh right. Yeah. The movie took like 70 years to make. Did,

226
00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:07.870
did Oliver stone write that? No, no. That's uh, Francis for Cola. Oh, okay.

227
00:11:07.871 --> 00:11:11.190
That's like, I don't think Oliver stone wrote that. Maybe IM wrong know.

228
00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:12.070
I think he was involved in.

229
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.630
<v 1>Some way. I don't think so. I'm kind of obsessed with Oliver stone. Yeah.</v>

230
00:11:14.631 --> 00:11:16.950
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I wrote a, I wrote a, uh,

231
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.260
my honor ceases in college about &lt;laugh&gt; so dorky,

232
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.860
the postmodern implications of the movie, JFK &lt;laugh&gt; ah,

233
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.660
I was just obsessed with that movie.

234
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:32.460
Like at the great at the time it had had the most edits in any movie ever and

235
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:33.740
the way that they just did mix me,

236
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.980
I just loved the movie and I just wanna write about it and dissect it. It's.

237
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.690
<v 0>A great movie, but the problem is they sort of,</v>

238
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.810
he makes it seem like, you know exactly what happened. Right.

239
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.370
And the reality is we don't know exactly what happened.

240
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.410
Mm-mm &lt;negative&gt; we don't know who killed JFK.

241
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.010
It was very likely that it wasn't Lee Harvey Oswal though. Yeah.

242
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.680
And if it was that, if Lee Harvey Osal did take a shot,

243
00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.800
he didn't take the only shots. Right. There was other people shooting at him.

244
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:00.600
Right. It's.

245
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.320
<v 1>Just so, it was just so blew my mind the way that he makes movies.</v>

246
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.710
<v 2>Okay.</v>
