00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.840
<v 2>But that moment is special because there's value in suffering and in today's</v>

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:07.501
society,

4
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:10.980
we have convinced ourselves that there is no value in suffering that the entire

5
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:15.270
role of say government is to end your suffering. But this is a false promise.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.680
Not only is it a false promise,

7
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:20.850
but it will create a weak society that is unable to sustain itself.

8
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.130
That's a really important point. And I think there's,

9
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.780
I think there's deep truth in that this is why victimhood politics is so

10
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:29.700
dangerous. And I would say populism is too.

11
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.390
I think the two are almost indistinguishable from each other.

12
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.660
People are always trying to talk about populism on the right and the left.

13
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.600
And I say, look, well, here's what populism is. It's telling you what you feel.

14
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.180
It's mirroring your feelings back to you.

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.250
It's telling you what you want to hear as opposed to the truth that I,

16
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:49.350
I think that's a decent definition of populism. I don't like it.

17
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.280
I don't like people embracing it. Um, it, it doesn't just mean, Hey,

18
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:55.800
things that are good, that people are for, well,

19
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:59.040
you know what a lot of people are for $1,600 checks that are free.

20
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.260
That doesn't mean it's a good policy, right?

21
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.030
That's a good example of a populated.

22
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.510
<v 1>If they voted and said, do you want a hundred thousand dollars, three years?</v>

23
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.270
<v 0>Um, everybody would vote. Yes. Yeah. Why wouldn't you,</v>

24
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.670
but is it a sustainable policy? And of course not, of course not. Um, and the,

25
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:18.840
the kind of amounts of that to the, I think drastic lurches and, you know,

26
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:22.050
welfare policy or infrastructure spending and all of these things that we're

27
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:26.670
seeing, it's populism on steroids. It's telling you what you want to hear,

28
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.410
and that's not truth.

29
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.723
<v 2>That's not truth.</v>

30
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.250
And we have to get back to truth and we have to get away from this victim hood

31
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:36.510
mentality where we actually, we actually elevate this idea of being helpless.

32
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.960
That's, what's changed. That's what's changed in the last decade.

33
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.740
It used to be that, well, you,

34
00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:45.180
you might feel some shame if you were the type to, you know what, you know what?

35
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.450
I just, I need some help. I feel bad about it. I'm going to get back on my feet,

36
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:49.650
but I need some help right now.

37
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.000
<v 0>That used to be the sort of American way, right? We, we need a safety net.</v>

38
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.940
That's nobody would disagree with that. We need a safety net.

39
00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:59.100
We need to help people who have truly fallen on hard times,

40
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:01.020
who lost their jobs because of COVID.

41
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.590
But does that also mean we needed to provide a $1,400 check to somebody who

42
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:07.470
never lost their job and whose biggest hardship has been zoom meetings?

43
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.910
<v 2>Of course not.</v>

44
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.030
But over a hundred million people were getting checks that never lost their jobs

45
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.900
a hundred million easily. It's way more. It's way more than that.

46
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.770
I'm cutting it off at a hundred million. Jen, that to me, w when we,

47
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:22.500
when we send out checks the direct cash payments,

48
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:25.730
I've always been against direct cash payments. So these.

49
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.420
<v 1>The COVID stimulus checks. Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.450
<v 0>So, cause they go out to anybody, those.</v>

51
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.790
<v 1>Checks that didn't lose their jobs. Of course.</v>

52
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.660
<v 0>What, yeah. The cutoff was like 75 K a year.</v>

53
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.030
So that made them in a wait a minute means every federal will not.

54
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.890
<v 1>Workers getting any money because of the pandemic still got checked.</v>

55
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.660
<v 0>Yeah. These were never, these were never based on your situation.</v>

56
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.853
What?

57
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.200
<v 0>Really it's ridiculous.</v>

59
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.460
<v 1>No, that I thought you had to lose your job. I thought there was a problem.</v>

60
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.620
Yeah. Wait a minute. People who never a penny. So if you look at their, their,

61
00:03:01.621 --> 00:03:04.810
their tax receipts, you look at their, their, uh,

62
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.240
what they made in 2019 versus 2020. Correct. If they,

63
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.223
they didn't lose any more.

64
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.320
<v 0>Yeah, no, it was it's based on your, just, just your income.</v>

65
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.030
So I think 75 K a year was the cutoff, but also if you're a married couple,

66
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.620
150 K, and if you have kids and it's even more,

67
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.680
so you've got like a lot of active duty military friends,

68
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.910
you're getting thousands of dollars because you know, they have kids and,

69
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.000
but it's like, why? And they're like, why, why am I getting,

70
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.890
this is such a waste of taxpayer money. You know what I mean?

71
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.200
Do your duty go spend it on a local business?

72
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.130
<v 1>The suffering,</v>

73
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.010
the money was allocated to people that lost money because of the pandemic.

74
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.990
<v 0>Oh no, no, because we already have a season for that.</v>

75
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.190
It's unemployment insurance or our system works fine for that. And this is,

76
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.480
this was always my thing. It's like, look,

77
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:51.240
I'm in favor of temporarily boosting payments to those who are unemployed on

78
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.001
unemployed insurance,

79
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:56.620
usually state run unemployment insurance runs at it's it's at a

80
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:57.550
formula that would,

81
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.210
that would make sure that you're not making more than you would have if you were

82
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:03.700
already employed because you don't want to have a disincentive to go back to

83
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:04.210
work.

84
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.421
<v 2>Right.</v>

85
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:07.540
What we did in the initial stages of the pandemic was increased that to 600,

86
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.130
an extra $600 a week. If you're unemployed, I'm okay with that for a few weeks,

87
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.400
during hard times, the problem is Democrats want to keep it forever.

88
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.730
And now every business I talked to was like, I can't hire people.

89
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.890
I have so many job openings right now.

90
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.070
Can't hire anybody because we still have it. It's $300 a week,

91
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:27.160
but we still have it. It means people are getting paid to stay home.

92
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.550
There's a distance there. They're making a purely rational financial decision.

93
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.020
But again, that's one conversation. That's, that's at least a debate to be had,

94
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.340
you know, during hard times, but the direct cash payments, that's nuts.

95
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.450
That's nuts. What are the direct cash? That's the free money. That's the frame.

96
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.320
That's the free money.

97
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.100
<v 1>So this is the people that even though they still make the same amount,</v>

98
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:51.850
they made it 2000, 19, 2020, they got a big check, you know, reason.

99
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.380
<v 0>Yep. A hundred percent.</v>

100
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.970
<v 1>That seems crazy.</v>

101
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.670
<v 0>The math that's well, over a hundred million.</v>

102
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.850
<v 1>People, they just got it. They didn't ask for it. They just received it.</v>

103
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:04.030
So it's not something they're guilty of. Yeah. They just received it.

104
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.630
<v 0>But it gets to the cultural argument that we're talking about. No,</v>

105
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.100
there was no backlash for this.

106
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.190
<v 2>Even on the right. I remember. I remember I was, I was,</v>

107
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.060
I was a little frustrated with the president or the ex president, Donald Trump,

108
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.630
the president I voted for that, uh, he was,

109
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:22.690
he was pushing for those $2,000 cash payments. I said.

110
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.630
<v 1>I don't really think that he was doing that politically and I didn't vote for</v>

111
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.190
him, but don't you think that's the.

112
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.130
<v 0>That's political. That's exactly the point.</v>

113
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:34.660
There's an incentive now to pay people off with their own money and it's not

114
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:35.260
good.

115
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.411
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

116
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:38.980
But it wasn't don't you think that he was in a desperation situation where he

117
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:40.840
just wanted to get reelected? I mean, he's.

118
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.050
<v 0>This was in December. He was already, he had already lost.</v>

119
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.490
<v 1>Oh. So in December, after he lost he still,</v>

120
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.310
but he didn't think he lost. He thought he was.

121
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.740
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

122
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.700
<v 1>It's a good conversation.</v>

123
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.740
He thought he was going to somehow or another get reinstated. I don't.

124
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.340
<v 0>I don't know if he ever truly believed that, but, um, he was pushing for it,</v>

125
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:03.920
but yeah, it is on the, on the victim hood side.

126
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:06.680
That's this is the demise of the Republic.

127
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.281
<v 2>When, when,</v>

128
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:11.060
when people are comfortable with being bought off with their own tax dollars and

129
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:11.810
being comfortable,

130
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.650
even more than that comfortable with being told that they're victimized and that

131
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.720
some other group is, is responsible for that victimization. Just to.

132
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.630
<v 1>Turn a bad situation, they're in a bad somebody else's and someone did it.</v>

133
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.260
<v 0>To you. And maybe it's the 1%, maybe it says those mean corporate giants.</v>

134
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:29.900
And now those corporate giants trying to get all woke and get on the Democrats

135
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:33.200
good side. Like they always do because, you know,

136
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.990
they don't because they want to maintain their little piece of the pie. That's.

137
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.780
<v 1>It's tricky, right? Where they manipulate the narrative,</v>

138
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.160
they realize where people's heads are at. So they try to jump on board,
