00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. Right. If you're stuck in some</v>

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.960
hole city, and it's just your whole,

3
00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:15.920
neighborhood's filled with dumies and there's no prospects and there's lead in

4
00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:19.120
the water. You got Flint, Michigan water. You're drinking. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

5
00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:22.550
they're still haven't fixed that people, if you drink bottled water in Flint,

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.270
Michigan. Yeah. In 2019. Yep. Like how,

7
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.910
how they do they not have, how did they let that ever get to that point?

8
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.550
Like at all the things you need? Well, what do we need to stay alive?

9
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:36.510
Number one. Water. Okay. Let's ignore that. Let's ignore that. And, uh,

10
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:39.070
work on the cracks in the streets. Let's ignore that and, uh,

11
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:41.580
have new traffic lights &lt;affirmative&gt; that, uh,

12
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:44.060
have cameras on 'em to bust you so we can get more revenue.

13
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.780
Let's make sure we hire parking 10. What about the water? We can get to that.

14
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.780
We'll get to that water. Yeah. Well.

15
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.540
<v 1>It's, it's my new phrase for, uh, you know, our situation cause capitalism,</v>

16
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.260
cause the current version of capitalism, I.

17
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.130
<v 0>Said, capitalism, I don't even well know enough about economics.</v>

18
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.170
<v 1>I mean, I, it's not really, it's more just like a philosophical.</v>

19
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.090
<v 0>But do you have capitalism with regulation so that you make sure that there's no</v>

20
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:13.090
pollution? You make sure that people yes. Don't,

21
00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:15.170
don't get away with environmental disasters. Of course.

22
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.450
And aren't we also going on the momentum of decisions that were made a long time

23
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.530
ago? Like a lot of this stuff,

24
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:25.880
like a lot of these minds that pollute everywhere, uh, uh,

25
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.560
pollute, um, environments, wherever they're like. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:33.000
They kind of made those when environment environmental laws were different,

27
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:33.834
right?

28
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.200
<v 1>Yeah. For sure. I mean,</v>

29
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.160
environmentalism was it wasn't really a thing until like the mid

30
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.870
19 hundreds, I guess. So like, like, uh, Roosevelt,

31
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.550
like was like a huge like environmental mm groovy dude. But uh,

32
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.150
the idea of preserving swaths of land and like considering the environment when

33
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:57.230
growing an economy simultaneously. Yeah. Like that just, that just stopped.

34
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.350
Like there's like some national parks stuff and maybe some things passed with

35
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:06.740
like ozone, some lead stuff, some mercury stuff, you know,

36
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.860
kind of common sense, really hardcore. That should definitely like no brainers,

37
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.860
those have been done, but anything else,

38
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.900
making sure that that balance is there as the economy grows, just doesn't exist.

39
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.860
It's just the way capitalism is right now. It's like it doesn't,

40
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:25.930
that's not considered a valid value. There's the more,

41
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.410
in fact the more scarce it becomes the higher in value. It is. So it's,

42
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:33.850
so it's in its own best interest to continue to grow and grow and grow until it

43
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:34.684
can't grow anymore.

44
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.210
<v 0>Jesus freaking out, man.</v>

45
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.130
<v 1>So, so that's why decisions like that are made in my, in my mind. Well.</v>

46
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.400
<v 0>Decisions that impact the will wilderness and impact in the environment.</v>

47
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:51.040
Like did you ever see that movie? Gasland no great documentary on fracking.

48
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.120
Oh wow. Really crazy. Um, what is the director's name? Josh.

49
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.240
<v 1>Fox Brolin. No.</v>

50
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.320
<v 0>Are you sure it's a different guy, bro? No, there's no way. No,</v>

51
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:05.560
there's a different guy. There's no way, but it's an amazing documentary.

52
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.320
And Josh Fox, Josh Fox. I did. I got it. Thank Josh Fox. Um, it's really good.

53
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.800
Really, really good documentary. It's is Joe Fox. He's a, a guy who,

54
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.920
who made the film. Yeah,

55
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.350
he's the he and he was inspired by a personal

56
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.110
experience with uh, wasn't it, do you remember the actual story? Jamie? Yeah.

57
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.270
Like personal experience with some pollutants or something like that in the

58
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:29.670
river, but got into anyway,

59
00:03:29.671 --> 00:03:32.350
made this amazing documentary and watching people dismiss.

60
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.830
Some of the stuff in documentary was so, so surreal. Oh yeah.

61
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.500
They were lighting their tap water on fire. And I dunno if you saw that,

62
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:42.700
but I did see that. Yeah. That's crazy.

63
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.860
People literally were saying you could do that before the fracking. That's not,

64
00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:50.660
it's not because of the fracking. Wow. People were saying that like, okay,

65
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.060
let's assume that's true. Let's just get crazy and assume that's true. Yeah.

66
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:56.180
Their water is on fire.

67
00:03:56.181 --> 00:04:00.370
That's the last that should be on fire is the they used to put out fire. Yeah.

68
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.530
If you God waters on fire. Yeah.

69
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.170
Do you know how much has to be in your water for it to be on fire? Okay.

70
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:10.170
What's going on here and why are you so sure that this didn't come from fracking

71
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.690
and that you could always let your water on fire and now you're telling us yeah.

72
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.610
Like you didn't make videos about this before,

73
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.970
before there was a fracking thing. Yeah. Show me a video that, yeah, let me see.

74
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.760
Are you sure? That would be interesting.

75
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.160
Are you really sure that there's have you tested the water? Are you a scientist?

76
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:26.720
Are you sitting over there with a lab coat and a check sheet? Yeah.

77
00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:27.521
Making sure that the,

78
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:30.920
the toxin levels are exactly the same before and after fracking. No, you're not,

79
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.040
but why are you so interested? There's a thing that people do with their,

80
00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:38.120
like really interested in the interests of big business. And they want to like,

81
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.440
they, they get and regular people who,

82
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.670
who don't even have a financial stake in that business will make up excuses for

83
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:45.270
the business. I.

84
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.150
<v 1>Know. It's crazy. Yeah. What is that? It's fear.</v>

85
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.510
It's just fear of losing jobs.

86
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.590
Like people like losing jobs or losing the thing that keeps their, their bills.

87
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.030
<v 0>Paid. It's also like that. No nonsense. Right? Wing mindset.</v>

88
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.300
There's like a no nonsense right? Wing mindset.

89
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.700
Oh these tree hungers God tree huggers. Oh yeah.

90
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.180
Trying to stop us from making a good living. You want those people to be poor.

91
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.160
Yeah. You want those people to,

92
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.140
you ever see the look on a poor coal miners' face. Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:14.100
You know what I mean? There's that thing that they do. Yes. At no nonsense.

94
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.540
So they want to go with anything that's like good for the economy,

95
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.980
but bad for the environment. Exactly. Which, which is crazy.

96
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.130
It's because you never, you have to factor in the other,

97
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.210
the additional costs of how much it's gonna cost to fix what you did.

98
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:29.770
And if you ever can fix what you did and if you can't fix what you did through

99
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.370
the environment, how much should that cost? Cause if you could, like,

100
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.850
if you decide like, Hey, I'm gonna pull copper out of this hole in the ground,

101
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.770
but it might kill a million salmon.

102
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.280
Like you imagine how much a in salmon would be worth.

103
00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:46.320
You're gonna kill a whole population of salmon. How much is that worth?

104
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.040
Like if you ruin fishing for all the people that want to come to this one salmon

105
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:53.080
river. Yeah. You kill a million fish. Like how much is that worth?

106
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.840
That's that should be worth a billion dollars. Yeah.

107
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.680
You should get fined a billion dollars if not more. Yeah.

108
00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.680
But you can't even fix that.

109
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.280
<v 1>That's what I'm, that's what I'm saying. That's that's what the,</v>

110
00:06:02.281 --> 00:06:05.160
that value that it has no value. Well, the thing is it's also.

111
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.200
<v 0>It's ours. Like the poisoning is our.</v>

112
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.120
<v 1>Stuff. I know. That's what I mean. It's like the earth,</v>

113
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.160
it's just the worst because it's like, it does not, it's just a, not,

114
00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:17.230
it's not a part of the equation for growing the economy. That's like,

115
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.230
and I know there's gonna be people listening that are like,

116
00:06:19.231 --> 00:06:21.190
just know about this hardcore.

117
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.750
I'm just approaching it from like an over kind of philosophical,

118
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.670
energetic viewpoint.

119
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.550
<v 0>Right, right, right. We're.</v>

120
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.590
<v 1>Being hippies. Yeah. We're being like kind of, I don't know,</v>

121
00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:31.950
weirdo hippy-ish we don't even stone know what the we're saying. We're stoners.

122
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.310
So have.

123
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.750
<v 0>You ever seen some of the image of the mining that they do?</v>

124
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.100
The images of the mining they to do in, um, Northern Canada?

125
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.620
Like Northern Alberta? No dude.

126
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.140
It's like some hellscape. It's crazy.

127
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.100
Cause like there's a giant industry of oil mining up there. Yeah.

128
00:06:50.101 --> 00:06:52.460
And all kinds of mining. Yeah. And Northern Canada,

129
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.580
a lot of folks that go up there and they do shifts, but I mean,

130
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.650
you're talking unbelievably brutal, ruthlessly cold.

131
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.370
Occasionally people get jacked by bears. Yeah. Like really they're,

132
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:06.650
they're living, they're living with monsters,

133
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:10.410
just outside the gates on some nights watch type deal where they're trying to

134
00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:12.770
suck oil outta the ground. And I mean,

135
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.730
there's so much of it up there and it's such a big part of the economy that you

136
00:07:15.731 --> 00:07:19.360
have these giant like AER views of these, this,

137
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.000
these places that are just Foxville. Oh, wow man.

138
00:07:24.001 --> 00:07:26.960
Here's here's one of 'em the one that I saw was much more horrific cuz it

139
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.920
involved the lake. So what does it say? Photos, fame photographer. Alex.

140
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.880
McLean's new photo of Canada's oil sands are shocking. Yeah.

141
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.720
I mean it's creepy. It's I mean, but there was nothing there. Anyway,

142
00:07:37.721 --> 00:07:38.554
the idea is like, Hey,

143
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.190
if it's just flat like that or it's ugly because we have holes in,

144
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.550
in oils coming outta the holes who gives a. No, one's up here. Right?

145
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.750
Like I get it. I get that mindset. We got jobs. Everyone has jobs and it's true.

146
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.710
It's a great job to have. They make a lot of money. You meet those dudes.

147
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.470
They come to a lot of shows. When you do in Canada,

148
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.620
they have a name for 'em like, like really rich or oil worker. Yeah. It's.

149
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.780
<v 1>Royal. It's real, real rich oil worker fellows. &lt;laugh&gt; that?</v>

150
00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:06.420
That's that is the nicknames.

151
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.660
<v 0>They're drilling these giant. That's one that I saw. You see the water all up.</v>

152
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.020
It's all filled with oil and. Oh my.

153
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.100
<v 1>Lords. Yeah.</v>

154
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.780
<v 0>That's a, that's a water man that the water's.</v>

155
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.113
Oh wow.

156
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.250
<v 1>Yeah. It's it's it's funny. All of the,</v>

157
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.730
all of the issues that all of the imbalances are completely solvable.

158
00:08:26.731 --> 00:08:30.290
There's like there is no deficit. We don't have a deficit, um,

159
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.730
in what it would take to just make good decisions that make life really

160
00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:37.690
nice for most people on the planet.

161
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.680
<v 0>I think a lot of managing has to be done because there's a lot of stuff that has</v>

162
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:47.200
unintended consequences and moving pieces affect all the moving pieces around

163
00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:48.034
them. Of course.

164
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.760
I think that's one of the things that people are really bad at predicting.

165
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.880
That's why I was saying like, yeah, you know,

166
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.360
how much is it worth to be able to get copper out of a hole in the ground,

167
00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:00.280
it's gonna poison a river and kill a bunch of fish. How much is that worth?

168
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.720
Yeah. You know, it's like,

169
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:07.280
these people have this sense that like you make

170
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.480
one decision and it only affects that thing,

171
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.440
but it doesn't affects a lot of things that are connected to that thing. Yeah.

172
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.270
It also affects the way P people feel. If you do something,

173
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.590
like kill a million fish, people get bummed out. Like that's real.

174
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.390
It affects the way they interact with other people. Yeah. You know,

175
00:09:22.391 --> 00:09:24.710
when you read something really up on the news, you're like, God.

176
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.350
And so you leave your house like that. You leave your house,

177
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:31.790
like God and two people that have that God. And then they,

178
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.380
they get upset at each other for something that wouldn't before. Yeah.

179
00:09:35.381 --> 00:09:37.380
Because they're just thinking there's a bunch of pedophiles out there and a

180
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:40.780
bunch of monsters and a bunch of murderers and a bunch of people pouring oil

181
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.620
into the ocean. Yeah. I know it's a bummer.

182
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:47.420
It changes when people do up things, it changes how we feel about people.
