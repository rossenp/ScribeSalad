00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.120
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Joe Marineland was my home.</v>

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.560
I was 12 years that I still to this day, I know I can feel that place.

3
00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:12.160
It was my home. Those animals were my family. It just was it's, you know,

4
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:13.480
it's in life. When you take for granted,

5
00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:16.880
when something is taken from you that you otherwise have. You know,

6
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:21.670
when I left that place, those animals are my mind. They have names,

7
00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:23.910
they have personalities, they have history with me,

8
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.670
and these are some really powerful, uh,

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.550
relationships that I had with the animals.

10
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.950
But you introduce the likes of smooshy suddenly my wall,

11
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.510
and now I become a freaking mother to her. I mean,

12
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:37.710
this is where things get really freaking weird. Well,

13
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:40.190
explain that to people that have never seen any of the earlier podcast.

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.420
I'll do a quick run up in 2000. Uh, I don't even remember. No,

15
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.900
at this 200 12, I quit Marineland because the, uh, the,

16
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.660
the conditions were such that I, I didn't have much of a choice left. Uh,

17
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.660
and so I did, but in doing so, I had to leave a Wal that had imprinted on me.

18
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.970
She, uh, she was a baby Wal that came into captivity from, you know,

19
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.570
while caught from Russia. In fact, the, you saw the footage of the baby wall.

20
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.810
Is that awful? I, that guts me well, it's also,

21
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.650
it's awful where they describe how they kill the mother to take away the baby.

22
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:15.570
That footage is it's, it's scary in any event. So

23
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.850
my having been there, as long as I did in leaving, I,

24
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.320
I haven't felt like I left. I felt there was unfinished business there.

25
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm not leaving my wall risk behind. I'm just not. And so

26
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.920
I'm, I'm very different. I'm a different person than what I was eight years ago,

27
00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:33.721
Joe, when I was coming on here,

28
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.440
I was a person who was desperate with a story to tell eight years later,

29
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:39.080
people know who I am. They know what's happening. There's a film about me. Now,

30
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.310
if there's ever been a time that I have a chance at saving this Wal,

31
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.310
it is now or never. How old is she now? She would be 18. Okay, Joe,

32
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.590
I got stories to tell about what she's she's 18.

33
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.790
I got stories to tell her what's happened to her. Okay.

34
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.350
Let me just give you a quick update since the, well, explain the imprinting,

35
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.870
how okay. How that worked. Cause.

36
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.590
So what became would know how close you are to this walrus? Absolutely.

37
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.420
So was the documentary's crazy when you see that thing Glu to you,

38
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.300
you just won't leave your side. She thinks of me every day.

39
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.860
It's all she thinks about.

40
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.180
This is where this is where the tide changes for me with captivity,

41
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:14.420
because I am now witness to the trauma of what's become of an animal that's been

42
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:16.740
separated from a its mother because I know it.

43
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.140
So ex explain to people who don't understand what that means, like what,

44
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.170
what happens with an animal when an imprints happy to, to so, uh, herd animals,

45
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:27.930
such as wall's that are otherwise in groups of, uh,

46
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.210
of thousands when their calves are born, they need to imprint on the mother.

47
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.530
So what happens is everything about them, every attribution, whether it be the,

48
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.210
the, their smell, uh, what they look like, the sound of their voice,

49
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:41.170
everything tattoos on that animal's brain so that their,

50
00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:43.730
that baby is able to identify that mother within thousands.

51
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.440
It's a scientific process that happens at birth.

52
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.560
When ooey came to us at two years of age, we were doing a, a,

53
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.120
a procedure on another wall and it caused her, you know,

54
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:55.080
she was in a heightened state of emotion and whatnot. She was going,

55
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.320
she was climbing all the other trainers. She was being a, a problem. So I,

56
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.720
I sought to pull her away from that situation.

57
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.880
All I did was put my hands in front of her face and she opened her nostrils big.

58
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.160
And I knew in that moment,

59
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:08.480
something had happened because now she was following me everywhere.

60
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.640
And I couldn't have attributed that to anything that I'd ever done in all of my

61
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:12.160
experience.

62
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.080
And so just to act of getting close to her and putting your hands on her face,

63
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.080
I believe it was during that traumatic, whatever happened,

64
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.270
her in circuitry opened.

65
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.110
And she realized that you're the one who takes care of her. I became her mom.

66
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.470
And so days go by and you know, I'm going back there and she's barking for me.

67
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:28.230
And I opened the gate. She's following me. And you know,

68
00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:29.630
she wasn't healthy when we got her.

69
00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:32.670
So now spending my eight hour to 12 hour shifts,

70
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.430
actually just sleeping and Soo she's laying on,

71
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.910
you see the footage in the documentary. She's just laying beside me.

72
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.940
She would only eat from me. It became this crazy thing. And that's what became,

73
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.220
I mean, and that's when that's when the that's,

74
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:48.260
when the world started to change for me. I, I don't have children, Joe, I don't,

75
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.940
I never did that. I mean, Frank,

76
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.940
that it's not an opportunity that would've been allotted to a person like me

77
00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.300
trying to fight multimillion dollar lawsuits and everything else.

78
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.340
I had to put a lot of things on hold in life. Generally, my life is on hold.

79
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.410
Lot of freaking ways because of, of, of what Marineland has done. I mean,

80
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:05.410
you see, they're sending the police to my house all the time. I mean,

81
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.730
over tweets and, like what?

82
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.890
And they send the police to your house over tweets. Like what,

83
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.770
what do the police say when they show up? Well, these days they leave,

84
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.050
then they leave with Marineland stickers. They gotta love getting that call,

85
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.720
but I don't think they wanna be there. They don't really wanna be there, but,

86
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.200
but why do they have to show up? Like, what are the tweets? What are you saying?

87
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.040
Because Twitter will ban you if you threaten people. I,

88
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.800
so you're not threatening anybody. The tweet that I sent that sent, well,

89
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.600
one of them was, life is short steal a wall.

90
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.440
And they sent the police to my house because I had tweeted. Life is short,

91
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.510
steal a wall. I tweeted it. I took a shower. I came back out,

92
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.510
I saw the tweeted explode. I said, oh, that's, that's gonna get some attention.

93
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.630
And the next day the cops pull up and I said, you gotta be kidding me. So I,

94
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.070
I light up the camera, the video, of course, you got the video in the film.

95
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.710
It's at the very end of the film. You see it, but here's, what's become

96
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.750
on June 1st,

97
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.340
a former employee of Marineland who had been fired inexplicably. She,

98
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.620
she herself couldn't quite understand.

99
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.500
Although we sort of figured it out over some time,

100
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.620
she came to me and she said she had things to tell me about smooshy.

101
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.180
And the one thing she said that struck me, she said she was pregnant. I said,

102
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:15.540
that's an impossibility 17 year old wall versus a,

103
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.540
it would be really grossly irresponsible to allow for that to happen.

104
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.370
Two what's our have spent well, in a while, they may go 30,

105
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.131
35 years at Marineland.

106
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:28.170
They don't last eight to 10 smooshy is the last one alive.

107
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.410
But what Marineland did is they negotiated a deal to have her transferred out

108
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.770
on my birthday. This sounds crazy, but I have the documentation.

109
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.330
I maybe shouldn't admit that, but I do.

110
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.200
They had plans to ship her out on March 21, my birthday, it failed.

111
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.520
It failed because of COVID. They tried two days later,

112
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.120
I got a tweet from the C F I from, uh, uh, an anonymous tweet from, uh,

113
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:55.080
someone saying your friends at the C F I a stopped an export to Germany,

114
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.280
to a facility, I believe. And I don't want to absolutely attribute it to it,

115
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:02.720
but I believe it's the tier park zoo in Hamburg, Germany. Uh, they, you know,

116
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:06.280
I've done some research. They breed walles. They know how to do it.

117
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.920
This girl says to me, I think like they were treating, Smoy like,

118
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:13.720
she's pregnant. It's an impossibility. There wasn't a male wall alive in the,

119
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.350
in the gestation period of a wall of a, of a Wal pregnancy. In fact,

120
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.230
the math is such that the last male died at the same time,

121
00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:23.710
as you would otherwise be getting swishy pregnant at Marineland at Marineland.

122
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:27.470
Now I worked there 12 years, and at the time we had like a lot of walrus,

123
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.390
they never successfully were successfully BR in fact,

124
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.550
Wal breeding is a very difficult thing in captivity.

125
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:38.420
You need a range of very specific things. You need certain UV lighting.

126
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:41.020
You need some fresher, you need a number of things. It's, it's a,

127
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:43.700
it's a rare thing. And it's quite celebrated what it happens in captivity.

128
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.420
I didn't believe her. I wouldn't believe her,

129
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:47.820
but she kept telling me of things that these,

130
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.820
that she kept telling me that there were veterinarian from Germany that were

131
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.700
there and that they were manipulating her.

132
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.020
And it had happened over some time and they were monitoring her. Now,

133
00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:00.450
when I put two and two together, okay, we've got an export to, to Germany.

134
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.610
That's supposed to happen in March canceled on account to COVID. We've got, uh,

135
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.570
we've got a girl telling me now that there's German,

136
00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:10.610
veterinarians that are manipulating smooshy. I tweeted,

137
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.570
I have I something to the effect. I I'm paraphrasing,

138
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:16.130
but something to the effect of, you know, I have a good, I have on good, uh,

139
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:20.360
reason to believe that M's been, uh, inseminated, like she's been made pregnant.

140
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.120
And, uh, June 3rd Marineland tweeted that ooey had given birth to a calf.

141
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.160
There's not been a picture of ooey since over a year ago on account to COVID

142
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.560
ooey was never taken out the park operated, but, you know,

143
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:38.830
obviously there was not a lot of numbers, but they,

144
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.510
because of the rules of bill S 2 0 3, which we had passed in Canada,

145
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.390
which bans the, the captive of, uh, of whales, dolphin, the purposes, it also,

146
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.350
uh, limits their performance. They,

147
00:07:49.351 --> 00:07:51.590
they're not actually allowed to perform for entertainment no more, uh,

148
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:54.070
much of the advertising is not allowed and whatnot.

149
00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:58.870
So when I read Marineland press release of what they,

150
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.460
you know of, of M's calf's birth, which I aptly named June,

151
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.180
which was the, the month she was born and is also the name of the, uh,

152
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.740
of Marineland veterinarian. Um,

153
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.660
they said they were monitoring smooshy carefully. And that, you know, these,

154
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.540
this, that giving birth is a risky thing.

155
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.450
We've not seen a picture of her since there's not been a IOT of an update.

156
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.410
In fact, I started to,

157
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.730
at one point I tweeted it's time for me to accept that smoo she's probably dead.

158
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:29.730
It had been months.

159
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.290
And whereas Marineland used to respond to my tweets with an update of oo sheet.

160
00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:35.650
There was nothing, there was nothing.

161
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.050
Now I knew that there was efforts to have her shipped out and whatnot.

162
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.800
So what happened was social media start to getting flooded.

163
00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:43.200
Marineland social media. People started saying where is.

164
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.240
MHI not only supporters of mine,

165
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.440
people that support Marineland Marine land's response. And this is a,

166
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:53.360
this was a national article in all of Canada.

167
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.400
That completely ignored everything. All media requests, my lawyers requests.

168
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.360
We just wanna know where smooshy is. We wanna know if she's still alive.

169
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.400
They blocked everybody. They're blocking fans. They're blocking everybody.

170
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:07.120
People started to call Marine lens's lawyer,

171
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.160
Marine lens's lawyer who has attributed himself as Marine lens spokesperson in

172
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:15.230
public was a Paul bear at John holder's death

173
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.710
was now telling people if you want answers about Marineland call Marineland.

174
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.910
He is Marineland. He's the one that does the answers where the is smooshy.

175
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.510
That's where I am at today.

176
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.070
I don't know with absolute certainty that she's alive,

177
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:31.670
but I should mention that I have been told by a lot of people that she is,

178
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:36.940
I have reason to believe that she is. I don't absolutely know, like how.

179
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.820
<v 1>Does someone know that? Who is someone.</v>

180
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.940
<v 0>Who works there? So because the people that work there. So,</v>

181
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.380
so what I should mention is that girl who had told me this information that got

182
00:09:44.381 --> 00:09:47.180
fired inexplicably, it turned out because she was like a junior trainer.

183
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.660
She was inadvertently in a meeting where they had gone over the details of the,

184
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.220
uh, German vets coming in and whatnot.

185
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.170
And one of the trainers were actually trying to stop Marine Anne's lawyer from

186
00:09:56.171 --> 00:09:58.130
revealing too much, because that girl shouldn't have been there.

187
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.970
And a week later she was fired. She doesn't understand what the hell happened.

188
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.370
I don't know that that's exactly the story, because this is what she says to me.

189
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:04.451
Now,

190
00:10:04.451 --> 00:10:08.450
imagine former employees come to me with stories and I typically tell people if

191
00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:10.690
you're a former employee, you're no, you're not really good to me anymore.

192
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:11.810
I mean, if you didn't have,

193
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.690
if you didn't have the gumption to do something while you're an employee,

194
00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:15.411
don't come to me now,

195
00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:17.680
because I don't know that you haven't been fired because you're.

196
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.240
I don't know your backstory.

197
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.840
I don't know that I'm able to trust your information,

198
00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:25.680
but hers came and I did do the tweet and it, it wound up being absolutely, uh,

199
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:26.640
absolutely true.
