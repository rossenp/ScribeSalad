WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So these groups were trying to</v>

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.430
incite violence. Now we get to the mode of, of,

3
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:15.930
of the official narrative of the Manson murder or the Tate LaBianca murders,

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.650
which is what the prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi presented at trial,

5
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:23.220
which was the famous helter-skelter motive. Um,

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.920
in a nutshell, uh, Manson believed that, uh,

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.740
there was going to be a race war and he wanted to incite this race

8
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:39.600
war because he had convinced his followers that through messages he received

9
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:44.070
from the Beatles white album, from their lyrics from biblical, uh,

10
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.070
old Testament prophecies that, um,

11
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.910
he had been told that he was going to be the savior of the world.

12
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.460
And once a race war started,

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.360
he would hide his family in a bottomless pit in the desert.

14
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.200
And when the race war ended with the blacks winning,

15
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.060
the blacks will be framed for, for murders. Um, they would, uh,

16
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.050
the massive family would emerge and repopulate the planet with their perfect

17
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.950
offspring and dominate the blacks. Um,

18
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.900
this was Vince Bugliosi well, he narrative, or there was talk of that.

19
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:22.980
There was a philosophy of Helter Skelter at the Spahn ranch, where,

20
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.000
where they lived in 68 and 69, that Manson would discuss.

21
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.690
But whether or not it was the motor for the murders is,

22
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.100
is I raised serious questions about that in the book, Manson.

23
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.270
<v 1>Would discuss it in that way that there was going to be a race war and that they</v>

24
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:41.450
would emerge and then their offspring. Yeah.

25
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.960
<v 0>Yeah. Except for the fact that, um, what's question.</v>

26
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:49.910
So the way Billy OSI was able to convict Manson Manson

27
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:52.490
wasn't at the Tate house. When the murders happened,

28
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.560
he had in the official story, dispatched Susan Atkins, Patricia Quinn,

29
00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:02.330
Winkle, Leslie Kasabian and Tex Watson to the house,

30
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.810
the former house of Terry Melcher. They didn't know who lived there,

31
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.430
but just to kill everybody and has Manson allegedly said,

32
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:11.570
leave something witchy.

33
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:16.250
He wanted it to look like blacks had killed these. Uh,

34
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.430
all he knew was they were wealthy, beautiful whites,

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.620
and he wanted to ignite the race war because of the Panthers

36
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.760
got blamed for these murders. Then the police would crack down on them.

37
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:33.110
They'd revolt the revolution, what happened, it would be app.

38
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.420
It would spread across the whole world.

39
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:40.010
And then when it was over and the blacks had prevailed, they were too dumb.

40
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:42.860
Manson believed to be able to run the world.

41
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.580
That's when he would come out with his followers of their hole in the desert and

42
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:48.800
take over the planet. Now,

43
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.860
Pooley OSI said in interviews that I didn't have until after

44
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:56.900
he and I stopped speaking,

45
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.340
which is when he started threatening me with lawsuits and other things in the,

46
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:02.710
in the about 2006, seven,

47
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.330
I discovered two or three interviews he gave in the early seventies where he was

48
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:12.310
asked if he believed that Manson really believed this craziness.

49
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.370
And Bugliosi said, I don't think Charlie believes in it.

50
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:18.850
He got his followers too, but he never believed in that he was too smart.

51
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:22.900
He was a con man, what the interviewers didn't ask them in the followup was,

52
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.430
well, if he didn't believe it,

53
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.360
why did he send his followers to kill these people?

54
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.840
The first night at the Tate house, the second night in Los villas is, you know,

55
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.140
upper middle-class, couple of the LaBianca because then, you know,

56
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:35.980
what was the motive?

57
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.960
And that's one of my biggest regrets is that I slipped and they were kind of

58
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:45.640
obscure. One was a penthouse interview. The other was a regional newspaper. Uh,

59
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.310
but then I didn't have them. I thought I had done all the research.

60
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.320
I thought I read every interview he'd ever given,

61
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.100
but I didn't have it at hand to say, all right,

62
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.020
then I get that because I don't think Manson believed that either.

63
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.850
Then what was the motive for the murders? Why were they sent there to kill?

64
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.860
And that's what the book explores.

65
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.430
<v 1>Um, so do you think Bugliosi was operating with the knowledge that</v>

66
00:04:08.431 --> 00:04:10.380
Manson was a part of these programs?

67
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.290
<v 0>Oh, that's the big question. Yeah. Again, I lay it out in the book.</v>

68
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:19.050
So I interviewed Bulli OSU. He was the first, not the first,

69
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:22.080
but one of the first interviews I did when I was a magazine assignment,

70
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.330
he invited me to his house and passed the Dina. Uh, so it was April of 99.

71
00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:29.970
We spent literally six hours together.

72
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:34.920
He was so kind and generous with his time. I thought I scored,

73
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:36.750
I had the prosecutor, hadn't given interviews.

74
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.080
He always gave interviews about this, but he hadn't for a number of years,

75
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.180
he agreed to do it for whatever reason.

76
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.500
And during the course of that interview, uh, you know,

77
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.340
w I arrived at his house, went into his kitchen.

78
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.030
His wife gave me a tie and cookies, coffee, and lemonade.

79
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.030
Then he and I went out to lunch in the valley somewhere.

80
00:04:57.031 --> 00:05:00.690
He showed me some of the sites connected to the murders.

81
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.110
Then we went back to the house and talk till sunset.

82
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.090
And towards the end of the six hours,

83
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:10.860
I did realize that even though he was talking non-stop and I'm recording

84
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:14.580
everything, he hadn't given me anything new or different. I mean,

85
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:17.220
I had just finished Helter Skelter. I read it for the first time,

86
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.070
cause I'd never been interested in the case till I got the assignment.

87
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.120
So I did what we call the hail Mary pass in journalism,

88
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:28.140
which is you ask someone if there's anything they could tell you off the record,

89
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:31.620
not for attribution that will help them to get something fresh,

90
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.120
because I was still searching for an angle.

91
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:34.710
This is the first month of reporting.

92
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.400
And then it's kind of thought a minute and he goes, turn it off, turn it off.

93
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.560
So I turned off the recorder and he did, I could tell he was debating,

94
00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:44.910
but then he told me something,

95
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.740
which I'm not sure if I don't think I reveal it till the last chapter.

96
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.170
So off the record was salacious pretty shocking in the

97
00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:59.930
larger pic picture. It doesn't change anything really,

98
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:04.040
but it showed me that he has a very different account of something very

99
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:08.870
important in the narrative. Um, and I took that away and I thought,

100
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:10.940
wow, I'm going to, uh,

101
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.060
well first let me explain it.

102
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.540
It's it was off the record in 2005,

103
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:21.500
when I interviewed him for the second time and all things went to hell and he

104
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:23.750
started threatening me and, uh,

105
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.630
with lawsuits and writing letters to my publisher,

106
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:31.070
trying to get them to stop the book. He wrote about what he told me.

107
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:33.500
And he claimed that, uh,

108
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.220
I had dragged it out of him and embellished it and all this.

109
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:40.640
But once he put that in a letter, the lawyers at the publisher said, well,

110
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:45.200
it's not on the record anymore because these documents will all be in a civil

111
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:48.860
trial when he sues you, which he said he was about to do not off the record.

112
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.620
You mean? Yeah, they said, now it's on the record. I mean, he is,

113
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.510
he's violated his agreement with you. So what he told me was that, um,

114
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.580
famously an audio or video tape was taken from the Tate house by the police,

115
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.650
excuse me, the first day after the murders, they found it hidden up in a loft,

116
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.030
uh, videotape videotaping home video taking was relatively new at that point.

117
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:13.550
Not a lot of people had cameras, but Roman Polanski did.

118
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.960
And in helter-skelter VIN says in the book, um,

119
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.900
that the police took the tape, viewed it,

120
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.360
and it was just Sharon and Roman making love and returned it to

121
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:28.010
the loft. Uh,

122
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.640
Roman was in London at the time of the murders.

123
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.140
He came back immediately. And then about a week later, he went up to the house.

124
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:39.890
And one of the first things he did was he went up to the loft and he never even

125
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:44.330
knew that they took it allegedly that that's a story, found it and took it.

126
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.670
Vince told me originally off the record that the tape wasn't of Roman and

127
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.160
Sharon making love, it was, uh,

128
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.630
Sharon being forced to have sex with two men against her wishes.

129
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.561
And he said,

130
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:00.350
Roman was the one who was making it because you could hear him in the

131
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:04.250
background. Um, you know,

132
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.800
if you read the book, you've read those chapters.

133
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.510
Roman did a lot of bad stuff to share. Yeah. He seemed like a terrible person.

134
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.040
He's pretty bad. But what do you.

135
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.840
<v 1>When you hear what he did? Well,</v>

136
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.820
the reason why he can never come back to the country go.

137
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.770
<v 2>Well. Okay. It makes sense. It makes sense.</v>

138
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.150
It's not that surprising as a monster. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, monster,

139
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.350
that's really good at making movies.

140
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.510
<v 3>Yeah, yeah. Which we're.</v>

141
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.400
<v 0>Not going to see anymore. Cause the last one he made,</v>

142
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:29.140
which is supposed to be at one of his best.

143
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.770
They're not going to release it in the United States. But, um,

144
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.420
once I had that,

145
00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:37.360
that's kind of the first rabbit hole I went down cause I'm like, well,

146
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:39.700
if this was different than the official narrative,

147
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.950
what else might they have changed?

148
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.260
So Vince and I were talking on the phone about every week for two

149
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:50.500
months and he was so accessible. So I'd be interviewing people.

150
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.140
And one of the first things after that, that I found was, uh, the perjury is,

151
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.270
uh, by Terry Melcher on the stand. I found,

152
00:08:57.271 --> 00:09:01.920
I got access to two separate files and found that Melcher

153
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.380
Doris stays on record producer,

154
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:07.230
young boy wander who lived in the house with his girlfriend,

155
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.790
candy Bergen on CLO up until January 1st of

156
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.540
69, then moved to Malibu. Um,

157
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.900
and Roman and Sharon moved into the house in February.

158
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.180
Melcher was the part of the motive for why the house was picked. And again,

159
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:25.200
this is getting into the weeds,

160
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:29.670
but it's hard to talk about any of this without this exposition. Um,

161
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.430
Manson sent his followers up there

162
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.880
to instill fear and Melcher by killing all the occupants of his

163
00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:40.830
former house who were strangers to them.

164
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.120
I don't believe that that's the official narrative, but, um,

165
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.450
Melcher testified at the grand jury.

166
00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:53.130
And then at the trial that he had three fleeting encounters with Manson,

167
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.230
one of beach boy drummers, Dennis Wilson's, uh, two there, I think. And then,

168
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.040
oh, no one there. And then two, when he went to the Spahn ranch in, uh,

169
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.940
April and may of 69 to listen to them,

170
00:10:05.941 --> 00:10:10.890
play music with the possible

171
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.650
possibility of recording them. Uh,

172
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.310
and he didn't think they were talented enough and told, uh,

173
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.750
trolley that in so many words. And then again, this is the official narrative.

174
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.960
Uh that's when Manson kind of spiraled and went crazy.

175
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.850
Cause he'd been rejected by Terry Melcher.

176
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:30.810
So he decided it was time for Helter Skelter, the race war. And again,

177
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.510
a lot of these things don't add up when you step back, well,

178
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:36.180
why didn't he kill Terry Melcher at the house in Malibu?

179
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.500
Because he knew where he had moved to,

180
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:40.320
why did he just go to this other place and kill strangers,

181
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.720
maybe Terry wouldn't connect at all that the bottom line was Terry on the stand

182
00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:49.230
and in all the official accounts of this case of which there are many,

183
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.150
not just helter-skelter, but lots of books.

184
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.620
His relationship with Manson ended in may of 69.

185
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:59.490
He said he never saw him again. When the murders happened at his former house,

186
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:00.810
it never occurred to him.

187
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.300
It had anything to do with him where that Manson did it.

188
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.090
I stopped believing that a month or two in.

189
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.250
And then I found these documents showing that melter actually had gone to see

190
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:14.700
Manson twice at the spawn ranch after the murders.

191
00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:18.330
And then once all the way out at death valley, where they had the Barker ranch,

192
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:21.930
where they were hiding when they were finally captured in, in the fall of 69.

193
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.960
Um, once I could document that, that changed the whole,

194
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.890
uh, I mean, it didn't change, but impacted the mode. I mean,

195
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.570
Melcher was a principal witness again because Charlie wasn't at the Tate house

196
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.500
Manson had, or bullosa had to convict them of conspiracy. In other words,

197
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.440
ordering people to go up there and kill.

198
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.090
And he had to have a reason for that house. So Terry provided it by saying, yes,

199
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:50.130
I did go out there and try to record them.

200
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.800
And then eventually in the question it came out,

201
00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:55.390
but I never had anything to do with them. Again. I had no idea.

202
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:57.390
I never saw him or heard from him again, motivation.

203
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.140
<v 1>Was revenge and Terry Melcher cause Tom Terry Melcher didn't turn him into a</v>

204
00:12:01.141 --> 00:12:03.960
star. So this is what bullying is he was using.

205
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.070
But it didn't make any sense because Melcher saw him after the murder several

206
00:12:08.071 --> 00:12:08.904
times.

207
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.630
<v 0>And not only even if it made it, it didn't make sense. You're you're right.</v>

208
00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:13.950
And that's why I think, well,

209
00:12:13.951 --> 00:12:17.730
I think you could get away with anything then because the antics of the family

210
00:12:17.731 --> 00:12:20.670
at the trial and everybody was so horrified about what was going on,

211
00:12:20.671 --> 00:12:25.650
nobody was looking at this critically and questioning stuff because every day,

212
00:12:25.651 --> 00:12:25.921
you know,

213
00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:29.040
Manson and the girls are getting thrown out of the courtroom for screaming,

214
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:32.910
for singing, for dancing, for mocking the proceedings. Um,

215
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.920
so all this stayed under the radar,

216
00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:38.790
but once I could prove that Maltra lied and then two or three more,

217
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.630
then I knew that I had to question the entire narrative.

218
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.370
So bully OSI started monitoring my interviewing.

219
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.170
This is all laid out in the beginning of the book.

220
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.460
So by the fall of the first year of 99,

221
00:12:53.461 --> 00:12:56.580
I got a call from one of my sources, Rudy out to beli,

222
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.110
who was another important witness.

223
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.970
He was the man who owned the house where the murders happen. He was traveling.

224
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.660
He was traveling actually in Europe with Sharon who had come back about

225
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.070
sharing tape about three weeks before, uh, to have her baby. Um,

226
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.630
and Rudy had told me from the very beginning, he was very close to Terry,

227
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.000
Dennis Wilson and the third guy, Greg Jacobsen,

228
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.290
Greg Jacobson was another important witness who lied throughout the whole,

229
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.970
all of his testimony in the trial to fit a narrative that Pence needed. Um,

230
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.800
Rudy had told me that Vince called him, uh, oh,

231
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.290
excuse me, Terry called him and said, what are you telling us?

232
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.440
O'Neil no one was supposed to know about that mince promised me it would never

233
00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:42.000
come out. So at that point I knew that I was onto something even even bigger.

234
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.650
And then, um,

235
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.630
I got a call from Vince and he left a message on my machine saying he wanted to

236
00:13:48.631 --> 00:13:51.960
talk to me. It was important. So I called him back and he said,

237
00:13:51.961 --> 00:13:55.080
you know what I'm hearing? I can't remember who told me.

238
00:13:55.081 --> 00:13:58.860
And that was another little game of his. He would never be like, Trump's saying,

239
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.810
um, this guy said to me or one of my friends or they say, uh,

240
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.250
Vince, that someone told me,

241
00:14:05.251 --> 00:14:10.230
I heard that you're questioning my tactics and my choices at the trial is that

242
00:14:10.231 --> 00:14:13.020
true? You know, Tom, what's, what's going on here I go. Well, you know,

243
00:14:13.021 --> 00:14:15.690
I'm looking at stuff and it's, and you know, you knew where this was going.

244
00:14:15.691 --> 00:14:17.070
I mean, I know we haven't taught at that point.

245
00:14:17.071 --> 00:14:20.040
We hadn't talked for about six weeks. I think he goes, well,

246
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:24.960
I want you to assure me that I'll be given the opportunity to answer

247
00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:26.460
any of these questions. He goes,

248
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.090
because what might appear irregular to you as a lay person can be easily

249
00:14:30.091 --> 00:14:32.850
explained by me. I said, well, of course, Vince,

250
00:14:32.851 --> 00:14:35.910
I'll definitely swing back around to you before he goes,

251
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.850
then I thought this was going to be out in August. And we were in like October,

252
00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:41.490
I think I go, yeah, I got an extension. He goes, well,

253
00:14:41.491 --> 00:14:42.510
they're also saying you're doing,

254
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.960
it's a book and that you lie that it's not a magazine. I go, no, no,

255
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.280
I'm still getting paid by premier.

256
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.280
Cause I was at that point and I had no idea it was going to be a book because we

257
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.630
were still in the first seven months. So at that point I,

258
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:58.580
we stopped talking Vince and I, and it wasn't until 2005,

259
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.260
when I got my book deal that I went back to him with these questions and

260
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.600
I thought hoped naive, really?

261
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.410
That I would get him to break down and say, yes,

262
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:14.030
this was all a CIA operation. I was awkward. Oh God, that was stupid of me.

263
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:14.661
But you know, I thought,

264
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:18.530
what else can he say when I put all this in front of him? But you know, um,

265
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.023
as.

266
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.730
<v 1>He must've been really freaked out by how deep you got into this.</v>

267
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:25.990
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, again,</v>

268
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:30.400
you've read the prologue to the book where we open in that scene in his kitchen

269
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.910
where he's screaming and cursing at me and saying, he's going to hurt me.

270
00:15:33.911 --> 00:15:37.780
Like I've never been hurt before. And he's going to Sue me for a hundred hours,

271
00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.390
hundreds of millions of dollars. It's crazy.

272
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.080
When you get to the end of the book, you'll see the outcome of that day.

273
00:15:44.081 --> 00:15:46.780
And what happened when he's begging me, he's saying he'll give me a,

274
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.620
a quote on the cover of my book if I don't publish this stuff. And,

275
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.870
and then when I wouldn't agree to anything,

276
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:57.280
then the lawsuit threats started happening. So I naively,

277
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.640
I didn't think he was going to break down and say,

278
00:16:00.641 --> 00:16:03.610
I was working for someone else. I had no choice. Right.

279
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.990
But instead he was evasive, threatening, screaming, denying.

280
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.930
He had two recorders. I had two recorders.

281
00:16:10.931 --> 00:16:13.450
He's he's he went off the record every two minutes.

282
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.580
So we'd have to turn off all the recorders.

283
00:16:15.581 --> 00:16:18.550
And Vince was not turning his I'm like Vince, you didn't turn yours back. Oh no,

284
00:16:18.551 --> 00:16:21.700
you didn't turn it off. Wait, no, that's my record. Now this is yours.

285
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.950
So woman and he's screaming and cursing at.

286
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.640
<v 3>Me going have any idea how I will you.</v>

287
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.720
<v 0>Put this in your book and then the recorders go back on.</v>

288
00:16:31.721 --> 00:16:36.430
But sometimes they were already on because we couldn't keep up with all the off

289
00:16:36.431 --> 00:16:38.950
the record. Jeez. Then when I got home that night,

290
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.940
so I walk out of the house six hours, exactly. Almost six hours,

291
00:16:42.941 --> 00:16:46.590
just like the first time, six years earlier, he's grabbing me by the arm.

292
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.880
He goes, this isn't a quid pro quo. This isn't quid pro quo.

293
00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:53.020
But if you don't put this ridiculous nonsense in, he goes, you know,

294
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.280
a blur from Vince pool.

295
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.240
He always referred to himself in the third person of blur from thins polio.

296
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.700
OSEA on the cover of this book. You have no idea what that does.

297
00:17:00.701 --> 00:17:04.900
And I rarely do it. I'm very selective. I get asked 10, 20 times a day. I mean,

298
00:17:04.901 --> 00:17:07.090
the man's ego is you'll see that in the book.

299
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.800
Then I get home that night there's messages call me, call me. And he called me,

300
00:17:11.801 --> 00:17:15.430
I think it's a week, week and a half almost every day, the next morning,

301
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.350
a few days later trying to, he would bully me. And then he say, no, no,

302
00:17:20.351 --> 00:17:23.440
G you know, look up what this is going to do to my family, my kids,

303
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.080
and all that went on and on and on. So.

304
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:30.670
<v 1>Had to be very excited by that, knowing that like, this is there's no,</v>

305
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.950
there's no reason for that guy to react.

306
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.970
<v 2>Like that unless you had them. Right. I know. I know. And then he knew.</v>

307
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.800
<v 0>Yeah. So a year he kept not a year later. He said, when we finally,</v>

308
00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:45.490
he goes at the very, the very last phone call, which is a week and a half later,

309
00:17:45.491 --> 00:17:48.220
he goes, so you're really going to go ahead and do with this go,

310
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:52.380
go ahead with a set of, I'm going to report what I have. I go, if you want,

311
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.370
oh, at this point I had lost the magazine deal had ended.

312
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.710
I had sold the book. So I, he knew I had a publisher. I told him who it was.

313
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.650
And he asked for my editor's name there. He said,

314
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:06.900
because I will be sending them a letter. He goes,

315
00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:08.970
I will work on this letter for hours.

316
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.360
It's going to be a complete rebuttal of everything.

317
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.530
You argued all of your arguments, all your points.

318
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.700
It's going to ruin you.

319
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.040
They're going to cancel your deal because they're not stupid.

320
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.960
So he wrote the letter, they got it. And I think it was June or July,

321
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.560
uh, after February of that year, 2005.

322
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.880
And I got a call from my editor. He said, you got to talk to our attorneys.

323
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.270
He goes, we have a letter from Vance. I go, well, I told you it was coming.

324
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.410
He goes, it's insane. It's 34 pages,

325
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:45.000
single space with 50 pages of attachments. And,

326
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.530
uh, he goes, I've never seen anything like this. So he said, talk,

327
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.190
talk to the attorney. So they sent me over to the attorney and he said,

328
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:55.500
my first question, I'd never met the guy before he goes,

329
00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.630
my first question for you O'Neill is,

330
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.030
is he suffering from dementia? He goes,

331
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.690
I was a law student during the trial. And he goes,

332
00:19:06.691 --> 00:19:10.350
I follow the trial every day in the paper, I've read Helter Skelter.

333
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:12.240
He was brilliant. He goes,

334
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.870
I can't believe the person that wrote this letter wrote that book.

335
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:19.830
So maybe you were dealing with somebody who was impaired. I said,

336
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.670
he's mentally ill. And I have a lot of proof of that in the book. He, he,

337
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.650
it's not dementia. I go,

338
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:30.360
he's finishing his Magnum Opus a 20 year effort to write a book of

339
00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:35.280
rebutting, the critics of the Warren commission about the Kennedy assassination.

340
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.030
I always got a book coming out a tour and sure enough, you know, he wrote,

341
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:43.380
I think two or three more books. After that, I go, he's just, I caught him.

342
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.450
He goes, all of his arguments. Don't make sense. He's contradicting himself.

343
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:53.130
The letter goes off in a directions that it sounds like it's written by a

344
00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:57.000
madman. And I go, is it going to inhibit us? He goes, oh, no, we're selling,

345
00:19:57.001 --> 00:20:00.240
we're opening the champagne here. I mean, he wouldn't write a letter like this,

346
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.270
unless you got them. Well.

347
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.790
<v 1>The name of it makes sense. 50 pages of attachments.</v>

348
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.220
<v 3>That was the first letter. And.</v>

349
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.970
<v 0>About six months later, another letter, I think there were four total.</v>

350
00:20:10.971 --> 00:20:14.060
I quote some of them in the book. Um, it was nuts.

351
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.890
And unfortunately he passed away in 2015 or 16.

352
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.590
And I get a lot of criticism by, I mean,

353
00:20:21.591 --> 00:20:24.740
you get it from all cuisine when he died. Uh,

354
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.680
I think 74 or five, it was cancer.

355
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.640
I knew he was sick off and on for a couple of years. Um,

356
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.710
but I've been accused by my critics of not publishing the book until

357
00:20:36.711 --> 00:20:41.360
he died because of these threats of law. No, I wanted him to be alive.

358
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.510
I wanted him to be accountable and have to answer to all this.

359
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.830
The reason I didn't publish it when I was going to publish it was penguin.

360
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.610
My publisher canceled my deal in 2011.

361
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.610
They, the motive though, to get back to the motive. Yeah,

362
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.820
for initial motive was double, I mean, bully,

363
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.060
as he said in his closing arguments that, uh, the,

364
00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:06.180
the main motive was to ignite Helter Skelter race war.

365
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:10.740
The sub motive was to instill fear in Terry Melcher because he had rejected

366
00:21:10.741 --> 00:21:15.180
Manson. Right. So you're saying, well then if it wasn't those, then what was it?

367
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.890
Right. All right. If you look at the co COINTELPRO objectives,

368
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.480
which was to, to, um, diminish the, you know,

369
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.340
to neutralize the left wing movement, to make them look horrible, evil, bad,

370
00:21:29.341 --> 00:21:32.760
and this is what drugs are going to do to your kids. Um,

371
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.870
the kind of outcome that this, this,

372
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:41.010
these murders had was to make the hippies, the boogeyman,

373
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:45.810
I mean the biggest boogeyman in the United States history, I don't know forever,

374
00:21:45.811 --> 00:21:49.020
but at least until the seventies became Charlie Manson.

375
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.150
And when Manson was,

376
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:56.070
and his family were identified as suspects the first week of December 69,

377
00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.550
I mean, it was like earth shaking because all of a sudden,

378
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.090
nobody knew who had committed the murders that the case was open from August

379
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:04.620
till first to December,

380
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:09.330
you have photos on the front page of every paper in the world of these hippie

381
00:22:09.331 --> 00:22:13.200
women, you know, nursing children, living communally,

382
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:18.120
who are accused these horrible, brutal slangs.

383
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.090
And the argument was,

384
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:26.040
and what the reporters were reporting was they had gone crazy on LSD and

385
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:30.900
free love and, and, and the hippie ethic. And, uh,

386
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.830
that was same thing, chaos and control, trial power, trying to do.

387
00:22:34.831 --> 00:22:38.850
They were trying to damage the youth revolution, the youth movement.

388
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.820
They targeted that house though. Uh,

389
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.050
so J Edgar Hoover,

390
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.340
when he had the COINTELPRO operation that he wrote or now, excuse me,

391
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:55.110
an LA agent wrote a memo to Hoover saying what we

392
00:22:55.111 --> 00:22:59.310
have to do. This was when they were mostly battling the Panther. I mean,

393
00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:04.020
trying to neutralize the Panthers in LA was go after the

394
00:23:04.021 --> 00:23:08.790
whites, the elite whites, the Hollywood whites who were supporting the Panthers.

395
00:23:08.791 --> 00:23:13.500
There was something called the white Panther party that began in LA 67 or 68,

396
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.960
Jane Fonda, Warren Beatty, Cass Elliott.

397
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:19.080
Those three were actually under surveillance by the FBI.

398
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.720
They were part of this group, Donald Sutherland.

399
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.030
And they were basically a support Leonard Bernstein.

400
00:23:24.031 --> 00:23:28.530
They supported the Panthers, they raised money. So in this one memo, which, uh,

401
00:23:28.531 --> 00:23:32.610
I think it was the winter of 68, it's got the date.

402
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.780
And the book said that what we have to make the whites think is that when the

403
00:23:36.781 --> 00:23:39.780
revolution finally happens, when the blacks rise up,

404
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.060
there'll be lined up with everybody else and slaughtered. So if,

405
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.550
look at that memo, that was part of their operation, which was to,

406
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:54.110
they did it by sending letters, making, you know, the white scare.

407
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.260
And so that I hate to speculate,

408
00:23:57.261 --> 00:23:59.630
but I think people will draw that conclusion.

409
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.430
If you read the book that this could have been a chaos or COINTELPRO

410
00:24:04.431 --> 00:24:09.020
operation to turn, you know,

411
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:13.400
the world, the nation, the culture against hippies,

412
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:15.350
the left wing, the black Panthers.

413
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:20.560
<v 1>And they picked that house because it was high profile because Sharon Tate was</v>

414
00:24:20.561 --> 00:24:20.740
in.

415
00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.950
<v 0>It. So we're not going to Sharon Tate was there, her and Polanski.</v>

416
00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.670
And that's one thing that Tarantino,

417
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.060
I don't think he showed that the parties at the house,

418
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.200
they were like the social center of Hollywood.

419
00:24:32.201 --> 00:24:33.700
It wasn't just the movie people.

420
00:24:33.701 --> 00:24:37.360
It was the music people and Terry Melcher and candy Bergen lived there for two

421
00:24:37.361 --> 00:24:41.110
years before that was a party house. Everybody went in and out of there,

422
00:24:41.111 --> 00:24:46.000
it kind of represented the elite of, of, of movies,

423
00:24:46.001 --> 00:24:49.210
music, Hollywood, you know, white people.

424
00:24:49.211 --> 00:24:53.890
So that would have been a very high profile place to hear it because all.

425
00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.910
<v 1>The people in that community in the Hollywood community would then also be aware</v>

426
00:24:57.911 --> 00:25:01.750
that that was a spot that they had been to all these high profile people had

427
00:25:01.751 --> 00:25:02.680
been there. Yeah.

428
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:06.250
<v 0>It's like Joan Didion wrote in her book, the white album, uh,</v>

429
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.150
that the morning she learned about the murders and she knew most of the victims,

430
00:25:10.151 --> 00:25:13.960
she goes, it occurred. She goes, I knew that the sixties had ended.

431
00:25:13.961 --> 00:25:18.670
They were over. I mean, there was also Altima and, uh, I mean,

432
00:25:18.671 --> 00:25:22.240
not a whole lot else, but that was like a cultural watershed moment.
