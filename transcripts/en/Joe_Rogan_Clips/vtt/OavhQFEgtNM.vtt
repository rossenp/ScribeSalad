1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.750
<v 0>All that kind of. We were like, okay. But what if, what if, what.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 1>If CNN and Fox news and all that, I know you hate them really,</v>

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:09.060
but what if they just, you know, they create kind of this, this panic,

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.520
what if they just on 24,

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.790
7 car crashes and people dying from obesity and you know,

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.930
we'd be terrified. We'd be terrible. It's not in our face, but it's way worse.

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.750
<v 2>So power so powerful, so powerful. Um,</v>

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.280
they can get the people to believe in anything, anything, anything,

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.100
if they say, they said, guess what? We found,

10
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:36.540
Santa Claus's bones in the mountains and in Norway,

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.820
people would believe that they could do a lot of people. You know,

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.820
they'd be like, you know what, dude, you know, they found Santa Claus bones,

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.000
there'd.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.340
<v 1>Be flying up there. And a dude, the media's powerful.</v>

15
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.173
<v 2>As.</v>

16
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.913
<v 1>He's super powerful.</v>

17
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.320
<v 0>This, this disease is a good example of it.</v>

18
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:51.360
It's not something that we shouldn't be afraid of. We should,

19
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.290
we should definitely be afraid.

20
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.480
We should be afraid of something that could come down the pipe.

21
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:56.790
That's more deadly. That's what we should be afraid of.

22
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.880
That's what those people, the center for disease control told me and Duncan,

23
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:02.070
we did a show there years ago. They were saying, well,

24
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:04.950
we really have to worry about, as these diseases, just jumping at people.

25
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:06.900
He said, it happens all the time. He can't control it.

26
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.630
<v 1>But learn from China, learned from Italy. Like they were unprepared.</v>

27
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:10.440
They didn't take it.

28
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.200
Or maybe they just didn't know it didn't have the resources,

29
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:13.770
but learn from their mistakes. You know.

30
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.410
<v 0>Price information. They tried to suppress information. China.</v>

31
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.730
<v 2>You're busy with the moon. You know, they, they went to the moon who to China.</v>

32
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.360
They went.

33
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.250
<v 0>To the moon things. Different people. No, no.</v>

34
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.113
<v 2>China.</v>

35
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.190
<v 0>1 Million people, a lot of.</v>

36
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.540
<v 1>People here.</v>

37
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.030
<v 2>They went, they got video. You can.</v>

38
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.380
<v 1>Watch the and blast it out.</v>

39
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.980
<v 2>No, they did. But no one [inaudible].</v>

40
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.650
<v 0>That drone to the surface of the moon too.</v>

41
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.910
<v 1>Kind of go to the dark side of the moon. That's kind of dope.</v>

42
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.280
<v 2>That's hilarious. I need the Chinese are awesome. Come on.</v>

43
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.940
<v 1>This is the other thing, Joe. A bit about the coronavirus and Karen Calla,</v>

44
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.783
jump on this.

45
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.040
<v 0>And then she's called it. Oh.</v>

46
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.000
<v 1>This is the best you've.</v>

47
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.460
<v 0>Ever dressed. Oh, you have a kombucha and a water bottle. That's it.</v>

48
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.830
It's appointed like great, Easy,

49
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.830
slow down cooties.

50
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.430
<v 2>Come on. We don't shake hands around her elbow.</v>

51
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.263
<v 0>Up.</v>

52
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.390
<v 1>Uh, but with the Chrome, they're also saying that, you know,</v>

53
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:18.870
because the lack of testing, there might be way more people with it.

54
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.220
So it shows that how, how,

55
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:23.040
it's not that deadly because we know how many people die. That's for sure.

56
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.100
But we don't know how many people have it. So it could be a less DeLeon.

57
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:29.520
And we think, well, I like to think of the glass half full Joe.

58
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.410
It doesn't make you and your texts worry me.

59
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.860
<v 0>What does it make you think about the flu too? I mean,</v>

60
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.020
if this is supposed to be 10 times more,

61
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.600
potentially 10 times more deadly than the flu, right?

62
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.970
This is what the worst case scenario.

63
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.890
<v 2>They make a lot of predictions. They do and have.</v>

64
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.803
<v 0>To try it.</v>

65
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.020
<v 2>Right with these predictions and we start going, you're right.</v>

66
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.420
How often are they? Right.

67
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.840
<v 0>Right. But if they are right, we have to be prepared for the worst. See,</v>

68
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.550
it's still the best fit. Exactly.

69
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.860
It can be an inconvenience to be prepared for the worst. It should really,

70
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.990
it should open up our minds and our, our, our brains as to what is causing this.

71
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.330
And is there another way to generate food? How about community.

72
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.550
<v 2>When we're old, when we're in our eighties,</v>

73
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.070
the kids during those times are going to look at us as weird because like old

74
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:18.370
people love toilet paper. They just hoard toilet paper.

75
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.960
Because from this point on, we have never lived through toilet paper shortage.

76
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.640
I have never heard about that.

77
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.000
<v 0>Toilet paper shorts are really the, what the problem is,</v>

78
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:29.440
is way bigger than that. It's making diseases,

79
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.230
raise food is making disease childhood.

80
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.180
<v 2>In China. I wasn't talking about that in China.</v>

81
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.640
And I'm just talking about toilet paper I was talking about.

82
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.570
<v 0>But I'm saying just it's crazy. We were,</v>

83
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.310
we were making viruses like avian flu. That was bird agriculture, right?

84
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.520
The swine flu. That was a pig agriculture.

85
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.830
When they jam all these animals together,

86
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.490
occasionally one of those bugs will jump. Let's.

87
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.730
<v 1>Buttons.</v>

88
00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.160
<v 0>Didn't [inaudible].</v>

89
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.360
<v 3>Fevers came from fruit.</v>

90
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.220
<v 0>Bats, I think. Yeah. That came from another animal.</v>

91
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.700
And then one that was different from there's a, I mean,

92
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:10.360
there's tons of these flus though. Brian are the ones that jumped.

93
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.000
<v 1>And they're all, they're all considered Corona virus.</v>

94
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.270
They're all labeled as Corona viruses. They're just different type of disease.

95
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.320
They're all the same strain.

96
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.860
<v 0>Apparently was a more deadly, even than this one.</v>

97
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.320
It's a wake-up call, man.

98
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:28.210
It's a wake up call for anybody that has anything to do with regulating

99
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:31.420
how people raise food. But like, there's been mistakes made,

100
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.770
but this does seem like.

101
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.730
<v 3>Like a wide.</v>

102
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.980
This does seem like a massive overreaction in terms of a virus that only kills

103
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:40.480
people who are what the mean age is 81.

104
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.040
<v 0>One that guy Sam Harris told me about some dude is in his fifties is on a</v>

105
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:45.874
ventilator.

106
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.380
<v 1>Bad immune.</v>

107
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.190
<v 0>System who knows what could have happened. Who knows what could have happened,</v>

108
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.190
buddy could Dak it happen. That's not a normal thing for a guy who's really fit.

109
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.530
<v 1>Here. You know, my dad's 60, my dad's terrified. And I got that thing you said.</v>

110
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.820
And he said, I think to the group text where it says,

111
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.340
Trump confirmed coronavirus. She click on it.

112
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.390
It's just this dude sitting on a bed with this black dude with this famous,

113
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.200
with the fattest Cognos in your life. It's great. So I said to my,

114
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:20.950
I thought it was funny. I sent it to my dad. Didn't find it funny at all.

115
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.540
He put what the would find this funny. I'm like, yeah.

116
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.230
<v 0>Oh God, Tom Segura sent us a picture that says, if you know this guy's face,</v>

117
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:31.420
you have up friends. Yes.

118
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.340
<v 1>Is he a real porn.</v>

119
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.680
<v 0>Star? Oh my God. If he is, he's the best dude.</v>

120
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.700
[inaudible] who was he fighting? These are good fights.

121
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.520
This is a really good car. Johnny Walker is fighting.

122
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.370
Gilbert burns going to be Maya, Maya. Great fight.

123
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.230
Who is the natto McConnell fighting? Um, God, Jamie, do you have the,

124
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.730
the cards pretty stacked?

125
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.020
<v 1>It's better than the last card.</v>

126
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.420
<v 0>It's a very good card. And usually in.</v>

127
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.620
<v 1>Brazil, they show up when there's no one in the crowd. Weird.</v>

128
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.680
<v 0>Is Rinaldo. Oh, this is a good fight. Toronado.</v>

129
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.630
<v 1>67 Years old, but this is a good role.</v>

130
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.560
<v 0>He's a bad though. That guy throws dude.</v>

131
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:10.430
He is from the beginning of his career. He's always, always been a dangerous,

132
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.590
a dangerous, dangerous.

133
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.510
<v 1>And listen. Cause there's no crowd.</v>

134
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.960
And you just hear Michael Bisping's voice narrating it. Right? Commentating.

135
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.780
It sounds like you're watching a golf event. Cause he,

136
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.630
cause they're kind of subdued too, because there's no energy. So he's like,

137
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.490
and he goes to Mount elbow here.

138
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.490
<v 0>Oh my God. There's nobody here. There's nobody here. No, there's no one.</v>

139
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:32.630
There's no one in the crowd bro. We're living in a movie. Oh, it's so weird.

140
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.020
Strange ever. We're living in a movie. It's a hormone.

141
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.140
Why didn't we have this reaction with H one N one that, that put a lot of people

142
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.580
[inaudible] here. Right? But, but the swine flu was.

143
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.290
A lot of people [inaudible] this is madness. It's insane.

144
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.380
This is madness is an empty arena. And the, I still.

145
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.560
<v 1>Do Tom Hanks has it. You son of a.</v>

146
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.900
<v 0>And guess what? He'll be fine.</v>

147
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.183
<v 1>He'll be fine.</v>

148
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.540
<v 0>It's Tom Hanks. I don't get it. I'm still confused. Nobody's told me why this,</v>

149
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.050
this virus. No, none of the it's all theories. Well,

150
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.060
there's some real dangers that it might be as much as 10 to 15 times stronger.

151
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.150
<v 2>The media, the media is running with this because it's bad for Trump. I did.</v>

152
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.020
And it kills the economy. That's all.

153
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.280
<v 0>The virus cologists have that in mind when they make their decisions.</v>

154
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:26.240
I think all these disease experts are trying to save millions of people from

155
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:29.600
unnecessarily dying. They're trying to stop a disease in its tracks.

156
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.660
That's what they're doing. They've done this forever with polio.

157
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.630
They've done this with smallpox. This is what they do. They try to stop.

158
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.230
Track diseases are trying to kill us every day.

159
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.040
It's as if we have a war and there's a war against viruses.

160
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.340
It's a re it's almost like a real war against a thing.

161
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.180
But we don't think of it as a thing because it's it's, you can't see it,

162
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.810
but it's uh, it's an attack on the human system.

163
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.470
It's an attack on human beings and it's constant and it's evolving.

164
00:07:57.471 --> 00:08:01.130
It's always changing. There's too many of us. And that's what it recognizes.

165
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:02.780
And it's trying to get rid of us this crazy.

166
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.090
<v 2>I'm learning how to have, how many people,</v>

167
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:09.800
how many people have died in the U S so far, 50,050, no fifties,

168
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.710
50th. And what is the average? What is the average?

169
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.840
81 and the MBA and all canceled. Everything.

170
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:22.040
Everything canceled because nobody in the audience then the average age is 80.

171
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.500
Yeah. You would think about going home.

172
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.530
You would think if you just found out about this,

173
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.260
you just woke up from a coma and then you see how everything's kind of was you

174
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:32.870
would be thinking people were dying on the streets running.

175
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.740
It was like the zombie apocalypse. That's why I'm asking stay home.

176
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.790
There's som bees on the streets.

177
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.880
<v 0>That's what you would think exactly what you would think. Right?</v>

178
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.190
<v 2>But the average age of the people dying in the United States is</v>

179
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.900
80 and half of them are from an old folks home in Washington.

180
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.430
How did they get? And then you, you see on the back of a Lysol bottle,

181
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.920
it says, it lists all the viruses that it kills. And it says human coronavirus.

182
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.940
I'm like, oh, I thought this was a new, oh, but it's a different strain.

183
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.050
You know? So I'm like, wait a minute. The average age is eight.

184
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.010
<v 0>Pause for a second. When give people the time. It's a two 30 of the first round</v>

185
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:18.570
2 29, 2 28, 2 27, 2 26, 2 25.

186
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.200
So if you want to sync it up, we're watching John Mack, Desi versus tree.

187
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.060
Now though Francisco Chinelo Paul versus unorthodox. Although bad-ass,

188
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.010
kickboxer, he's a shy with our saying, he's always a dangerous, yeah,

189
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.100
he never has like an off night. He's just such like he's been.

190
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.210
<v 3>Fighting since he was seven.</v>

191
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.820
<v 0>It is a weird thing to see no audience.</v>

192
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:42.540
And it's a weird thing to think that so many people are so afraid of this,

193
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:43.920
that they don't do anything and go out.

194
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:48.120
But it kind of makes sense if it's as bad as they think it is. Now,

195
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.830
if it's not as bad as they think it is,

196
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.250
the problem is there's going to be a lot of people that are not going to believe

197
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:55.170
them. The next something comes up to tonight.

198
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.690
<v 2>No, no, no. They'll believe everyone did.</v>

199
00:09:57.691 --> 00:10:01.030
We believed every one so far the younger generation people forget. No, no.

200
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.190
<v 0>No, no, no. Some people.</v>

201
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.330
<v 2>This is going to work. All I know, I know it always wore, I don't know.</v>

202
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:09.570
It always works. It works every two years, Ebola.

203
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.340
<v 0>Well, I don't think it's a works Eddie.</v>

204
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:14.880
I think there's a constant battle going on between people and viruses.

205
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.870
This is a story that has a real [inaudible]

206
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.870
, But it has a real clear beginning. And you could follow the history of viruses in the United States and in the world, 

207
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.870
like a little herds, right? Where it's weak people to be about this. He calls

208
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:19.703
 it the boomer virus. When people.

209
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.700
<v 3>Take out.</v>

210
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.680
<v 0>The young polio or the Spanish flu, right. That was really bad for young guys.</v>

211
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.420
[inaudible] it was killing a lot of guys with great immune systems by some,

212
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.400
some way, the way it attacks.

213
00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:47.520
And this is what the 1920 or w.

214
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.800
<v 2>Didn't hygiene fix most of that sanitation. Yeah.</v>

215
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.430
<v 0>Eddie does it. It fixes a lot of infrastructure. Doesn't stop it viruses.</v>

216
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.360
<v 2>All Brian is saying, all Brian is saying is where are the bodies?</v>

217
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:03.030
That's all he says, oh no, no. I heard the bodies.

218
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:05.760
I hear you describe what the disease was.

219
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.790
A guy just woke up from a coma and then like, he must've gone. Oh my God,

220
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.720
the NBA canceled. There's nobody at the UFC. This is insane. Flew from Austin.

221
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.580
The guy would think like, what is it?

222
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:17.370
A thousand times more powerful than the flu, right? And then you would say,

223
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.840
well, it's not even quite the flu is so far this year, the flu is kicking its.

224
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.180
Cause 20,000 people in the U S have died so far since January 1st.

225
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:27.420
But.

226
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.480
<v 0>The thing is so far relatively new.</v>

227
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.820
<v 2>Thinking. It's going to, I know they don't know.</v>

228
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.761
<v 3>My, my,</v>

229
00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:37.710
my thing is maybe that we're trying to be the scientists and CDC might be

230
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:38.280
saying,

231
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.260
let's stop a peak in cases that overwhelm hospitals in our

232
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:46.380
infrastructure, because we don't have the infrastructure yet to deal with this.

233
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.630
This might be a very good dry run for us.

234
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.680
When we really do face a major virus that that's, you know, really a killer,

235
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.590
well, a wake up.

236
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:57.490
<v 0>Call to people that are living their lives. Like, like this can't happen.</v>

237
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.563
What about the, I'm.

238
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.220
<v 2>One of those right now.</v>

239
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.700
<v 0>They're like, finally, the world comes to my level.</v>

240
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.930
<v 2>Come on down now. Right now it's,</v>

241
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.860
it's hard to buy hand sanitizer and no one wants to shake hands. Yeah.

242
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.790
So we're like cleaner than we've ever been as, as a society.

243
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:22.000
But then homeless are the dirtiest ever of whether

244
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.320
they're finding you in history.

245
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.230
[inaudible].

246
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.063
<v 0>Right.</v>

247
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:29.270
<v 2>And.</v>

248
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.270
<v 0>We don't want to be rude. No one says.</v>

249
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.423
<v 2>No one is</v>

250
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.470
[inaudible] everyone's wearing a face mask. Nobody's shaking hands anymore.

251
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.030
There's going to be a time when we say, dude,

252
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.270
remember when people used to shake cats. Why did you have any? When I was a kid,

253
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.390
I remember that kids would, should really do to touch hand.

254
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:51.371
<v 0>We all,</v>

255
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:54.460
we all have to recognize when it comes to the homeless or anything like that.

256
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:58.480
It's like, you're not responsible for other people's actions. Now,

257
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.170
some people might have done things to get them to that position that were

258
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:06.400
foolish or they got addicted to drugs or their life fell apart. All these,

259
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.050
all these things could be contributors, right?

260
00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:09.460
But you're not responsible for them.

261
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:14.620
And to pretend that we are and that we should just leave them.

262
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:16.650
There is ridiculous. Like it, like if,

263
00:13:16.651 --> 00:13:20.620
if someone was just littering where they are and just throwing in the street and

264
00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:23.950
throwing needles in the street, you'd arrest them. But you don't arrest them.

265
00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:27.220
And they're setting up camps under these bridges. Like this is nonsense.

266
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.030
You got to figure this out. And either you got to either find them some way,

267
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.750
some form of cheap housing for people,

268
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.550
which is what they're trying to do. Medical health services, medical change,

269
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.180
whatever the budget is for other things, it's gotta to be shifted to that.

270
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.940
Right? Like that's a real problem.

271
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:45.970
<v 2>I think, I think there's,</v>

272
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.480
there should be someone out there interviewing as many as pot Lama. Crazy.

273
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.360
Maybe they have a story,

274
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.270
but nobody will listen to them because they're crazy and homeless.

275
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.380
But maybe like, why are these people on the street all of a sudden,

276
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.010
like what the.
