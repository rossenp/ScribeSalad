00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.100
<v 1>You know, that was an issue. Apparently when Reagan, when Reagan was in office,</v>

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.000
they lower the standard of what's cuckoo for cocoa puffs and they just let a

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.810
bunch of dudes just wander through that actually wasn't it was a little bit more

5
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:17.480
complicated than that. It was, it was at the state,

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.370
the state doesn't have a right to keep you against your will if you don't want

7
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:24.030
to be. Right. So, so there had to be very specific criteria for that. So,

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.680
you know, this whole thing with gun control,

9
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:28.710
like we need to help mental health issue. Well there's,

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.170
if you talk to the psychiatrist, I'll be like, look, dude,

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.480
the criteria for getting to fur con saying, saying,

12
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.400
and getting somebody essentially classified as a danger to society.

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.260
And, uh, like a real threat is very steep. It's hard to do.

14
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.170
You, you, you can't do that because somebody talks to themselves,

15
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:50.940
you can't do it because they're hearing voices. Well,

16
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:55.170
the FDA doesn't like to visit that kid two years ago, right. Um,

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.370
the kid who shot up the school in Florida and they decided he wasn't a threat,

18
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.030
but he might not have been a threat two years ago. When people saying, oh,

19
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:05.580
you know, they visited them two years ago. They're incompetent. No,

20
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:06.810
he might be a different person.

21
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:09.600
Now you have to realize that like people get way worse.

22
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.810
Like we've all known people that we knew at one point in time in the life,

23
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.510
then you don't see him for six years. And then you see him. You're like, whoa,

24
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.070
well that's cause people evolve.

25
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.550
And sometimes they evolve and sometimes they don't. Sometimes they recede.

26
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:24.210
Sometimes it gets ugly. So they didn't. You go crazy. Weren't you talking about?

27
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:28.720
How, because 20% of boys in this country are, are,

28
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.840
are, are, uh, diagnosed with ADHD 20% diagnosed. If, of course,

29
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:35.940
because you have a doctor who spent 10 minutes with you,

30
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.560
who's not an expert on ADHD.

31
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.550
It could be a thousand other things I could just be. Y it was on Rhonda,

32
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:43.260
Patrick posted up to study.

33
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.390
And then a D H D was something that was not the one that was

34
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.490
created. See if Google this too. Sorry.

35
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.980
ADHD was the one that was created by the advertising agency. What a surprise.

36
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.590
There's been several conditions that were literally invented

37
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.220
by advertising agencies in order to promote a cure.

38
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.050
So it's a attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Yeah.

39
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.340
Look, I don't know how much of that is a real disease and maybe,

40
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:18.150
maybe some of it is maybe I'm not, I'm obviously not an expert.

41
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.330
Maybe some of it is a kid whose brain works different. Right?

42
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.400
Let me tell you something, man, my dog might have ADHD or whatever the it is.

43
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.950
I go to see him and he goes crazy. He's he's out of his mind.

44
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.160
Cause he thinks we're going run and he's running around in circles.

45
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:34.950
He's hopping up and down. He bolts back and forth into the backyard.

46
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.930
He's like a maniac. Like I can't control him.

47
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.660
You know what the solution for that is I take him running.

48
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.700
I don't lock them in a room and then drug them, you know?

49
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.410
So when you're dealing with little kids and when I was really focused, you know,

50
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.270
it wasn't focused algebra. You know what? I was really focused.

51
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:50.550
If somebody started talking about fighting and how to throw a right hand,

52
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.320
I think about what I'm saying with my dog. I mean,

53
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:55.650
there's really something to that. Like that dog wanted to go run.

54
00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:57.720
And if I forced him to sit into a room,

55
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.400
he would go crazy to bark and he wouldn't want to do that.

56
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.540
That's how kids are exactly. It's the same thing. There it is.

57
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.780
That's hugging of the American boy, but what was the tweet? Jamie?

58
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.630
Is this an Esquire article? What did it, what did the tweet say?

59
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.410
One in five boys will be diagnosed with ADHD.

60
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:18.640
By the time they make it to high school to date only one significant study has

61
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:23.620
looked at ADHD, misdiagnosis and found 20 to 25% of boys were

62
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:24.790
misdiagnosed.

63
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.900
And this was before ADHD was a co as common as it is now.

64
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.370
So they're saying it's a real issue.

65
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.980
I know quite a few people that are drugging their kids.

66
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.970
This is my next door neighbor. They put their kid on Ritalin.

67
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.670
There was nothing wrong with this kid. I talked to that kid all the times.

68
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.810
It just takes too much energy that you just had too much energy and they didn't

69
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:45.910
want to deal with it. And they weren't paying attention to them.

70
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.240
They worked all day and then the kids bouncing off the walls and nobody wants to

71
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:52.090
take care of the kid. And so they put him on Ritalin offer, dude,

72
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:55.030
it's happening everywhere. It's happening, bad side effects.

73
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:59.800
Some of these drugs look at this 6.4 million children between the ages of

74
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:04.210
four and 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD by high school.

75
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:08.530
Nearly 20% of all boys will have been diagnosed with ADHD.

76
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.060
A 37%, 37% increase since 2003. My son,

77
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.510
my son is a classic example of a kid who doesn't like to sit still.

78
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:19.450
And rough houses. Google is an origin of ADHD.

79
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.960
See if a schools have no time for horse, they have no time for boy energy.

80
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.230
No you're near you're. You're condemned because it's aggressive.

81
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:28.030
And my son's way to not be a boy.

82
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.390
He's being told that his hands are hot lava and he can't use his hands.

83
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.290
That's healthy. Oh my God. What kind of liberal school are you taking?

84
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.100
Public school. Public. That's what happens? That's awful.

85
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.620
This is what we're dealing with. Yeah. Uh,

86
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.940
1900 ADHD was first mentioned in 1902 British pediatric pediatrician.

87
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:47.290
So it must be a wrong one.

88
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.280
A different one described an abnormal defect of moral control in children.

89
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.730
He found that some effected children could not control behavior the way a

90
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.220
typical child would, but they were still intelligent.

91
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:00.700
Maybe it was restless leg syndrome. Didn't you tell him?

92
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.810
I feel like that one might have been, but I don't know who was the, oh, sorry.

93
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.510
Sorry. Who was the guest? Do you remember the guest?

94
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.530
It was a woman who was telling us all about this. Some medical expert.

95
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.720
Was it Kelly Brogan? It might've been, might've been Kelly Brogan.

96
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.280
Dr. Kelly Brogan. W well,

97
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:22.390
didn't you say weren't aren't there studies about school shooters and a lot of

98
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:25.960
them were on SSRI since yes. Mass shooters,

99
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.090
not just school shooters, but like even this Vegas guy,

100
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.350
the Vegas guy was on anti-anxiety medication. Wow. Yeah. That stuff.

101
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.560
And that's also, Chris Cornell was on anti-anxiety medication.

102
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.940
There is a lot of people who are on psych drugs who lose their

103
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.890
minds because psych drugs are not universal. Right? Like there's no thing, like,

104
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.510
here's a perfect example. Say if you have a,

105
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:56.770
there's a solution that makes alcohol

106
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.300
91 octane. Right.

107
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.220
And you add something to that and you can add some additives and it'll spike it

108
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:08.930
up and you could try to find the right mixture, but that's just gasoline.

109
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.270
Right? You throwing things in there and try to mix it up.

110
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.190
You don't know exactly what the right thing is.

111
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.010
That's how they're doing your brain. Correct.

112
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.190
When they're shifting these things, that's why they say, try this one.

113
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.300
There's not like, okay, you have one cup of flour.

114
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.040
You need two eggs and one tablespoon of sugar. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

115
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.670
There's no specific recipe. And what the does feel good?

116
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:34.370
Mean th the other thing that they're not taking into account is that, you know,

117
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:37.520
you might be depressed for a good reason. In other words,

118
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:42.440
if you made me do a job, I hated, and I wasn't allowed to work out,

119
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:44.960
or I didn't know how to eat or a thousand things that make me feel good.

120
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.680
Cause I have to self-regulate I'm 51. And I gotta, I got,

121
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.820
I still have to self-regulate because otherwise, um, you know, I'll go crazy.

122
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.750
If I don't have, if I didn't know how to do those things,

123
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.860
I would probably be depressed. Now. Now you're going to give me drugs. Well,

124
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.920
that's not going to help me. Well, here's what it is. What I'm doing.

125
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.020
My behavior is what it is for sure.

126
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.650
But here's where I think you got to recognize that that kid, your son,

127
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.180
who has that energy, that's a gift.

128
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.150
And what you're doing is you're making him squander that gift by sitting them

129
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:16.130
down in a charity, wants to go crazy.

130
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.000
That kid is supposed to be like my dog running around all day. Okay.

131
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:24.440
My dog is a year old at seven. He's a seven year old dog, basically, you know,

132
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:27.800
in dog years. And he's like a seven year old kid he's running around.

133
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:32.180
He's going crazy. You know? But that's because he wants to run. Exactly.

134
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:36.740
But once he runs, he's fine dogs. The best. Yes. And your kid will be too.

135
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:37.250
If you,

136
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.810
if your kid was involved in something where they emphasized physical movement

137
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.700
and then taught things in between workouts taught things in between, you know,

138
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:50.450
they play a game outside, play a little Dodge ball, play a little soccer,

139
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.030
play a little basketball. Then after wear yourself out a little, come sit down,

140
00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:57.050
we're going to teach about math. So teach them about math. And then, you know,

141
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:59.570
you're going to show them, this is leverage. We're all gonna pick things up.

142
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.080
Do you think I pick it up? Like, or like, let them now pick it up with leverage.

143
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.220
Oh, you see, you understand, you could teach kids in a very physical way.

144
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.810
Instead of forcing them to sit down who the wants to sit that hard chair,

145
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:15.860
we feel other people's gum on the top of your leg. You know, it sucks. Yeah.

146
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.150
It sucks. You're sitting there waiting for the class to be over stuck.

147
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.910
Their energy's out. Let him around.

148
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.630
Did I ever tell you that my acting teacher who looked at me a lot of times the

149
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:29.840
greatest and he goes, uh, I'd done a scene. And he goes,

150
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:32.540
you know what we got to with, you got a little self-esteem problem.

151
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.400
You think of yourself as a second banana. And I was like, what? He goes, yeah,

152
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:41.150
you got to start believing in yourself more. He goes,

153
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.400
you got to start thinking of yourself as a first banana. Did he say this?

154
00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:46.400
When he was in his underwear? He did. He was, I was wearing, I was wearing,

155
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.920
I was wearing a black place on it. He was put these black lights on these on,

156
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.030
there you go. I'm going to Pierce her nipples and all this. What's that? Why,

157
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.790
why do you smell like cologne with leopard seal? This is weird.

158
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.050
So he says that to me. And I'm a young actor and I'm up of her. And I'm like,

159
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.720
I got to get better. I got to get higher. Self-esteem.

160
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.860
So I say to my buddies kind of Cooper guys, one of my buddies, older and wiser,

161
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:11.860
and I said, um, said, man, I, I was told I have low self esteem, you know?

162
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.560
And I heard a voice in the back, over there goes, thank God.

163
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.790
And I go, huh? And they go,

164
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.700
you really think you'd be this funny if you liked yourself, bro.

165
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.300
And you think you'd be a actor. If you liked yourself, go yourself.

166
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:30.540
That guy's an. Keep hating yourself. It's the best part of you.

167
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.310
And I was holiday card tanks, mom. I know. I was like, you're right. I liked it.

168
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.421
The whole point.

169
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:40.170
The whole thing that drives me is the fact that I've never been satisfied with

170
00:09:40.171 --> 00:09:42.510
myself. And I'm never going to lose that. I, if I,

171
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.110
if you make me really happy with myself, I'm not so sure it's a good thing.
