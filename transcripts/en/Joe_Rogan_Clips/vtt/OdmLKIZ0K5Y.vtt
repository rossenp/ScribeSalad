00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.120
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How do you decide what you're going to ask people?</v>

2
00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:07.890
You just go on with the flow, do research and stuff. Cause I, I,

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.340
I really loved some of the questions you asked Kanye,

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.140
trying to remember what they were, but I mean,

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.040
do you sort of plan in advance or are you kinda just sorta up.

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.790
<v 1>Because, well, with Kanye, we had talked about doing a podcast for a long time,</v>

7
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.670
but I was worried that he was going to come off.

8
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.940
<v 0>I remember your first question was, why do you want to do this? Right.</v>

9
00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:28.780
I just was when he was running for president, that was such a great question.

10
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.990
Cause it's like, you know, why do you want to run for president?

11
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.000
But everybody would ask that question, but it was just,

12
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.680
it was just right into it. It was just great. You know.

13
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.730
<v 1>A fan of his music, I've always been a fan of his music. And I think that the,</v>

14
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.800
the way he communicates his sort of manic style of thinking

15
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:50.030
and constantly creating and doing things, it's why he's so successful. I mean,

16
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:50.391
that's the,

17
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:54.230
there's this like stream of consciousness that he has is also why he's so

18
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:58.790
prolific as an artist. Like, I mean, he is, all of his albums are good.

19
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:00.230
He doesn't have a dud. You know,

20
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:04.460
you go from one album to the next and they're all like he's got this

21
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.540
dream of creative ideas that are constantly running through his head.

22
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.320
And he talks sometimes in these streams where they don't end,

23
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:14.180
he goes from one subject to the next subject.

24
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.130
And so I was curious as to like how I was gonna talk to him.

25
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.050
And I wanted to make sure that we can do it in a way where other people are

26
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:28.220
going to appreciate there's a great value and the way he thinks.

27
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.930
And then if you get it in sound bites or you get it in some weird thing where he

28
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:35.030
says something and people get mad at him and they blew him or something like

29
00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:39.710
that, like you're missing who he really is, who he really is,

30
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:40.940
is him all day.

31
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.270
It's not him in this 32nd chunk where you don't like what he said, guess what?

32
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.540
He probably doesn't like what he said either. Okay, he's streaming.

33
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.810
He's just going, he's running with these thoughts and ideas,

34
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.730
but that's also why he can boil those thoughts and ideas down these amazing

35
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.580
songs. You know, like this is,

36
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.010
that's what I wanted to get out of him while we were talking because when people

37
00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:08.690
were trying to medicate him and people were trying to, and I'm like, I, I don't,

38
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.000
if you have a choice between this medicated, overweight,

39
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.650
Kanye who doesn't get anything done or manic crazy, Kanye says wild.

40
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.220
You want manic? Crazy. Kanye is manic. Crazy.

41
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:25.100
Kanye is the one who makes amazing music and I've been around him.

42
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.060
He's a nice guy, man. He's a really genuinely nice guy.

43
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.830
And when the cameras are off, same things,

44
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.940
nice guy with all the staff and everybody he's cool. Like he's genuinely cool,

45
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:39.800
but whatever you want to call mental illness, that's the problem.

46
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.200
It's like when you call it mental illness, well, we'll,

47
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:44.600
you got to give it medicine. He's got mental illness.

48
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.670
You've got to give him medicine. Do you really?

49
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.780
Because that mental illness is making some pretty amazing, right? Like,

50
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.470
look at us, look at his catalog. Look at all the music he's made.

51
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.630
That's all because of mental illness. No,

52
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.600
that whatever you call an illness is a particular style of thinking that he has.

53
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.280
That's sort of non-linear and it's, it's wild and it's all over the place.

54
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.360
But it's also very funny.

55
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.050
<v 0>I've found in that interview though, that, you know,</v>

56
00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:11.820
I've seen him interviewed quite a bit, but that was,

57
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.060
that was one where everything you said made a lot of sense.

58
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.470
He's certainly done a lot of

59
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.730
put a lot of thought into a lot of the stuff he was talking about with

60
00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:24.220
everything from, you know, reorganizing the way civilization works. I mean,

61
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:25.420
I just, I, it takes a little bit of,

62
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.740
it takes a little bit of thinking to come up with how to reorganize the entire

63
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.240
way civilization works.

64
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.410
<v 1>But that was one of the things that I thought was really good about the</v>

65
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.270
interviews. You do get a chance to see, like,

66
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.830
this is not just a crazy person who buys his own. And by the way,

67
00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:45.150
when he's like the braggy stuff that he kind of does talks to himself,

68
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.670
first of all, he's being honest about where he is.

69
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:51.720
He's sort of reaffirming who he is, but also he jokes around,

70
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.330
like he was joking around about it outside.

71
00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:58.860
He was showing us this video that he had made for his wife for his wife's

72
00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:01.890
birthday. And it was really emotional. It was very beautiful because he,

73
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.440
he made a, uh,

74
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.360
a hologram of her dad and he wrote the script for all

75
00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:10.860
this. Oh yeah.

76
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.040
And he wrote the script for all the things that the hall ground was telling her.

77
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:15.900
It's, it's really intense. And you know,

78
00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:20.820
you can do that now like that they can take your voice and for you and I,

79
00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:23.580
it would be easy for them to do because there's hours and hours and hours of us

80
00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:26.790
talking. So they would take this voice. God, imagine what they could do.

81
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.800
They already have theirs they've they used me as an example for one

82
00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:33.120
of these companies in Canada,

83
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.370
they used me as an example for how well this deep fake technology works because

84
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.710
there's 1500 plus podcasts in me that are three hours

85
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:44.940
long. So he'd take these,

86
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.040
these sounds that come out of my mouth and then you can make me say anything,

87
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.480
literally anything, cause every noise that I'm capable of making I've made.

88
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.110
Right?

89
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.790
So you use this catalog of sounds that my voice can make.

90
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.940
And that's what he also did without hologram. Yeah. Because you know,

91
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:03.870
Robert Kardashian,

92
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:07.470
there's all the cases and all the different times he's been interviewed on

93
00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:07.950
television.

94
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.900
There's a great catalog of his voice and you can have him speak to her.

95
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.850
Yeah. But even in then, like he has him say that, uh,

96
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.100
you know, in your genius genius husband,

97
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.910
but he was laughing when he said it and showed it to us. He was laughing.

98
00:05:23.911 --> 00:05:25.920
He thought it was funny that he, he had them,

99
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.170
he had Robert Kardashians call him a genius, amazing genius husband.

100
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.930
He thought it was funny. Like, he's not just, it's not just ego.

101
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:40.140
It's not just crazy. It's also there's brilliance there.

102
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.080
He's a complicated person. It's nice to hear.

103
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.170
<v 0>That because like, you know, it's interesting. I don't,</v>

104
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.740
you know how the media can sort of reframe.

105
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.070
<v 2>A person, right. And takeaway nuance. Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.180
<v 1>People are nuanced. Man. People are really complicated. You decide,</v>

107
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.920
decide that a person is this person because of one sentence,

108
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:04.910
they said one time or because of one thing that they did where they maybe wish

109
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.090
they didn't or because of one concert they did where people booed them or what,

110
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.890
whatever you pick about Kanye that people decide he's this.

111
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.480
People just love to put someone in a box and categorize them and just decide

112
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:18.980
that they want to dismiss them.

113
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.580
<v 3>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

114
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.730
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

115
00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:30.160
they're going to be available everywhere. But after December 1st,

116
00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:33.880
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

117
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.870
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

118
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.700
That's all we're asking you just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye

119
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.690
okay.
