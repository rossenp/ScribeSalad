00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So let's, let's go to that then. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,</v>

2
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:05.274
since this is

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.280
the United States has a very strange situation with native Americans where

4
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:13.680
native Americans have reservations and on those reservations,

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.000
they have sovereignty. They can, they have different rules,

6
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.440
they can do what they want. It's very strange.

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.870
It's like there's nations inside of our nation. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

8
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.763
how do you feel about that?

9
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.830
<v 1>Uh, so it's a system that's been imposed by.</v>

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.590
Maybe the best way to start is kind of start with the beginning. Okay.

11
00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:40.110
Like how did, how did, how did we get to where we are today there? Uh,

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.900
and there's a lot of information. Yeah.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.180
And so you gotta stop me if I start getting too carried away. All right.

14
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.860
No worry. We.

15
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.660
<v 0>Have plenty of time. Okay. And a lot of interest. Okay. So don't.</v>

16
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.360
<v 1>Worry about that.</v>

17
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.660
So there are three Supreme court cases that happened in the 18 hundreds,

18
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.140
and there was a justice named John Marshall,

19
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.090
who was actually buying Indian land from, from us,

20
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.170
the us government through us grants. And so he was interested,

21
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.690
he was an interested party, uh, but he was making decisions that, um,

22
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.690
that set forward the kind of watershed principles that continue

23
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.650
effect who, uh, native Americans and Indian nation governments are.

24
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.480
And so those three cases, the first one was called Johnson V Macintosh.

25
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.480
And it was in 1823 and it didn't involve any Indians.

26
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.720
It was a non-Indians coming to court to try to determine who owned a piece of

27
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:39.120
land in Indiana. And, um,

28
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:44.070
there was one guy Johnson who was a plaintiff who had purchased the land

29
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.950
directly from the pian Shaw Indians, who are related to the Miami tribe today.

30
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.820
And, uh,

31
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.670
then the defendant was Macintosh and he purchased land from the us

32
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:59.990
government. And so the case of course, was who had the proper rights.

33
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.020
And through that case, uh, through, uh,

34
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.220
the narrative that John that justice Marshall created,

35
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.500
uh, he, uh, brought forward, uh,

36
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.260
an a piece of international law that affects us today.

37
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:19.460
And that's the doctrine of discovery.

38
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.610
Have you ever heard of the doctrine of discovery? So that's that's

39
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.410
any Christian civilized, European nation has a right to conquer,

40
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.490
uh, indigenous hen peoples.

41
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.010
So this was the principle that this case was based on,

42
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.280
and it's set forward this weird, uh, relationship,

43
00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:50.240
the tribes and the us government have today. Um, so if the us,

44
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.160
if the Christian European peoples had the rights to,

45
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.040
um, take land away from tribes, because they were an inferior race,

46
00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:04.240
which is this, this is language from the case, their inferior race,

47
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.320
they're savages, they're unable to govern themselves. Um,

48
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.040
and they only have a right of occupancy.

49
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.000
So that was the first of three cases that justice Marshall decided.

50
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.190
And of course he was an interest party in the whole thing because he had

51
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:24.390
purchased land from the United States and he wanted to make sure his land was

52
00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:27.990
secure. Um, the second case was Cherokee nation B, Georgia.

53
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.230
And this was the time during the Indian removal act that Andrew Jackson had

54
00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:37.790
gotten through Congress to remove the Eastern Indians west of the Mississippi

55
00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:42.500
river into Indian T, which is of course now Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas area.

56
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.980
And, um, and again,

57
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.020
this was a case that actually, uh,

58
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:54.660
the Cherokee nation tried to bring before the Supreme court and before

59
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.260
the Supreme court could even make a decision, um, on,

60
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.570
and I just realized, I didn't even tell you the facts of the case. So, um, uh,

61
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.970
there was I'm, I'm getting ahead of myself. I apologize. No worries. Um,

62
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:12.330
this is, this is, uh, incredible experience to be here.

63
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.570
So I'm a little bit nervous. Um,

64
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.560
so in Cherokee nation versus Georgia, um, uh,

65
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.160
Georgia was trying to assert its, um,

66
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.200
laws over the Cherokee nation.

67
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.280
And so the Cherokee nation brought this case before the Supreme court to say,

68
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.680
you know, the, the, this,

69
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.680
the state does not have any right to assert any of its laws against us.

70
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.790
And what justice Marshall has has said, well,

71
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.830
you're not a foreign nation, so you can't bring a case before the Supreme court,

72
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.590
um, and determine that tribes were a pseudo sovereign nation,

73
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.030
that they were still under, uh, Tudo lids. And, uh,

74
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.340
they needed to be civilized, uh, again, the same kind of inferior,

75
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.140
uh, uh, Savage language in this case. Um, and,

76
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.420
um, held that the federal government had plenary power over, um,

77
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.500
uh, tribal affairs. Um,

78
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.060
and that the Cherokee nation couldn't bring this case to court.

79
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.690
What ended up happening is some missionaries who were serving the Cherokee

80
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.610
nation actually, um, developed a case and, um,

81
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.250
violated Georgia laws. Um,

82
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.810
so they could bring a case before the Supreme court.

83
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.850
And that case was called Wooster V Georgia.

84
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.280
And I think that was about 18 32, 18 31.

85
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.600
And in that case, um,

86
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.040
it was ruled that the United States, uh,

87
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.680
had a guardian and ward type relationship with tribes.

88
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.840
And so we were the wards, uh,

89
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.600
they were our guardian and that set up this weird dynamic

90
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.600
that still exists today,

91
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.560
the Supreme courts and other case other courts site,

92
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.800
um, in,

93
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.910
in decisions today to basic take away more and more rights.

94
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.930
So,

95
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.830
so that was that's the watershed basis for this weird relationship that we

96
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:26.790
have. And it's based on racism,

97
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.470
it's based on tribes being an inferior people's they not be

98
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.390
civilized. And, and so here we are, so help,

99
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.020
help direct me into another in here. Well, that's a.

100
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.853
<v 0>Fascinating thing.</v>

101
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.660
The idea that the United States government is they they're like the big

102
00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:45.460
daddy yeah. To look over the tribes.

103
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.580
And the only way the tribes can exist is if they exist the European.

104
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.420
<v 1>Way. Right. The great white father. Yeah. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

105
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.300
<v 0>And so all this was happening, uh,</v>

106
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.260
while they were trying to conquer the west.

107
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.490
So all this was happening around the gold rush time.

108
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.130
<v 1>Uh, this was happening before then. So this was happening in the 18,</v>

109
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.770
when was rush, the gold rush was 1850s. Okay.

110
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.610
18 49, 18. So this was a little bit before.

111
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.250
<v 0>That. And then they were, they're trying to,</v>

112
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.250
they basically trying to take over land, right?

113
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.880
<v 1>Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. So Georgia wanted that land for themselves.</v>

114
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.400
They wanted to remove the Cherokee and of course the other, um,

115
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.080
quote unquote civilized tribes that were in the Southeast at that time.

116
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.320
And that's, what's so interesting is because you see throughout time, um,

117
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.480
and this is a, this is a little bit why I have a problem with, um, uh,

118
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.550
some of the books that you've read is because they've taken, uh,

119
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.110
small pictures of what was going on and kind of removed the

120
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:50.070
context of what was really happening.

121
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:53.990
There were so many tribes across the United States that

122
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.390
tried everything to resist or,

123
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.180
or assimilate so that they could maintain their way of life,

124
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.420
maintain their lands and, um, continue to prosper as they had been.

125
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.340
Um, but the United States was, um, obviously for a formidable opponent.

126
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.820
And regardless of, of, of for example,

127
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.690
the five ice tribes and their, their,

128
00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:26.370
their tactic was to assimilate was to go to school and

129
00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:30.570
educate themselves and learn English. And even though they did that,

130
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.090
and they did everything that the United States wanted them to do,

131
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.090
they were forced off their land, um, to the west, uh, into Indian territory,

132
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.400
the she, who, who you've learned about through, uh,

133
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.640
the book they, that those events happened during a point in time.

134
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.480
And that was their effort at resistance. They saw how disease wiped out,

135
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.480
um, their brethren from other nations. They knew that, uh,

136
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.120
folks were coming to get them. And so that was their way of resisting,

137
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.160
um, uh, being assimilated and having everything taken away from them.

138
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.760
<v 0>And the defense of the authors of those books, they did cover a lot of that.</v>

139
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:17.030
These books are in no way, uh, taking the side of the United States government,

140
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.910
you know, most of, I mean,

141
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.710
the most amazing thing about empire the summer moon was just

142
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.163
how special,

143
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.870
the relationship that the command she's had to the land mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

144
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.870
And about how, when, um,

145
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.340
Jeff scan parkers is that no, Cynthia, the Anne Parker who's, uh,

146
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.340
she's the photo out there, right. Of the woman that's breastfeeding her child.

147
00:09:39.341 --> 00:09:39.661
Right.

148
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:43.500
She was kidnapped when she was nine and assimilated with the command shes and

149
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:46.620
then was re kidnapped by the United go United States government when she was in

150
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:49.540
her thirties mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and didn't want go back. Right.

151
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.060
She missed the command,

152
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:56.050
she life and through her and through her and

153
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.810
her descriptions of the way they lived and the understanding of it,

154
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.850
they got a better sense of like what she missed about that life and that mm-hmm

155
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.850
&lt;affirmative&gt; they had an incredible relationship with the land.

156
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.850
They lived basically just in tepes. They were very nomadic.

157
00:10:09.851 --> 00:10:12.050
They just followed around the Buffalo mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they had,

158
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.970
you know, in, in her way of looking at it,

159
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.200
almost a magical in comparison to this

160
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.520
really boring life that these settlers had. And when,

161
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.760
you know, she looked at it,

162
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.160
it was interesting because she was a girl who was born, um,

163
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.760
you know, a, how would you describe it? A white settler.

164
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.950
And then from the age of nine on lived as a Manche.

165
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.270
So she had like, sort of a view of both worlds mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and,

166
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.070
you know, she very much took the side of the Manches and she wanted to go back,

167
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.510
like she had spoken command sheet in the book.

168
00:10:50.511 --> 00:10:55.270
There's an encounter where they bring in someone who was a Manche

169
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.180
to speak to her and grabs him. She's like, take me back. We're gonna leave.

170
00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:01.580
Let's get outta here now. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like her thought was like,

171
00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:05.260
we gotta get outta here. Like this way of life is. Like,

172
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.860
I want to go back to the command chiefs.

173
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.020
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; she just didn't understand that that way of life was slowly

174
00:11:11.021 --> 00:11:13.380
going away. And her son qu Parker,

175
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.610
who is that photograph over there, that's on bullets, said somebody made for me,

176
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.010
I don't even know where that came from. Somebody sent me that,

177
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.530
but that he was the last command chief. Uh, and they, by the,

178
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.170
during her lifetime and her son's lifetime was the last of it.

179
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.170
And it's a very sad story. And it's, but you know.

180
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.330
<v 1>The Manchi still lived today, right?</v>

181
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.520
<v 0>Sure. In Oklahoma. Right. There's quite a few of them.</v>

182
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.720
I've actually been in contact with some of those guys. Oh, that's awesome. Yes,

183
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:46.400
it's very cool. Um, but they do, but they don't live the way they did. Right.

184
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.360
I mean, their way of life was removed. I mean, they were wiped out.
