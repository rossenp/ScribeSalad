00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.970
<v 0>Mr. Boghossian welcome back. Good to see you again, sir, to be here.</v>

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.690
Thank Mr. Lindsay. Good to James or Jim, depending upon preferences.

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.570
That's right. Go with Jim. Uh, Jeff, first of all, gentlemen,

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.230
and th there was one other person that you did this with this whole project,

5
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:13.590
Helen.

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.860
<v 1>Pluck rose from England. Uh, shout out to Helen from England.</v>

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.620
<v 0>She back across the pond. She's across the pond to fish and chips and she's.</v>

8
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.170
<v 1>Making tea and managerial magazine.</v>

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.380
<v 0>That's right. Excellent. All right. Well, shout out to her as well. Um,</v>

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.820
let's explain what you guys did and what's so significant about it because,

11
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.490
uh, when I first read it, my first inclination that I,

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.760
I had two reactions, one was a huge laugh.

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.860
I laughed really hard. And then I said, thank God, so many exposed this.

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.900
Yup. So tell me, tell me what you guys did, Jim go for it. Yeah.

15
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.750
So let's explain who you guys are, what you do. Okay.

16
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.560
<v 2>Um, my background is in mathematics. I bailed out in academia in 2010 though,</v>

17
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:04.970
because I kind of see the writing on the wall. And, uh,

18
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.470
so now I am a Renegade gender scholar, and I write nonsense about genitals.

19
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.710
That's primarily what I do. I mean, I manage a business at home,

20
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.570
so I got to academia.

21
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.510
<v 1>Yeah. And I'm, uh, uh, teach philosophy at Portland state university. And, uh,</v>

22
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.400
I met Jim years ago.

23
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:25.670
We collaborated and we've written a number of things over the years.

24
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:30.410
And at some point it just came to be, we had to do something about this.

25
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:34.340
It was just too ridiculous. And it was translating into the real world.

26
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:37.820
And so we collaborated and here we are.

27
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.840
<v 0>Well, let's explain what you did and what was ridiculous. Um,</v>

28
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.340
what we're talking about,

29
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.230
what was ridiculous is there's many fields of

30
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:49.940
studies, um,

31
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.080
that you can get legitimate degrees in that are absolutely preposterous. Right?

32
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.990
Literally filled with nonsense,

33
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.430
taught by nonsense people who live in these nonsense bubbles. Right.

34
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.110
And then they give these degrees and these people go out in the real world and

35
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.550
they infect things. They in their ridiculousness, in fact,

36
00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:13.830
certain particularly tech industry businesses. Like you,

37
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:17.330
you see it in the morning, James. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

38
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.620
it's explained what you guys did.

39
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.880
<v 2>Yeah. So we started about a year, I guess, a year and a half ago.</v>

40
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:23.720
Now it was last summer.

41
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.190
We started writing a bunch of academic papers for the journals that represent

42
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:29.024
these fields.

43
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.970
And so everybody understands what an academic paper is getting out of the gate.

44
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:35.810
This isn't like an op ed that you dash off for like Washington post or some

45
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:36.740
magazine or whatever.

46
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.990
This is a thing like academics work their careers to write

47
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.380
one or two of these a year. And so they're really hard to write.

48
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:47.240
They're supposed to be hard to get published.

49
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.400
So we were at 20 of them in 10 months

50
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.140
and, uh, seven of those got accepted. Four were actually published.

51
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.670
And um,

52
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.230
then we got at least four more know we got busted in at least four more we're on

53
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:04.540
track, maybe five or six more would have gotten in.

54
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.120
What's the difference between getting accepted and getting published.

55
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.730
So the process with everything in academia is really slow.

56
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.610
And a lot of people don't know this. So you send off this article,

57
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.120
the editor looks at it and the editor either gives it the thumbs up or the

58
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.510
thumbs down. If they give it the thumbs up, it goes off to peer reviewers.

59
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.220
And that process takes months often, as long as, I mean,

60
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:26.290
we had one paper that was eight months under peer review.

61
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.190
So the reviewers look at it. They try to figure out if the arguments are good,

62
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:32.320
they try to figure out if the research is good,

63
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.400
they evaluate that they give extensive comments, they send it back to you.

64
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.190
Then you have to revise it according to whatever they say,

65
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.970
make it better is what's supposed to happen. They made ours crazier.

66
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.680
And so then they did every single time we took the feedback.

67
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.710
<v 1>And made the papers just the most extreme, most extreme.</v>

68
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.590
<v 2>Things. And so then you send them back. So now you're probably three,</v>

69
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:56.310
four months in just the review process, not to the writing,

70
00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:57.630
which should also take months. Yeah.

71
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.920
And then the editor will either send it back to the reviewers to see if it was

72
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:05.730
good enough or they'll just evaluate it themselves depending on where it stands.

73
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.840
And then they'll make a decision as to whether or not to accept it or reject it

74
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.630
or ask for more revisions. And then when they accept it,

75
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.000
that means the journal is ready to publish it.

76
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.960
But then the publishing process requires all the type setting, proofing,

77
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.500
all the stuff that goes into making it professional for an academic journal.

78
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.850
And that can take months.

79
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.450
<v 1>And, and, and publishing is the coin of the realm. Like that's it.</v>

80
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.830
So the ideal is one paper every year in the humanities broadly.

81
00:04:31.831 --> 00:04:36.570
So if you that's how you credential yourself, that's how you get tenure,

82
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:40.500
which is a job for life. That's how you get to teach people, these ideas,

83
00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:43.320
who then, as you said, go out into the workforce, you know, five,

84
00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:47.490
six years later and infect everybody with total silliness.

85
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.490
So it's the gold standard peer review.

86
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.850
So we saw a tremendous problem.

87
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.880
<v 0>Can we tell people some of the titles of these charter,</v>

88
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.770
because right now they're like, what the hell is? This was hard.

89
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.170
<v 2>So we had a article,</v>

90
00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:05.310
the one that got the most press was about dog humping in Portland, Oregon. Um,

91
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.080
it was called how did it go as it called, um, performativity.

92
00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:12.600
And, uh, was it rape culture,

93
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.050
rape culture and performativity in dog parks in Portland, Oregon.

94
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.240
<v 1>We claim to have examined under a fake name is all fake names, performativity.</v>

95
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.780
Oh yeah, totally have their own lingo, their own, you know.

96
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.850
<v 0>But is that a word in the English language, performance.</v>

97
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.390
<v 2>Activity? I mean, in the academic English language, not in karma,</v>

98
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.910
common parlance, but that's like the whole thing. This is huge, right?

99
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:34.020
This goes back a long way.

100
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.100
That's Judith Butler's whole thing was that gender's uniformed Butler.

101
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.960
Judith Butler is probably the most influential feminist scholar or gender

102
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:47.520
scholar. Actually. I should say that that's been in maybe the last 30 years.

103
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.000
She's she's big time. And so she had this whole thing.

104
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:53.700
That gender is performative. It's something you perform.

105
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:54.660
It's not something that's anything.

106
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.430
<v 3>To do with your biology articles.</v>

107
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 0>Reactions to rape culture and performativity at urban dog parks in</v>

108
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:04.190
Portland, Oregon. Why is it retracted?

109
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.850
<v 3>Because it's because they realized bogus were hosing them.</v>

110
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.060
<v 0>We reactions to rape culture and performance.</v>

111
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.870
<v 1>Seemed to have closely examined the genitals of.</v>

112
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.390
<v 2>Just under 10,000, just under.</v>

113
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.440
<v 1>A 10,000 dogs.</v>

114
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.310
And then interrogated their owners as to their sexual orientation.

115
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.290
<v 2>I felt the dog's nuts and then said, excuse me, sir, are you gay? Yeah.</v>

116
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.110
<v 0>And you said, that's what I'm, if they gendered their dogs.</v>

117
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.670
<v 1>Well, made up these totally insane, you know, dogs,</v>

118
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.140
humping incidents and how they, they beat female dogs,

119
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:40.960
but they didn't beat male dogs. So that's one of the papers that we made,

120
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:41.920
you know, the other paper.

121
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.960
<v 2>That, well, this one also, they had the whole thing,</v>

122
00:06:43.961 --> 00:06:46.990
like if a male dog humps another male dog,

123
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.150
especially men would freak out and break it up,

124
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.240
stop that because that's the performativity part. Yeah.

125
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.970
But then if a male dog humped a female dog, they'd be like, you know,

126
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.610
get her girl, get her, get her, you know, get.

127
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.650
<v 0>On it. You're basically raging against hetero normativity.</v>

128
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.350
<v 1>Exactly. Correct. We told them exactly what they wanted to hear. Yeah.</v>

129
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.110
And we gave them bogus statistics to fuel what they already want.

130
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.911
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:13.270
We started off with the idea that what we wanted to get to was a conclusion.

132
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.340
And then we made up all the crap in between to get to it.

133
00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:19.720
And the conclusion was feminism should train men the way we train dogs so that

134
00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:20.980
we can get rid of rape, you know, put.

135
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.380
<v 1>Them on leashes, you know, it's right in the paper, it's all there.</v>

136
00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:25.390
Unfortunately, we cannot put men on Alicia.

137
00:07:25.391 --> 00:07:28.510
It's not politically feasible to put men on leashes. You guys wrote.

138
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.820
<v 3>That. Yeah. Yeah. If their leashes.</v>

139
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.150
<v 2>When they misbehave and this paper didn't just get published.</v>

140
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.990
The journal said that this was exemplary scholarship and gave it an award.

141
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.630
Oh my God. So it was one of the best pieces. This.

142
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.760
<v 3>Year is the 25th anniversary. So this journal.</v>

143
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.820
<v 2>Has been doing this for 25 years and it's their 25th anniversary.</v>

144
00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:56.200
So they're picking out the best papers out the whole year and putting them you

145
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.490
prior to place in some,

146
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.300
some issue of their journal and ours was going to be in the seventh issue was.

147
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:06.220
<v 0>Weighted. Number one is greater. It's not great. So it's, it either is greater.</v>

148
00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:08.410
It's not great. Like why they retracting.

149
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.350
<v 3>It. Oh yeah. Because they know we were bogus. So what.</v>

150
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:13.960
<v 4>You were right. Well.</v>

151
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.970
<v 0>It's like a broken clock. The clock's broken when it is actually 12 o'clock.</v>

152
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.090
<v 4>So, so they, they would claim it incorrectly.</v>

153
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.980
<v 1>That we fabricated statistics. But we,</v>

154
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.910
we wrote other papers called one was fat bodybuilding.

155
00:08:27.911 --> 00:08:32.080
So they claimed that there should be a category introduced in traditional body

156
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.580
building called fat bodybuilding,

157
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.210
where people come and display their fat before the audience.

158
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.810
And we didn't manufacture any statistics for that. And they loved that.

159
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:41.800
They thought it, you know,

160
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:44.950
one line in that paper was a fat body is a built body.

161
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.470
<v 4>Right. The reviewers, like.</v>

162
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.150
<v 3>I wholeheartedly agree.</v>

163
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.943
<v 4>That.</v>

164
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.290
<v 1>Yeah. And then we wrote other papers, like to high, we publish, uh, uh, uh,</v>

165
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.840
got accepted, not published, but that one, we claim that it's, uh,

166
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.370
it's unexpected. [inaudible].

167
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.810
<v 2>It's on, it's unethical to make fun of anything to do with social justice.</v>

168
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.380
Right.

169
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.740
And so if you want to make fun of things that don't have anything with social

170
00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:13.160
justice, that's good. So if we wanted to make fun of men, that's great.

171
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.900
If you want to make fun of white people, that's great.

172
00:09:14.901 --> 00:09:17.990
If you want to make fun of, uh, anything to do with social justice,

173
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.930
that's a problem. So we made, we said that, you know, south,

174
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.870
Park's a huge problem. The Simpsons is a huge problem.

175
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.700
We went into talking about how Stephen Colbert and John Stewart have the right

176
00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:32.170
idea. But then the journal was like, ah, but they're straight white males.

177
00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:33.140
So you have to, you know,

178
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.130
nuance around that to make it clear that their position is white men.

179
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.610
Even though they're on the side of social justice, it's not quite good enough,

180
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.473
you know?

181
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.050
<v 4>Oh. So they publish that. They post that they published,</v>

182
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.543
what was that one called?

183
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:51.200
<v 2>That one was called when the jokes on you. Yeah. And.</v>

184
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.270
<v 4>We made, we wrote it to that. They would think.</v>

185
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.180
<v 1>The joke is on us because we cited our own work in there. Right.</v>

186
00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.230
But the joke was actually on them for publishing it. Yeah, yeah.

187
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.670
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

188
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.870
Th this it's so it's so funny how racist you can be,

189
00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:07.820
as long as you're racist. Again, it's white people.

190
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.260
<v 2>That's what we saw is that as long as you are going up the river against</v>

191
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.050
privileged, then you can really just get away with some nasty.

192
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.920
<v 0>Stuff and you can generalize. Oh, totally gross.</v>

193
00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:23.360
Generalizations, not treat people as individuals. Absolutely.

194
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.770
It's very strange. It's very strange that this is the left. You know,

195
00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:32.090
I was a kid in San Francisco in the 1970s. Uh,

196
00:10:32.091 --> 00:10:33.980
we lived in, you know,

197
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.690
like there was the hippie times and that's, I,

198
00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:42.650
I lived there from age seven to 11 and it kind of formed a lot

199
00:10:42.651 --> 00:10:47.090
of my opinions about people like the, who gives a part of my, my,

200
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:51.590
my appreciation for any group, whatever it is,

201
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.270
whether it's race or gender or sexual orientation. And I just,

202
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.430
I don't understand it from either way.

203
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.070
I certainly don't understand it from a racist perspective,

204
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.730
but I really don't understand it from racism.

205
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.510
That's condoned because it's racism against white people. Oh yeah.

206
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.300
This is the left. This is that these are,

207
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.210
these are the people that are preaching against hate.

208
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.870
And these are the people that used to be the people that were supposedly.

209
00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:21.920
So open-minded, and so open to ideas.

210
00:11:21.921 --> 00:11:26.420
And now they're trying to stifle creativity and stifle dissent and

211
00:11:26.421 --> 00:11:29.570
stifle, stifle. Anything that doesn't fit inside.

212
00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:34.220
That very narrow paradigm. They're trying to push very strange.

213
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.470
<v 2>Now they co-opted the civil rights movement.</v>

214
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:39.740
The good name of the civil rights movement is kind of the brand that they ride

215
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:43.130
on. You know, they're fighting against racism, they're fighting against sexism,

216
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.500
misogyny, et cetera. And the thing is,

217
00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:50.360
is that's not really what's going on here. They've actually tapped into this to,

218
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.970
to throw around the term. This post-modern notion,

219
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.010
everything in society has to do with power dynamics and the power dynamics have

220
00:11:57.011 --> 00:12:00.460
to be understood in terms of groups and how those groups have traditionally held

221
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:01.870
power and exercise power.

222
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.820
And so immediately it becomes stuck in this idea that it's all about this group

223
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:09.760
or that group and how they relate to one another. And I don't mean like, Hey,

224
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:10.750
let's get along really.

225
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.040
I mean like white people are imagined to always be over black people.

226
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:19.330
And therefore, you know, there's always this natural power dynamic of, of,

227
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.100
of oppressor versus oppressed.

228
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.490
And this is stuff that came straight out of this weird postmodern philosophy

229
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:29.140
where you saw these dissatisfied French philosophers in the sixties,

230
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.490
you know, all in this, all this stuff you were talking about was going down. Um,

231
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.120
they saw this stuff and they said, wow, you know, okay,

232
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.910
power dynamics are the thing, because I should go back a step. The,

233
00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:45.220
the postmodern philosophers like Fuko and all of this got all hooked up on power

234
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:48.280
because they were just satisfied with seeing what they called grand narratives,

235
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:52.330
Christianity, uh, capitalism, Marxism.

236
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.160
They saw all these huge, you know,

237
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:58.000
explanations for how the world works and said, you know, they're not working.

238
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.930
Look how bad communism failed. Look how there's so much, you know,

239
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.350
coming out of this or that from religion, it's not working.

240
00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:08.020
We need to just get rid of all of it. We're going to deconstruct this.

241
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:10.540
We're going to break it down to its power dynamics.

242
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:15.310
And then we're going to look at it in terms of who has master hood over,

243
00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:19.090
over who who's oppressing, what where's dominance. And it's just kind of grown.

244
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:22.930
It got picked up in the, in the academic culture, in the 1960s.

245
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:24.130
That's how old this stuff is.

246
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.360
And then it took this huge turn in the 1990s and got really vicious.

247
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:30.670
And that's where it really got, you know, that's when it turned intersectional,

248
00:13:30.671 --> 00:13:31.440
actually.

249
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.140
<v 0>That was during the political correct days. That's.</v>

250
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.430
<v 2>It's when the political correct thing kind of blew up. Yeah.</v>

251
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.820
Was when all this stuff was coming out. So that would have been, you know,

252
00:13:38.821 --> 00:13:43.650
late 1980s is really when all of this political correctness stuff started

253
00:13:43.651 --> 00:13:45.570
coming out of the academy. And then a few years later,

254
00:13:45.571 --> 00:13:48.690
you see it coming all over politics, which typically what happens.

255
00:13:48.691 --> 00:13:50.190
It starts in the academy a few years later,

256
00:13:50.191 --> 00:13:55.080
it leaks into the culture and politics or media or the tech sector. Now,

257
00:13:55.081 --> 00:13:56.100
whatever it happens to be.

258
00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.450
<v 0>The stifling of creativity is the most disturbing part about it. Like the,</v>

259
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:05.130
like the, the agreement that south park and the Simpsons are a real problem.

260
00:14:05.131 --> 00:14:07.830
It's so bizarre because like, here's the thing.

261
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.310
If they miss the mark and it's not funny, it won't work.

262
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.060
And then it'll be a bad show and no one would like it. But if it's funny,

263
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.590
there has to be something about it that people find ironic

264
00:14:19.591 --> 00:14:23.130
satirical. There has to be something about it that people are enjoying.

265
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.090
It has to point to some truth and the denial of this.

266
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.410
And instead like the saying, oh,

267
00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:32.730
it's white males that are causing this problem and you shouldn't attack this or

268
00:14:32.731 --> 00:14:33.660
that. Or, you know,

269
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.260
that there's subjects that are off limits and social justice should never be

270
00:14:37.261 --> 00:14:39.660
attacked. Like the two agree to that.

271
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:44.100
It's so it's so preposterous. This is life we're talking about.

272
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.350
This is literally the nuance of life,

273
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.330
all the various strange things in the spectrum of human behavior

274
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:56.450
and, and all the things you encounter in life and to segment and limit what

275
00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:59.360
is, and is not what's off limits.

276
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.030
It's not off limits based on race,

277
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:07.130
based on things that a person can't control at all. You're just born white.

278
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.340
So if you're born white, you're born and oppressor, right.

279
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.880
You're born a victimizer. And if you're a white male, you're a piece of.

280
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.530
And you can say that white hetero male in particular, God, I mean,

281
00:15:18.531 --> 00:15:23.480
I've seen so many tweets from people that means so many virtue signaling tweets,

282
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:28.040
but one of my favorite ones is this feminist who said all white, a white,

283
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:32.960
straight men are trash unless proven otherwise. Yeah. That's a thing.

284
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.460
<v 4>All of us, all of us,</v>

285
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.450
50 million of us.

286
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:45.040
<v 0>Have been give or take, you know, how many gay folks there are trash. Yeah.</v>

287
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.030
Trash.

288
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.910
<v 2>No problem. Proven. It's proven. Otherwise, if you're not right,</v>

289
00:15:48.911 --> 00:15:51.510
how do you do that? That's like, you have to be an ally.

290
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.880
They asked us to problematize allyship to you see there's power dynamics.

291
00:15:54.881 --> 00:15:56.620
Once you say, Hey, I'm an ally.

292
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.770
Now you've made it so that you have like a shield where people can't call you a

293
00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:00.880
white supremacist anymore.

294
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.350
And you are acting on behalf of other people in, you know,

295
00:16:05.351 --> 00:16:06.310
you're speaking for them.

296
00:16:06.311 --> 00:16:09.970
So you now have assumed power that was reproducing the same power dynamics.

297
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.830
That was the mind comp paper that rewrote my income actually.

298
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.600
<v 3>Was about allyship. And they were like, you didn't problematize Ellen.</v>

299
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.180
<v 4>Yeah. We had two, two of them that did mountain comp.</v>

300
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:19.511
<v 1>One of them,</v>

301
00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:24.220
we just more or less replaced whites would replace Jews with white men.

302
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:25.690
And you, I.

303
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:30.670
<v 0>Literally took mine comp the actual words from mine comp and put it</v>

304
00:16:30.671 --> 00:16:34.960
in this paper and replaced the word Jews with the word white men.

305
00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:35.794
And they accepted.

306
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:40.210
<v 1>Them. We had two papers that did mine comprehend. So that one did not get.</v>

307
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.850
<v 0>Do the quotes that you guys use.</v>

308
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.680
<v 2>I mean, so with that one,</v>

309
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:49.480
what we did was we took the whole document on online and we just

310
00:16:49.481 --> 00:16:52.960
searched the word Jew and we just started picking sentences and paragraphs.

311
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.620
So what was it that at the end, it was something like,

312
00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.430
if we don't combat whiteness, it's going to be the funeral wreath for mankind.

313
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.120
That's straight.

314
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.920
<v 3>Out now. They didn't.</v>

315
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.360
<v 2>Yeah, they didn't, they didn't accept that paper though, because that paper, uh,</v>

316
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:07.931
turns out,

317
00:17:07.931 --> 00:17:11.830
was written from the perspective of a white lesbian who hated her on whiteness.

318
00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:14.140
And they said that it was positioning her as a good white,

319
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.470
and because she's making herself out as a good white, again, allyship isn't,

320
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.190
as all it's cracked up to be, she, you know, was making a problem.

321
00:17:21.191 --> 00:17:25.240
She should have really been forwarding the ideas of the black scholars that she

322
00:17:25.241 --> 00:17:28.030
read way more and not talking about herself so much,

323
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.340
even though it was a paper designed to be talking about. Yeah,

324
00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:32.740
because that was what Hitler did. So that's what we had to do.

325
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.170
Now. The other mind comp paper was about feminism.

326
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.690
And what we did was we took the chapter it's chapter 12.

327
00:17:40.691 --> 00:17:42.070
We took the chapter where he says,

328
00:17:42.071 --> 00:17:45.820
this is why we should have the Nazi party and what is expected of people who are

329
00:17:45.821 --> 00:17:49.710
going to be part of it. And we took out our movement or party.

330
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.840
He didn't call it a Nazi party in the chapter, but everywhere.

331
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:53.670
He's like our movement took that out,

332
00:17:53.671 --> 00:17:58.380
put in intersectional feminism and then modified the words and added theory

333
00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:00.710
around it so that it would fly. And.

334
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.610
<v 3>Your theory, that's what they call it. I love that word theory. I love when.</v>

335
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.570
<v 0>Feminist theory, I love when they throw that around. Like, what are you saying?</v>

336
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.770
But you're saying things that like, once you say that you're, you're good.

337
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.460
Like you've said, you can say something ridiculous and then say feminist theory.

338
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.580
<v 3>And they're like, oh, it's in feminist theory. That's the thing.</v>

339
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.080
<v 2>Right. Is so much of the stuff they come up with.</v>

340
00:18:21.081 --> 00:18:22.340
Let me throw them on all of branch.

341
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.530
Like so much of the stuff they come up with is a creative idea.

342
00:18:24.531 --> 00:18:26.480
Maybe there's something to some of this stuff. Right.

343
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.880
But what they're putting forward is hypothesis.

344
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.680
And then they're treating them as conclusions.

345
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.560
So they're putting forward this idea. I saw one on Twitter today.

346
00:18:33.561 --> 00:18:35.570
It was something like there's about south park,

347
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.260
how it's been laundering racism into society and making everybody comfortable

348
00:18:39.261 --> 00:18:42.620
with racism. And that's why everything is so racist and people are shooting.

349
00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:47.120
Jews is because south park made it normal that they're treating that as a

350
00:18:47.121 --> 00:18:49.880
conclusion, but that's a hypothesis, right? So we could test that.

351
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.590
It's conceivable that you could actually try to parse out what variables need to

352
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:57.520
be controlled. See, you know, south park came out,

353
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.320
it started doing these themes. What, how does it track?

354
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.870
Statisticians can do kind of amazing things with that stuff,

355
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.510
but they're not doing that. They're not testing it instead of testing it,

356
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:11.150
they're concluding it. And they're using theory to do so. And they're go, oh no,

357
00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:13.610
it's even bigger than that because why don't they test it? Well,

358
00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:17.090
if they tested it and this is, I'm not making this up, you won't believe me,

359
00:19:17.091 --> 00:19:17.924
but this is true.

360
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.140
If they tested it and the test showed that their hypothesis was wrong,

361
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.770
they would say that the test was racist, but the test is condoning racism.

362
00:19:24.771 --> 00:19:26.930
And that's why it didn't give them the desired result. How.

363
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.960
<v 0>Would you test something like, cause I mean, I'm.</v>

364
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.050
<v 2>Not a statistician. I actually am a mathematician, but I'm not a statistician.</v>

365
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.140
They're two different things. So I'm not exactly sure how you would test that.

366
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.300
But conceivably you could gather data,

367
00:19:38.301 --> 00:19:41.000
survey data and see how attitudes have changed.

368
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.780
Maybe you could track kinds of articles, kinds of events that are coming out.

369
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.710
You could kind of pair that up with, what's been shown on south park who are.

370
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.770
<v 1>At south park and track that with attitudes. I mean, yeah, but they're not.</v>

371
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.100
<v 2>There's no effort to do this. They're like, oh, south park presents these ideas,</v>

372
00:19:55.101 --> 00:19:56.090
which they then cherry pick.

373
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.670
Cause there's other ideas that they don't talk about. Their point,

374
00:19:58.671 --> 00:20:03.140
the other direction, these ideas are problematic. That's the big word,

375
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.140
theoretically, that's a problem. Why? Because they, and I'm not joking.

376
00:20:06.141 --> 00:20:09.830
They literally believe that use of language creates the power dynamics that

377
00:20:09.831 --> 00:20:10.700
define society.

378
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:15.260
So south Park's using language and imagery that creates a power dynamic that

379
00:20:15.261 --> 00:20:19.940
makes people more comfortable being racist. Boom theory done.

380
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.260
No tests needed no even attempt to test. And then if the test happened,

381
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.770
the test itself will be racist unless it confirmed the hip-hop right.

382
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:32.060
<v 1>So they start with an agenda. And then you mentioned the word laundry,</v>

383
00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:35.270
which could your former guest, Brett and Heather talked about, uh,

384
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.910
ideal laundry. I think that's important for the listeners.

385
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.660
<v 2>So what's, that's what really what's going on here is, um,</v>

386
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.200
they're forwarding these hypotheses. They treat,

387
00:20:45.201 --> 00:20:49.480
they don't treat them as hypotheses and they write up a paper paper,

388
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:52.360
like we were saying is the absolute gold standard of academic work.

389
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.190
They send the paper off the reviewers in our case has made our papers crazier

390
00:20:57.191 --> 00:21:00.610
every single time. So they push it further into the ideology or the madness.

391
00:21:00.611 --> 00:21:01.540
How does the reviewer.

392
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.450
<v 0>Do something like that? What, what input do they get to have?</v>

393
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.690
<v 2>They said, for example, that we should problematize allyship. If we're gonna,</v>

394
00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:10.530
if we want our paper published, we've got a problem with, I love that word.

395
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.900
<v 0>Problematize, everything. So everything.</v>

396
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.900
<v 1>Problematize, everything, dog parks, problem.</v>

397
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.340
<v 4>Problem with literally anything.</v>

398
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.440
<v 1>Can be problematized and looked at through a feminist.</v>

399
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.560
<v 4>Lens. Does everything the whole world.</v>

400
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.010
<v 3>To up their tool. That's why we call it grievance studies.</v>

401
00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:31.080
<v 4>Grievance is there they're massively. Okay. So then, but the, do the homo,</v>

402
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.180
the transphobia. Yeah, the trans paper.

403
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.350
<v 2>So we wrote this paper,</v>

404
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.730
the saying that straight men are generally transphobic,

405
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.790
meaning in particular, the, their kind of niche,

406
00:21:41.791 --> 00:21:45.240
weird definition that you see on the internet and activist sometimes that they

407
00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.260
aren't interested in having sex with trans people who have penises trans women

408
00:21:49.261 --> 00:21:52.230
who have a penis in particular. And so we said, well,

409
00:21:52.231 --> 00:21:53.490
that's a kind of transphobia.

410
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:57.330
And clearly the reason that they might be transphobic is because they don't

411
00:21:57.331 --> 00:21:58.830
practice putting things in their butts.

412
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.670
So if they start putting stuff up their butts in particular, we call the paper.

413
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.870
So you can imagine what we were saying that you put up the paper was called. No,

414
00:22:06.871 --> 00:22:08.250
that was the, that was the nickname we gave her.

415
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.140
The paper was called going into the back door.

416
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.893
<v 3>Wheeling. Really?</v>

417
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.730
<v 2>Yeah. Going in through the back door.</v>

418
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.700
<v 3>There's a lot of technical words that would get published.</v>

419
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.850
<v 4>Online. So we argued that, that, uh, if straight men.</v>

420
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.210
<v 1>Just penetrated themselves and had their girlfriends,</v>

421
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.280
peg them through exposure therapy, you know,

422
00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:32.970
you start small and then work your way up. You can remediate transphobia. Yeah.

423
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.100
We'll make them less transphobic. So as a result,

424
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:38.280
self penetrating or having your girlfriend, Peggy, you,

425
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.310
you can be less transphobic. And they thought this is the greatest.

426
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.590
<v 3>So we based this off the.</v>

427
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.300
<v 2>Interviews, really 13 interviews, but with men and I say really a 13,</v>

428
00:22:48.301 --> 00:22:50.970
there were 13 interviews documented, but five of them were gay people,

429
00:22:50.971 --> 00:22:53.310
not even straight people. So they don't really apply.

430
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.770
So then we have these eight interviews with straight men.

431
00:22:55.771 --> 00:22:59.370
We made one of them a conservative. And he's just so we could just put in like,

432
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.400
you know, crazy things that a conservative might say about this.

433
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.330
And they were like,

434
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:07.380
why don't why weren't there more conservatives participating. So I was like,

435
00:23:07.381 --> 00:23:08.400
well, I'm gonna run with this.

436
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.320
<v 3>And I was, I wrote this whole thing.</v>

437
00:23:10.321 --> 00:23:13.140
We invited six conservatives to participate.

438
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.850
<v 2>And only one accepted and to kind of summarize why in the world.</v>

439
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.040
And this is in the paper, in the words of one,

440
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.700
I don't want to be a part of some stupid liberal study about shoving things up

441
00:23:23.701 --> 00:23:26.390
your butt. And they published.

442
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:31.260
<v 4>It. Boom. Right, right. Oh my God. Oh,</v>

443
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.460
so we wrote this.

444
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.440
<v 0>Retracted article. Yep.</v>

445
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.150
Going in through the back door right there. Oh my God. Now,

446
00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.480
did they contact you after they were tracked your article? They go, Hey,

447
00:23:42.481 --> 00:23:45.450
you guys are. You are wasting our time.

448
00:23:45.451 --> 00:23:47.550
We spent hours reviewing your papers.

449
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.720
<v 2>A couple of pretty bitter responses, but mostly, no,</v>

450
00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.610
mostly they've kind of put their head in the sand and kind of avoided talking to

451
00:23:53.611 --> 00:23:53.820
us.
