00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.440
I don't know too much about the actual,

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.040
is there a difference between the way different alcohol affects you? Is,

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.960
does the wine alcohol actually affect you by volume by,

5
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.840
by, by the actual percentage of alcohol?

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.070
Does it act you differently than beer or differently than whiskey or differently

7
00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:27.630
in tequila? Cause that's what people always say. Oh, if I drink tequila,

8
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.110
I get crazy. Like people always have these stories, but is that true?

9
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:35.110
If you have, you had a certain percentage of alcohol? I see we equalize.

10
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.630
<v 1>We equalize the, the alcohol mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh, concentration.</v>

11
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.420
Is it all the same in the, because.

12
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.273
<v 0>For me,</v>

13
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.340
wine makes me warm and friendly and it makes me

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.540
sleepy and it ma I mean, it doesn't make me energetic.

15
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.300
Whiskey makes me crazy. Yeah. Like I think it's a crazy drug.

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.940
I think when people drink shots of Jack Daniels, they just want to go, whoa.

17
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.850
They, they, they wanna get CRA. They wanna I'm.

18
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.850
It makes 'em want to do dumb things.

19
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.130
Shots in particular makes people want to do dumb things. Makes people get crazy.

20
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.010
Makes people loud. That makes people Irish. &lt;laugh&gt; right.

21
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.650
<v 1>Yeah. It's better you saying than me.</v>

22
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.770
<v 0>Quarter Irish. I can get away with it for a little while. Only a quarter.</v>

23
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.810
That's it? Yeah. Mostly Italian.

24
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.520
<v 1>Oh, I see. You're at the cusp of these two drinking traditions.</v>

25
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.373
<v 0>Yes. Yes.</v>

26
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.400
<v 1>Oh, I see. But Rogan you're fool's Irish. You're fooling us with Rogan though.</v>

27
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.760
YESS an Irish. Cause we would think that you were majority Irish with that.

28
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.720
<v 0>Yes. Yeah. And I, I could be dark Irish if you looked at me, if you would.</v>

29
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.960
<v 1>Yeah. I'm well, I'm, you know, I'm um, reserved,</v>

30
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.990
uh, uh, English and Jamaican.

31
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.350
Jamaican's not big drinkers in no, in the same kind of, uh,

32
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.270
uh, the difference actually, fascinatingly of the many weird alcohol facts.

33
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.590
If you look at, uh, young people, it's like, let's look a college age,

34
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.260
young people in America and look at their drinking habits. The, uh,

35
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.413
uh,

36
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.100
black students drink and get drunk markedly less

37
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.300
than white kids. Real differences in drinking behavior by race,

38
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.860
in that, at that age, Asian students don't drink much.

39
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:22.580
Either drinking is like a, it's like a, it's like a white thing.

40
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:26.530
It's like a crazy white thing increasingly in, um, or, or problematic drinking.

41
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.650
I always thought that was fascinating. It is fascinating. I don't know.

42
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.170
I don't know. I don't know why that's.

43
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.410
<v 0>So is it it's revered in our culture more it's uh, yeah, I mean,</v>

44
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:40.330
getting up is celebrated in white culture. Well.

45
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.250
<v 1>This, you know, in the alcohol chapter, in my book, the,</v>

46
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.320
I talk of about all the strange things that have happened with drinking patterns

47
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:51.680
on campus. And I was struck in doing that chapter.

48
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.280
I was interested in the connection between drinking and drunkenness and

49
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.920
sexual assault on campus. Cuz all of those, the overwhelming majority,

50
00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:03.080
if you talk to people who study sexual assault on campus,

51
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.400
they will tell you that you almost never see one of these cases where

52
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.080
both parties aren't drunk. Right. It's um,

53
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.840
which doesn't explain them entirely,

54
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.750
but it's a huge factor in making sense of what happened. But,

55
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.790
and when you dig into that, you see these like really weird patterns. First off,

56
00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:26.790
when I was in college, I did not know. And I went to college in Canada,

57
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.510
not a T totalling population.

58
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.390
I did not know a single person who had ever been Dr. Blackout drunk.

59
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.830
And then now if you talk to a 20 year old college student in,

60
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.540
they will name friends of theirs who get blackout drunk on a weekly basis.

61
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.100
<v 0>What is the drinking age in Canada? And what was it when you were in college?</v>

62
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.780
When.

63
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.700
<v 1>I was in college, you was 18.</v>

64
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.980
<v 0>Yeah. I think that might be a big factor.</v>

65
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.060
I've been talking to friends about this, about Europe,

66
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.250
about how in Europe? Uh, particularly in to Lee and France,

67
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.210
you're you're allowed to drink wine at a very young age. Yeah.

68
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.050
And the taboo aspect of it, the forbidden fruit, all that goes away.

69
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.490
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's a, just, it's a,

70
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.890
I don't think young kids should be drinking cuz I think it's terrible for your

71
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:15.724
brain development.

72
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.450
But I think there's a thing in keeping them from drinking or making it illegal

73
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.000
where it becomes so taboo and so intoxicating that they can't

74
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:29.600
wait until they can legally do it or they try to get ahold of it before

75
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.320
it's legal and it has this certain excitement to it that just doesn't,

76
00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:35.960
it doesn't have in parts of Europe. Yeah. You've.

77
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.840
<v 1>Given it up kind of.</v>

78
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.030
So there's all kinds of the things that are new are way less beer and way

79
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:46.150
more hard liquor. So yeah, hard liquor. When I was in school in Canada,

80
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.550
in the eighties, 95% of what we drank was beer. Right.

81
00:04:49.551 --> 00:04:52.990
It's just not there wasn't any whiskey or even, um,

82
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.910
or tequila or a vodka in our parties. It's just beer, beer.

83
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.990
<v 0>Kegs, cake parties. Yeah. Really.</v>

84
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.300
<v 1>Hard to get blackout drunk on beer. I mean blackout to get to blackout.</v>

85
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:06.740
You gotta be, you gotta get to like, I forgotten what the exact number,

86
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:07.580
that 10 drinks.

87
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.380
<v 0>Or something. Well it's.</v>

88
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.260
<v 1>Point you gotta blow like one eight or something.</v>

89
00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:15.180
I've forgotten what there's a sort of magic number where people is that for.

90
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.420
<v 0>Everybody. Cuz some people, they just get dribble eyes.</v>

91
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.340
Like there's some dudes they'll have a couple of drinks and they get shark eyes

92
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.610
of those, those dark. Yeah. Like expressionless eyes like, Hey man,

93
00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:29.770
you still here? Yeah. Like they're just wandering around like, like a, like a,

94
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.490
a person with doll eyes. There's no. Well the issue, nothing there.

95
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.210
<v 1>With the issue with back is just at what point is your hippocampus shut down and</v>

96
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:40.050
you cease the ability to have the ability to make memories. So that's just,

97
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.720
that's a very narrow, clean explanation of,

98
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.600
so there may be a whole different set of manifestations of drunkenness

99
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.280
that have to do with alcohol's effect on other parts of your brain. Right.

100
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.640
But blackout is just about your hippocampus. Um,

101
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.280
and past a certain blood alcohol concentration,

102
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.040
your hippocampus just goes offline as Essent.

103
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.760
You just pull a plug on HIPC &lt;affirmative&gt; and then so nothing that's coming in

104
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.000
is being stored. Wow. So you can continue to communicate.

105
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.120
I could be blackout drunk right now, but.

106
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.920
<v 0>Does it vary with people? Does it, I mean the, the, the number, well.</v>

107
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.070
<v 1>So alcohol, it would, it would vary, um,</v>

108
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:22.830
depending I think on drinking history and yeah. Um, but I mean, as a,

109
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.310
there is it's, there's a kind of a,

110
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.110
there's a consensus figure where most people, I, I wish I it's in my book.

111
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.510
I wish I could remember. I think it's something like, uh,

112
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:35.550
point 16 or something like that. If you think of the,

113
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.060
if the Lev the level legal level for drinking for,

114
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.500
for driving is 0.08, I think it's roughly two X that level.

115
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.100
And most people at that level will be at risk will have at least the beginnings

116
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:50.500
of memory impairment.

117
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.420
So that feeling when you get really drunk at a party and the next morning,

118
00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:59.010
you can only remember little bits and pieces of what that night that's because

119
00:06:59.011 --> 00:07:03.330
your, your hippocampus was at your moment of peak intoxication.

120
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.130
Your hippocampus was starting to shut down and just wasn't taking in new

121
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.970
humidity. It's.

122
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:08.771
<v 0>Really interesting too,</v>

123
00:07:08.771 --> 00:07:12.810
because some of our most interesting minds and some of the best communicators

124
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.050
relied on alcohol heavily mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, and it made them like,

125
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.123
Hitchins,

126
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.280
it made him a more interesting communicator when he was drunk when he would have

127
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.400
a, a drink, you know, I mean, right.

128
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:30.200
Like he would be on bill Mar you could tell he was, he was lit. Yeah. And, and,

129
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.640
and he was so eloquent and so articulate,

130
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.760
but that beautiful phrasing. So.

131
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.401
<v 1>Remember though,</v>

132
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:40.470
that is an interesting point and a crucial point about blackout,

133
00:07:40.471 --> 00:07:45.470
which is your hippocampus doesn't necessarily control your, uh, your,

134
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.030
how articulate you are, how fluid your speech is.

135
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.110
It's just about memory mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

136
00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:53.830
So Hitchens could have been the most articulate person in the world. And just,

137
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:54.450
and,

138
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.070
but the next morning he would not have remembered a single thing he said on bill

139
00:07:57.071 --> 00:07:58.750
Mar. Mm. I mean, I'm assuming if he was.

140
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.580
<v 0>I think he was blackout. No, he was a blackout, but.</v>

141
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.500
<v 1>But you don't know. There's fascinating stories in the literature about, um,</v>

142
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.460
when people were discovering blackout in the fifties and they would,

143
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:13.740
they would be these stories, like they would, some guy would come in,

144
00:08:13.741 --> 00:08:18.700
he would wake up in Las Vegas and he would say, what am I doing in Las Vegas?

145
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.290
Like, and he would go,

146
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:23.850
and he would see his clothes hanging in the closet and he would say,

147
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.970
what's going on? And then he would like go down to the desk and say what?

148
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.250
And they'd say, oh, you checked in last night.

149
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.890
And he would look in his wallet and he would see he had a plane ticket from

150
00:08:31.891 --> 00:08:34.890
Cleveland and they would reconstruct. And there's a, in fact,

151
00:08:34.891 --> 00:08:36.970
this very story was told in the, you know,

152
00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:40.400
one of the big medical journals in the fifties, the guy res trucks,

153
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.840
he's a salesman living in like St. Louis who gets really, really drunk.

154
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.840
And then his hippocampus shuts down and he continues to function. So he goes,

155
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.680
gets in his car, drives to the airport, buys a plane ticket, goes to Vegas.

156
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.560
Does he doesn't know what he does in Vegas does whatever he does in Vegas.

157
00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.960
And then wakes up like two days later. Oh my gosh.

158
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.640
Hippocampus is suddenly back online. He's like, what am I doing in Vegas?

159
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.320
That is two days.

160
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.400
<v 0>Two days. God.</v>

161
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.320
<v 1>So the point is like, the point is that you can, you, you like,</v>

162
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.720
that was my point. I could be blackout right now.

163
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.910
<v 0>And still communicate. You wouldn't know.</v>

164
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.430
<v 1>It. I don't, it's not like you can tell,</v>

165
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.990
I can't tell whether you have a headache. Can I? Right. No clue.

166
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.590
So you don't know what's going. I mean,

167
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:24.790
until we come up with that machine that you were talking about, uh,

168
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.950
you can't tell that my hippocampus isn't working. Ah, except if you answer,

169
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.910
if you ask me the same question, this is how you, the only way you can do it,

170
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.750
you're at a party. You think someone's blackout.

171
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.380
Ask them the same question over and over again and see if they respond.

172
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.780
Like say why you ask me? So literally I would say,

173
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.900
um, wait, did you say you're a,

174
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.700
you're a quarter Irish and then I would just have to wait,

175
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.620
like say five seconds and say, Joe,

176
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:54.500
did you say you're a quarter Irish and at a certain way,

177
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:55.970
you're gonna say Malcolm, why is stop it?

178
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.250
If you don't say that you're blackout drunk.

179
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.143
<v 0>But if you do,</v>

180
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.290
if you could you be blackout drunk and still have like a tiny memory?

181
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.930
No, you just asked me that. Okay.

182
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.650
<v 1>So, uh, the hippocampus doesn't shut down all at once.</v>

183
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.680
So what it does is it shuts down slowly. So let's imagine where doing shots.

184
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.040
So after, I mean, I'm quite sure your capacity I'm,

185
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.720
I mean, you're like, I'm half your weight, am I? But I didn't know what you are.

186
00:10:26.721 --> 00:10:30.560
You're like 200 pounds. I'm 1 26. Okay. Yeah.

187
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.480
So we're gonna deal with alcohol very differently,

188
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.600
but let's assume we're doing shots of tequila. Uh,

189
00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.270
there's a point in where things start to get hazy.

190
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.470
So you might remember that I answered that question or you might not.

191
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.470
And then as we keep drinking in our blood alcohol levels get higher and higher

192
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:46.711
at a certain point,

193
00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:51.270
your hippocampus will completely like the off switch has been thrown.

194
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:56.430
So it goes from being sluggish and impaired to just being

195
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.220
down like.

196
00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.820
<v 0>And what brings it back?</v>

197
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.421
<v 1>Uh, well,</v>

198
00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:05.020
your blood alcohol level has to fall to the point where it can work again.

199
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.460
So you fall asleep and over the course of eight hours of sleep, you know,

200
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:14.860
your alcohol is processed by your liver, blood, alcohol falls, uh,

201
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.660
hippocampus snaps back into action.

202
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.610
<v 0>Wow. What a ridiculous drug to be our most socially acceptable drug.</v>

203
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.970
Yeah. To totally. And then the Vegas thing where they give it to you for free,

204
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.890
of course. Yeah. In a place where you can gamble, which is really sneaky. Yeah.

205
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:35.690
That's one of the weirder laws ever that a person could literally lose their

206
00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:37.130
house while they're black out drunk.

207
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:38.400
<v 2>And.</v>
