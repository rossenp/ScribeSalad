00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 1>Experience. Would you fight now? What.</v>

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.440
<v 0>I know? No, there's nobody listening to what I'm saying.</v>

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.170
<v 1>I know, but like not one of those guys, that's some of the celebrity.</v>

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.800
<v 0>Too many people that are having real problems with their head. Yes.</v>

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.810
A lot of fighters like post-career are having real struggles. It's not,

7
00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:23.760
it's no joke, man. You gotta know when to stop and head injuries. Are.

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.110
<v 1>That headgear?</v>

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.870
<v 0>That's worse. Well, head gear doesn't help.</v>

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.230
Headgear makes your head like a bigger target. It's easier to hit.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.980
And then also when you get hit, it acts like it's unnatural.

12
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:37.380
Fulcrum all its weight on your head. Yeah.

13
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.280
I think you're pro the thing about it is you're trying to avoid cuts.

14
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.680
That's what head gear is good for. It's good for you avoiding cuts,

15
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.960
but you can get up with a punch or a kick wearing headgear big gloves.

16
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:52.410
Help a little bit. Yeah. The gloves still get your brains. Rattled.

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.570
<v 1>AAA are talking about having a fight, but he won't fight.</v>

18
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.300
<v 0>Me. No, don't get your brains rattled.</v>

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.290
<v 1>Dude. It won't be me. I guess he's worried about himself.</v>

20
00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.310
<v 0>About.</v>

21
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.160
<v 1>Hurting himself. Yeah. Getting hurt. Yeah. And his mom's worried about it.</v>

22
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.510
<v 0>Too. What are you trying to say?</v>

23
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.060
You're trying to talk says his mom's worried about.

24
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.800
<v 1>Him. That mom loves him. He's worried about her.</v>

25
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.750
<v 0>I'm going to them up. Is that what you're saying?</v>

26
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.770
<v 1>Yeah. I think that's overall likes run away from the fight. Yeah. If I had,</v>

27
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.933
if I had against.

28
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.760
<v 0>I was trying to figure.</v>

29
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.320
<v 1>Out what's going on and trying to find him. You won't find me.</v>

30
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.540
<v 0>Why do you want to find them? You guys work together now.</v>

31
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.330
<v 1>I know, but he's talking about this fight forever and he won't fight me forever.</v>

32
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.000
<v 0>Yeah. He would do this. I know you would know for sure.</v>

33
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.710
Do you think you would fight higher sober?

34
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.910
<v 1>I probably alright. Probably highs. I don't know.</v>

35
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:33.990
Maybe I trained high all the time with Eddie. He encouraged it. Yeah.

36
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.630
<v 0>Always. It's great. Would you? Um.</v>

37
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.360
<v 1>I might show mercy if I was high, that'd be a negative bare.</v>

38
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.650
<v 0>Bare knuckle each tank.</v>

39
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.760
<v 1>I was not thinking about that. I was thinking the big gloves, but that's Debbie.</v>

40
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:46.710
One way to go. I don't think bare knuckle now.

41
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.300
<v 0>Bare knuckle open hand.</v>

42
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.190
<v 1>Like combat fight. That's.</v>

43
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.900
<v 0>A good way to get poked in the eye. Trust me.</v>

44
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.080
<v 1>She Lewis and break his hand. Slapped fighting. Jay. Did he really?</v>

45
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.720
He broke his fix though. I think so when he hit it right.

46
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.013
<v 0>That a giant head.</v>

47
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.353
<v 1>Real hard.</v>

48
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.120
<v 0>He's got a super wide. Yeah. He's got big bones at J.</v>

49
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.370
<v 1>Yeah. How was losing those gangs? You went on.</v>

50
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.170
<v 0>We were so high though, dude. And it was the day after sober. October was over,</v>

51
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.420
uh, Blitzkrieg and they kept rolling blunts and pass them around. And I was,

52
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.340
and I had pronounced some rush names two hours later, you know? Cause yeah,

53
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.620
you do the way and it's two hours later. So this is them slap,

54
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:32.670
fighting Jeremiah. Oh, him and Jeremiah. That's when he brought this.

55
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.510
Oh JAMA, just Jeremiah just lit him up.

56
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.310
Jeremiah changed stance. He knows how to use that.

57
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.390
<v 1>There's a block too. He goes backhanded. Oh he's toying with them.</v>

58
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.280
<v 0>Dude. Jeremiah slapped him like, oh.</v>

59
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.450
<v 1>Louis. When he faked boxes, he touches. You hit your way.</v>

60
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.590
<v 0>To learn a box.</v>

61
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.380
<v 1>From Catholic school. I think to Kansas somewhere. Yeah, for real,</v>

62
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.180
I don't hit a slap cattle on the

63
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.380
outclass by this 130 pounder.

64
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.690
<v 0>Oh that's a good angle to, this is a slap Thompson.</v>

65
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.180
This is a real slap fight. This is a real slap fight. Yeah.

66
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.520
This isn't like some guys playing silly.

67
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.203
[inaudible] No.

68
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.450
<v 1>Wow. You know he's not knocked out, but you got to up Gomez cracked. Oh,</v>

69
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.430
that's a kind of fighting. They got your dad stabbed to death.

70
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.020
<v 0>The region of skank slap-boxing oh my God. Let me tell you something.</v>

71
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:35.350
You can get Kao and slap boxing. Don't get confused. Look at him.

72
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.890
He just had a fight that was like a fight fight.

73
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.930
<v 1>Flew out for this. He flew out.</v>

74
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.330
<v 0>For a slap. I mean they had some of the shamans this round too.</v>

75
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.193
Are they going to brown too?

76
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.640
<v 1>I didn't know what, like.</v>

77
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.970
<v 0>This keep going please. What are you doing? Why are you shutting this off?</v>

78
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.630
Let it roll. Oh my God.

79
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.783
<v 1>This,</v>

80
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.960
I mean, Louis is so serious right now.

81
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.960
<v 0>Well, what Jeremiah is doing, let me tell you what to doing.</v>

82
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.520
What he's doing is he's waiting.

83
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.480
He's putting his hand out to his PI and Lewis throws. These combinations.

84
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.210
Jeremiah is waiting, watching him.

85
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.820
He's catching him as he was coming in comparison.

86
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.460
<v 1>To Anderson silver a little bit, a little bit. The way.</v>

87
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.770
<v 0>He's like Baytown counter fighting guys, counter fighting.</v>

88
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.150
And he's also very smart with his defense and Louis got a little feel for that.

89
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:24.310
Right-hand a little worried about that right hand. He doesn't want it.

90
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:27.940
That thing's coming down. It's a good, he's got a good reach. Tack keeps.

91
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.070
<v 1>Blocking on the side of the Jeremiah is not touching, but.</v>

92
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.570
<v 0>Oh.</v>

93
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.590
<v 1>Oh Lewis. Can't help. But want to close his fist? Yeah.</v>

94
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.460
<v 0>Again, real close. Jeremiah is circling. That's a good move as well.</v>

95
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.660
But Lewis is closed. The distance. He looks very angry. He's serious.

96
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:45.070
He's going back to his room, sir.

97
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.563
<v 1>Ooh, Claremont.</v>

98
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.740
<v 0>Oh, he's getting very aggressive. Jeremiah might be losing steam. Oh,</v>

99
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.010
he's taken big reaches to the ground over rounds over.

100
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.660
There's another round after this.

101
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.850
<v 1>Jeremiah doing this. Gotta be a one more.</v>

102
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.240
<v 0>Keep it moving. Please. Let's see the next round they go for.</v>

103
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.780
And it goes on for the seven minute. Oh my God. So they just kept doing rounds.

104
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:08.920
Look, he's got his back turned and. This is hilarious.

105
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.230
These guys are, I'm so glad these guys are alive. They're so ridiculous.

106
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.720
Yeah. They're they're pushing wild comedy.

107
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.540
<v 1>I would go as far as I go on they Jessica, of course not.</v>

108
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.580
It's just such an open environment for doing.

109
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.950
<v 0>It's also in support of like, like I said, wild comedy.</v>

110
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.910
Like you need that.

111
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.410
<v 1>Need that you need it's.</v>

112
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.280
<v 0>People gathering, bounce things out. Obviously people love it. Oh.</v>

113
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.170
<v 1>Jeremiah. It's so Lakey.</v>

114
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.420
<v 0>He's taking away long swings.</v>

115
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.680
Louis is relaxing a little bit more now and he's starting to use some technique.

116
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.910
That was some nonsense right there.

117
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.680
It looked like he just punched him in the stone.

118
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:45.790
<v 1>As he looks at his closing his.</v>

119
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.610
<v 0>Fist all the time. He smacked him hard in the head with that right hand.</v>

120
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.040
<v 1>I have people get haven't slept Jeremiah.</v>

121
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.660
<v 0>Yeah. You can slap. I mean you could jail. Oh Lewis just smacked him. Oh,</v>

122
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:01.580
he went to the body with a punch dude. He's.

123
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.443
<v 1>Punching.</v>

124
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.230
<v 0>It seems like he's is he slapping.</v>

125
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.400
<v 1>Punching to the body? He can't help it. He's an oath. He's uneducated,</v>

126
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:13.010
which has a lot of his problems. He thinks he doesn't have a concept yet.

127
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.220
<v 0>Would you recommend to him? What, what books would you recommend?</v>

128
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.560
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

129
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.620
<v 0>Up with that right hand, dude. He got lit up. He.</v>

130
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.670
<v 1>Got lit up. Oh my God.</v>

131
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.560
<v 0>He's trying.</v>

132
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.580
<v 1>Hard to come. Or as the route is over at Lewis is still punching on the trash.</v>

133
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.443
Oh.

134
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.990
<v 0>Wow. Is that it?</v>

135
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.260
<v 1>I mean he won that fight. He's on, he's got Jeremiah in his heels, Jeremiah.</v>

136
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.050
Well, the first round, second round, I say it was a wash.

137
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.940
<v 0>Move. Definitely not. I didn't judge it.</v>

138
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.470
No people are saying one more round. Okay. What does it say?

139
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.710
<v 1>Jeremiah takes it. Wow. I can see it.</v>

140
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:52.700
There's all who run too.

141
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.240
<v 0>Wow. Well listen. He did crack him.</v>

142
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.090
<v 1>With some all based on round two. And that was the closed shot.</v>

143
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.530
<v 0>Looking at Jeremiah slapbox and people that looks painful as.</v>

144
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.780
Like his face is raw. Oh.

145
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.830
<v 1>My God. They.</v>

146
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.330
<v 0>Might have to have a rematch. Listen,</v>

147
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.060
let me tell you something about slapping people in the face.

148
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.230
Slap me with the face is open hands, open hands, hitting your eyeball.

149
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.170
You going to scratch your eyes and you're gonna have a real eye injury.

150
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.580
I'm not saying, I'm not saying don't do that. You do whatever you want.

151
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:26.060
But I want you to know that open hand, slapping and reaching like that.

152
00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:30.980
You just ask as someone who's seen probably 500 people get poked in the eye

153
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.780
up close. You're going to get poked.

154
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.630
<v 1>In the eye. A great, that is the best way to incapacitate someone. Don't do it.</v>

155
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.680
<v 0>Though. And what.</v>

156
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:37.603
<v 1>Don't do that?</v>

157
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.230
<v 0>No, don't do that.</v>

158
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.160
<v 1>If you need to win, he used this, like I like your technique.</v>

159
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:44.900
Block goggles there's is little slits.

160
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.010
<v 0>On your eyes. That's a good way to get those things whacked off. Growing.</v>

161
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.003
<v 1>Your nails out to.</v>

162
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.290
<v 0>Maybe if you had some eye goggles, like legit little welding goggles or some,</v>

163
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.050
some school goggles. There you go. But that would be,

164
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.950
it would almost be worse for you because it will with your peripheral.

165
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.780
If you didn't get used to slapping people.

166
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.720
When you have things on this one thing I always hated about headgear.

167
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:09.050
You put them on you can't see things here in here. Good.

168
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.170
Your window of your field of view gets narrowed. Yeah.

169
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.320
It becomes a problem. When you get close,

170
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.730
you don't see where punches are coming. You don't see what's headgear.

171
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.980
You don't see what checks are coming. You don't see things coming.

172
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.200
So I would think that would be the same thing with those goggles.

173
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.970
<v 1>Swimmers goggles, I think.</v>

174
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.300
<v 0>With your peripheral. All those things would with your peripheral. Yeah.</v>

175
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.070
<v 1>No way you don't see anything coming. Okay. But.</v>

176
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.680
<v 0>Unless you trained with them on, if you trained with them on,</v>

177
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.060
maybe you could do it, but also.

178
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.950
<v 1>It used to, but it still cuts you down.</v>

179
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.920
<v 0>You could also just touch your goggles with their face and they would get their</v>

180
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:45.410
sweat all over your goggles and then you wouldn't be able to see as good.

181
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:45.740
Another.

182
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.690
<v 1>Good technique. Yeah. They're both.</v>

183
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.930
<v 0>Wearing goggles. So, so it's fair. But they would both do that. It would you up.</v>

184
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.070
You wouldn't be able to see that. Good.

185
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.530
But when you see what what's in front of you let's just fight.

186
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.850
Let's just cut the and put some gloves on and fight that.

187
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.060
If we're going to slap fight, let's just, let's just fight.

188
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.910
I want to be able to take you down strangling you.

189
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.850
This is nonsense for salmon in the eye and smear smear in each other's.

190
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.200
<v 1>Got anything we've been in a just straight jujitsu fight between you and Louis.</v>

191
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.183
Cause he thinks him.

192
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.203
<v 0>That's hilarious.</v>

193
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.310
<v 1>He's watched over a hundred UFC fights.</v>

194
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.500
<v 0>He's a big fellow though. He is so fat. Probably get good at it. Yeah.</v>

195
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.580
<v 1>He's a big tough.</v>

196
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.390
<v 0>He could lay on you the way.</v>

197
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.320
<v 1>Three 30. He's lost a.</v>

198
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.190
<v 0>Little load. That's a.</v>

199
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.660
<v 1>Lot. He's also over 20 pounds.</v>

200
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.183
<v 0>No, he's not that big.</v>

201
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.780
<v 1>I don't think he's back. He's ballooned.</v>

202
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.900
<v 0>He trying to start a fight with him. No, I'm not. I'm just.</v>

203
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.560
<v 1>Saying he has balloon.</v>
