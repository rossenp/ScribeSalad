00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.800
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, so who are you voting for? No kidding.</v>

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.600
<v 0>I put a I'm joking.</v>

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.280
<v 1>H what? A whirlwind you're in, huh? Strange.</v>

5
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.800
<v 0>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; strange to watch it take place cuz it's so it's so obvious</v>

6
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.720
what it is. It's uh,

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.320
I know they're using me to make him look bad that he

8
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.590
supports me or that he used my endorsement. Right.

9
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.750
I had no idea they were gonna do that. Either. The Bernie Sanders people just,

10
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.750
and all I said is I'm probably gonna vote for him. Right. I said, I like TSI,

11
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:32.670
Gabbard. I really love her. I love him. I love Andrew Yang.

12
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.030
Those are the people that I think like, and look, here's,

13
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:37.430
here's a really important point. I'm a moron.

14
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.540
If you're basing who you're gonna vote for on president for,

15
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.380
for president based on mine. Right? Like what I, like, I know I'm not,

16
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.140
I'm not that balls deep into this stuff. Yeah. It is not, it's not,

17
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.740
I'm not the guy.

18
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.620
<v 1>It's very strange. And, and this is a little outta left field,</v>

19
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:54.540
but how much of this is based on your look,

20
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.460
if you were't a muscular baldheaded white guy, I don't know if this would be,

21
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.260
uh, I bet this would be a different.

22
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.850
<v 0>Game. &lt;affirmative&gt; what's easy to paint me as a doucheback. Right.</v>

23
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.690
And also it's what's really funny is the thing that I said in the video was

24
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:13.090
exactly what they did. I said, if you just take the worst aspects of someone,

25
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.130
take out everything else, magnify it. Right. And you know,

26
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:18.690
you could paint them out to be a real piece of. Of course I have 10.

27
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.523
<v 1>Texts today.</v>

28
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.160
<v 0>But I, what I said is that it's hard to do that with Bernie. Cause he's, ah,</v>

29
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.200
he's a really consistent guy. He's the real deal. He was out in.

30
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.280
<v 1>The front lines, in the sixties with the, the civil rights. Right. Getting.</v>

31
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.160
<v 0>Changed. Yeah. To people and getting arrested. Yeah. Right. He was, um,</v>

32
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.440
that doesn't mean he's gonna be a great president. I don't. No, of course.

33
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.520
I don't know. What's required to be a president. I really don't.

34
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:39.480
And I don't understand.

35
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.950
What's required to make sure the economy functions correctly. And also,

36
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.550
I don't understand what's in required to make the military function correctly.

37
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.390
No, it's just guesswork. I mean, maybe we're better off with Trump.

38
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.950
Maybe we're better off with someone else. I don't know.

39
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.590
But what was fascinating to me was that these people like CNN.

40
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.470
I printed something saying that I was homophobic and transphhobic,

41
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:04.980
and there's a clip that they're using. That's completely outta context.

42
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.780
That there's the only look as far as trans people,

43
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.140
some trans people listening to this.

44
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.580
I got nothing but love for you for everybody. And in fact,

45
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:16.100
Eddie Isard is one of my all time. Favorite guests. Oh loveard.

46
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.140
And he's one of the most inspirational and brilliant people I've ever met.

47
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.373
I love that guy.

48
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.370
And he's probably one of the most public trans people in the first,

49
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.570
most public celebrities to go trans mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't care. Nobody.

50
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.970
This had to do, but this had to do with fighting. This had to do with a man. Oh,

51
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.250
that's what, this was what I was saying.

52
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.850
And the video that they're using was me saying you're a man,

53
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.970
definitely shouldn't use those words, but this is why I was upset.

54
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.770
There was a guy, um,

55
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.240
this person was a man for were 30 years.

56
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.720
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; transitioned to become a woman for two years and then

57
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.120
started fighting women in MMA.

58
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.480
And didn't tell them mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that she used to be a man. Ah,

59
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.480
and was smashing girls. Sure. She broke, literally broke this girl's skull. Mm.

60
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.040
Like broke her face and was kind of bragging about it. Like she was, you know,

61
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.480
she was hping up her MMA career. Right? Yeah.

62
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.200
And then people found out that she was a trans woman and she used to be a man.

63
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.040
And she said that she didn't have to disclose that because it was a medical

64
00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:18.320
procedure. Oh. And it had nothing to do. It wasn't their, their business there.

65
00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:20.870
She 80, I was like. And now here's the thing.

66
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.710
If she disclosed it and everyone knew I'm a hundred percent in favor of it.

67
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.030
If you wanna do that,

68
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:30.990
if you're a woman and it's your choice to fight a trans woman and see how you

69
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:33.910
do. And in fact, a woman who eventually went and fought in the UFC,

70
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.470
a girl named Ashley, Evan Smith. Who's a really good fighter.

71
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.790
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, you know, UFC, caliber fighter,

72
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.100
a unlike this other woman who was the trans woman,

73
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.900
that trans woman was just really strong. Yeah.

74
00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:46.180
She wasn't the same caliber as a world class martial arts, Ashley,

75
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:49.220
Evan Smith actually wound up beating her. Oh yeah. Yes. And then,

76
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.860
and then she fought in the UFC afterwards.

77
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.980
Uh-huh can we see a photo of this gal? It's not, oh, I just wanna know.

78
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.780
Does it look like a dude? Little,

79
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.890
they couldn't tell skilling woman. Okay. You know? Well, when,

80
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:05.410
when he was a dude, he looked like a, a guy, right? Like a bro. Yeah.

81
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.010
And then when he became a woman, he looked, you know, like a, yeah,

82
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:13.090
definitely. You could say he was a woman, a dude, lady. But I, you know,

83
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.530
I was like the outta here. You're a man. And so they,

84
00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:19.450
they taken that he's so transphobic, like not, I'm not listen.

85
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.720
This is want people to get hurt. This has only to do with athletics.

86
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.041
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

87
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:26.240
that's it in terms of your gender identity and who you are and what you wanna

88
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.640
do. I don't care. And specifically my wheelhouse, which is fighting,

89
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.240
there is a gigantic physical advantage that men have in that,

90
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.840
in that particular sport. Well,

91
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:36.840
we all know that when a guy hits a girl in the street,

92
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:38.880
there's a different vibe than when a girl hits a guy.

93
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.910
That's the problem is that's what the fights look like.

94
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.430
The fights of like a guy hitting a girl. And he's, you know,

95
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.950
also fighting people that aren't that skilled. It's a low level MMA promotion.

96
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:51.750
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know, and then when it came out,

97
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:52.590
there was all this outrage.

98
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.870
But what was really fascinating was how many people were mad at me,

99
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.390
but didn't have an equal amount of,

100
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.700
there was there weret aren't equally upset that this woman was deceptive. Well,

101
00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:07.740
you can't about the fact that she was trans it's bad for the cause. Right?

102
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.020
Right. Cause you're really in supportive transgender people.

103
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.660
It's very bad for the cause.

104
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.740
If you have a transgender woman that doesn't disclose she's transgender and is

105
00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:18.580
beating the at a biological woman and here's the big, well,

106
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:19.740
here's one of the big problems with it.

107
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:24.650
Ultimately the ones who get over are biological women in this whole race

108
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.170
to be woke mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and including transgender women in female

109
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.770
sports, biological women are the ones getting over, right?

110
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:34.850
When these trans women are winning world records and, and, and,

111
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.570
and becoming world champions. And it's, you know,

112
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.770
it is this it's where the rubber meets the road between pragmatic

113
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.200
objective people that are analyzing the, all the,

114
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.320
the facts and people who wanna stick with a woke ideology.

115
00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:49.480
And they don't want to hear it on the other side.

116
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.840
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so this is the big one that people are calling me out on.

117
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:55.400
Right? The other one is like the homophobia one is like, come on, man, look,

118
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.680
I have nothing but love for gay people. Nothing but love. I love gay people,

119
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.720
but I make fun of them. I make fun of me. I make fun of my mom.

120
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.240
I'll make fun of you when you're here. I'll make fun of you when you leave.

121
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.920
Sure. Doesn't mean I don't love '. Right. Like I was saying before,

122
00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:13.200
one of my most popular memes online is in support of gay marriage. And it was,

123
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.190
it says, if you, if you had eight gay marriage,

124
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.470
it is because of one or two reasons,

125
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:21.310
either you're dumb or you're secretly worried that are delicious.

126
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.310
&lt;laugh&gt; and that has been shared millions of times. In fact,

127
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.270
I had a gay strong man in here. I saw that. Yeah.

128
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.230
And he was the world's strongest gay.

129
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.750
And he was talking about Rob Careney was talking about how hilarious he thought

130
00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:34.050
that was.

131
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.020
And he had seen that it's one of the first exposures that he had to me. Yeah.

132
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.140
<v 1>Well, they're just looking for to pin to you. That's.</v>

133
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.660
<v 0>All it's to it's to marginalize him.</v>

134
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.100
And it's also people that don't want anyone who's not woke to

135
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.660
represent anything on the left. Yeah. If you're gonna be on the left,

136
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:52.820
there's a lot of people. Well, there's a, first of all,

137
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.940
I should say this before I say anything about the blowback.

138
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.410
Uh-oh the positive side. Like the support that I've gotten from people,

139
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.570
because this has been overwhelming and really heartwarming mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

140
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:06.810
from so many from great comics and scientists and people that have had on the

141
00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:07.180
podcast.

142
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.890
Psychology today wrote an article about how the media is gaslighting you

143
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.450
on me. Yeah. Like they're like,

144
00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:15.050
they're trying to paint this guy out to be this monster.

145
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.810
Like have I said stupid. A hundred percent.

146
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:23.040
I've done 1400 plus podcasts. A lot of 'em high, like a giant percentage of,

147
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.120
I said a bunch of stupid. I couldn't even believe while saying it.

148
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.000
I like to say inappropriate words. I do it all the time. Same. Why?

149
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:31.800
Because it's fun. Yes. Because we're comics and, but it might.

150
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.360
<v 1>Hurt some people. Yeah. But some people like it.</v>

151
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.360
<v 0>I like, I like saying words. You're not supposed to say sometimes. Yeah.</v>

152
00:07:36.361 --> 00:07:39.030
But it it's doesn't mean I'm ho obic no.

153
00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:43.590
Or racist or sexist or misogynist Dick or transphobic these things. Aren't true.

154
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.110
I love everybody. Like literally, if you're a nice person, I will love you.

155
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:49.190
Yeah. I'm, I'm cool with.

156
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.150
<v 1>Everybody. The weird thing is they want it to be true.</v>

157
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.790
Why it's not even about the justice or helping people.

158
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.550
It's about nailing a guy down.

159
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.870
It feels more like vindictive and we want to hurt you than it does.

160
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.140
Let's save the world. It's more like, if you go, I'm actually not. They go, ah,

161
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:03.650
whatever.

162
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.220
<v 0>Well, there's a couple things going on. One.</v>

163
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.100
This podcast gotten way too big and it actually can influence elections. Oh.

164
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.340
<v 1>That's real. That's do you like that? That's.</v>

165
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.173
<v 0>Terrifying. No, it's not good.</v>

166
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.060
I don't think I want to have anything to do with politics. Not to.

167
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.893
<v 1>This. I'm the same. I'm sorry.</v>

168
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.260
<v 0>Ask the question. No, but I like rather talk to you. Okay.</v>

169
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.330
I'd rather talk to someone like you than ever talk about this and have

170
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.290
politicians on. And I've never voted.

171
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.610
No know whether or not they're full of or not. Congratulations.

172
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.010
<v 1>I've never, I don't know anything about politics. I don't follow it. Good.</v>

173
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:30.770
People are obsessed. It's taken over too much time in your day.

174
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:33.410
It burns too many calories and people get so passionate about it.

175
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.170
It's all changing. And it's all silly. I would love.

176
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.730
<v 0>If they revamped the system and made it. So there was a,</v>

177
00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:43.320
like a council of really smart people who yes. Who get to decide on things.

178
00:08:43.321 --> 00:08:44.020
Think tank.

179
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.760
<v 1>Yes. Get the smartest people in here exactly. Are not.</v>

180
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.560
<v 0>The most likable. Exactly. And get em fed,</v>

181
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.000
give em at least a micro dose of mushrooms before they make their decisions.

182
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.440
&lt;laugh&gt; I mean.

183
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.240
<v 1>Obama hated gay marriage, but we all like him.</v>

184
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.120
I don't dont think he hated Don gay marriage or he was against it. He was.

185
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.920
<v 0>Doing that for political reasons because he was trying to attract a certain</v>

186
00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:02.840
amount of people that were on the right. And it's, it's a ploy. Right?

187
00:09:02.841 --> 00:09:04.840
They have to play their hands carefully. They're playing chess.

188
00:09:04.841 --> 00:09:05.720
What's giveifferent.

189
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.200
<v 1>Palm what'snce though. He could have swayed the leg. I mean, he was, uh,</v>

190
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.240
in charge of. So he couldn't make policies. Well.

191
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.150
<v 0>Hillary Clinton didn't believe in gay marriage until 2013. There you go.</v>

192
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.630
But it's weird. It's but it's not real. It's they're in their world.

193
00:09:19.631 --> 00:09:22.510
That's what it is. The world of politics. They're giving up paw.

194
00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:24.750
They're making a concession. Right? Exactly.

195
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.910
And so what this is is take me down to make Bernie look bad.

196
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:34.510
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because Bernie dared to post one of my videos in the

197
00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:37.580
meantime, Bernie has searched to number one in the polls. Oh, is that right?

198
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.940
Yes. He's number one in the polls.

199
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:42.220
And number one for the first time in the bettingdding polls a-ha so it's like,

200
00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:43.580
look, I don't know if it's good or bad.

201
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.220
<v 1>Well, it's like Chappelle, everybody hates Chappelle.</v>

202
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.860
He's the transphobic guy of the year,

203
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.780
whatever he's won the Grammy three years in a row for best comedy album.

204
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.860
And he just won the mark Twain award. So it's like,

205
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.050
we talk a big game and we complain in and my own. But I think the,

206
00:09:57.051 --> 00:09:58.130
the real out there.

207
00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.130
<v 0>Well, even more,</v>

208
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.250
more telling when rotten tomatoes only let five woke critics, right.

209
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.010
&lt;laugh&gt; judge his special, he had a 0% on RO tomatoes. Exactly.

210
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:11.730
Then when they let the general public do it, it jumped up to 90, 90%. Yeah.

211
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:13.570
Which is unheard of. I know. And.

212
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.240
<v 1>Why does anybody go? This is weird, right? I mean, we do it, but you know, the,</v>

213
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:20.440
the people with the big voices and the loudest people are all going, oh, well,

214
00:10:20.441 --> 00:10:22.080
whatcha are you gonna do? They never chime in on.

215
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.560
<v 0>That. Well, the, but right now you are one of the loudest people right now. Oh.</v>

216
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.040
And here's the other thing that's terrify.

217
00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:31.160
Those people that are the other loudest people out there are all being employed

218
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.480
by giant companies. Ah, is that what it is now?

219
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:36.440
If you're a part of a giant media company, we don't even have to say any,

220
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.390
you have to make arrangements with political parties and

221
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:46.550
candidates. They will give you access to candidates, but they in exchange,

222
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:48.470
they would like you to run certain stories. Mm.

223
00:10:48.471 --> 00:10:49.630
They would like you to cover things.

224
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.110
They would like you to not cover other things. I mean,

225
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:55.710
you're seeing this anti- Bernie Sanders push. Yeah. Across the board.

226
00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:59.940
Hillary Clinton just came out and said that she thinks she, nobody likes him.

227
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.060
I saw that. She said that, why would you say that the guy campaigned for you?

228
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.660
<v 1>What are you an eight year old? Nobody.</v>

229
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.140
<v 0>Likes him. Exactly. And she said that he's a career politician. Like,</v>

230
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.450
Hmm.

231
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:11.170
<v 1>What does that mean?</v>

232
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.980
<v 0>Were you involved in industry before this? Like,</v>

233
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.330
did you manufacture televisions? Like what did you do before? Right. Well,

234
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.250
you you're a lawyer for a little bit. Okay.

235
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.570
&lt;laugh&gt; aren't you a clear career politician and your husband's clearly a career

236
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:28.450
politician like this crazy thing to say mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, and then,

237
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:29.160
you know,

238
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.890
there's like a lot of people that are in support of Elizabeth Warren that were

239
00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:37.410
trying to push the narrative that Bernie Sanders is sexist. This,

240
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:40.840
this helps that narrative come on because Elizabeth Warren was saying that she

241
00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:43.120
said that he had said to her that a woman could never be president.

242
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.400
Did you ever see that inter exchange where the two of 'em were on CNN?

243
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.520
I heard about it.

244
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.480
<v 1>I try not to watch anything.</v>

245
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.313
<v 0>Good for you.</v>

246
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.400
But so this is what it's been for me just to watch all this play out.

247
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:54.000
But this is the first time I've seen.

248
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.640
<v 1>You rattled, by the way. I've never you're you're usually cool. As a cucumber.</v>

249
00:11:56.641 --> 00:11:58.560
I, you look a little for CLE.

250
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.520
<v 0>I just wanna make sure that I say it the way I think it all right.</v>

251
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.640
Get it out. That's but that's why if I feel, if I look rattled,

252
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.680
but the positive thing, thank you.

253
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.910
The positive thing has been the outpouring of support by so many, many people.

254
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.590
Yes. It's been overwhelming. Like, and then the,

255
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.510
the support to negative is the ratios. Incredible. So it's it's awesome. Well,

256
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:19.630
the.

257
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.950
<v 1>Good news is everyone who knows you likes you.</v>

258
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.750
All the people who are saying have probably never met you,

259
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.510
or don't even listen to the pod. But this is a well.

260
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.310
<v 0>Even listening to the podcast. You don't know me that well,</v>

261
00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:31.710
but this is a part of the problem with human beings,

262
00:12:31.711 --> 00:12:35.940
communicating through social media. Yes. Social media is the worst way,

263
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:40.020
like Twitter or so like that is the worst way to either know someone express a

264
00:12:40.021 --> 00:12:43.220
feeling or show any compassion mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and no one,

265
00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:45.900
this is one of the reasons why cancel culture is so, right, right.

266
00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:49.060
Because this is the best way to cancel somebody through a tweet. you. Yeah.

267
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.540
Look at how many comics did that with Louis. Yeah.

268
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.050
After Louis CCK thing went down on, there was a bunch of comics that were like,

269
00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:56.890
now it's my chance. Right? I'm gonna move up the ladder.

270
00:12:56.891 --> 00:13:00.130
And Tim Dillon posted this awesome Instagram post about that.

271
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.090
Like recognizing that Uh-huh like, I see what, this is.

272
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.730
A lot of these people that are virtue signaling these insanely mediocre UN

273
00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:06.690
talented comedians.

274
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.970
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; that, uh, tends to be,</v>

275
00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:10.890
you don't see Michelle Wolf for michaelche and all this. Exactly. Exactly.

276
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.760
<v 0>Especially when the, um, the leaked audio came out, people like this is,</v>

277
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.600
oh, he's leaning into it. He's HES. You know, he's Al right now, like, listen,

278
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.560
that hurt me. Feeling CK has always said the most inappropriate. That's funny.

279
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.760
I know, go back. And you guys don't even fans.

280
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.680
<v 1>Well, when you tweet there's the, the remorse is much smaller.</v>

281
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.280
Like canceling a guide. Oh, through the computer.

282
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.150
You're not gonna feel as much guilt and shame and meanness. You don't feel,

283
00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:36.470
you don't.

284
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.430
<v 0>Feel anything. It's a keyboard. You don't feel anything.</v>

285
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.870
I'm hoping that social media will evolve to something that you,

286
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.710
that people that somehow or another allow people to be more compassionate to

287
00:13:46.711 --> 00:13:46.930
each other.

288
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.790
Or maybe we'll just understand how to use it better and understand consequence.

289
00:13:49.791 --> 00:13:51.950
Maybe when everybody gets canceled. Right. Everybody.

290
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.630
<v 1>Right. Well, it's like, you can't drink and drive,</v>

291
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.100
but you can drink and tweeted. Yeah. You know, which is way almost, you know,

292
00:13:58.101 --> 00:14:01.140
it's career suicide instead of, you know, auto.

293
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.500
<v 0>Do we know the jsine SA story? She's.</v>

294
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.020
<v 1>Is that the aids chick? Yes. John stopley. Yeah. That's amazing.</v>

295
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.500
<v 0>She was on her way to Africa. She was, uh, on,</v>

296
00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.980
I think she took an Ambien and she was drinking. Yeah. Yeah. And she's like, uh,

297
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.610
going to Africa. I hope I don't get aids. Right. Just kidding. On white LOL.

298
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.770
&lt;laugh&gt; that's a good tweet. It's a good joke.

299
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:23.650
It's a joke of Mark Norman joke in a lot of ways. Thank you.

300
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.930
It is in a lot of ways. Right.

301
00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:26.410
It's kind of like something that you would say as.

302
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.290
<v 1>A joke. I get, I Don know if I'd go at the white angle, but I like it.</v>

303
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.410
What would you say instead of white? Cause white people do get aids,

304
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:35.050
so it doesn't really do make sense logically. Right. But when you're on.

305
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:38.080
<v 0>Ambien and you're liquored up. Oh, ambient man,</v>

306
00:14:38.081 --> 00:14:40.720
you only have a couple minutes before the flight takes off and you lose &lt;laugh&gt;

307
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.573
you lose cellular.
