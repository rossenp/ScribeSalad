00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well.</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.540
<v 1>Okay, so we're fast forwarding to noon.</v>

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.560
<v 0>Okay. Give me a radio.</v>

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.250
<v 1>On a non radio day. Non radio day. I get up at seven.</v>

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.870
I get up at seven. I go upstairs soldier. I make coffee.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.910
I get one cup of coffee. Do you.

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.040
<v 0>Play classical music softly once.</v>

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.873
<v 1>In a while? Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.400
<v 0>Usually I picture you OCD butter and your toast.</v>

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.730
<v 1>No, I don't. I don't eat straight away.</v>

11
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:32.850
It's just straight black coffee into the office.

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.410
I have an office and I try and write. I sit at the desk,

13
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:42.180
I call it going into the shop and I sit there and I write and I make sure that

14
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.720
there's no appointments until noon.

15
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.630
Anything that I'm going to do. I don't do until noon.

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.440
Except if I'm going to go for a run or work out,

17
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.570
I'll put in a couple hours. And then when I start to fade I'll, uh,

18
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.820
I'll uh, go for a run and then come back and continue. Oh, I skipped something.

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.990
No, sorry. Uh, before the coffee,

20
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.140
if I'm up early enough and the house isn't up,

21
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.110
I'll meditate first for 20 minutes before you even right before

22
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.470
coffee before I right. Really? Yeah. Wake up water in the face.

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.060
Maybe brush teeth up into the office and then take 20 right away,

24
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.270
because it's more restful than sleep.

25
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.960
So even if you had like a bad night's sleep or you're tossing or whatever was

26
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:35.700
going on, you're now ready to, to go through the day.

27
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.270
What.

28
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.370
<v 0>Kind of meditation are you doing? TM.</v>

29
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.920
<v 1>Transcendental meditation.</v>

30
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.470
<v 0>Transcendental meditation. There.</v>

31
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.930
There's a weird thing about that. Right? Some people think it's kind of culty.

32
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.220
It's not culty. It's.

33
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.310
<v 1>Not called it. There's no, there's no leaders. Right.</v>

34
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.050
<v 0>But it wasn't there. Um,</v>

35
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.580
wasn't there some controversy with TM awhile back? I think so. No,

36
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.650
my misconstruing. It was something else. Yeah.

37
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.370
<v 1>Yeah. No, th that's why I like I'm, I'm very into it.</v>

38
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.470
I'm doing it for a long time. It's great. I, but I don't, I like yoga.

39
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.640
I was like all that kind of stuff.

40
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.440
And unless you get a little hippy dippy with it and a little too preachy,

41
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.150
and then I'm out. Yeah, me too.

42
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.440
And this is totally basic simple.

43
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.610
When I was taught it, there was nothing like hippy-dippy flaky about.

44
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.090
<v 0>No one spent that hippie DB flaky. It's only,</v>

45
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:34.890
it only feels if the person's not really living that life and you can kind of

46
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:39.390
feel it kind of bullshitting. There was this guy used to take classes from St.

47
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.720
Louis. Peter is from South Africa. And I only took his classes a few times,

48
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:46.260
but he was like one of those genuinely spiritual people.

49
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.820
And we would say these things,

50
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:51.270
and you could tell he wasn't trying to manipulate you or

51
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.220
[inaudible]

52
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.220
, or he wasn't trying to you that's. Yeah. And then there was another guy that I used to take classes with. It, it felt like he was always bullshitting. Right? Always. It was so annoying. And he 

53
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.053
went up banging this other dude's wife and he came a giant disaster. The guy.

54
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.280
<v 1>With the acoustic guitar making eye contact with. So funny.</v>

55
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.980
<v 0>You say that he would sing singing clashes.</v>

56
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.550
<v 1>Of course, of course. No. There's you can, you can smell it.</v>

57
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.940
And that's why I had a hard time with yoga until I found this one teacher and

58
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:21.340
she was just great. And it's the same thing with.

59
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.310
<v 0>Here. It is cult controversy or something a while ago. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.850
Okay. Yeah. With TM, can we make that a little larger? I can barely read that.

61
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.540
Yeah. That's.

62
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.373
<v 1>Really small.</v>

63
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.050
<v 0>What, but say the organization organization had been,</v>

64
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:38.980
the subject of controversy is labeled a cult by several parliamentary inquiries

65
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.230
or anti-cop movements of the world.

66
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.430
Some also should adjust the TM it's movement or not a cult.

67
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.850
The TM movement has been characterized in a variety of ways,

68
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:53.200
has been called the spiritual movement, a new religious movement, a millennia,

69
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:57.940
Erin [inaudible] article,

70
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:01.270
world affirming world affirming movement, social movement,

71
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:02.560
a GRU centered movement.

72
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.890
How a new book exposes the dark side of trans gentlemen.

73
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.500
<v 1>The education. I don't even understand where you would have,</v>

74
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.680
like where it would happen. Like there's no place to.

75
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.650
<v 0>Go, honestly, ignorant of it. So explain it to us. Yeah.</v>

76
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.990
<v 1>There's nothing. It's very, you know,</v>

77
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.240
I tried meditating in all these different ways and this was,

78
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.520
this kind of made it very simple.

79
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.160
<v 0>It's doesn't just Seinfeld do this too. Yes.</v>

80
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.850
<v 1>Yeah. He's actually the one that, that got me into it. And for a long time,</v>

81
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:31.030
I was thinking, well, I meditate. I count breaths. I'd kind of do it.

82
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:34.430
Then I wasn't really feeling, maybe I was, I was,

83
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.060
I always had my head that maybe TM is different. Maybe,

84
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.950
maybe going and learning that would kind of dial it in a little bit classes on

85
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:45.940
it. So I took four classes, went and saw this guy, um,

86
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.860
hearing California and just go for an hour for four

87
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:55.540
days in a row. And he teaches you what to do it. And the analogy is that,

88
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.370
uh, there's this,

89
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.110
the reality is just in this tumultuous ocean

90
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.800
waves. We're on the top. We're on the surface. That's where we live.

91
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.140
And this is just a way through a mantra to get you down below the waves to

92
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:13.270
sit for 20 minutes.

93
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.040
And it's very freeing because there's no, there's no controlling your mind.

94
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:22.360
There's no forcing it to come back and count breaths. There's no, you're never,

95
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.260
you're not, you're not, uh, thinking about what you have to do.

96
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.260
You just do the mantra, do the mantra and then let it go.

97
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.410
And if your brain starts thinking about work and thinks about work,

98
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.270
if it starts thinking about your wife, it's we just let it be, let it be,

99
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.104
let it be.

100
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.300
And 20 minutes you pop out of it and you feel

101
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.330
not right away. I don't feel changed immediately. Like I'll feel I,

102
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:52.660
you know, I have an apple watch and my heart rate is low.

103
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.400
Like it's 40 to 50.

104
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.860
<v 0>All the time. Or when you're doing, when I'm doing that, how much is it?</v>

105
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:00.710
Normally? Probably like 80. What's it right now.

106
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.290
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

107
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.980
<v 0>How long does it take to find that out? It's going to take awhile. Hey Siri.</v>

108
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.060
It's at 80 80. Yeah. And you get down to 40 when you get TM. Yeah.

109
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.190
<v 1>Oh yeah. It's very calming. And it just kind of like gives your nervous system,</v>

110
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.790
uh, a respite. That's pretty heavy. It's pretty great.

111
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.880
It gives me a lot of energy. Activate.

112
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.470
<v 0>Siri. Hey Siri.</v>

113
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.440
<v 1>Siri.</v>

114
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.273
<v 0>It didn't catch this.</v>

115
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.640
Area's a pain now people right now screaming at me because their car is gone.

116
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.080
What would you like me to do?

117
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.250
<v 1>Yeah, but I don't feel it like right away, but, but like,</v>

118
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.740
I'll notice it hours later that I have more energy, like.

119
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.050
<v 0>I'm still going, what is the process? How do you do it? I just sit.</v>

120
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.850
And what's the mantra. Uh.

121
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.650
<v 1>Everyone has an individual mantra. Tell us.</v>

122
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.090
<v 0>Your mantra. I can't come on, bro. What if someone's a gigantic Tom Papa fan.</v>

123
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:54.800
They want you to want to do everything that you do.

124
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.620
<v 1>Oh, that's true. It's jelly beans.</v>

125
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.580
<v 0>That's what you say now.</v>

126
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.750
<v 1>Yeah. It's just a noise.</v>

127
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.120
<v 0>It might be weird if you just kept saying Jerry Seinfeld.</v>

128
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.493
<v 1>Sour dough.</v>

129
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.710
<v 0>This is how it would be cool. It's Howard's delicious food,</v>

130
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.260
but it wouldn't be nearly as weird. Something about Brad, Garrett.

131
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.390
Yeah. Brad, Garrett.

132
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.670
Yeah. It's really weird. Right?

133
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.770
<v 1>So I'm tout. So I do it first thing in the morning, 20 minutes.</v>

134
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.170
And then sometime in the late afternoon.

135
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.720
<v 0>All you do is you sit and you just change your mantra in my mind and you don't</v>

136
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:46.100
say it out loud. Okay.

137
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.880
So as you're just repeating the mantra in your mind,

138
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:52.520
you just try to stay on path of just keeping it.

139
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.630
<v 1>And when I don't try and stay on a path, I don't force anything.</v>

140
00:07:56.631 --> 00:07:57.620
I just keep saying it.

141
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.040
<v 0>But if your brain tells you to trick you and say, Hey Tom,</v>

142
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.500
I got a really great idea for a new bit. Do let it happen. Let it go.

143
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.663
<v 1>It's okay.</v>

144
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.170
<v 0>To write the bit down. Or do you go back to no, whoa. You're risking it all.</v>

145
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.140
<v 1>I'm not that great of a comedian. So those things don't happen.</v>

146
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.130
<v 0>Yeah. I been laying in bed and I was too tired to get up.</v>

147
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.070
And I would w I'd say, I'm going to remember you remember that? Yeah,

148
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.480
I definitely didn't.

149
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.080
<v 1>No. And, uh, and yeah,</v>

150
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.680
20 minutes and I'm telling you, it, it,

151
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.230
my one friend described it as it's adds another four hours to your day. Wow.

152
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.990
And it's really true when I, when you call me today,

153
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.360
last minute to come in, I took 20 before I came, because I was dragging,

154
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.450
I went for a run this morning. I meditated this morning,

155
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:49.460
but then I went for a run. I came back,

156
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:54.130
I was writing and you call and you're like, can you come on over?

157
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.040
I was like, yeah, that's cool.

158
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:59.490
But let me drop for 15 minutes before I get in the car.

159
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.210
<v 0>Once we did he meditated for 15 minutes. Yep. Wow. Do you do that before sets.</v>

160
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.210
<v 1>If I'm tired. Yeah. Like it's towards the end of the day.</v>

161
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:09.960
And I've got something that, you know, at night that's a little later.

162
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.810
<v 0>Does it help you make decisions? Yes.</v>

163
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.530
How did you still make the decision to do a radio show at seven in the morning?

164
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.650
<v 1>Because I'm not afraid of it because I know that I can meditate and I'll</v>

165
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:23.940
have energy. How many days a week?

166
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.290
I don't have to worry about getting a good night's sleep ever. No, that's crazy.

167
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.200
I can meditate and then I'll be okay for the show. That's.

168
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.270
<v 0>Crazy. I can't do that. Yes, you can.</v>

169
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.553
<v 1>You should go.</v>

170
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.240
<v 0>You should go.</v>

171
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:36.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

172
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.940
<v 0>Really? Yeah. I'd love to, I'll hook you up with the guy.</v>

173
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.070
Can I just watch a YouTube video and that good enough.

174
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.890
Now I've learned so much from YouTube though. Have you? Yes.

175
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.443
<v 1>It's true.</v>

176
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.410
<v 0>Why can't you learn transcendental meditation for you to.</v>

177
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.530
<v 1>You know, what, there's this mystery about it.</v>

178
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.840
And I would research it and I was like, maybe what? Like,

179
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:58.980
why can't I just learn it mystery. The only difference is having this man,

180
00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:02.430
explain it to you. It kind of dials it in.

181
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:06.840
And I went back once since I learned it initially, just to kind of tune up,

182
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.110
tune up. There's not that much, but it's just, you know,

183
00:10:10.111 --> 00:10:11.460
they give you a little bit, you know,

184
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:13.050
it's like playing tennis or something and they're like, no,

185
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:16.440
just hold it like this. Oh, right. Okay. Or like in yoga. And they're like,

186
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.650
you think you're doing this, but your elbows are out.

187
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.420
<v 0>That's big in yoga. Like sometimes the instructor will give you one thing.</v>

188
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:25.860
She'll say one thing about your,

189
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.590
the way you're standing or the way you keep your weight. And you're like,

190
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.450
oh man. And you just change it just slightly. Oh my gosh. So much.

191
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.600
<v 1>I know which you never would have learned at home.</v>

192
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.460
So it's kind of a similar thing. And, uh, it just, uh,

193
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.950
an over time. So that's what it is on a daily basis. But over time, it's,

194
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.080
uh, it makes you more chill. Things.

195
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:55.230
Don't bother me the way they used to bother me.

196
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.190
Just day to day aggravations, normal.

197
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.450
There's it's it's um, you,

198
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.270
you slowly transform without realizing it. Do.

199
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.150
<v 0>You know, um, who Dan Harris is Sam.</v>

200
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.320
<v 1>Harris, Dan.</v>

201
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.400
<v 0>Harris. Dan Harris.</v>

202
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.180
<v 1>From.</v>

203
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.120
<v 0>No ABC from what is the show? Nightline.</v>

204
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.033
<v 1>That sounds right.</v>

205
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.210
<v 0>Is that what he's on? Anyway, he'd been on the podcast for a really nice guy.</v>

206
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:22.290
He's got a Nightline,

207
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:27.570
he's got an app called 10% happier and it's just a meditation app.

208
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.700
And he wants people to know that it's been super beneficial to him.

209
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.780
So he talks about it often.

210
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.360
He talked about it on my podcast and he actually used the tank.

211
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.030
He's the only guy. Yeah. He's the only guy other than me. That's overused.

212
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.850
<v 1>That tank. I want to use the tank. Okay. This.</v>

213
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.090
<v 0>Was a weird thing for it to everybody. But Dan Harris is the only one that said.</v>
