00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How'd you feel about, um,</v>

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.330
about the Olympics banning, uh, Shakeri Richardson.

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.370
<v 1>A hundred percent horseshit. First of all,</v>

4
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:14.610
I think the Olympics are disgusting because that lady should be getting paid

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.610
millions of dollars. All of them should be getting paid millions of dollars,

6
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:19.710
all the winners of the gold medals, all those,

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:23.040
all those people that are generating insane amounts of wealth for the Olympics,

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.840
they should get a giant piece of that.

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.900
They're responsible for the reason why people are watching the Olympics, right?

10
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.850
No one is watching the Olympics because it's the Olympics.

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.780
The Washington live is because you see the best athletes on the world, right?

12
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.400
You see the best athletes who have gone through all these competitions and reach

13
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:41.460
this insane pinnacle of their skill development. Right?

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.630
And they're getting nothing,

15
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.200
they're getting zero and the whole world's watching and they're selling crazy

16
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:50.250
advertisement and that money's being generated and the networks are making it

17
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:52.980
and the IOC is making it. And all these other people are making it.

18
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.660
And the athletes, the whole reason people are tuning in, they get nothing.

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.820
It's insane. It's a disgusting corrupt system. Gross.

20
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.180
<v 0>That's of course the cities that they move into, like once they gone,</v>

21
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.890
they fall the apart. Oh yeah.

22
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.470
<v 1>Yeah. Well, it's a lot of times, you know, these countries,</v>

23
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:15.330
they build up this whole thing for the Olympics and they're incentivized and

24
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:17.190
there's a lot of money that flows into the city.

25
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.230
And then once they pull out of that, I mean,

26
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.120
the people that live in that country, like, Hey,

27
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.820
why didn't you spend that on infrastructure?

28
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:27.480
Why don't you spend that to fix the bridges in the streets and to, you know,

29
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:31.530
to fix these communities. But there's no money in that.

30
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.530
I don't give a about these dirty, but I,

31
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.300
I think it's infuriating that this lady who is, uh, apparently like she's a,

32
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.370
shoo-in for the gold medal in the a hundred meters,

33
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.030
she's supposed to be spectacular and they're not going to let her run that,

34
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.850
but they're going to let her run the relay, like.

35
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.010
<v 0>You. Oh, they gonna let her run.</v>

36
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.830
<v 1>They're going to let her go. Yeah. Because if she doesn't run the relay,</v>

37
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:54.960
America probably doesn't win. I mean, I don't know.

38
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:58.770
I don't know Jack about track and field she's kept off. What? Yeah.

39
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.590
What do you mean exclusion from the relay team? Yeah, I saw that last night. Oh,

40
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:02.424
this is new.

41
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.640
<v 0>She's not on the team, but for we for weed.</v>

42
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.090
<v 1>It's so dumb. It's so dumb. It's so dumb. Look,</v>

43
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:13.980
if they caught her doing steroids or EPO. Okay. I get it. Okay. But man,

44
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:15.630
there was a lot of people accusing her steroids.

45
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.630
There was like a lot of people accusing her of a conspiracy.

46
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.280
So the reason why she smoked weed was so that she could get caught for weed and

47
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:24.540
not get caught for steroids.

48
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:29.520
Like I was reading this I'm like you people can't just look at

49
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:30.570
things for what they are.

50
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.290
Everyone has to like look things like with this conspiracy theory lens.

51
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.580
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, that's just, that's just idiots. Like people that,</v>

52
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.580
that pedal and conspiracies and room it's like,

53
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:46.110
they it's a substitute for doing the work to become actually

54
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:48.690
intelligent. If you just say the opposite of what everyone's saying.

55
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.490
<v 1>It is however track and field apparently has been</v>

56
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.810
one of the dirtiest sports. Like they've been cheating from the jump.

57
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.470
Apparently like most countries cheat.

58
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.650
They try to figure out a way to juice their athletes up,
