00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 2>If you look at a lot of my losses,</v>

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.220
I would load up and put my head first and like, well,

4
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.063
why am I going to give you my.

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.700
<v 1>I get back to the TJ fight, right? The two fights,</v>

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.410
those you were more emotionally invested in those fights than any fight you've

7
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:17.100
ever had, right?

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.310
<v 0>Yeah, definitely. And that's not me. I don't have to, Joe, I love the fight.</v>

9
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.830
I can fight in your studio right now. You know what I mean?

10
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:27.450
I'll kick Jamie's if his pants big of his pants earlier, you know,

11
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.820
but, uh, [inaudible] uh,

12
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.900
yeah, so I never like for me to go in there and kind of have that, you know,

13
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.850
just an example of that. I don't need to do that. Yeah. You know, and you know,

14
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.220
it was great. I was a world champion felt like I had to defend it.

15
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.780
A lot of other stuff, you know,

16
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.470
the backstory of it and the injury coming off a year, I was just so,

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.331
like I said,

18
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:54.210
not mentally ready to go in there and fight that physically was like

19
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.340
overcompensated for the emotions.

20
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.680
<v 1>Go into a fight with someone you don't like, it's always extremely difficult,</v>

21
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:05.100
but for you to go into a fight with someone you don't like who you used to be

22
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:07.410
tight with. Right. And you used to train with, right.

23
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.880
That's gotta be like doubly different.

24
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.920
<v 0>That's all I say. I didn't, didn't like TJ,</v>

25
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:14.250
I don't agree with a lot of things that happen. Um,

26
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.030
but that's so far in the past that Neil passed that. But yeah,

27
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:20.490
I definitely taking that in there. It was my,

28
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.410
my mental state was not what it should have been to go in against a guy like

29
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:28.170
TJ, you know, and we can fast forward to where, you know,

30
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.380
he got popped and this and that TJ can be on that stuff.

31
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.790
He can be on that stuff.

32
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.980
And he still can't beat me when I'm focused and I'm mentally there and I'm in

33
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:40.590
there and I'm excited, you know, like, I'm glad that he's coming back.

34
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:42.060
He's got to prove to himself, you know,

35
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.580
and that's a big fight for me to come back to, you know,

36
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:47.100
in the future that's going to happen. You know?

37
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.640
And I feel like TJ caught me at a time where mentally I was not

38
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.410
in the best state of mind to go on there and be a champion.

39
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.200
And that's why I was taken from me. You know, I wasn't doing the right things,

40
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.620
you know, the slight edge things. I wasn't doing those. And, uh, you know,

41
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.710
he capitalized and, and I look back on it. I, I,

42
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.950
I kept going back in those slights and a little bit of insanity, you know,

43
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:10.650
you gotta be insane to repeat the same thing, thing in a different outcome.

44
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.830
And that's what I was doing in there. I was always train hard, always prepared,

45
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:18.450
ready, but what was, what was it? Wasn't nothing due then I needed to do.

46
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:20.700
It was just the slight, slight edge things,

47
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.160
little work this worked out and like, and looking back on it, it's, it's,

48
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.930
hindsight's 2020 always in a fight, but, uh, I'm thankful for that.

49
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:32.280
I have to feel like if I would have went off and defending the title and I

50
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:35.880
probably wouldn't have been as hungry and motivated as I am today and that's

51
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.610
going to help me out for the next five years of my career,

52
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:40.500
however long I want to fight for, you know,

53
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:45.080
I always kind of break my life down to five five-year increments, but, uh,

54
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:45.840
I'm excited for it.

55
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.300
I'm more hungry than ever because I know what it takes to get back to the top.

56
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.870
<v 1>When you said that you stopped visualizing for a long time and now you're doing</v>

57
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:56.430
it again. Are you doing it now in D do you have like a rigid format?

58
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:57.600
Do you have like a, uh,

59
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.470
do you have a disciplined format of visualization or do you just spend time

60
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.870
alone thinking about things? Like how do you do it?

61
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.850
<v 0>Um, yeah, I do do a format, write things out, write out goals three months,</v>

62
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.390
six months, a year, five years. What I want to accomplish was financial,

63
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:17.470
where I it's, you know, athletic, whites, personal growth, spiritual growth,

64
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.070
family growth, things like that. So I try to prioritize, um,

65
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.210
what I'm lacking or what's the lower grade than I give myself and try to focus

66
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:26.440
more on that. So it's all balanced.

67
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:29.470
I feel like I'm trying to balance my life more. As far as being,

68
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.640
I grew up in chaos, you know, I feel like I can, I do well on that,

69
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.640
but I'm at a different place in my life and what I want for my son and my

70
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:38.590
future. I want to have that balance of,

71
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.950
or you're not so a hundred percent in this and, you know, lacking this,

72
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:44.560
you know, I want to make sure it's kind of balanced across my goals,

73
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.450
but I feel like, you know,

74
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.760
going back to talking about getting out of your comfort zone,

75
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.070
like doing things that absolutely suck,

76
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.310
and you got to mentally put yourself in that position.

77
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.950
<v 1>Well, you, in your comfort zone, when you were a champion,</v>

78
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:00.190
like when you say getting out of your comfort zone, I know you trained hard.

79
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.050
So like, what is different? Right.

80
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.970
<v 0>I think that I removed myself after, um, winning the world title.</v>

81
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.780
I, I didn't feel like it was everything that I thought I was going to be in what

82
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:15.400
way? Just the whole prolific you're world champion.

83
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.960
You're the best in the world. You know, I didn't,

84
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.090
I never expected a lot of things that were happening,

85
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.970
but I just focuses on as you think it was going to be like, I don't know.

86
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.580
I don't think I had any expectations when I feel like a lot of things change

87
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:28.360
around. Oh man. Like, how does it feel like I'm still the same person.

88
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:29.200
I just kind of, you know,

89
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.160
I'm just a number one person in the world at what I do, you know? I don't know.

90
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:33.790
It just didn't.

91
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.940
<v 1>Did you think that like in achieving such a great goal,</v>

92
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.430
that you would feel satisfied that you would feel.

93
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.200
<v 0>I wasn't satisfied maybe, maybe. Cause that's what at the later then the tunnel,</v>

94
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.990
since I was 12 years old and I was man,

95
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:50.350
just through the journey of getting to where I was at looking back on it and I

96
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:53.860
was like, man, like, no, what's next. I didn't have the what's next.

97
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.121
<v 1>Isn't it interesting?</v>

98
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:57.670
Like this is the thing that gets brought up all the time about fighting.

99
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.720
Is that so much of it is mental, especially at the elite level,

100
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:02.620
like a year level.

101
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.360
So much of it is how you're approaching all aspects of your life,

102
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.760
how your relationship is going, how your friendships are going. Like, what,

103
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.800
what's your relationship with your family? You know,

104
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:17.080
that's so much of how a fight or flight.

105
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.730
And then what is your focus on is your focus on adulation?

106
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.110
Is your focus on doing interviews and letting everybody tell you you're the or

107
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:29.860
is your focus on continuous improvement? And then recognize that yeah,

108
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.270
you might be a world champion,

109
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:34.900
but there a bunch of hungry lions climbing up that hill to try to get to the

110
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.320
gang.

111
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.220
<v 0>Yeah. You, you see it? I have, you know, Chris Holdsworth, my coach, my trainer,</v>

112
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:42.760
my good friend. He travels with me, you know, we put through hard workouts,

113
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:45.700
you know, this morning we're going to, after your podcast. And that's the thing,

114
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:49.360
doing those balancing that, okay. I might have, you know, come on your show,

115
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.080
absolute honor. I got to train. I got to, you know, I can't take this week off,

116
00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:55.420
we're here. And you're looking at homes and doing other things with PMP,

117
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:59.180
my other business partner. So just prioritizing, what's important.

118
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:01.880
What your goal is, how you reaching those goals, what are you working towards?

119
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.820
Are you reading help books, self-help books, are you reading, you know,

120
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.090
books to help your, your mental fortitude to strengthen that? You know,

121
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:10.280
are you doing yoga? Are you doing other so much.

122
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.220
<v 1>And resource in staying enthusiastic, staying enthusiastic?</v>

123
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.580
<v 0>I think that's the main thing. I wasn't doozy.</v>

124
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:19.250
I felt like I was just going through the motions and there's a lot of other

125
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.400
things. There's a lot of things that can transpire,

126
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.360
but I'm slowly putting the blame on myself because that's all I can control what

127
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:27.980
I do, how I react to things.

128
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.240
And I wasn't the person that I am during those kinds of

129
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.430
tribulations or trials in my life, you know, and I've grown from that. I was 24,

130
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.360
25 years old. I'm 29 years old. Now, you know, I've looked at the game, um,

131
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.220
just differently.
