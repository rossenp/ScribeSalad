00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.160
<v 1>But, but it's a terrible thing. And obviously with, I mean, with these, uh,</v>

3
00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:10.000
school shootings and things that are going on here at the moment, I mean,

4
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:14.080
this is obviously, um, one of the things I watched your podcast the other day,

5
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:17.640
where you were discussing it with the latest one with the Florida. And, uh,

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.600
and I think the, you know,

7
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:23.350
the sort of in a away bafflement going on in this society about this is

8
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:24.184
understandable.

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.950
<v 2>Yeah. The, I mean,</v>

10
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.670
it's the unimaginable horror of being involved in that situation.

11
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:32.910
Your mind is just not prepared to cope with that. I mean,

12
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:35.910
maybe if you are a soldier and if you experience combat exactly.

13
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.230
And you know how to, uh,

14
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.710
stay calm in a firefighter because you've been in a bunch of them,

15
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.860
but for the average person, I mean,

16
00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:44.940
it's one of the reasons why eye witness testimony,

17
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.620
it's one of the worst pieces of evidence you could ever get, including, I mean,

18
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:51.460
about, about basically everything about fist fights to.

19
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.500
<v 1>You know, anything. Oh yeah, no, I mean,</v>

20
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:55.780
we all have examples in our own lives of seeing, you know,

21
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:57.460
friends who've been through the same thing.

22
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.420
We know that they burn through the same thing and yet they have two totally

23
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:01.260
different versions of.

24
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.050
<v 2>All course of what happened. I mean, that's, that's a real problem, but.</v>

25
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.730
<v 1>Now you have this thing here where, I mean, in some ways,</v>

26
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:09.930
even worse than we do of,

27
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.450
of the search to notch it up for your own political side yes.

28
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.890
Or against the enemy. Yeah. It's the same thing with the Twitter,

29
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.330
the Twitter point, but the, I mean, this,

30
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.360
this obscene glee that on after any terrorist attack in Europe,

31
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.840
but I think also here as well, the attempt to, to,

32
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.040
to immediately call it for the other side or for your side or whatever. Um,

33
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.960
and to, to try to use terrible events as a way to justify

34
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.200
whatever your own team is. Yes. Um, I, I have, I,

35
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.270
I find this amazing with the gun debate here and I would find it amazing coming

36
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.710
from a different society on it,

37
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:50.550
but the way to sort of notch it up for one side or the other in it, and,

38
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.190
uh, know it's, you've got a real problem on.

39
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.110
<v 2>This one. I've been watching a lot of it, uh,</v>

40
00:01:56.111 --> 00:02:00.990
from the perspective of the gun owners, right? The NRA members and the,

41
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:05.540
the people that want to the idea of having guns and

42
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.340
even of arming teachers.

43
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.540
And you're looking at their perspective on it and their perspective on it is all

44
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:14.780
about their rights, all about the constitution, all about the bill of rights,

45
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:19.380
all about protecting the second amendment, all about it's gun ownership,

46
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:21.620
being taken away, gun ownership under attack,

47
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.850
the NRA under attack they're coming after our guns.

48
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.210
And this is this constant battle of ideas. That's on Twitter,

49
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.330
not addressing the actual issue. I mean.

50
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.370
<v 1>I, sorry. No, it's okay. I was gonna say, I mean, watching this thing, uh,</v>

51
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.210
arming teachers.

52
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.090
<v 2>Yeah. That's insane. I mean, this is Samuel Jackson had a great quote about it,</v>

53
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.600
but you mean it's, you know, he, uh, he put a it on Twitter.

54
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.760
Like someone tell a who's never been in a gun fight. The problems of arming,

55
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.640
a bunch of teachers, right? Yeah.

56
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.520
<v 1>Some somebody said, said someone.</v>

57
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.440
<v 2>Who's been in a gun fight, please tell yeah. A in.</v>

58
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.160
<v 1>A fight. Somebody said, anyone who thinks it's a good idea,</v>

59
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.560
giving teachers guns has clearly never seen one,

60
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.480
try to use an overhead projector. Ah.

61
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.640
<v 2>Yeah. There's there's Samuel Jackson look at that 306,000</v>

62
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.760
likes. So, you know, it was an effective tweet.

63
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.840
&lt;laugh&gt; this is the world we're living in. You check, check the number.

64
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.280
It was only, yeah, you got three tweets. It can't be true. Nobody likes.

65
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.440
<v 1>Yeah. I, uh, I, I thought there was a,</v>

66
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.670
a very pertinent one a few years ago in New York on fifth when, um,

67
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.470
somebody shot their colleague and, um,

68
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.270
outside the office came back as disgruntled work, shot the colleague and,

69
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.063
uh, locally,

70
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.350
there was some policemen around the corner and they came out and started firing

71
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:39.740
at the guy who'd done. It ended up wounding about 11 and pedestrian.

72
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.220
Like, well, you would wouldn't you of course. I mean, I'm not saying by the way,

73
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.420
but we have, we have our own problems. I mean,

74
00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:47.700
this is a big problem for America. What, I.

75
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.940
<v 2>Can't have more guns than we have people.</v>

76
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.020
<v 1>I mean, I completely understand why the amendment exists.</v>

77
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.500
And I think it's a very good idea for the time.

78
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.730
And I think it a very understandable idea to hold onto it now. But, um,

79
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.850
but why can't people say, for instance, I mean,

80
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.970
we all have abstract ideas we have to hold onto, but we,

81
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:11.810
and we all in our countries have like weird things that other people don't

82
00:04:11.811 --> 00:04:12.644
understand. I mean,

83
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.210
might think it's odd to have a hereditary constitutional Monarch for instance,

84
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.080
and right. Uh, it, it is weird. It's a great way to put it. It strange. And,

85
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.640
uh, if you are starting from now, you might not do that. Um, uh, but,

86
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.280
but clearly with the gun ownership thing, it is,

87
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.040
we are willing to take bad things happening quite often

88
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.880
because we want to hold onto the second amendment. Well.

89
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.320
<v 2>The second amendment has been around forever.</v>

90
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:43.110
The bad things happening quite often is really from Columbine and on. I mean,

91
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:47.510
there was a few of them before there was the Austin, Texas, uh, but, uh,

92
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.150
tower shootings. But it.

93
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.990
<v 1>Seems like, I mean, again, I mean, just,</v>

94
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.630
it's such an obvious point and I don't underst sound like I say,

95
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:56.550
it's snotty Brit, who's saying something about America.

96
00:04:56.551 --> 00:05:00.550
That's not at all welcome, but it seems obvious that you just,

97
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.100
you could do a lot more damage with a semi-automatic rifle than you

98
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:10.380
can with a knife. And most people, we see this in the terrorism as well.

99
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.980
There are really committed terrors who don't commit acts of violence,

100
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.820
unless they can get hold of a, of a, the means to do it right.

101
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:21.500
Because we often think, well, why don't you just like go out with a knife?

102
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.473
Some people do,

103
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.450
but most people actually want to go out in that way in what they see as being a

104
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:28.850
blaze of glory. Right?

105
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.650
So they like stopping them,

106
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:36.370
having the means of getting that very easily seems to me very obvious,

107
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.970
but that isn't to say that, I mean, of course,

108
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.850
I think you made a point the other day. It's like saying, if you say,

109
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.240
who has a gun is part of the problem is then obviously not because it's like

110
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:48.320
saying everyone's got a truck is a part of the problem, but right. But there is,

111
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.720
there are obviously two things.

112
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.200
One is the psychological and whatever the social issues are that cause this to

113
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:56.360
keep happening. And that, that is obviously very,

114
00:05:56.361 --> 00:05:58.200
very important to try to get to the root of,

115
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.160
but you can get to the root of that or try to get to the root of that.

116
00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:07.000
And also recognize that people having access to some of the weapons

117
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.120
they have access to in this country must be a part of the problem.

118
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.670
<v 2>It has to be. And it, there also the, uh,</v>

119
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.260
idea that you should just be able to go out and buy a gun

120
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.980
without really understanding how a gun works at all. Yeah.

121
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.260
And which is exactly how you do it. I got my first handgun license in 1994. Um,

122
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.020
that's when I bought my first handgun and I just went and bought a handgun.

123
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:36.180
Right. They did a background check on me, that's it? I mean, I went to a range.

124
00:06:36.181 --> 00:06:39.810
They showed me with a safe is point at this, put the earphones on,

125
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.250
make sure you don't blow ears out. Bang, bang, bang.

126
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.610
And then you leave with a gun. I mean, once your background checks clear,

127
00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:49.010
they find out you're not a criminal. There's not much to it. There's a,

128
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.890
there's a giant problem with that. If you wanna drive an automobile,

129
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.570
you have to show that you understand the laws, right. You have to understand,

130
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.680
uh, you have to sit with an expert's to sit there and drive the instructor.

131
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.480
They have to go through it with you. They have to watch your movements.

132
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.400
They have to watch you make turns, right?

133
00:07:06.401 --> 00:07:11.000
They have to wouldn't wouldn't you imagine that it would be a good idea to have

134
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:14.840
some sort of a clinical evaluation of a person that's gonna gonna buy a gun.

135
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.920
And here's another thing.

136
00:07:16.921 --> 00:07:21.430
There was an article recently that was saying contrary to popular belief.

137
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.110
Most school shootings are not committed by people who are mentally ill. Well,

138
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.270
that's a stupid thing to say. You know why? Because if you're,

139
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.190
you're committing a school shooting, right. You're mentally ill. Exactly. Okay.

140
00:07:32.191 --> 00:07:36.150
Period. Then on top of that, what they're ignoring conveniently,

141
00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:40.340
and this is another headline thing, psych medications, right?

142
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.900
These people are almost entirely on some form

143
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.140
of psychiatric medication, whether it is anti-anxiety pills,

144
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.020
whether it's anti antidepressants, whether they're, they're all,

145
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.460
I'm not saying that correlation equals causation. I'm not saying that.

146
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.690
But to say that they're not, this is just a. This is click bait headline.

147
00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:04.330
Exactly. They're mentally ill, a hundred percent, 100% of 'em are mentally ill.

148
00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:04.650
There's.

149
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.890
<v 1>There's a, uh, uh, um,</v>

150
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.650
a conservative commentator in the UK called Peter Hitchens,

151
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:12.090
who always makes a point after Islamist terrorist attacks in Europe.

152
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.250
That there's a large number of them,

153
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.210
as well as other types of attack who seem to be on some kind of medication. Yes.

154
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.160
And my point is always, I'm very, very happy to have that conversation.

155
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.680
I think we need to have that conversation and we also have to have the other

156
00:08:25.681 --> 00:08:28.560
parts of it as well. Yes. So you're right. It's the same here. I,

157
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.360
I can't see why we can't have all of this. Look.

158
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.320
<v 2>It's the same thing that we were talking about earlier. It's these idea sports,</v>

159
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.280
right? These wars people don't want to give up their idea.

160
00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:43.030
They don't want to give up any ground whatsoever on their second amendment

161
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.270
rights, whether it's owning a 50 caliber tank gun,

162
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:52.310
or whether it's, uh, having a, uh, a gun for home safety or for hunting. Yeah.

163
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:55.280
They don't wanna give up anything. And they feel like it's a slippery slope.

164
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.720
The people that I follow online that are tweeting about this on a regular basis,

165
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.920
and you can go to a lot of them, like, uh, they're making videos about it,

166
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:07.480
Dana lash. And, uh, Colin is actually,

167
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.640
his name is, it's not Colin's co lion co lion noir.

168
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.070
N O I R. He's very variable cool about it. And I'm, I'm reading all this stuff.

169
00:09:16.071 --> 00:09:16.850
It's like,

170
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.630
all anyone's taking into account is that this idea that they're coming after

171
00:09:20.631 --> 00:09:22.150
your rights, right. And,

172
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.950
and emphasizing the idea of a good person with a gun that can

173
00:09:26.951 --> 00:09:31.470
protect people in these terrible situations, which can happen as well. But what,

174
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.950
what we have to address, that's not what we're talking about.

175
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.740
We have to address how the do these crazy people get guns. Why,

176
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.700
why are so many people on mental health medications? Yeah. Yeah.

177
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.500
<v 1>Well, that's a huge, it's a huge problem. I can't understand.</v>

178
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.380
We always have this wanting to have the conversation about it,

179
00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:51.140
but there's very little done on it. That's one thing I'm very struck by this.

180
00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:53.580
We, we, uh, we, we have in all our countries, I mean,

181
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:57.290
slipped into a very weird attitude towards this type of medication.

182
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.130
<v 2>Yes. Very weird. Very,</v>

183
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.290
just very accepting of something that radically alters the way your mind works.

184
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:05.124
Right.

185
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.170
<v 1>And I, I don't know.</v>

186
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:10.050
Maybe it's maybe it's cuz there's not an incentive drug companies,

187
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:13.130
obviously don't have an incentive quite the opposite, uh, to look into it.

188
00:10:13.131 --> 00:10:15.770
But it's another example of the,

189
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.360
a set of set of things we should be thinking about at the moment and looking at

190
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:23.400
which we just don't, why don't we,

191
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.240
cause it's sort of shut down because we shut it down ourselves. I, uh,

192
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.640
I think it's, it's just such a range of issues. This is the case with,

193
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.400
and it's always the same thing. It's always that if you address,

194
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.830
is the question difficult as it might be,

195
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.710
you are attacking an individual who might suffer from it. Yeah.

196
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.750
Who might be upset by us addressing the question. Um, I mean, I,

197
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.630
I have a lot of suspicions about all sorts of things. I'm a very, you know,

198
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.990
skeptical person as it were about things that I'm told.

199
00:10:52.991 --> 00:10:57.500
So I'd like to look into, into things. I'm amazed that the number of things in,

200
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.180
in our societies that we just don't discuss and they're all the things that we

201
00:11:01.181 --> 00:11:06.060
ought to be discussing, um, issues like mental health issues, uh,

202
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.900
issues that have to do with the social presumptions that are going on left right

203
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.540
and center at the moment where you're not meant to discuss things that are apart

204
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.810
for anything else. Very, very interesting and very important. And.
