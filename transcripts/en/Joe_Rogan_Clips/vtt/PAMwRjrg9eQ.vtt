I just think Kevin, any other predictions.

37
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.070
<v 0>Kevin? I know you. Can't Brian. Kevin Lee is a bad mother.</v>

38
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.230
You know why Kevin leaves a.

39
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.230
<v 1>Bads? Don't talk over each other. I.</v>

40
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.710
<v 0>Know. Do you know why Kevin?</v>

41
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:55.910
Lee's a bad because he's a wrestler who uses his

42
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.950
expertise to win fights. He likes to take down and take their back. He could.

43
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:05.580
Kevin Lee likes to take is down. He's really good at taking the back. Oh, jeez.

44
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.700
<v 1>Oliver. Clean.</v>

45
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.340
<v 0>Left hook. Not very many wrestlers. Take that route.</v>

46
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.340
<v 1>Dude. Oliver. No jokes, son.</v>

47
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.700
<v 0>Butvera but okay. Now on oliververa's side,</v>

48
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.700
that guy is a Savage on his feet. Who you up on the ground,

49
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.780
on his back on the top. He'll shoot that.

50
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.130
<v 1>Take to the face, dude. Dude, oliververa looks real good. Standing up, man.</v>

51
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.750
He' is a solid.

52
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.890
<v 0>He kicked him right in the face. He's a. Look at this dude.</v>

53
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.610
They're both a Kevin. Take him down soon. That's high level on high label,

54
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.290
two D two different styles, but still crazy. This.

55
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.090
<v 1>Well oliververa doesn't have a weakness in his game either. You know,</v>

56
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:45.240
his standup is nasty as. And his, his ground game is terrifying.

57
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:45.880
He's the only thing he.

58
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.080
<v 0>Has a lot of space. Maybe straight up double lag is not.</v>

59
00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:52.560
Charles has a ton of, uh, experience people forget.

60
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.040
<v 1>How long he's been doing it. He's just on this hot streak right now. Six,</v>

61
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.360
six or seven in a row. Yeah.

62
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:59.080
He's been around a long time and is an opportunity for him. Look at him. Slip.

63
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.400
Watch out. Just hit him. The Kevin hits hard, hard, hard, hard, hard. They.

64
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.480
<v 0>Off Christ. They both need to step it up right here. Oh, nice. Shot.</v>

66
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.520
Up, up, up. Careful.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.400
<v 0>Careful. You ain't to tell he's that's gonna be hard. He can't complete.</v>

68
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.470
Look at this's. It's hard to complete.

69
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:25.030
That's going for leg transitions right into leglock's beautiful. Oh, beautiful.

70
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:26.710
That's high level Jitsu. No, he doesn't have it.

71
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.590
High level jujity if could see lot into it, look at it. Well'll see.

72
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.230
We we'll see how advanced he is. There's a lot of going on right now.

73
00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:36.750
Kevin doing the right things. A lot of going on, dude.

74
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.380
People think leglocks are, um,

75
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.020
dangerous MMA leglocks will keep you safe. Look at, oh, her, if you keep attack,

<v 0>Oh, look at that. He's safe. All that. Wow. People forget that.</v>

80
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.300

84
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.090
<v 0>No. Oh no. Don't give him your back hip.</v>

85
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.690
<v 1>Oh boy. Oh, he gave a back. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh my God. Holy.</v>

86
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.770
Look at this. This is he's in half.

87
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.170
<v 0>Guard. They're in a very complex jujisu configuration. Big times. Yeah.</v>

88
00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:15.610
It's very.

89
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.600
<v 1>Complex. This kid wind up in a twister. Yeah. Oh. Look at this. Him out.</v>

90
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.683
Kevin.

91
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.800
<v 0>On the bottom. He's going to leg HES. The most submiss ever he's going. Right.</v>

92
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.680
Look at that skull. Look. He's sick started. Leglocks look at, look at this.

93
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.880
Just hanging busy. What the dude.

94
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:35.960
You know what we're seeing here is uh,

95
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.080
punch you punch consistently offensive.

96
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.630
Look at at his leg locks while you're on your back, dude.

97
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:45.790
Make your black bill go to for MMA. Look at that.

98
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.350
This is leglocks are great for MMA. Look at those. Kick out, kick out.

99
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.310
He' Kevin. He's been gone for leglocks the whole time and, and Kevin Lee.

100
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.990
Kevin, he's.

101
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.350
<v 1>Gonna blow his leg out. Exactly. This is real bad.</v>

102
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.540
He's gotta turn the other way. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Look at his knee dude.

103
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.100
Jesus Christ. Ow. Jesus Christ.

104
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.940
Nos hard. It's hard to see from the other side. Like what?

105
00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:13.140
It not looks like that's not good. Oh my God. That's not good, dude, bro.

106
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.300
That's a Kevin's in trouble. Here't I don't want Kevin to up his knee.

107
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.090
Even.

108
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.500
<v 0>Even if come on, Kevin doesn't have from this and he's probably,</v>

109
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.570
we're not gonna tap from this, but the whole,

110
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.330
the whole purpose of this is oliverlovera is got him in a position where Kevin

111
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.530
Lee can anymore see that he' attack.

112
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.890
And then he's going right into a crime the whole time.

113
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.290
Don't punch the whole time. He's throwing.

114
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.850
<v 1>Look at his arm, look at his arm. He's got his arm pin. Look at that. The.</v>

115
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.880
<v 0>Wholes are Lia. Look at that.</v>

116
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.960
<v 1>Look at that. Oh my goodness.</v>

117
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.920
<v 0>But they're both high level. They're both high level. Look at this. Look at,</v>

118
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.853
are you in.

119
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.760
<v 1>Look at this, a look.</v>

120
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.440
<v 0>At this I' high level, dude. Look at that. Oh my goodnessvera.</v>

121
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.240
<v 1>Count. This is high levelsu high.</v>

122
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.320
<v 0>Level with the leg locks incorporated.</v>

123
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.120
Elevatberry incorporating the leg lock. Good. Both guys.

124
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.280
Constant attacking. Oh.

125
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.360
<v 1>Look at Nope.</v>

126
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.520
<v 0>Both hands. He's always on offensive. Look at that. Always.</v>

127
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.760
<v 1>Wow. That's a high guard. He's he?</v>

128
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.190
I've never seen anybody work a guard that effectively.

129
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.470
I have to go back and watch this and listen to it with, with no audience. I bet.

130
00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:26.550
It's so weird. Yeah. Oh it's I was watching the prelim like, God,

131
00:06:26.551 --> 00:06:28.430
this is awful and he's going de lahiva on.

132
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.070
<v 0>And he just went dehi on him. And then Kevin Lee back stepped into like,</v>

133
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.260
he could, he could go into honey hole, but I love S relaxed on Perry.

134
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.123
This is high level.

135
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.140
<v 1>Right hand by Kevin Lee. That's bad. What were you gonna say about John Enoch,</v>

136
00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:47.540
Joe? Oh, that he tweeted, uh, when Gilbert burns yelled that it was very eerie.

137
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:51.900
How it echoed in an empty arena. Weird. That's so strange. Who,

138
00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:53.100
who do you give this first round to.

139
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.220
<v 0>So far? Kevin Lee' Kevin Lee.</v>

140
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.690
<v 1>Man. No, no, no. But even though, even though Charles was doing worse,</v>

141
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.690
this is the end of time. The end of the round. They're both doing work. I mean,

142
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.930
Oliver LAA hit him with some really good shots.

143
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.530
But when Kevin Lee's on top of the end of the round beat beating you up.

144
00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:11.570
It' it's hard in the judge's eyes to see someone else. I give it to Kevin,

145
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.450
but Charles, very close, just attacking all the time, off his.

146
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.930
<v 0>Back. I love that. I'm all fighting, man.</v>

147
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.880
I'm all about Charles Alivera.

148
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.960
I love the fact that he's a jujitsu black belt and,

149
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.800
and his jujitsu is an Orthodox. I love all that.

150
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.120
But at the end of the round, if the guy's on top of you battering you down,

151
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.040
how did you win that round? Yeah. All that you did.

152
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.750
Didn't really mean that much. If this guy's on top of, you know,

153
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:41.510
beating you down. Right. So I give that round to Kevin Lee.

154
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.630
<v 1>Yeah. The, what you were saying earlier,</v>

155
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.910
I agree with about thepri the old pride rules that the end of the fight counts

156
00:07:47.911 --> 00:07:50.470
more. Look at that though. Look that jumping fight, kick that scores.

157
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:54.430
But look at this. Yeah. Boom. There's some nasty ground and pounds on nasty. He,

158
00:07:54.431 --> 00:07:57.150
he has to be so calculated when he's punching mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; down.

159
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.540
It's it's so dangerous for him. This is a dangerous.

160
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.540
<v 0>I'm fight. I'm biased. By the way, we got four more routes. Did you get to.</v>

161
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.660

163
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.740
<v 1>More. Minutes's I'm a little upset. They make Mike Beltran hide his mustache.</v>

164
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.740
I know. Why do they do that? He's got a mustache. Get to cut it. I thought no,

165
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:15.460
it's tucked in. It's tucked in his shirt. Look at this. Look at this.

166
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.940
Man's wrapped up. Oh, like a beer. So I love that guy tucked in.

167
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.730
There's he's the best great guy. He's my favorite riff actor guy. He's.

168
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.570
<v 0>Great. Nobody better than Mike Betran that's the Best's the best on.</v>

172
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.680

209
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:52.910
Oliver. Bear can be smart, but Lee is a beast. Look at him, dude.

210
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.750
He's a beast. That's a hard one to finish. He's a for.

211
00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.380
<v 1>He's a strong guy for this weight class. Oliverve's gotta get him off of him.</v>

212
00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:03.500
Right? He's remember oliverve used to fight at 45. Yes sir.

213
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.300
<v 0>Look at that. He wants that.</v>

214
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.300
<v 1>Back considerably. Uh, the smaller guy. See.</v>

215
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.620
<v 0>That's the beautiful thing about Kevin Lee right now is he wants the back.</v>

216
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.860
Cause that's he know that's his spot. That's what he's known. The.

217
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.090
<v 1>Michael fight. Michael Black felt mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he wants the back.</v>

218
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.570
That was super, super impressive that he choked, uh, SL like that. Yeah.

219
00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:24.450
You definitely choke him out. Don't have to coach him.

220
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.850
I just wish they let it go a couple more seconds so he can see him go to sleep.

221
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.450
Just so he taps or goes to sleep. I know, but stupid. Well,

222
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.930
a referee he's resting a choke. When a referee stops a choke.

223
00:11:34.931 --> 00:11:39.160
That's not necessary unless a guy goes out. I agree. He wasn't out. I agree.

224
00:11:39.161 --> 00:11:42.200
But he, he was finished either way, but he no guys relaxing in a arena.

225
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.400
You're you're right. I would bet I would bet the house on it a hundred percent,

226
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.200
but I would wanna see it. I agree. Also, Michael, she,

227
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.600
that one 70 is a mother.

228
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.360
<v 0>Father.</v>

229
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.880
<v 1>Mother. He's a. Oh, he's a contender.</v>

230
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:54.893
<v 3>Top five mother.</v>

231
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.040
<v 1>Him like mother. He's so strong.</v>

232
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.480
<v 3>I love about he so strong. I love Michael chest.</v>

233
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.520
<v 1>It's impossible to imagine that he actually made 55 right now.</v>

234
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.200
Huge. Really? He's a big 70. I'm telling you. He's.

235
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.400
<v 3>He's the, he's your dark horse at 70.</v>

236
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.910
<v 0>Batter. Your dark horse. Tall.</v>

237
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.430
<v 3>He's big for 70 man. Wow, great, good. Other he beast. Great on the ground.</v>

238
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.110
<v 0>And right here, Kevin Lee wants the back. That's where, that's what he wants.</v>

239
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.790
That's.

240
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.510
<v 3>What HES. Most finishes. There's.</v>

241
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.470
<v 0>A battle going.</v>

242
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:29.270
<v 1>On right here. How are they scoring this right now? There's a battle. The top.</v>

243
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.150
He, he was piece him up on the ground. He.

244
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.740
<v 0>Turns leglock battle. Look at that. He took,</v>

245
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.100
he turned that top half into a leglock battle. Now it's a whole chance.

246
00:12:38.101 --> 00:12:39.780
Itifferent sport. Whole different sport.

247
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.220
<v 3>Real quick. Remember it's in Brazil. It's a remember it's in Brazil. It's right.</v>

248
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.540
It's in Brazil. Yeah. So the judge in middle.

249
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.500
<v 0>This position though, this position is a whole different thing.</v>

250
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.260
Kevin Lees win right? Top half.

251
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.060
<v 3>Why? Why you say that be.</v>

252
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.930
<v 1>No, no, I just, uh, theve was scoring a lot on the, on the, on the field. Yeah.</v>

253
00:12:57.931 --> 00:12:58.010
It.

254
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.090
<v 3>Depends how you score. Yeah, I know. I know. I hear you. So.</v>

255
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.690
<v 1>So I would give Kevin the take down and control, but is that worth,</v>

256
00:13:03.691 --> 00:13:06.850
which goes long. Was that worth as much as the headtrikes that he was? Well.

257
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.250
<v 3>What's the mostdominant thing that happened this round.</v>

258
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.530
Figure that the take down. Oh, you're right. And he ended the round on top.

259
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.360
<v 1>The second. That's only the second round. How much damage did he do? He,</v>

260
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.320
he held him. No, that's the second. Are you? Sure' not the third. No.

261
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.480
<v 3>The third's coming up next. Yes. Here's here's the thing. The round Charles.</v>

262
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.920
Cardioio's not fantastic. Well look, Kevin, Kevin's about to.

263
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.560
<v 1>Win this fighted here. You think so Kevin's gonna win this fight. Look at him.</v>

264
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.840
Look at Kevin Lee. Look at.

265
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.000
<v 3>Charles li he didn't, he.</v>

266
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.790
<v 1>This is a hard fight for both guys. Yes's a hard fight. Yes. And on the eat,</v>

267
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.910
it's hard because at Lee's taking a lot of shots before he can get it to the

268
00:13:37.911 --> 00:13:39.430
ground. He's getting up, up on the he's getting piece.

<v 1>But it's just a technique.</v>

274
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.830
It's not that he doesn't give a Heely doesn't he comes forward, but it's also,

286
00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:26.770
this is where it's most dangerous for Lee. He's still recovering.

287
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.410
He's probably a little tired and Oliver AA. I'm telling Charles more around.

288

I don't know. He did it a million. He look at that. He tapped the guys in the,

302
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:18.430
the fire went right back to wrestling.

How much confidence do you have to have that to do that half car?

308
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:38.340
I got this half guard. He does this all the time. That's a percent.

309
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.540
That's his. He just was out of it. He's like, dude, are you kidding me?

<v 1>Dylan. Oh look. It's like he woke up. Oh.</v>

312
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.100
It's like you woke up and jumped on his back. Poor guy. Oh my.

313
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.410
<v 0>There's a poster right there. Wow. That's.</v>

Look at this. They're cool with each other. No, that's nice to see. Yeah dude,

316
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:03.850
he must have choked him out.

317
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.850
He must have choked him unconscious and he woke up thinking the fight was still

318
00:16:06.851 --> 00:16:09.450
going on. Unfair. That's crazy. He badass. Who's.

319
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.600
<v 0>Better than him. Oh. Is that people better than where is he?</v>

320
00:16:12.601 --> 00:16:15.280
Train out of Brazil. Who's better than him. What? Weight division? He's.

321
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.160
<v 1>So good. 45, but guys a beat. He' that? 45 or 55 55 at 45. That was 55.</v>

322
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.080
That's 55. Cause he used to do 45.

323
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.000
<v 0>Yes. And now.</v>

324
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.840
<v 1>He went up to 55. He, he was cutting too much weight at 45. His five.</v>

325
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.640
He won seven on row. Pretty sure he's.

326
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.510
<v 0>On spot 55. That move. I didn't know. He made.</v>
