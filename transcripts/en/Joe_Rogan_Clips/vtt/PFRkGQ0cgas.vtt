00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.030
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. But van Halen seems like a.</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.410
<v 1>Yeah, it is. Yeah. I didn't know. I didn't even,</v>

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.830
I guess I didn't even think to even put it together that it was his last name.

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:13.560
Even though I knew that it's like a vehicle, like a van Halen.

5
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.990
It's a strong yeah. Yeah.

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.770
<v 0>So it's like a Hindenburg. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.810
<v 1>It is. Yeah. Yeah. Rogan. That's good. He is not a good one.</v>

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.050
They got the apostle, he it all up.

9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.800
<v 0>These are weird. Like, why are we still using? No, do we forget how to talk?</v>

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.680
<v 1>It's very weird. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:37.410
You don't have to tell me how to pronounce it. Just drop it. By the way,

12
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:42.000
it makes it worse because people are like Elliot, Leah, add ELLs and.

13
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.330
Dude, you go to like a restaurant. You know what the worst is,

14
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.010
is when I pull into a gate,

15
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:50.340
you have a meeting anywhere and you got to give everybody that's thing.

16
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.150
And I said, and then they say, you're not in this system. And I'm like,

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.030
try a with or without the apostrophe, whichever one you didn't do.

18
00:00:57.031 --> 00:01:00.600
And then they're like, there it is every time, every time.

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.040
<v 0>Change your last name,</v>

20
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:06.330
spelling to de D U H a

21
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.930
H L E E a.

22
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.770
<v 1>H know if, uh, Uh, the, uh,</v>

23
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.440
when I was little, when I was little, I told my dad, I was like,

24
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.940
can we get rid of the apostrophe? I was young. I was like 12.

25
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.840
And he was like, huh. And I was like, it's just a sucks.

26
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:29.790
Like w what I feel like, like, what is it? Like,

27
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.010
people always mispronounce it and he's like, you should be proud of that.

28
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.730
And I was like, I'm not. And then, and then

29
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.120
I remember thinking I'm not, it's just the 13. That's rough. Yeah.

30
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.570
And then, and then, and then I started to like it, you know? Cause I'm like,

31
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.660
yeah, I guess it is my name. it. You know? Um, but when I was little,

32
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.860
I wanted to change. I remember, I remember asking my parents if I could.

33
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.200
I mean, this is embarrassing.

34
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.230
I remember telling my parents that I wanted to change my name

35
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.073
to

36
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.710
Damian Monroe. No. Yes.

37
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.610
Krista Leah to Damien Damien Monroe. I imagine.

38
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.910
Imagine if my name was Damien Monroe,

39
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.050
you would have hated me immediately. No, I wouldn't. Cause open-minded.

40
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.633
Yeah, but Dave.

41
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.570
<v 0>Giovanni pretentious name ever. My name is Theodore Theodore Von.</v>

42
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.290
<v 1>But think about, but think about this is why you didn't even know why,</v>

43
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.610
why I wanted to name it because this is so

44
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:40.470
embarrassing and whatever, but okay. Because Damien was,

45
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.810
is the devil. Right? Okay. And then Marilyn Monroe was like pure in my head.

46
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.370
I was like, you have both.

47
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.830
<v 0>This. So this was like a show biz name ID. I don't.</v>

48
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.420
<v 1>Know. I didn't get very far with it, obviously. This time. Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.430
Same age, like young. What am I possibly positivity? I was like, well,

50
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:59.230
I could call me. I just named myself Damian Monroe. Oh my God.

51
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.760
Imagine I would hate.

52
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.230
<v 0>That. [inaudible].</v>

53
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.510
<v 1>I mean, you all do stupid things as a kid. I didn't get to do that.</v>

54
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.430
Obviously my parents wouldn't have, let me do that. Thank God.

55
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.150
I was a weirdo man. I would ask my parents. I would,

56
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.790
I would ask my peers because I always sat like this at the dinner table.

57
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.940
And I asked them, I was like, I was like, can you call me crazy legs?

58
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.740
<v 0>And I remember thinking.</v>

59
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.700
<v 1>Like, I like, that would be cool. Like if my family called me crazy legs.</v>

60
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.500
<v 0>Hey, it's Damien crazy legs.</v>

61
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.260
<v 1>And then they were like, and my dad was like, no. And I was like, but just like,</v>

62
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:34.270
maybe just at least at the dinner table. I remember saying that.

63
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.680
And you would be like, I'm not calling you crazy leg. We need you Chris.

64
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.140
<v 0>Oh my God. So funny kid.</v>

65
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.110
<v 1>That was even younger. The crazy legs thing was like, it was probably like nine.</v>

66
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.680
<v 0>God kid's ideas are so stupid.</v>

67
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.420
<v 1>They're so dumb. They're so funny. I remember.</v>

68
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.650
<v 0>These women laughing in my face once at me trying to be cool.</v>

69
00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:00.580
And I was like 12. Um,

70
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.630
I had these sneakers on, I mean, I don't know,

71
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:07.420
like they were like these brown suede sneakers.

72
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.000
And I went through a period of time. This is very embarrassing.

73
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.830
I went through a period of time when I was like 12, 12, 13 ish,

74
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.840
where I got really into Tom Sawyer and huckleberry Finn. Oh boy.

75
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.910
I even tried chewing tobacco.

76
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.523
<v 1>At that age.</v>

77
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.060
<v 0>Oh geez. They would sell you chewing tobacco. When you were a little kid,</v>

78
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.050
you could be 12 and just bite you in the back for whatever reason, like that.

79
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:35.890
Wasn't like cigarettes. Right, right, right. You could just buy chewing tobacco.

80
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.060
Look, I bought it. I didn't have to hide. That's so weird. It's crazy.

81
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.160
They let you,

82
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.480
but you would come in this like wallet looking brick and you open it up and you

83
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:51.460
break a piece off like real old schooly Clooney's would style chewing tobacco.

84
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.010
I was retarded. Okay. So I had these, uh,

85
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.340
these shoes on that were like a brown suede. They were really goofy liquor.

86
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.800
And these next door neighbors, uh, in this, we, we rented a house. It was, um,

87
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:04.990
me, my sister, my parents.

88
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.650
And then one of our friends of the friend of my dad's rented.

89
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:12.790
One of the rooms in the house had the upstairs and the next door is like a very

90
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.460
small house. And next door was another small house. And uh,

91
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:17.680
these young kids lived there, like the downstairs people,

92
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:22.120
they had a band and they were horrible, but they were like super committed.

93
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:25.270
So they'd practice all the time. And they had,

94
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.530
they had carpet everywhere, man. Like, you'd go down in the basement.

95
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:34.420
And what they had done is taken like 30 or 40 sheets of carpet and like

96
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.390
made doors and packed the walls.

97
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.490
And they essentially turned the basement into like a practice soundproofing.

98
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.500
But you could, you could hear them super clear. And uh, okay.

99
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:51.340
I remember there, the band's name was death in the shopping mall.

100
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.260
Oh my God. And the song called my baby is a mutant.

101
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.030
You remember this? Yeah. Yeah. I got a crazy memory man.

102
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.870
And so these guys be like, my baby is a mutant

103
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.260
[inaudible] but that's okay. I love my black Jesus.

104
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.030
<v 1>Christ. I can't even remember.</v>

105
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.980
<v 0>This practicing blow in their eardrum. They were cool. It was up.</v>

106
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.910
They let me go over there and watch when I was 12 to let me go and hang out with

107
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:25.640
these guys. One of them scooped ice cream, you had giant forearms.

108
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.940
And everybody was like, look at his forearm, Spanish coops, ice cream, scoops,

109
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.780
ice cream all day. So he's jacked forearm and all the like young kids,

110
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:36.740
like 12 would be like scared of this 19 year old dude with his giant forums.

111
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:39.590
Cause he'd scoop a nicer all the time, but they were all super friendly,

112
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.680
but there's these two freaky little girls that would hang out with them. And I,

113
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:45.170
you know, when you're 12, you're going through bloom ruined group.

114
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.010
So I have these stupid sneakers on, I say the girl, I go, uh,

115
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.830
she goes nice sneakers. Like she's kinda mocking me. I go, yeah,

116
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.290
I don't like codes. And my sneakers, it turns me off.

117
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.600
And they burst into laughter not laughing like

118
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.350
exist, but like, look at this dork.

119
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.440
And I'll never forget the feeling when I said it, like, yeah,

120
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.710
I don't like colors of my sneakers. It turns me off like the feeling of like,

121
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.573
oh, you.

122
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.910
<v 1>So you thought you were being cool and quickly while you were saying this and</v>

123
00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:15.920
you're like, oh, this is not, that's hilarious.

124
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.150
<v 0>Realized as you're saying it, like, how stupid are you really?</v>

125
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.370
<v 1>Yeah. Checked by the opposite sex. When you're that age. I mean,</v>

126
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.540
there was one time. I can't like, I remember high C.

127
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.110
I was probably still around. I don't know, but obviously I don't drink it,

128
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:31.400
but there was great.

129
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.590
<v 0>Dem. Oh my God. Wow. Whoa. They have a YouTube video.</v>

130
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.380
Wow. In the shopping malls has a, this.

131
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.550
<v 1>Was a five-year four years ago.</v>

132
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.830
<v 0>These guys are 80. Oh no.</v>

133
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.680
<v 1>It says that this was in 1981.</v>

134
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.320
<v 0>Oh, they recorded it in 81. Wow.</v>

135
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.070
So that was right around the same time,

136
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.210
because 81 was where I went to high school in 81.

137
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.910
So that would make sense. That was like, so I was,

138
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.210
I guess I was 13 and then a little later in the career, but dude,

139
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:11.390
that's two years later, we're talking about like 79

140
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.940
in 1979. I'm pretty sure that was the age. I was pretty crazy.

141
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.740
Cause I was 13. Yeah. Cause it was right.

142
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:24.440
When I first moved to Boston, we were living in Jamaica, plain.

143
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.870
We were living on, um, God. I don't remember the name of the street for,

144
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:31.880
I remember the name of the street. It would help. But anyway,

145
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.180
I'll that haunted me, those girls laughing in my face,

146
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.820
haunted me for years. I still think about it.

147
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.660
<v 1>That's interesting. I think about, I think about like that.</v>

148
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.380
I think about like that, that like you carry with you, like,

149
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.910
you know how sometimes it's just yeah, but sometimes it's just like,

150
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:50.510
like that's I.

151
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.610
<v 0>Mean nothing. But what happened.</v>

152
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.180
<v 1>Was you were too young to have with a situation like that yet. Yes.</v>

153
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.480
So that was why you remember it because you were still, oh, this is a new,

154
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.740
oh God. You know what I mean?

155
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.730
<v 0>Where personally aware of how [inaudible].</v>

156
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.800
<v 1>But I sounded right. Which yeah. But as a kid, you,</v>

157
00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.940
you don't have that. Right. You know? So the first few times that's.

158
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.940
<v 0>The same age. Do you change your name? Damian Monroe. So.</v>

159
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.670
<v 1>We're both forgiven. I remember I had to, yeah. I feel like it did.</v>

160
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.250
I had, uh, I had, uh,

161
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.150
I C I was at kindergarten or yeah, kindergarten, I think.

162
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.920
And um, it was before first grade, whatever that is, kindergarten goes and um,

163
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.050
the high C straw, it was gray Hi-C I remember. And I,

164
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.850
I squeezed it wrong and it shot up on my face and I was with a

165
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.060
table where there were girls there and it was lunchtime.

166
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.860
And I remember thinking, oh, it's probably purple on my face,

167
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:57.840
around my eye, like kiss or something. Cool. Yeah.

168
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.130
And wait. And so I was like kisses. Cool.

169
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.780
Like I'm going to just chill with it and just cause it happened by accident.

170
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.970
So it's not like I tried to do it.

171
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.170
So these chicks are just going to see me with this cool purple thing on my face.

172
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.580
I mean, God, I mean, same age,

173
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.170
no kindergarten. Oh.

174
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:23.880
So however old that Jesus Christ so young as and thinking all these thoughts and

175
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.540
then thinking, um, oh my God. And then thinking, uh,

176
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.610
I can't wait to like Mack on these girls, like, you know, your Magnum on girls.

177
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.660
I mean, it was whatever it was before first grade. That's kindergarten. Okay.

178
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:41.190
Yeah. So kindergarten. Yeah. Mrs. Antwan's class. And so, so you got grapes,

179
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.520
grapes, grapes, not even soda, just the juice, you know what I mean?

180
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:47.730
On your face? And um, I remember thinking,

181
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.200
like I remember leaving it there and it was very sticky because it's high C and

182
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:55.440
it's candy basically. So I was, I believe it though. Cause it's cool.

183
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:58.140
I remember thinking like, just stick with it cause it's very cool.

184
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.350
And finally it was so sticky that I was like,

185
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.430
I hope that this is like paying off. Cause I got, gotta wipe my face.

186
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.820
And so I asked the girl like really insecurely, like next to me, I was like,

187
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.610
Hey, uh, I was like, is it like all purple on my face? Like,

188
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.350
but like wanting it to be purple, you know?

189
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.400
And she goes and she just goes like this. No.

190
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.780
And then I was like, can I go to the bathroom? And I washed my face,

191
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.540
like what if you went to the bathroom? And then I looked at my face,

192
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.040
it was just my face zero purple. But, but that was like an, uh,

193
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.120
those were actual thoughts that this idiotic kindergarten or had,

194
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.840
um, yeah, I was like, oh, I look like a rockstar is what I thought.

195
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:38.761
<v 0>This moment.</v>

196
00:11:38.761 --> 00:11:42.250
So you can remember when you're just a little kid where you're so stupid.

197
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.650
They will haunt you deep inside.

198
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.400
<v 1>I don't think about that all the time. I think about it all the time.</v>

199
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.460
It's it's probably shaped me, you know,
