00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.160
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Do you sit down and write,</v>

2
00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:06.760
like on a piece of paper or do you write while you're putting music?

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.760
<v 1>No, I've no. Yeah. Um, for me, writing is a visual process visual.</v>

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.560
Yes. And I can't, if I write it, it down,

5
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.720
it becomes too dimensional and I I've never,

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.190
I I've written lyrics that I thought were genius and actually they committed him

7
00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:23.870
to paper and saw them and they be, and they it's like,

8
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:26.910
they dissolved from this three dimensional beauty to like, oh,

9
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:30.430
it's two dimensional garbage. It's bizarre. I know.

10
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.750
And it's not always like reasonable, but it's my process at this point.

11
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.790
How's it visual? Um, it's if you really listen to my songs, they're like,

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.220
photograph, like it's like flipping through a ographic album almost.

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.100
If you really listen to like what I'm doing, it's like very visual.

14
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.420
I see the pictures I equate it to like, did you ever watch the show Oz? Sure.

15
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:53.420
Yeah. Remember the poet guy who, who, who was illiterate,

16
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.380
but he drew pictures and that's how he recited his poems from pictures.

17
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.580
It's similar. It's like,

18
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:03.250
but it's kind of reverse it's in my brain mean it's it's there. So.

19
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.850
<v 0>You're seeing your visual in, in terms of like the, the stories of you painting,</v>

20
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.130
like the guy outside.

21
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.690
<v 1>The liquor store or the imagery. Yes. Or like, you know,</v>

22
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.250
a song like black Jesus where it's like just kind of cultural,

23
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.850
like pop culture reference after reference,

24
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:21.090
leading down a path of just like stream of consciousness,

25
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.360
pop culture references, you know what I mean? I'll go on tangents.

26
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:28.560
You know what I mean? But it'll be all within an energy inside the brain.

27
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.160
You know what I mean? Like once I commit them, I even like, after the fact,

28
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:36.640
like when you turn in like music to like entities that shows or whatever,

29
00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:40.560
they want to know the lyrics so they can know if they should put it on air or

30
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:42.480
this, you know, depends on whatever, if it's public their,

31
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.510
but even when it comes to that, I have to have,

32
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.110
I have to like recite it to somebody and have 'em type it. I can't it'll,

33
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.030
it'll just kind of taint it to me. Wow. That's interesting. See it written down,

34
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.910
so it's all you in my hand, you know what I mean? And, and another hand,

35
00:01:57.911 --> 00:02:00.510
it doesn't bother me, but like for me to com to do it, it,

36
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.180
it like breaks a barrier of some sort and that

37
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.140
everything vaporizes &lt;laugh&gt;.

38
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.380
<v 0>So do you, uh, how do you capture the, the various beats?</v>

39
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.260
Do you record it as you're coming up with it? There's.

40
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.580
<v 1>A, there's a few different ways. It happens for me. Like, you know,</v>

41
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:21.900
if I'm doing like a hip hop-ish or hip pure hip hop project, I'll,

42
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.210
there'll be a beat involved always for, you know, I mean,

43
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.330
there'll be somebody to have a track and we'll be like, oh, that's the track.

44
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:28.810
We're gonna commit to let's and we'll write lyrics to it.

45
00:02:28.811 --> 00:02:30.250
And it'll be just kinda, like I said, I'll,

46
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.370
I'll drive around a lot with rap stuff and just let it bump and see what words

47
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:39.010
starts popping up. I like wordplay and bouncing wordplay, but it,

48
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.890
it can't just be wordplay for the sake of it.

49
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:44.480
It has to like tie into some sort of like idea, um,

50
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.760
when it comes to a song, it's usually I,

51
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.760
I string together some simple chord progression and,

52
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.200
and start and, and see. And, and if I, once I see something, I really like,

53
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.360
it'll just, like I said,

54
00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:01.880
pictures will start coming up and you kind of just try to describe the picture a

55
00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.720
little bit. And sometimes you,

56
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.920
you come across poetry when you're describing the picture and you be like,

57
00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:10.120
that's good. &lt;laugh&gt;, you know what I mean? There's a lot of like, nah,

58
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:12.480
that's not good. Nah, that's not good. There's a lot of that.

59
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:13.360
There's a lot of that. It's.

60
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.400
<v 0>It seems like a mirror process to stand up comedy, like a mirror process.</v>

61
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.000
Except.

62
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.630
<v 1>I get a whole hold on to mine. Even if they record it and make a special,</v>

63
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.670
I still can play mine. And that's, that's what I always was like, man,

64
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.150
comedians are just, that's a little di it's a different commitment because like,

65
00:03:29.151 --> 00:03:30.510
you're, you're bringing, you're like,

66
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.390
it's almost like a child you're raising that you have to watch the life of it.

67
00:03:35.391 --> 00:03:37.750
Finish in a weird way. I'm not, you know what I mean?

68
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:40.380
We both have children that's yeah. Extreme, but I know what you're saying,

69
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.540
but like you're,

70
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:46.460
you're taking this idea from kind of garbagey idea that, you know,

71
00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:47.740
there's a premise there. Yeah.

72
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.700
And then like over a series of shows or nights, or maybe months,

73
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.620
you, you find it, you know,

74
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.740
with different audiences and then you got it and you,

75
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.490
you get to rock it for maybe six, good. In all these places.

76
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.290
And then you go and record it and make that special if you're lucky enough to be

77
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:10.010
on that level. Yeah. You know, it's almost like I almost envy the come. I,

78
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.170
I wonder if you guys ever envy the comic who quite doesn't quite have that yet.

79
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.010
So he can, like, he has this, you know,

80
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.410
be of material that he hasn't had the trash yet. You know what I mean? Is.

81
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.560
<v 0>It he's talked to Roy Wood about that. It was just on right before you,</v>

82
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.320
he that's one of the things that he said that you shouldn't do TV for like 10

83
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:28.000
years. Like don't do, it's like, can't have a.

84
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.200
<v 1>Catalog, man. People.</v>

85
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.320
<v 0>Come up with that idea that like the first time you do anything that people get</v>

86
00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:38.120
to see, like be hardened, like be a polished samurai of standup,

87
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.030
you know? But I disagree. I say, let, 'em see everything. Let, 'em see all the,

88
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.910
all the stuff that sucks. All the terrible jokes who cares. Just keep going.

89
00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:48.470
Especially.

90
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.030
<v 1>If the progression's there, then it's like, oh, you see what happened.</v>

91
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.510
<v 0>Happened? Yeah. Just keep going. And it's good for everybody. See,</v>

92
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:54.311
people don't want to think.

93
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:57.470
You're just like someone who just figured it out instantly. No,

94
00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.990
it's good to see these sucked. It's good for everybody.

95
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.700
It might be bad for your ego,

96
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.260
but it's good for you when your ego get takes a hit. It's always good.

97
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.780
It's always good. It puts everything in perspective. You know,

98
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.740
anything like as an artist too,

99
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:13.740
like the thing that gets in your way more than anything is your ego. Right?

100
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.980
The thing that gets in, in the way more than anything is for sure,

101
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.700
the way you view yourself, I wouldn't the way you want people to view you.

102
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.930
<v 1>I wouldn't produce my own. Right. Occurr until like maybe two albums ago,</v>

103
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.770
because I felt like if I'd made it through an album without being

104
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.650
like seriously challenged, I didn't make the best record I could. Mm.

105
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.890
And then just being involved with a bunch of really seriously good producers,

106
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.930
I learned to challenge myself and, and even the records I've produced for.

107
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.000
So if there's other guys involved producing with me that are,

108
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.040
that I know are gonna be the ones, if that's some, Hey, that sucked. Right.

109
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:53.200
You know what I mean? You can eat that guy around or, or even a guy just to, to,

110
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:56.840
to challenge even how committed you are to certain ideas. You know what I mean?

111
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.893
How much time.

112
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.560
<v 0>Do you spend going over? Like when you have a song and you're like,</v>

113
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.120
I think, I think this song is solid. Do you,

114
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.760
do you outside of singing the song,

115
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.240
do you ever go over the song and ponder, like what,

116
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:13.880
what you're saying or how you're saying it? Like,

117
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:18.510
how do you cuz your stuff is so it's so interesting because you're, you're,

118
00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:22.270
you're telling these stories of your experiences in these songs in a,

119
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.070
in a lot of 'em and you're also having fun and you're also talking,

120
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.190
you're having a good time with them as well. But when you decide, okay,

121
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.710
this one is gonna be recorded like this, how do you make that conclusion.

122
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.260
<v 1>For me? It's uh, uh, uh, again, if there's not like, cuz I,</v>

123
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.100
I can also, even if I'm not doing necessarily a straight rap song,

124
00:06:44.101 --> 00:06:47.540
there's times when I get a track from a producer that I just love the track and

125
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.740
I'll build something around that. Other than that, it'll again,

126
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.020
start with a guitar and I'll either, um,

127
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.020
create a, a very, uh,

128
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.730
rudimentary drum beat and lay down the guitar and maybe a vocal.

129
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.610
And I have a very unique voice, you know,

130
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:10.290
it's not like it's so there between the guitar and the voice tones start

131
00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:12.970
appearing that like resemble other instruments to me,

132
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:16.050
like it almost starts telling you what to do. Oh, that sounds,

133
00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:18.600
it sounds I could hear a roads in there. I, you know,

134
00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:20.720
the baseline should do that. You know, you can hear that.

135
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.800
And the guys I surround myself with are beasts that hear the same, you know,

136
00:07:25.801 --> 00:07:28.280
they know, oh yeah, this, I hear that. Let's do, you know, it's,

137
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.240
you can start a song, will tell you what to do with it. You know,

138
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.240
if you really listen to it, I believe that because I, I kind of, uh, you know,

139
00:07:36.241 --> 00:07:40.150
one of the things Santana told me, you know, I always held onto is like,

140
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:41.390
you know, cause,

141
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.150
and I've experienced this once or twice where I've written very similar songs to

142
00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:49.790
friends of mine or people I know that was like, whoa, like maybe not sounding,

143
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:52.550
but like the ideal. Oh wow. I wrote something that was exactly.

144
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.790
And he said like, you know,

145
00:07:53.791 --> 00:07:58.550
we're all just antenna that are like catching energies and and like

146
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:01.940
bringing in. And we're, you know, bringing, making something outta that energy.

147
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.380
And sometime people catch that same energy and similar things happen, you know?

148
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.060
And uh, so I always look at, at a doubt, I, I,

149
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.900
I look at my ideas like this also because I don't write them down.

150
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.740
I equate it to like my children like this,

151
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:19.460
like my ideas are like little animals that are wild

152
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.570
and I, I see them and I think they're amazing and I want to, and so I,

153
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.810
I I'll play a song till I know it so well,

154
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.170
it has to stick around it. Like I,

155
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.810
I train it to stay and if it stays the next morning,

156
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:37.490
that's this kind of answers your question the next day. If I write,

157
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:42.040
if I'm on to some and I write a song, I'll sing it 200 times.

158
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.840
If I get it close to dun and then I'll go to bed. Mm.

159
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.560
And then if it's there in the morning in the, in the same form,

160
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.120
I'll record it. If it's gone, I didn't, it wasn't mine.

161
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.440
And that's happened a lot.

162
00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.680
<v 0>Dude. That's a brave move. Yeah. I have the opposite cowardss approach.</v>

163
00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:03.880
Yeah. Yeah. If I get an idea, I'll run away from everybody, with my,

164
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.920
my fingers in my ears and write it down.

165
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.200
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; now here, what I said, I'll sing it 200 times. You know what I mean?</v>

166
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:15.030
So if ive done it 200 times and I don't wake up and know it it's

167
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.750
trash. I write everything down. It's not supposed to happen.

168
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.670
<v 0>I have the total opposite approach in terms of writing comedy. I.</v>

169
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.310
<v 1>Write, how many specials have you made in your life?</v>

170
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.870
<v 0>I never counted. Rough, rough guess it's like eight or nine.</v>

171
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.670
<v 1>All right. That's how many albums I've done in almost 30 years. Yeah.</v>

172
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.900
You know what I mean? So it's like, I'm not turning them out like that. I,

173
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.780
you know, and I don't, again, because of that,

174
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.420
there's not like this crazy archive of garbage that's gonna be released when I'm

175
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:47.820
dead. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen.

176
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.260
It's not gonna happen. Cuz I,

177
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.500
even songs that I start to record if I get halfway through with it and I'm like,

178
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.420
not even satisfied with it, it gets erased. Yeah. You know what I mean?

179
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.570
There's a few things out there that, that I,

180
00:09:58.571 --> 00:10:00.370
that I probably wouldn't have released, but they're not,

181
00:10:00.371 --> 00:10:02.930
they're like from house of pain days. Yeah. And they're not bad.

182
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.290
I'm just like they weren't for, they didn't have a, a purpose.

183
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.210
<v 0>I think it's good for people to see bad from great artists.</v>

184
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.370
&lt;laugh&gt; I do. I think it's good. It's it's good for.

185
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.880
<v 1>Everybody. I have. I mean, I'm the guy that I'll up,</v>

186
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:20.880
live and talk about it for five minutes at a show &lt;laugh&gt; and be like, yo,

187
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:24.000
at least, you know, it's not on tape. Right. I'll be like, that's real.

188
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.040
You know? And I, you know, I'm with that, I'm just like, it's my process.

189
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.520
It's like, just the way I do. Like, you know, again also I think I has Stewart.

190
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.920
I have some really hardhardcore producers, like DJ mugs and my man, Dante Ross,

191
00:10:35.921 --> 00:10:39.310
these were do, it would be like that was garbage. Do it again.

192
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.190
&lt;laugh&gt; it's for so long that that's, I'm a,

193
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.670
the first time now is gonna be decent. Yeah. You know what I mean? So it's like,

194
00:10:45.671 --> 00:10:48.390
I gotta push myself for it to be better than decent, you know?

195
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.070
You know what I mean? Yeah. No, I get it. Otherwise I just clip.

196
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.790
<v 0>It. Yeah. Well that's the only way you could be as productive as you are.</v>

197
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.300
You have a, you have a welloied approach, you know.

198
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.180
<v 1>But I don't put out a lot of music.</v>

199
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.420
<v 0>I yeah. But, but when I know for a fact that when you put something out,</v>

200
00:11:07.421 --> 00:11:08.254
you're happy about it.

201
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.180
<v 1>Oh yeah. I'm I'm, I'm, I'm I'm content. That's when you put it out content.</v>

202
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.740
<v 0>With it, that's a, you're in a great position, man.</v>

203
00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:18.650
That you can kind of sort of decide what to do. And when do it writing.

204
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.890
<v 1>Three of the biggest songs in the nineties with what it's like jump around and</v>

205
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:27.690
put your lights on. Well, that was 2000, I think so, but that little period,

206
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.410
you know, and I, I wrote those songs, jump around with mugs,

207
00:11:32.411 --> 00:11:36.170
what it's like and put your lights on. Totally on my own. That,

208
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.400
that provided me, me with something that I cherish.

209
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.720
Like some people cherish private jet rides,

210
00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:48.400
which is I can do whatever the I want and still live

211
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.400
pretty decent, not super rich guy or anything, but like better than average.

212
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.440
No, you got a good, good life. Take care of my family,

213
00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.080
but creatively I could do whatever the I want. Yeah, no you,

214
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.000
and it's a beautiful thing, man. That's I, the older I get,

215
00:12:03.001 --> 00:12:06.840
like I'm on my whole new. My slogan is it. I'm 50 man.

216
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.880
&lt;laugh&gt; that's my new dog. I'm on. Like, I don't, you ain't gonna rattle me,

217
00:12:11.881 --> 00:12:16.550
man. I'm 50. I don't even care. How's that if you're I like there,

218
00:12:16.551 --> 00:12:20.910
you GOM. So just trying to have fun. Live my life, go home,

219
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.350
hug my kids. Yes. And know that nobody with them in school.

220
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.430
And they had a great day. And then my universe was complete. Yeah.

221
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:37.900
<v 2>I.</v>
