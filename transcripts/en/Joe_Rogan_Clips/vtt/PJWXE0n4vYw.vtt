00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.770
<v 2>You and I would have met eight years ago just about to the date in a few months,</v>

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.590
because it will be the eight year anniversary of my being sued by Marine,

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.660
Lana, Canada, for plotting to steal a walrus, uh,

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.590
which would have been in February of 2013.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.550
<v 1>It's been so long. I hardly remember how we.</v>

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.890
<v 0>We're introduced. I can tell you the story. Please do.</v>

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.760
When I was sued by Marine land, the headlines, uh,

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.330
international were quite absurd. One of which in the, uh,

10
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.770
said the Kanye west of animal training gets sued for 1.5.

11
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.630
And I tweeted to you saying, dude,

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.490
they're calling me the Kanye west of animal training. He's like,

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.940
they're calling you the what? And then you went straight to my DM and he said,

14
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:47.400
dude, you got to come to LA. And we got to talk about this. I'm like, dude,

15
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:48.600
I'm on the next flight. Let's do it.

16
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.790
<v 1>I've always had a soft spot in my heart for dolphins and orcas. And,</v>

17
00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:55.230
and I just, I think we're going to look at it.

18
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:56.730
I've said this before on the podcast with you,

19
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:58.680
but I think we're going to look at it in the future the same way we look at

20
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:03.120
slavery. I think there, it makes me sad just talking about it.

21
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.480
I think I think there is intelligent as we are.

22
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.110
I think they're just different and because we don't understand their language,

23
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.590
we, uh, we think it's okay. And I think it's,

24
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.620
it's beyond up watching your documentary made me cry.

25
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:20.100
Man made me really cry when I was watching that dolphin get forced fed.

26
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.280
That's hard when they're holding his mouth open and shoving fish in his throat,

27
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.110
I'm like Christ. What, what is that? Imagine a person. Imagine a person.

28
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.900
I mean, you're dealing with an animal that is a cerebral cortex.

29
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:35.520
It's 40% larger than a person's.

30
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.280
<v 0>Can I tell you the story of that animal? His name was Sam.</v>

31
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:42.600
He came in an old male dolphin, wild caught, uh, from Russia. And, uh,

32
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:44.700
when we received him, you only had to take one,

33
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:48.540
look and realize this animal is going to reject captivity. He's a warrior.

34
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.690
He's got scars up and down. This is not an animal. That's going to accept.

35
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:54.990
Being told what to do by idiots like me. And you just saw,

36
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.600
he rejected captivity. We did everything we could to keep him alive.

37
00:01:57.601 --> 00:01:59.700
And you know, if you notice in the documentary,

38
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.240
I was told to turn the camera off. And I said, no, no, this is important.

39
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.440
I knew then that a lot of the documentation of the things that I was taking

40
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.420
could prove useful in the future. I didn't have a agenda when I was there.

41
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:14.040
Remember I was a company guy. I.

42
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.590
<v 1>Well, you were a kid and I was a kid. That's,</v>

43
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:20.040
what's crazy about your documentary, the Woolworths and the whistleblower,

44
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.213
emotional.

45
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.260
<v 0>Alrighty. I know I came to the right place, Joe.</v>

46
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:28.320
You've always been the biggest support and the fact that you answer all my

47
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:31.440
calls, you're one of the last and uh, I just know I'm in the right place.

48
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:35.250
This is my safe place. And uh, thank you for that. My friend.

49
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.630
<v 1>I'm invested. I'm invested in you and you thing. And this, this,</v>

50
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:40.441
this project,

51
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:45.060
and the fact that Canada stepped up and made all Orca and

52
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:46.770
dolphin captivity elite.

53
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.690
<v 0>And that doesn't exist without you and I having had done this. It, it, the,</v>

54
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:54.900
the backstory to that is it was an interview with you and I,

55
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.110
where the senator's son approached the center and said,

56
00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.410
is there any way we can help this guy?

57
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.170
And then suddenly private members bills was introduced. You know,

58
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:04.270
I got a call saying, Hey, we're looking to work on something here.

59
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.690
And I was like, absolutely. And that's how the bill got drafted.

60
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:09.550
It doesn't exist without you and I haven't spoken.

61
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:13.690
So in every which way I have you to thank and the world over has you to thank

62
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.200
because the influence that you have had on the passing of this law,

63
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.550
and now it's progressing to other countries.

64
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.410
Other countries are consulting with I'm actually, uh,

65
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.420
being witnessed in Australia, submitted some, uh, uh, witness testimony,

66
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.580
whatnot to, to, to support the, a similar ban.

67
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.690
And also I'd like to take the opportunity to take this time to say that there's

68
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:32.860
more laws coming in Canada.

69
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.970
The next law that's been introduced by the same Senator, uh, uh,

70
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.900
uh, Senator Murray Sinclair. Who's, who's actually retiring,

71
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.230
but he now has introduced, what's called the Jane Goodall act,

72
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.620
which is now gonna extend animal protections and ban the cafeteria. Great apes,

73
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.390
big cats, because there's, you know,

74
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:51.700
there's some places in Ontario in Canada that are awful,

75
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.560
that they just breed these cats rapidly. It's just,

76
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.120
it's just not the place to have them.

77
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.300
They're riding elephants at a place called, uh, African lion safari.

78
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.820
You're next, anyways, laws are coming. So Joe,

79
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.800
in every which way that I get attributed with

80
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.890
having done all this stuff, I attributed it right back to you.

81
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.960
That's the influence of this show.

82
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.160
I knew something eight years ago when I was desperate and looking for a place

83
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:18.100
to, to, to where I can speak unimpeded.

84
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.490
The media doesn't allow me that with the lawsuits and everything on me,

85
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.060
a lot of places won't talk to me because they get threatened to be sued.

86
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.680
You kept talking to me.

87
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.490
And so we're here today in celebration of every which way that you have

88
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.570
influenced both my life and the way that we can continue to influence, uh,

89
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.640
uh, the state of the planet for these majestic animals. I mean, really,

90
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.150
it doesn't take a lot of thinking to realize that dolphins,

91
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:46.140
porpoises and whales have, like you say, a higher intelligence,

92
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.850
I'll even challenge to suggest that they may be even more emotionally

93
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:51.250
intelligent than we could ever appreciate. I mean,

94
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:54.640
there's a chance that they're more intelligent than us. So, you know,

95
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:58.180
when you say that, what watching that dolphin get force fed.

96
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.950
I have 12 years of that to process and to discuss and to talk.

97
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.780
And it's invaluable that my experience that I have these open channels to speak

98
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.940
and I have them because of you. So.

99
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.980
<v 1>Thank you, Joe. I'm honored and I'm happy. And you you've been here. I mean,</v>

100
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.400
if we're going back eight years, this is literally the beginning of the podcast.

101
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:22.930
When it was just, you were one of the, like the first groups of interviews,

102
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:25.330
because I was just kind of talking with my friends.

103
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:27.730
Most of the time back then episode 4, 25.

104
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.653
<v 0>It didn't.</v>

105
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.440
<v 1>Have, um, I mean, it wasn't, it didn't have an impact on culture.</v>

106
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:35.230
It was just a silly thing that we were doing.

107
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.570
And so to talk to you about something that meant something to me and

108
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:44.020
for to see that you've been just swinging,

109
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.040
duking it out all these years know when you watch the documentary,

110
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:51.580
you get a real sense of how long this has been a part of your life.

111
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:53.410
It's crazy goosebumps.

112
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:56.590
You've even got your even rocking the glasses old man style.

113
00:05:56.591 --> 00:06:00.590
Now I bought these pink coming on forever, and now you're rocking so gray.

114
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.430
Now you're rocking glasses like this. It's it's really nuts, man. When,

115
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.050
when you look at the overall time spent battling this out,

116
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.940
I can't think of another person that's more on the forefront of a

117
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.700
Marine mammal captivity than you are.

118
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.860
<v 0>And again, I have to you to thank for all of that.</v>

119
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.260
<v 1>Um, so now I have you to thank, I wouldn't have,</v>

120
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.650
I would just been just talking about it. I would, uh, I mean,

121
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.580
I never thought that it would have an impact. I didn't, you know, it was,

122
00:06:29.581 --> 00:06:31.250
it wasn't a plan, right?

123
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.150
<v 0>And he was a second UDM to me. I thought, this is it. This is my chance.</v>

124
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.420
And then years went by and it occurred to me. I'm going to have to go again.

125
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.010
It doesn't end. And I came back and then the bills start piling up again.

126
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.520
And then I got to come back. This is now the fifth time I've been here, Joe.

127
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:48.050
I will say that it's crazy. I will say this.

128
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.810
You have the most influential podcast in the world.

129
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.880
The fact that I've had to come here five times will tell you just how much abuse

130
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:59.720
that it is that I've endured systematic abuse through both the courts. You know,

131
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.740
Marine lands, lawyer,

132
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.360
Andrew Burns is really good at doing what he does,

133
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.390
which is abuse the system. And, you know,

134
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:12.890
by virtue of I'm still here accruing inordinate amounts of,

135
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.510
of debt for a lawsuit that can easily be beat, uh,

136
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:20.810
resolved. It's a trespassing wall, a lawsuit. I never,

137
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.340
I never stepped foot on the property.

138
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.150
There isn't an iota of evidence that I've been presented in a multi-million

139
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:29.300
dollar lawsuit against me that I'm able to defend against. There's nothing,

140
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.320
it's all fiction.

141
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.460
They're literally created a story about me and are using the courts to in every

142
00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:36.500
which way. Silence me.

143
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.520
<v 1>And what's crazy is during this time the owners died from the time you came in</v>

144
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:44.660
the podcast, way back eight years ago, till now the owners now dead,

145
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.840
the guy that you were calling out on the podcast back then,

146
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.470
and the guy who's in the documentary, you see him and you,

147
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:55.280
you see as just his demeanor and his attitude and everything about it.

148
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:59.030
It's just, and now the fact that he's gone, but yet the lawsuit rages on,

149
00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.780
and that's.

150
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.410
<v 0>What screams that this is now personal lawyers. Uh,</v>

151
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.550
the reputation is everything.

152
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.470
Greenland's lawyer thought this would go away a long time ago because it's not.

153
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.450
And because I've taken a lot of options away from him as I continue down this

154
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:19.010
very long process, uh, I think he's getting nervous a little bit.

155
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.060
This has become a hallmark lawsuit in Canada. A lot of eyes are on, on,

156
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.520
on what he's doing and there's going to be a lot more after this.

157
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.880
And in a lot of ways, he's making himself famous for all the wrong reasons,

158
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:30.830
but I'm happy to be on the show to help make that happen.

159
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.120
<v 1>Well, it's,</v>

160
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.100
there's no good side to keeping those animals in

161
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:40.640
captivity is no good side to be running a place like Marine land. There's no,

162
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.870
there's no upside it's. I mean, the video alone, if you watch the documentary,

163
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.460
the video alone of the, the damage, their skin,

164
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:53.330
when they're using chlorine and seeing those animals bleeding and seeing those

165
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:57.660
animals getting forced fed there's no defending it. You can't defend that.

166
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.553
It's not.

167
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.970
And we have this concept of intelligence based on our own ability to manipulate

168
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:04.080
the environment around us.

169
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.880
Our concept of intelligence is based on their ability to build things and drive

170
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.170
a car and fly a plane. And that's how we, we,

171
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.690
we need to see manipulation in order to, to do,

172
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:17.730
to believe that it's intelligent life,

173
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.050
but these animals speak in a way that they've been mean.

174
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.280
Lily was trying to decipher dolphin intelligence in the 1960s.

175
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.160
They still don't know what the they're saying.

176
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.560
They've determined that there's some sort of,

177
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.990
they have dialects and they have the different accents for different

178
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:39.690
regions, but they don't know what they're saying. They still don't.

179
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:42.150
These are insanely intelligent animals.

180
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.440
<v 0>I don't want to say, give up on the idea of interpreting language necessarily,</v>

181
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:49.260
but the idea that we can attribute words to their sounds is just not,

182
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.420
it's not the thing to do. And again,

183
00:09:51.421 --> 00:09:53.610
I'm not gonna take anything away from scientists are doing this, of course,

184
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:56.040
but I can, I can attest that in my experience, being there,

185
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:59.210
the things that I took note of in, in terms of how they communicated it,

186
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.520
I can tell you when a dolphin was sad, angry, excited,

187
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.770
all of these things I can tell you. I mean, I can,

188
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.240
I can attribute what I believe that to have been now in my experience. Yeah.

189
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.430
I would say that that whole.

190
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.110
