00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. When you're writing a book,</v>

2
00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:05.820
you're literally inside working all the time.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.550
<v 1>Yeah. So explain to people what the book is.</v>

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.690
<v 0>So the book is called the end of gender. And before I go any further,</v>

5
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:16.440
I'm going to explain the title because some people, I think misinterpret what I,

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.970
when I announced it on social media,

7
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:21.090
some people were getting upset because I think they thought I was taking a very,

8
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.100
very far left, progressive view. And I,

9
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:26.490
I consider myself to be a liberal I'm definitely not far left, but you know,

10
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:30.030
I have liberal values. I'm pro science. And so the end of gender,

11
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:31.890
I think people thought that I meant,

12
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:35.280
I was saying that gender is basically whatever you want it to be.

13
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:38.640
It's based solely in self identification. You know,

14
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.030
there's no tethering to biology and that is not what I'm saying with the book at

15
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:46.080
all. And I think if anyone's ever read my columns or seen my appearances,

16
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:49.230
or they listened to the talk that I had with you last time I was on your show,

17
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.730
that's definitely not what I'm saying.

18
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:54.060
I'm saying the complete opposite that the fact that science denial and

19
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:57.210
misinformation about gender is so prominent now is actually affecting,

20
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.180
is really poorly affecting our ability to understand gender.

21
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:04.080
And that's leading to the demise of our understanding of it. It inaccurate way.

22
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.430
If.

23
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.380
<v 1>You don't mind, just to, just to start things off,</v>

24
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:08.720
will you please give your credentials and tell people what you do?

25
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.820
<v 0>Yeah. So I have a PhD in sexual neuroscience research. Um,</v>

26
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.800
I made the transition from academic being an academic sex researcher to

27
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:22.040
being a journalist. So now I write about the science of sex and gender.

28
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.670
I read about the politicization of science and academic censorship.

29
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.050
And so now I have this book out and I can talk a bit about how I got here,

30
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:31.150
if that would be helpful.

31
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.050
<v 2>Sure, sure. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.120
<v 0>Yeah. So, uh, when I was doing my PhD, I very much,</v>

33
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.800
I loved being a sex researcher.

34
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:41.300
I really thought I was going to stay in academia.

35
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.870
And in the last few years I noticed that there had been a change in the climate

36
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.540
in terms of what people could study,

37
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.510
what people could talk about as scientific experts.

38
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.620
And one area in particular was about gender transition in children.

39
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.060
So every single mainstream news piece was saying that for these children who say

40
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:00.380
they're born in the wrong body,

41
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.350
the best approach for them would be early transitioning.

42
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:07.820
So that means to take on a name, a new name, identify as the opposite sex.

43
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.100
Usually get a haircut, start dressing like the opposite sex.

44
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.140
But from a scientific perspective,

45
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.980
all of the research actually shows that most of these kids,

46
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.760
the vast majority of them are more likely to grow up, to be gay in adulthood.

47
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.140
They're not going to be transgender.

48
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.630
And at that time there was literally maybe one or two news articles that called

49
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:29.750
into question this narrative of early transitioning.

50
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.200
So I wrote an op-ed about this citing the scientific research.

51
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.210
And I asked my colleagues and mentors in academia, you know, what do you think?

52
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:41.390
I knew that there was going to be some backlash to it. Um,

53
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.700
and one of my mentors said to me, cause I said,

54
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:47.870
should I wait until I have tenure to put something like this out? And he said,

55
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:52.130
nowadays, tenure is not going to protect you. So that sealed my decision.

56
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.540
I published the piece.

57
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.930
And then from there I made the transition to journalism and I haven't looked

58
00:02:56.931 --> 00:02:57.764
back.

59
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.480
<v 1>It's a very strange time when it comes to talking about certain subjects,</v>

60
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.290
because it doesn't matter what the science is. There's a, there, there,

61
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.610
there are specific narratives that you have to adhere to in today's climate.

62
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.180
You know, I like you am also left, but when you,

63
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.370
when it comes to saying like far left,

64
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:20.050
like far left is a different thing now than it used to be far left, used to be,

65
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.170
I mean, 10, just 10, 15 years ago, it was a different animal.

66
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.600
And I knew a lot of people that are far left now,

67
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.510
far left associate with lunacy. It's like,

68
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.760
I look at it the same way I look at far, right?

69
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.340
I look at far right extremists and far left extremists,

70
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.140
but something happened where far left ideology has permeated our

71
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:42.790
culture when it comes to gender. And I don't understand it. I don't,

72
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.570
if you don't adhere to this ideology,

73
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.430
people want to say that you're you have no compassion. You're evil.

74
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.330
You're bigoted.

75
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.640
I had Abigail shear on the podcast recently and she has she's great.

76
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:02.380
And she's very brave. And I saw what happens when you go against this narrative,

77
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:04.150
by having her on men's health,

78
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.230
wrote a piece about me saying I'm fanning the flames of hate because she was

79
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:11.140
talking about a 4000% increase,

80
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.910
4000% increase in teenage girls identifying as trans and

81
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:19.540
rapid onset gender dysphoria, which is real. I mean, this is,

82
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.300
this is a real scientific 70.

83
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.680
<v 0>Times, 70 times,</v>

84
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:25.980
what you would see in the general population in terms of people identifying as

85
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:26.814
transgender.

86
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.070
<v 1>And so it's amazing. Um,</v>

87
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.270
when she was talking about this in this very specific way,

88
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:37.860
talking about awkward teenage girls and about how these girls have

89
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.170
really odd situations in terms of the way they deal with people

90
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:44.004
socially,

91
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.630
and then all of a sudden they're praised for deciding that they're trans.

92
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.320
And then they get these clusters of friends that also decided they're trans,

93
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.290
which is very strange. It's just a very strange phenomenon,

94
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:59.700
but you're not even allowed to talk about it. So if men's health, which is,

95
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.730
it's a men's magazine is going to write articles,

96
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.150
calling you a hateful person because you're discussing it.

97
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:09.960
There was no hate in that podcast at all. It was just discussing it, like,

98
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.320
what is causing this? Why is this and what,

99
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:18.290
what can be done and why are we so quick to just, I mean, we,

100
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.960
we, we can assume that people are troubled in all sorts of different ways,

101
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.380
but we can't assume they're ever troubled when it comes to gender. It's,

102
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.760
it's very bizarre.

103
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.080
<v 0>I think what you were saying with why it's gone so far left.</v>

104
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:35.250
I do think a lot of this is coming from empathy, which is a good thing.

105
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.140
And I have to say, you know, I,

106
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.420
with regard to the issue of transitioning children,

107
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.220
I do support traditioning and adults.

108
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.330
I think it can help adults who are transgender. I think if you were an adult,

109
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.010
you it's, your decision is your body.

110
00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:48.720
It's no one's place to tell you what to do.

111
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.120
But I think a lot of this is coming from,

112
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:55.440
so I grew up in the gay community and I remember seeing how homophobic people

113
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:59.630
could be toward my friends. And I think things have changed.

114
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.810
Things have gotten better in some ways I think homophobia still exists.

115
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:05.540
And we can talk about that because I do talk about how that affects a lot of

116
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.260
what we're seeing in the book. But I think for a lot of people,

117
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:12.170
they look at that and they say, okay, we were wrong about that.

118
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.540
We were wrong to treat gay people differently.

119
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.030
We were wrong to say that being gay, something you can change.

120
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.210
So now they've gone completely in the opposite direction saying, okay,

121
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.110
no matter what anyone says with regard to their identity,

122
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.590
with regard to their gender, this is something that we should not challenge.

123
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.560
We should fully support. And if you question it in any way,

124
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.280
even in the most nuanced or sensitive way, as I tried to, and I said, thank you,

125
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:36.080
do that's still not acceptable.

126
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.120
<v 1>Yeah. That's, what's strange. It's, it's an ideology. It's rigid.</v>

127
00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:41.140
It's like a religion.

128
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.260
<v 0>It is. It is. I think I find people who are, you know,</v>

129
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.970
middle of the road. They're not sure what to think.

130
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.390
If they read my work or they talk to me, they say, oh wow. I had never,

131
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.820
I never realized that. I didn't know the science said that.

132
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.730
And they changed their perspective. But I think for some people,

133
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.000
if they are very much invested in the identity or very,

134
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.420
very invested in activism or for whatever reason,

135
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.660
this ideology means something to them, it's, you cannot,

136
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.740
you just cannot reason with them. It doesn't matter what the science says.

137
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.340
They will find something to pick at. And especially with desistence,

138
00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:17.140
which is that, that, um,

139
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.620
the research I was mentioning where it shows that most kids will not feel gender

140
00:07:20.621 --> 00:07:24.910
dysphoric anymore. When they reach puberty, they w they just, people,

141
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:27.880
some people can not accept it and they will call you transphobic.

142
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.180
They'll call you bigoted. And, you know, I don't think I'm any of those things.

143
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:35.500
I'm really just trying to help prevent these children from making potentially a

144
00:07:35.501 --> 00:07:37.270
very bad decision that they're going to regret.

145
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.620
And especially now we're seeing in the UK that this is happening where more di

146
00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:45.280
transitioners are saying, this was something I regret. This was a mistake.

147
00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:48.550
Why did the adults not challenge me? I really think so. Right now,

148
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.250
we're in August, 2020, I think within the next five years,

149
00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:52.300
or maybe a little bit longer,

150
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.170
we're going to be seeing an explosion of children coming out and saying,

151
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.600
I did not want to transition. This was a mistake.

152
00:07:58.601 --> 00:07:59.890
And it's really going to be awful.

153
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:00.281
<v 1>Well,</v>

154
00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:03.940
we're already seeing that there's a lawsuit that was a very prominent in the UK

155
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:06.760
recently about a young girl who transitioned to be,

156
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.650
do you know the lawsuit I'm talking about? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's,

157
00:08:10.651 --> 00:08:15.460
it's heartbreaking because they she's essentially ruined her body

158
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.640
to the point where she's not going to be able to have children. She's she'll,

159
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.190
you know, she, and in many cases,

160
00:08:21.191 --> 00:08:24.040
a lot of these girls can't have orgasms ever again. No.

161
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.160
<v 0>Exactly. But I think in north America,</v>

162
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.880
we are still very much in denial about those. If, I mean,

163
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.790
whenever I'm on a show, if I'm on TV and I talk about this,

164
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.580
the backlash after is just crazy. And I'm thinking people need to wake up,

165
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.960
I'm trying to stop this from happening. Right?

166
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:43.270
The whole point of writing this book and saying these things is trying to

167
00:08:43.271 --> 00:08:44.350
prevent what's about to happen.

168
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.270
<v 1>Yeah. Um, the backlash is it's, it's very strange because, um,</v>

169
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.040
a lot of the backlash is from trans folks and it seems that they equate

170
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.830
any criticism or any,

171
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.400
any examination of even children,

172
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.720
even small children transitioning to transphobia you, you must hate.

173
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.190
And I get there,

174
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.380
there has to be some trans people that as children knew that they were

175
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:14.310
women, or they were the opposite sex that they were in the wrong body.

176
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.940
There has to be the question. The question is no disagree with that.

177
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.330
I think we both don't the question is how many,

178
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.280
and how do they make that decision?

179
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.150
And how many have actually are actually being influenced by other factors?

180
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:29.400
External children are very malleable.

181
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.260
And that's part of the problem with making lifelong decisions as a six-year-old.

182
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.550
If you're a six year old male and you decide that you're a female and you go

183
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:39.530
through the transition and then,

184
00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:43.950
then you realize you're a gay man later in life, there's no recourse.

185
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:46.620
There's nothing you can do to rectify that. That's,

186
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:49.670
what's terrifying about this and that you're not allowed to talk about it.

187
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.990
You're not, you're not allowed to say that even.

188
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.730
<v 0>Right. Right. And when I do point that out,</v>

189
00:09:55.731 --> 00:09:59.480
people say that I'm using the gay community to try and as a shield or something

190
00:09:59.481 --> 00:10:00.740
like that. But it,

191
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.430
medical professionals need to be the ones to do their job because it is their

192
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:04.880
job.

193
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.530
They should be doing proper assessments with these children and adults to,

194
00:10:09.531 --> 00:10:12.350
to determine, you know, what is the best way forward for you?

195
00:10:12.351 --> 00:10:15.500
And that's the only way they can really determine on a case by case basis,

196
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.780
whether transitioning is going to help somebody,

197
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.520
but they can't do their jobs right now,

198
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.850
everyone I know that is ethical in the field has left,

199
00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:26.960
or they stop working with these patients because they don't feel they can do

200
00:10:26.961 --> 00:10:27.890
their job properly.

201
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.950
So what you have instead is is the people who are currently operating are

202
00:10:30.951 --> 00:10:34.760
activists, and they will really facilitate whatever patient wants them to do.

203
00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:38.120
Whether or not that may or may not be the right thing for them.

204
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.050
<v 1>Yeah. How did we get to this point now? How did we get this point? First of all,</v>

205
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.090
an academia you come from academia.

206
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.510
How did we get to this point where some subjects cannot be discussed,

207
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.900
where like you were talking to that other professor and they were saying,

208
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.540
even if you get tenure, this is protect you.
