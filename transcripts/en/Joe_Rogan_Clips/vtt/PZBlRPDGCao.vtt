00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience love it. Before we get.</v>

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.100
<v 1>Into sort of the deep philosophy point. And this is,</v>

3
00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:08.900
this is actually really the, the biggest problem right now.

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.540
And the racism point is the shifting definition of racism.

5
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.720
So I had the unfortunate experience of actually reading one of the best-selling

6
00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:16.610
books in the country. Robin's Angela is white fragility.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.060
And let me just tell you a greater pile of horseshit has never been produced by

8
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:22.370
a bevy of horses. It is an awful book,

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.580
and it is basically rooted in the same theory as Hebrew Kennedys,

10
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.180
how to be an anti-racist the,

11
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:30.740
the basic definition of racism changes in this theory. So racism,

12
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.250
you and I were sitting here discussing racism and the way I defined racism,

13
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.570
it's probably the same way you defined racism.

14
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.800
You believe in the inferiority or superiority of a group based on race of an

15
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:42.560
individual based on their membership in that group too. Right? That'd be racism.

16
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.440
I believe that you're inferior or you're superior based on your race.

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.240
End of story. Right? That's that's racist.

18
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.860
So Robin's Angelo and Ebrum Kennedy redefined racism to mean any

19
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.930
societal structure that results in a racial inequality is itself racist.

20
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.150
So any structure that results in a not exact proportion between whites

21
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:07.100
and blacks, the NBA races. Exactly, exactly. The answer is kind of, yes,

22
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:10.340
except that the NBA is not racist because obviously it benefits black people,

23
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.290
right? I mean, now this is not racist,

24
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.650
except the root cause to meritocracy is the reason the NBA is not racist,

25
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.810
but Robin D'Angelo and Kennedy both suggest that meritocracy is an aspect

26
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:21.644
of whiteness.

27
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.310
They say that meritocracy and individual are aspects of whiteness because these

28
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:26.121
institutions,

29
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:29.900
things like meritocracy and individualism and not seeing people's colors,

30
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.130
these just reinforce hierarchies that end with disparate outcomes.

31
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.650
And so what they say is in order to be anti-racist,

32
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.800
you have to want to tear down the entire system. They literally say this,

33
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:44.120
I'm not, I'm not really. I know that I'm not misidentifying the argument,

34
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.040
because again, I've read their books. The,

35
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.630
the basic notion that to be anti-racist, you have to tear down free markets,

36
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.330
or you have to tear down free speech, or you have to.

37
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.630
And what that means is that, of course, that anytime there's riding and looting,

38
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.600
that's really just an expression of outrage at the broader American system.

39
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.390
And so it justifies that sort of stuff. This is why you saw Nicole Hannah Jones,

40
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:04.760
that in fact, the editor of the New York times 16,

41
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:07.970
19 project lady tweeting out that she appreciated that people were calling these

42
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:09.170
the 1619 riots.

43
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.370
Because once you say America is rooted in slavery and rooted in evil and a

44
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:14.900
terrible, horrible, no good, very bad place,

45
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.770
then robbing a shop is just the latest iteration of you fighting the system,

46
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.610
explain.

47
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.650
<v 2>The 16, 19 correlation to people if.</v>

48
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.560
<v 1>You weren't sure. So the 1619 project is,</v>

49
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:26.330
is something put forward by the New York times. It's not good history.

50
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:28.310
There are four Pulitzer prize winning historian who said,

51
00:02:28.311 --> 00:02:29.210
this is not good history.

52
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.570
The basic argument is the United States was not founded in 1776 with the

53
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:34.220
principles of the declaration of independence.

54
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.250
The count and the country was actually founded in 16,

55
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:40.970
19 with the importation of African slaves to American shores because that's when

56
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:43.490
the first African slave arrived in the United States was 1619.

57
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.350
So the idea is that the entire history of America is a history of a system

58
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.660
that is endemically white supremacist.

59
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.170
And that all of the declaration of independence is basically a lie that the

60
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:57.170
principles of all men are created equal. That was a lie when it was written.

61
00:02:57.171 --> 00:02:57.591
And it's a lie.

62
00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:01.270
Now that the idea that we have rights that preexist government that's a lie.

63
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.470
All of these things are lies.

64
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:06.250
The constitution was built in order to enshrine white supremacy and no evolution

65
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:07.560
has taken place. So they don't, they, they,

66
00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:12.370
they essentially make the argument that from 16, 19 to 2020 is a continuum.

67
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.940
Racism has gone underground a little bit, but it's still there. And still,

68
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.740
it's still implicit in all of our systems.

69
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:21.280
So the 1619 project has that says blaming literally everything on racism.

70
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.250
So disparities in maternal mortality between black women and white women,

71
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.640
which by the way, exist in Europe and in Canada, that's due to American racism.

72
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.290
Traffic patterns in the United States is due to systematic American racism.

73
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.300
Every racial disparity is attributable to a system that was rooted in slavery.

74
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.290
Now the traditional notion of America is that America was founded in 1776.

75
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.970
And that the story of America is that America did tolerate the great original

76
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:48.070
sin of slavery up until the civil war,

77
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:52.180
and then tolerated Jim Crow up until the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

78
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.370
And that is a great stain and a blot on America.

79
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.150
But the story of America is trying to fulfill the promises of the declaration of

80
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:00.940
independence over time, make those promises available to everybody.

81
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.010
And this isn't my argument. This is Martin Luther king Jr.

82
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:04.300
His argument when he talks on the,

83
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:07.180
in the March in Washington about fulfilling the promissory note of the

84
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:09.670
declaration of independence, he says, we're here to cash the check, right?

85
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.820
You issued us the check, and then you didn't let black Americans be Americans.

86
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.340
We're here to cash. The check is the argument. Frederick Douglas,

87
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.960
the freed slave makes in 1852,

88
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.480
he makes a famous speech before slavery has ended. And he says,

89
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:22.810
July 4th doesn't mean anything to black Americans because we're not included in

90
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:24.520
the bargain, include us in the bargain.

91
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.280
The story of America is the declaration of independence,

92
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:30.280
those principles that we should all basically still agree on because they're

93
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:33.130
pretty good principles, free speech, free assembly,

94
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.750
all the things you see in the constitution that those things brought about

95
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.640
greater freedom and prosperity than anything else.

96
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.440
And helped us overcome that sins that are present in all human societies and

97
00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:47.080
were present in the United States in extreme ways as well. But that's the,

98
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:48.100
that's the counter narrative, right?

99
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:51.130
The 1619 project says that all that was basically nonsense.

100
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:55.360
And that America is just a history of whites keeping blacks down and that no

101
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:58.570
progress has essentially been made. If there is progress, it's mostly a lie.

102
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.370
And so every disparity now can be attributed to historic disparities between

103
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:04.440
white and black. Is.

104
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.460
<v 2>There a middle ground D so if we look at</v>

105
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.080
1776 and we look at the declaration of independence and we look at America today

106
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:15.150
in 2020, we,

107
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.650
there clearly is some impact in the echoes of

108
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:22.410
slavery. And then after that Jim Crow,

109
00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:26.430
there's clearly some impact in these deeply impoverished communities that don't

110
00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:27.900
seem to advance. Yes.

111
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.400
<v 1>So the, to, to, to make the argument about institutional racism there,</v>

112
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:33.870
there's a couple of ways you can read this when people say systemic racism or

113
00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:34.920
institutional racism.

114
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.530
I usually ask them to be a little more specific in what they mean,

115
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.440
because there are a few ways you can read that one is history has impact.

116
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.390
Of course, that's true, right? That's true for everybody.

117
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.470
It's true in your family history. But if you have a grandfather who went to,

118
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.050
who went to prison on a particular charge that leads to poverty for your

119
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:51.840
parents, which led to more poverty for you, right? People have histories,

120
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:53.820
those histories are embedded in their life experiences.

121
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.940
And that's true for societies as well. All of that is for sure. True.

122
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.190
Then there's the question as to whether the institutions today are racist and

123
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:02.870
that's not quite the same thing, right?

124
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:06.650
Because history has consequences is not the same thing as saying the rules today

125
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:09.230
are racist because the rules today are not racist.

126
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:11.690
Actually the roles today are quite not racist. So.

127
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.410
<v 2>Historically it's fairly recent.</v>

128
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.260
If you go from the civil rights movement to 2020,

129
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.470
we're really not talking about how much time it was taught three generations,

130
00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:21.730
50 plus years.

131
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.050
<v 1>60 Years. Yeah. 50 plus in the world of, you know,</v>

132
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.750
the history of human history. It's not very small.

133
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.590
<v 2>Amount of time, right?</v>

134
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.150
So clearly there's some impact of both racism and Jim Crow laws.

135
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.510
So that, that's where I'm saying there's a middle ground.

136
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.740
<v 1>Yeah. Then, and it's in depth.</v>

137
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.290
It is important for people on my side of the aisle,

138
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:44.440
conservatives to acknowledge and recognize the importance of,

139
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.020
of history in people's living situations now.

140
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.570
And it's important for people on the other side of the aisle to at the same

141
00:06:49.571 --> 00:06:52.810
time, not attribute every single thing to history, because.

142
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.970
<v 2>There's always something like that.</v>

143
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.980
There's always like extremes on each position. And the truth lies somewhere in.

144
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.813
<v 1>The middle.</v>

145
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.870
I think that it lies as far in the dead center of that as people I think want it

146
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:08.950
to what I mean by that is the problems that have played communities in the

147
00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:10.870
United States, not just the black community in the United States,

148
00:07:10.871 --> 00:07:12.640
but problems of racism or problems of sexism,

149
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.390
the way those get alleviated is people making better choices over time, right?

150
00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:18.790
That is the problem. That that's the way that those issues get alleviate.

151
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.110
When Jews arrived in the United States.

152
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.780
And though in the early 20th century to talk with my people, when they,

153
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.640
when they came, they were impoverished,

154
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:27.040
they didn't speak the language they're banned from country clubs.

155
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.500
There was open discrimination against them. They were banned from Harvard,

156
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.680
right? Harvard law school had quotas on Jews. The,

157
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.580
the way to fight against that is to make good decisions.

158
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.080
And so the,

159
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.680
you fight against the system to make sure that the system has rules that apply

160
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.020
equally to everyone, right? But you clearly.

161
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.950
<v 2>See that there's a big difference between people coming over here willingly and</v>

162
00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:52.930
doing so in order to better their lives versus someone whose ancestors were

163
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:55.660
dragged over here to be sold as property.

164
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.080
And then dealing with the repercussions of that,

165
00:07:59.081 --> 00:08:04.060
being your family history and red line laws and all the other things that were

166
00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:07.360
put in place to sort of keep them in very specific areas,

167
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:11.590
which to this day remain crime-ridden gang ridden

168
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.200
deeply impoverished. Well.

169
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.951
<v 1>That's true.</v>

170
00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:17.740
But the question is how much of that is historic redlining and how much of that

171
00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:20.380
is an 18 year old kid today deciding to pep a gun and shoot somebody.

172
00:08:20.381 --> 00:08:21.100
But how much.

173
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.060
<v 2>Of that 18 year old kid today deciding to pick up a gun and shoot some money is</v>

174
00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:30.010
based on him growing up in this up environment where that's, what he models,

175
00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:34.420
where everything around him is crime and gangs. And you imitate your atmosphere,

176
00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:35.380
which all humans.

177
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.840
<v 1>Right? But the answer is there's only one way to break that chain.</v>

178
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.320
What is that way is to not pick up a gun and shoot somebody.

179
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.270
<v 2>Simplistic way of looking at it. If you're on the outside of that community.</v>

180
00:08:46.271 --> 00:08:49.960
And you're not one of those 18 year old kids that grows up with the incredible

181
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:53.470
influence of all the people around him. And that's all you see and that's all,

182
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:54.790
you know, well, but.

183
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.810
<v 1>The problem is the only way that's going to be the thing that your kid doesn't</v>

184
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:01.110
know is for you not to do it at some point, personal agency has to come in.

185
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.280
It does, but education, education.

186
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.830
<v 2>And teaching them about personal agency and,</v>

187
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:11.780
and letting them understand that there is a way out of this and that the path

188
00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:15.050
that they see being replicated over and over again,

189
00:09:15.051 --> 00:09:17.750
by these people that wind up dying young, that wind up going to jail,

190
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.280
that there are other options.

191
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.510
There's a lot of kids that never get that other information, or if they get it,

192
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.170
they get little blips of it. But the vast majority of the information,

193
00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:29.150
the vast majority of the influence they get is.

194
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.010
<v 1>Terrible. Well, th I, I totally agree with this.</v>

195
00:09:31.011 --> 00:09:34.310
And this is why I think the worst thing that you can say to a kid is you're born

196
00:09:34.311 --> 00:09:36.800
behind the eight ball. And no matter what you do, you're not going to succeed,

197
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.570
right? That's literally the worst thing you can say to a kid.

198
00:09:38.571 --> 00:09:41.990
What you should be saying is look at how your grandfather was born behind the

199
00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:45.500
eight fall and look how hard he had to work in order to get ahead and look at

200
00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:46.490
all the options true.

201
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:51.230
<v 2>Though. But if your grandfather wasn't ahead, didn't get ahead.</v>

202
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.540
If your grandfather was in and out of jail,

203
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.080
if your father was in and out of jail, everyone around you is like that.

204
00:09:57.081 --> 00:10:01.400
If there's literally no influence, that's positive in your life.

205
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.190
The idea of saying to a kid like that, Hey,

206
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.520
don't pick up a gun and shoot somebody. It's way.

207
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.960
That's way too simplistic aversion of, of their future. In my, in my.

208
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.360
<v 1>My problem is I don't see an alternative solution.</v>

209
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:16.520
I wouldn't tell talking about solution. Absolutely.

210
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.140
<v 2>I think an alternative solution is there has to be some sort of large</v>

211
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.930
scale intervention in these communities to do something about what,

212
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.410
what, what has already been set in motion and the momentum that keeps continuing

213
00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:33.800
decade after decade, I don't know what could be done, but that that's.

214
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.380
<v 1>The problem is that I think that a lot of the solutions that have been proposed</v>

215
00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:38.750
have already been tried, meaning that, okay, so for example,

216
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.500
LBJ thought that the way to alleviate a lot of these inequalities was the war on

217
00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:45.290
poverty. And he openly talked about this. He talked about,

218
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.210
he gave a speech very famously in which he said,

219
00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:50.960
we're trying to guarantee equality of outcome, not just equality of opportunity,

220
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.130
equality of outcome.

221
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.300
And you can't hold the race where somebody is starting 20 yards behind and then

222
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.580
fire the gun and say, okay, then 10 equal race, right?

223
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.460
So you have to get the person who's 20 yards behind to actually get up to the

224
00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:03.860
starting line so that they're equal. And so the idea was,

225
00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:06.410
we're going to fight this war on poverty and alleviate poverty,

226
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.060
largely through transfer payments. And,

227
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:12.560
and through the government taking a forcible step in favor of alleviating

228
00:11:12.561 --> 00:11:15.590
people's lives. We've now spent $22 trillion in the war on poverty.

229
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.530
And we have about the same number of black Americans living under the poverty

230
00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:21.980
line as we're living under the poverty line. By the late seventies, the, the,

231
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.250
the real issues that that are inter that are,

232
00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.770
that are creating intergenerational poverty. Everyone knows this,

233
00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:28.760
but remains true.

234
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.820
The number one predictor of intergenerational poverty in the United States

235
00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:32.780
remain single motherhood.

236
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.720
The single mother had written the black community was 20% in 1960.

237
00:11:35.721 --> 00:11:39.020
It is upward of 70% today. That's not unique to the black community, by the way,

238
00:11:39.021 --> 00:11:40.100
it's true in the white community as well.

239
00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:43.970
The fi 5% of white kids were born out of wedlock in 1960. Today,

240
00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:47.930
it's upward of 40%. That is not something has happened.

241
00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:50.750
And it is not a matter of increased racism.

242
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.200
That's not happening because of increased racism, right?

243
00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:58.180
Th th that is happening because there has been a cultural change that does

244
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:00.310
not place tremendous emphasis for black or white,

245
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:03.160
or for anybody on personal responsibility and personal agency.

246
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.590
There needs to be a mindset change. We do this by the way,

247
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.180
in all other areas of American life,

248
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.060
except for the most important decisions in the area of sports,

249
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:10.900
nobody does this routine.

250
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.510
And there there's a point shall be steel makes in the area of sports.

251
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.630
If a kid is not, does not have a good jump shot. Nobody says to him,

252
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:16.961
you know what?

253
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:19.120
You don't have a good jump shot because your father didn't have the jump shot.

254
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:20.530
His grandfather didn't have a good jump shot.

255
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.740
And the game is biased against you. We say, okay, if you want to be on the team,

256
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.110
you're going to have to learn to shoot a jump shot, right? That,

257
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.710
that sounds harsh. That sounds bad, but boards.

258
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.320
<v 2>Are different. And here's why sports are different. Cause sports,</v>

259
00:12:31.321 --> 00:12:34.680
you enter them independently of your culture. You, you, you,

260
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:39.630
you base what you're trying to do on the parameters of the rules and the

261
00:12:39.631 --> 00:12:41.880
people that you're competing against. That's how you look at it.

262
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.070
So whatever culture you're from you,

263
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.420
you walk into this new thing with this very rigid set of rules.

264
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:50.940
<v 1>[Inaudible] white people,</v>

265
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.420
or Jews or Asians have a monopoly on valuing education or a monopoly on hard

266
00:12:54.421 --> 00:12:55.680
work or punctuality or anything.

267
00:12:55.681 --> 00:13:00.450
I think that black people have exactly the same capacity as any

268
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.400
people of any other race to do all of these things.

269
00:13:02.401 --> 00:13:05.040
And those are the preconditions for success. You either meet them or you don't.

270
00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:06.330
I mean, that's true for everybody, but.

271
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.561
<v 2>For success,</v>

272
00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:12.150
but don't you think that a lot of that is predicated on the environment that you

273
00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:15.510
develop in and the people that you're around and the,

274
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.840
the lives that you imitate and the influences that you have around you,

275
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.250
someone has to do something to influence those kids in a different way. Look,

276
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.600
I was very fortunate when I was young that I discovered martial arts and it kept

277
00:13:27.601 --> 00:13:31.860
me from being what I could have potentially been a bad kid.

278
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.590
It gave me something to focus on. There's an,

279
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.300
I didn't grow up in a bad environment, but it wasn't the best.

280
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.320
There's a lot of people out there that grow up in horrific environments and they

281
00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:45.960
never have that thing. They never have something.

282
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:50.160
They don't have a father around, or they don't have a mother around or whatever,

283
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.730
whatever bad influences they have are overwhelming. And they,

284
00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:56.020
they don't, it's,

285
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.420
it's very difficult for someone to just air quotes,

286
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.530
get their together. It's very difficult for sure. That's why to this day,

287
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.900
there's so many books about losing weight.

288
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.260
Don't you think everybody wants to lose weight. That's fat. They do. They,

289
00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:14.640
everybody who's fat wants to be thin. They do, but it's hard for sure.

290
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.130
And that's nothing in comparison to changing your life.

291
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.890
<v 1>Whole life. But you would say about somebody losing weight, you know,</v>

292
00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:20.461
it's not useful.

293
00:14:20.461 --> 00:14:23.970
Here is lamenting how bad your family has had it with regard to losing weight.

294
00:14:23.971 --> 00:14:25.830
Like at a certain point, if you want to lose the weight,

295
00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:27.210
you got to figure out a way to lose the weight.

296
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.970
<v 2>Yeah. But this is based on the information that I have.</v>

297
00:14:29.971 --> 00:14:34.350
I have this vast scope of information that I've been able to absorb.

298
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:39.090
If you're in these isolated environments and everyone around you is involved in

299
00:14:39.091 --> 00:14:40.950
gangs and crime and drugs,

300
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.750
it's very difficult to model yourself after something that you don't see in real.

301
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.990
<v 1>Life. Totally true. Totally true. And that's why, again,</v>

302
00:14:48.991 --> 00:14:51.060
more information needs to get into areas.

303
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.430
I agree with a lot of the opportunities that needed to be provided by education,

304
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.950
getting people to be educated outside their local public school would be a good

305
00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:00.200
change. I mean, being able to like move outside your crap,

306
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.530
local public school and go somewhere else. The best.

307
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.910
<v 2>Influences for kids that grow up in these environments seem to be people that</v>

308
00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:11.230
have gotten out and then come back and talk to them and tell them how to.

309
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.530
<v 1>Do it, but this can be done. But to go back to the original conversation,</v>

310
00:15:14.531 --> 00:15:17.680
none of this has to do with telling kids that you live in an evil country,

311
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.360
that's seeking to keep you down. Well.

312
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.460
<v 2>Maybe not, but there,</v>

313
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.590
there has been a very small amount of emphasis placed on taking

314
00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:29.800
these impoverished communities and figuring out how to engineer them out of the

315
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.653
situation.

316
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.040
<v 1>That's true. So I don't think that's true. Yeah.</v>

317
00:15:33.041 --> 00:15:36.430
I mean the amount that we've spent on a federal level and a state level on

318
00:15:36.431 --> 00:15:39.790
educational programs and poverty programs over time,

319
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.610
but no on it on a year to year level, I mean, these are,

320
00:15:42.611 --> 00:15:44.110
these are enormous quantities of money.

321
00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:46.960
This is not a money and this is not really a money problem.

322
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.970
It really is not a money problem in just terms of,

323
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.340
you could sign everybody a check tomorrow, right? The, the predicate.

324
00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.210
So the predicate for the slavery reparations movement is exactly this sign.

325
00:15:55.211 --> 00:15:59.280
Everybody had $80,000 check and the problem will be alleviated. No,

326
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.560
I don't think that's, I don't think that's, I think they'll spend.

327
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.640
<v 2>$80,000 And they'll be right back where they started from.</v>

328
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.260
But I do think that there is an argument that there can be some way

329
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.130
of engineering, whether it's community centers or education,

330
00:16:12.131 --> 00:16:16.330
or doing something differently in these places to chip away at this problem.

331
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.580
<v 1>So on that stuff, we totally agree.</v>

332
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.150
The only point that I'm making about the 1619 project is when you teach people

333
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.300
that they are the victims of a society,

334
00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:29.050
it makes it very difficult for them to succeed. The story of,

335
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:33.970
of black America should be a story of unbelievably brave people triumphing over

336
00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:37.300
systems that sucked, right? I mean, that, that is the story of black America.

337
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.000
Most black Americans do not live under the poverty line in the United States.

338
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.530
There's a huge black middle class. There's a black upper-class. Yes. Let's.

339
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.520
<v 2>Just, let's simplify this if we can. Sure.</v>

340
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.510
If Ben Shapiro's the king of the world, how do you fix Baltimore?

341
00:16:49.511 --> 00:16:53.320
How do you fix Detroit? How do you fix the south side of Chicago?

342
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:57.730
<v 1>Okay. So here's the unpopular view, but it happens to be empirically, correct.</v>

343
00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.640
The first thing you have to do is you have to load the place of the police.

344
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.490
You gotta load the place with police because you have to stop crime.

345
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.940
Once you stop crime, then businesses are happy to invest in those areas.

346
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.580
You're not gonna get businesses to invest in those areas and provide jobs unless

347
00:17:09.581 --> 00:17:11.500
the crime is gone. You need, in fact,

348
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.470
one of the reasons that you have such a vast differential in racial crime in the

349
00:17:14.471 --> 00:17:16.210
United States is because of white racism.

350
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.720
And this is the point that Jane Levy writer for the LA times has made you should

351
00:17:19.721 --> 00:17:20.560
write a book called Ghettoside.

352
00:17:20.561 --> 00:17:23.800
And she points out that the reason that black crime was so high in the early

353
00:17:23.801 --> 00:17:27.490
20th century and late 19th century is because basically white communities said

354
00:17:27.491 --> 00:17:29.770
to black communities you're on your own right enjoy.

355
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.950
And so the prime rates ended up spiking because there were no police there.

356
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.860
You have to make sure that law abiding people are protected.

357
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.770
That law abiding businesses are protected. That people want to live there,

358
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.000
that people want to invest there.

359
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.660
You have to have a re-establishment of faith in churches, right?

360
00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:46.780
You need social institutions outside of government that are promoting things

361
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.130
like family. You need,

362
00:17:48.131 --> 00:17:51.660
you need more than one of the reasons you need more companies in these areas is

363
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:54.030
they can offer educational opportunities to kids,

364
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.570
internships deals to go to college and then come back and work for us for a

365
00:17:57.571 --> 00:17:59.340
couple of years, right? You need an opportunity.

366
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:01.530
The same way that opportunity is built anywhere else on earth,

367
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.360
you need to provide a safe space for business to work and for free speech to

368
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:09.240
flourish and for education to be valued, you need to go in,

369
00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:12.510
you need to make clear to every kid. If you graduate high school,

370
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.170
then you will have a shot at college, which by the way is 100% true today,

371
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.320
right? If you are a black head and you graduate high school with any level of

372
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:20.154
achievement,

373
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.740
you'll have a very solid shot of at least going to a community college.

374
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.070
And if you score even decently on the SATs of going to a very high level

375
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:26.491
college, right,

376
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:29.790
affirmative action programs are extraordinarily common across the United States.

377
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.530
But the first message is we are going to ensure that law and order prevail here,

378
00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:38.550
a safe space for life, Liberty, and property and ownership of private property.

379
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.370
And we are going to make sure that you, as a law abiding citizen,

380
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:44.790
have the opportunity to succeed because the biggest obstacle to young black kids

381
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:47.760
growing up in the inner city again, is not history. It is in the moment,

382
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.530
the drugs, the crime,

383
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.890
the fact that there are no fathers in a lot of these areas, Roland fryer,

384
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.160
black professor at Harvard has done excellent work showing that actually the

385
00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:59.060
number one factor in allowing kids to,

386
00:18:59.061 --> 00:19:01.770
to rise is not even having a father in the home and how many fathers there are

387
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:04.410
generally in the community. So you can, you can have a single mom,

388
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:08.400
but if there are a lot of other male father figures around that helps fill in

389
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.140
the gap, right? These, these are practical things,

390
00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.480
giving kids the ability to pick the school they go to.

391
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:14.310
So they don't have to go to the local crappy public school.

392
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:17.340
If it's a local crappy public school, there'll be a solution here.

393
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.320
But this all starts with the notion that it is not racist in the slightest to

394
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:24.180
suggest that law and order have to prevail.

395
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.540
And that law abiding people should be protected in their exercise of their

396
00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:28.130
rights.

397
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.960
<v 2>I think you're a hundred percent right on that. And I think,</v>

398
00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:32.990
although that might be an unpopular opinion. I agree with you.
