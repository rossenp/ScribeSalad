<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.800
<v 3>It's something that people used to call the addictive personality.</v>

3
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.640
We don't really call it that anymore.

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.160
We just use the idea of the disease model.

5
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.400
So we say that somebody has the disease of addiction.

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.160
It's a chronic relapsing and remitting problem.

7
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.710
People come to it with different degrees of vulnerability and the risk for it

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.750
can essentially be summarized as nature, nurture and neighborhood.

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.390
And just to briefly describe that if you have a biological parent or

10
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:36.350
grandparent with addiction,

11
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.670
you are increased risk compared the general population of getting addicted

12
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.020
yourself. If you have a co-occurring mental illness,

13
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.260
you are at increased risk of getting addicted.

14
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.740
If you have certain character traits, like you're more impulsive,

15
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.500
you have a hard time putting a break between the idea to do something and

16
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.740
actually doing it. You are, are you're at increased risk for addiction.

17
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.010
So that's kind of all in the sort of nature, um, risk at gory.

18
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.250
<v 0>There's also the nurture piece of it.</v>

19
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.650
So if you grow up in an environment where you experience a whole lot of trauma,

20
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.690
you are at increased risk for becoming addicted.

21
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.690
If you grow up in an environment where your caretakers model, um,

22
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.530
using drugs and alcohol or other addictive substances or behaviors as a coping,

23
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.760
you are an increased risk of becoming addicted,

24
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080
or even if they just implicitly condone it.

25
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.920
And then that brings us to the whole neighborhood idea.

26
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.520
And this I think is an really underrecognized aspect of our risk for addiction,

27
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.920
which is just simple access.

28
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.830
So if you live in an environment where you have more access to highly

29
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.390
reinforcing drugs and behaviors, you're more likely to try them.

30
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.790
And just simply in being exposed,

31
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.710
especially with the increasing potency variety and novelty of drugs today,

32
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.870
your increased risk of becoming addicted.

33
00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:58.710
So if you go see a doctor who's more free with their prescription pad,

34
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.870
you're exposed to opioids or benzos, you're more likely to, to get addicted.

35
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.220
If you grow up in a culture where people are playing a lot of video games,

36
00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:08.780
you're more likely to try them more likely to get addicted.

37
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:13.740
So this nature nurture and neighborhood are the risk factors, but again,

38
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:18.260
people bring different degrees of vulnerability to this problem of addiction.

39
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.060
And some people are more vulnerable than others.

40
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.450
And you may indeed be in that category, or you're just some, somebody who,

41
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.130
you know, once you find something that's reinforcing for you,

42
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:33.170
you just go and you just wanna do it again. And again, and again, when you say.

43
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.250
<v 1>Reinforcing, what do you mean.</v>

44
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.930
<v 0>By that? I mean, that it's rewarding in some way rewarding, right?</v>

45
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.610
So it's, it's, it's pleasurable at first.

46
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.960
Now the thing about addiction and the way that it changes our brains is that

47
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:53.480
that thing that initially is pleasurable and has us engaging in approach

48
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.633
behaviors.

49
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.720
If we continue to consume that substance or engage in that behavior,

50
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.120
it ultimately actually puts us in a dopamine deficit state,

51
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.480
such that we want to continue to do that behavior, not to feel good,

52
00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:10.840
but just to stop feeling bad. Mm.

53
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.400
And that's kind of one of the fundamental things about the disease of addiction.

54
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.470
It's innate vulnerability to start added to the

55
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.150
changes that occur in the brain as a result of ongoing consumption

56
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.110
of our drug and those brain changes are what drive continued compulsive.

57
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.050
<v 2>Use.</v>

58
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.950
So that's the difference between being enthusiastic about something that you

59
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.590
enjoy versus something that consumes your life.

60
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.660
So you're kind of chasing the dragon, like the initial fir,

61
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:44.700
like that's what they talk about it with heroin addiction, right?

62
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.220
Don't they say chasing the dragon. Yeah.

63
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.460
The initial rush that you get from the first, um,

64
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.140
uses of it, you're always chasing that,

65
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.780
but really what you're doing later on in life is just trying to not be sick.

66
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.850
Yes. Not having it in your body makes you feel too terrible.

67
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.170
<v 0>Right. So, so interesting that that term chasing the dragon,</v>

68
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.850
it comes in part from, as you describe,

69
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.330
like the elusiveness of trying to recreate that initial high,

70
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.330
which with continued use becomes harder and harder,

71
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.050
but it also literally comes from when heroin is inhaled.

72
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.360
So if you put it on a piece of tinfoil and you lighted underneath you get this

73
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:25.280
kind of smoke, then that plume looks like a Dragon's tale. Oh. So it's,

74
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.800
it's got a couple of different meanings, but yes. Um, I mean,

75
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.440
what you're saying is exactly right.

76
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.960
And the way that I describe this to patients and describe it to medical students

77
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.160
is imagine that in your brain, there's a balance, um,

78
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:41.230
kind of like a teeter-totter and a key its playground.

79
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:45.230
And one of the most interesting findings in neuroscience in the past 75 years is

80
00:04:45.231 --> 00:04:49.990
that pleasure and pain are co-located, which means the same parts of our brain.

81
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.550
That process pleasure also process pain.

82
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.910
And they work like opposite sides of a balance.

83
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.470
So when we do something that's rewarding or reinforcing or pleasurable

84
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.580
are balanced tips slightly to the side of pleasure,

85
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.220
we get a little release of dopamine,

86
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.700
the pleasure neurotransmitter in that part of our brain, our reward pathway.

87
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.180
And we feel good.

88
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.260
But the thing about that balance is that it wants to remain level and it,

89
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.900
and the brain will work very hard to restore a level balance or what's called

90
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.443
homeostasis.

91
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.370
And it does that by tipping the and equal and opposite amount to the side of

92
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.530
pain. So again,

93
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.610
the way the balance restores homeostasis is to tip to the opposite side.

94
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.930
That's the come down after using that moment of wanting to do it again,

95
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.143
the hangover,

96
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.330
if we wait long enough that feeling passes and balances restored,

97
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.720
but if we don't wait eight and we continue to use our drug again, and again,

98
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.960
we end up with a balance that's essentially weighted to the side of pain.

99
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.040
And I imagine that like these little neuro adaptation gremlins hopping on the

100
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:56.480
pain side of the balance, not very scientific. I know,

101
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.360
but the point is that with repeated use,

102
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.160
we get enough gremlins on the pain side of the balance to fill this whole room.

103
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.560
And then we're essentially working from a dopamine deficit state.

104
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.560
We've downregulated our own dopamine.

105
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.040
We've downregulated our own dopamine transmission and those gremlins like it on

106
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:17.510
the balance. So they don't get off after the hangovers or the acute withdrawal.

107
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.150
They can persist there for weeks to months to years,

108
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.990
which is why people with addiction,

109
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.430
even when their lives have become so much better will relapse because they're

110
00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:32.350
not walking around with a level pleasure pain balance.

111
00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:36.390
They're walking around with a balance tip to the side of pain.

112
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.180
They're experiencing the universal symptoms of withdrawal from any addictive

113
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:45.940
substance or behavior, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria,

114
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.580
and intrusive thoughts of wanting to use their drug again.

115
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.500
Now with enough time elapsed, and again,

116
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.340
with people in people with severe addiction, it can take months to years.

117
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.250
Those neuro adaptation gremlins will hop off.

118
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.930
We will regenerate our own dopamine and our own dopamine receptors and,

119
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.610
and our level balance or homeostasis will be restored. Is it.

120
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.650
