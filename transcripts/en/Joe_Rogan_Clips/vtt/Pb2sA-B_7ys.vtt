00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.240
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know, there's an, there's a giant,</v>

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.600
there's a giant issue in this country that is like, like skirted.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.520
It's like it gets addressed, but then it gets, it gets ignored.

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.700
And,

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.630
and that is what do they do with all

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.350
the communities that have been forever affected by slavery?

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.910
Like what about all those, all those. When, when people talk about reparations,

8
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.590
it gets dismissed. Like, it's not you. I didn't do anything. It's not you,

9
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.310
it doesn't have to do with you. You didn't do anything. You never owned a slave.

10
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.460
I never owned a slave. We didn't have anything do with it,

11
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.820
but there's no denying that there's parts of this country that are

12
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.300
forever affected by slavery.

13
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.620
And then afterwards by racist laws, those red line laws. Oh yeah.

14
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.460
Reconstruction. Yes. And Jim Crow, all that. Yeah. Okay.

15
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.860
Never really been addressed, never been addressed in terms of a correction now,

16
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.890
in terms like reparations, you give people money. I don't know if that works.

17
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.950
Like if,

18
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.810
if I thought that by me paying more in taxes and them

19
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:14.530
giving reparations, we could ease the tension racial tension in this country.

20
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.170
I would be like, okay, that's all you have to do,

21
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:18.650
but it's not all you have to do. Right?

22
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.930
Because you're still gonna have these communities that are forever affected

23
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.640
until something has been done to correct them.

24
00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:29.280
Like I'm not in favor of giving people who were never slaves money

25
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.920
as reparations,

26
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.000
but I am in favor of giving communities money mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and figuring

27
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.800
out a way to rebuild them, figuring out a way to make them safer,

28
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.920
better credit schools. Yeah. Everything lunches, community programs,

29
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:45.510
getting people out off the streets that are involved in gangs and drugs and all

30
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:48.310
that stuff. Like I've, I've said this a thousand times,

31
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.070
but it bears repeating the best way to have a great country is

32
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.870
if we are a team or if we're a country we're supposed to be a team, right?

33
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.390
We're a community, a giant community of 320 million people.

34
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.620
What's the best way to make it stronger. Well, you have losers.

35
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.140
That's the best way. Well,

36
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.940
what's the likelihood of you becoming a loser.

37
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.020
If you're in an impoverished drugriled crime,

38
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.100
just ravaged area. Well, they're highly,

39
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.180
it's highly likely that you're not gonna succeed in that area unless you

40
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.810
are some person of UN believable character,

41
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.490
an unbelievable will and fortitude. And you're,

42
00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:31.530
you're raised by people who did a phenomenal job, essentially in a war zone.

43
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:31.990
Right?

44
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.810
If you live it in the south side of Chicago and you look at the murder rate in

45
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:37.930
the south side of Chicago and you compare it to the murder rate in war zones,

46
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:39.810
they're pretty similar. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right.

47
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.930
So essentially these people are being asked to do their best and,

48
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.920
and come out of this war zone and pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

49
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.400
Whereas other people around them are not in a war zone. If we're a community,

50
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.320
we're supposed to look at that and go, Hey,

51
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.360
how the do you stop this thing from being a war zone? How do we stop this? Yeah.

52
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.080
How do we, how do we do that with Detroit? How do we do that with Baltimore?

53
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.720
How do we do that with all these impoverished areas that that should be

54
00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:06.510
addressed?

55
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.640
<v 1>Well, it has to be looked at as our problem. Yes. Not their problem. Yes.</v>

56
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.480
You know, we are all living with the ramifications of inequality. You know,

57
00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:19.190
it's affecting us on a daily basis, whether it's crime or whether, you know,

58
00:03:19.191 --> 00:03:21.070
our gross national product would be much higher.

59
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.150
If more people were educated and more people were proud of their work. And yes.

60
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.230
And so there's, there has to be, there has to be pride, less, less losers,

61
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.590
more pride, more identifying with progress. And you know, I think if you,

62
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.030
if you, if you live in a certain culture in this country, there,

63
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.980
there isn't a pride in six seating, right.

64
00:03:39.981 --> 00:03:42.100
They're J cuz you haven't seen it right.

65
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.340
<v 0>More opportunity. And this includes poor white cultures.</v>

66
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.460
Like I have a friend who's from Kentucky and he tells me about these people

67
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.780
that live in these coal mining communities, where the coal mining community,

68
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.620
the coal's gone and the, the community is shut down. People are hooked on pills.

69
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.650
And he is like, you have never seen poverty like this. He's like,

70
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:05.850
you have never seen it where like everyone in the communi is on pills.

71
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.970
Everyone is surviving on like below minimum wage. Everyone's a criminal.

72
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.570
Like it's just, everyone's poor. It's just horrific.

73
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.850
Did you ever see the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia? No. Holy.

74
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.040
Ho I think it's a Johnny Knoxville documentary. Did he put it together?

75
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.560
It's amazing. It's amazing for all the wrong reasons.

76
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.240
Cuz these are the trashiest white trash people that have ever lived and they're

77
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:33.800
all on pills. They're all turning tricks and doing crazy and,

78
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.840
and robbing people and shooting people. And it's like, everyone has a story.

79
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:42.030
That's like, you're like macaulayulcan for, from home alone. Like what? Yeah.

80
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:46.670
Putting your hands on your ears. Like what the. But those communities exist.

81
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.390
They exist. They, and it's so hard to get out.

82
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.350
It's so hard to break free. Like we as a community,

83
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.750
as a giant 320 million person community should be

84
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.910
concentrating on fixing those spots.

85
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.180
At least as much as we're concentrating on fixing problems in other parts of the

86
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:06.820
world. Yeah.

87
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.020
I understand the logic behind going to these other parts of the world that are

88
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.900
up and trying to solve these problems before they affect us before they come

89
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:20.740
back to us. That's the logic. I get it. But internally inside of our country,

90
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.290
we were not doing the same thing.

91
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.850
We're allowing people to become violent criminals by never giving them a chance

92
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.130
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but never giving them an outcome or never,

93
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:32.730
never giving them, uh, possibilities other than what they see around them.

94
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.770
Not giving them any opportunities. And we treat it as if they're supposed to be,

95
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.650
we're all supposed to be.

96
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:40.730
Even we're all supposed to be on this even game mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; no,

97
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.880
some people got one card and some people got like five ACEs.

98
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.000
It does. Yeah.

99
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.600
<v 1>There's this documentary they made about uh, a public school in Chicago.</v>

100
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.760
I forget what, uh, Oak park, I think it was in, it was called America is me.

101
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.600
And it was like this 10 part series.

102
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.120
And it showed the experiences of the white kids versus the black kids,

103
00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:02.560
cuz it was an integrated school.

104
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.480
But you were seeing that the black kids were lagging grade-wise graduation rates

105
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.800
and they just went in depth.

106
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.680
And you saw that a lot of the black kids were dealing with single parents.

107
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.720
They were dealing with being evicted,

108
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.750
some of being homeless or just not having the resources like,

109
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.390
you know, the white kids are getting S a T prep classes and you know,

110
00:06:24.391 --> 00:06:27.230
they're getting extra help because they've got a parent that's not working that

111
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:29.270
can pick them up from school and drive them to a tutor.

112
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.350
And there's just all these things that you're seeing.

113
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.910
One side is getting fostered and the other side is struggling and it's the same

114
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.660
school. So it's not,

115
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.380
it's not as simple as just put good schools in the community,

116
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.060
but there's gotta be, um, mentorship programs and there's gotta be, um,

117
00:06:45.061 --> 00:06:47.540
community outreach programs. Community outreach has gotta be,

118
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.860
they gotta get preschools. Yeah. They gotta get kids in there at a young age.

119
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:51.820
So the parents can work.

120
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.100
And there's good nutrition that they say that the studies that show preschool

121
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.210
the differences long term of how people come out of there.

122
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:02.370
But those extra two years is astronomical.

123
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.250
<v 0>Makes sense. Makes sense. You prep 'em for it early, but it's the thing is like,</v>

124
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.730
this is where a concept like democratic socialism actually makes sense.

125
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.810
It's like people think of democratic socialism where anything where you say the

126
00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:19.080
word socialism, they go, oh, you're gonna take money. Give it to lazy people.

127
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.640
This is the, that's the worst case scenario. Right. But man,

128
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.640
if we're a community, if we're, if we are a community of human beings,

129
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.520
you gotta, we've gotta help the people that aren't doing. Good.

130
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.200
There's gotta be a reason why they're not doing good.

131
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.590
It's not that they're inferior. There's they have a inferior choices.

132
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.150
They have inferior opportunities. They have an inferior situation.

133
00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:47.510
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's so hard to get the mass of people behind

134
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.670
giving their money to some sort of, uh,

135
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.790
some sort of a program that does take steps to fix this.

136
00:07:56.791 --> 00:07:58.310
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you just don't hear it.

137
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.580
<v 1>Well, you know, they had the jobs for, you know, FDR and the new deal.</v>

138
00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:04.420
They were able to start. People wanna work.

139
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.140
People don't want to get a welfare check. They want, they,

140
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:10.940
they wanna feel good about themselves and they, and you wanna be busy all day.

141
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.820
You know, sometimes I'm not, sometimes I don't work for a month, you know,

142
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.300
I'm between writing jobs. Maybe I take some time off from stand up. I get,

143
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.130
I don't feel good about my self terrible. I mean, imagine that times,

144
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.610
year after year and generation after generation and.

145
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.730
<v 0>For you, it's a choice. Like if you wanted to go on the road any time. Yeah.</v>

146
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.050
But that's not a choice for a lot of people. Right. For a lot of choice,

147
00:08:31.051 --> 00:08:31.370
they're.

148
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.890
<v 1>Just. And you used to have the, the, the funny thing is like the factory jobs,</v>

149
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.560
you look back on them and you go, those are like really jobs. You know, I,

150
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.080
I grew up in a factory town and it was like, people were not enjoying it.

151
00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:48.040
People were getting drunk and high and just getting through.

152
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.800
And now we're looking we're hearkening back to like that it was like some golden

153
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.440
age of great work. Like, oh no, you know, they were union jobs,

154
00:08:56.441 --> 00:08:59.840
which was great, but let's shoot higher. You know,

155
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.720
let's the factory jobs aren't.

156
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.680
<v 0>Coming back. Right. But the real question is like some people,</v>

157
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.000
some people don't have aspirations.

158
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.320
So if you took someone who's already gone through the school system and you

159
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:17.310
know, like, oh, we're gonna get jobs for people. You that's not good enough.

160
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.710
Like you gotta fix the people that are up. Yeah. Like you can't say like,

161
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.790
like an 18 year old person is not a finished product. Right.

162
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:30.430
A 25 year old person came from a up neighborhood and is got all sorts of mental

163
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.270
problems and probably PTSD. That's not a finished product. Yeah.

164
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.740
You can't say a, we got a job for you. Well, cuz they're in the head. You know,

165
00:09:38.741 --> 00:09:40.420
they've had to deal with their friend getting shot.

166
00:09:40.421 --> 00:09:43.940
They have to deal with their mom being on crack. Like getting 'em a job is not,

167
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.420
not enough. Mm. I don't know what the answer is.

168
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.940
Like obviously we're just two white guys talking. Yeah. Right. We,

169
00:09:49.941 --> 00:09:51.940
we don't have to worry about this. This is not our concern.

170
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.700
But if you wanted to, if you wanted to fix,

171
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.530
if you were a and like say if great fit Simmons became president,

172
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.130
how do you fix that? How do you, how do you even make steps to fix that?

173
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:04.970
Cause I haven't heard anyone come up with a plan.

174
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.850
Maybe there is one that I haven't heard,

175
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.770
but a plan where it makes sense where there's a long term proposition

176
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.840
to try to take these communities that are just hub ually,

177
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.880
engulfed in crime and violence. Mm.

178
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.920
Just consistently like throughout the sixties and the seventies and, and fix it.

179
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.800
Mm. And turn it around, like at least.

180
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.720
<v 1>Try. Well, there's a gap. The gap between the rich and the poor is growing.</v>

181
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:37.070
Ever since the eighties, it's gotten just outta hand, you know, the, the amount,

182
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.470
the top 1% have 50% of the money or something like that.

183
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:42.650
And it's just,

184
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.510
and everything is set up structurally for that to continue to divide more and

185
00:10:46.511 --> 00:10:47.350
more. Right.

186
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:48.790
<v 0>But are they playing a game? Right.</v>

187
00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:52.830
They're playing a game called capitalism and that game they're dominating that

188
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:54.110
game. And once they get the money,

189
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.910
then they keep the money and they pass that money down to their kids.

190
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.700
They keep the money. How do you change that? I mean,

191
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.140
we could all play that game, right?

192
00:11:02.141 --> 00:11:03.940
Like we could all invest in the stock market.

193
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.980
We could all just really focus entirely on making money or should we not be able

194
00:11:08.981 --> 00:11:13.660
to, like, how do you stop the 1% like these bankers and investment people?

195
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.500
How do you stop that? And how do you stop that in a way where it doesn't see,

196
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.850
seem like you are, you know,

197
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:23.450
you're changing the rules of the game because some people are just psycho good

198
00:11:23.451 --> 00:11:27.410
at it and completely dedicated to only making money. Well, you're not.

199
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:32.050
<v 1>Changing the rules because the, uh, the, the estate tax was there from day one,</v>

200
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.490
the founding fathers wanted there to be a very large estate tax. Right.

201
00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:37.730
They wanted to avoid what happened in Europe,

202
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.080
as these building up of these families that are mm-hmm,

203
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.840
&lt;affirmative&gt; handing down wealth. And so these kids, you know,

204
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.200
so I think we need to go back to right now,

205
00:11:45.201 --> 00:11:49.560
it's like 35% or something like that on wealth,

206
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.800
over 10 million. If you're a couple,

207
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.200
they need to go back to really taking that money back because.

208
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.600
<v 0>And doing what with it though.</v>

209
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.560
<v 1>Put it into schools to start with that.</v>

210
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.200
<v 0>I would love that if there was like a real logic to how that money got spent.</v>

211
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.960
Yes. Right, right. Yeah. That would be the problem.

212
00:12:05.961 --> 00:12:09.120
Because if it just went to a bunch of like,

213
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.390
just, if it just went to a bunch of government programs,

214
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.870
it don't seem to make sense. And that are like poorly structured. Yeah.

215
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:19.590
And that money gets wasted. That would make me sick.

216
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.150
<v 1>No, I think it has to be job training programs.</v>

217
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:26.230
It has to be helping small businesses grow yeah. With, you know, uh,

218
00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:28.870
low cost loans. But you know, they,

219
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.590
the think about these kids that are inheriting a billion dollars,

220
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.260
what are you ever gonna contribute to society? As opposed to,

221
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.780
if you were set up with, you went to a private high school,

222
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.540
you went to a great university, you went to a graduate school.

223
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.780
All of it was paid for, you had nannies, you were given tutors.

224
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.620
You should be able to go out and make a good living. Now. Yes.

225
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.300
You don't need that billion dollars. Right.

226
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.090
<v 0>And you will feel so much, much better if you make your own money.</v>

227
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.730
<v 1>Yeah. So there should be enough money left, you know, I'm not,</v>

228
00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.730
I'm not saying take away everybody's money when they die,

229
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:04.890
but I'm saying that there's a grotesque amount of money that needs to be pulled.

230
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.650
<v 0>Back. That's one way of, of at least putting a chip,</v>

231
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.730
like chip away at it. That's one way, right. That money. Yeah.

232
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.520
It's another way. What's. I mean,

233
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.520
unless you want like cops or police to occupy these areas,

234
00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:26.080
like, how would you ever stop? Like at this point in time,

235
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.320
how would you stop places from being crime written?

236
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:33.000
It would have to be like a multistep program where you would slowly but surely

237
00:13:33.001 --> 00:13:37.710
implement it and try to slowly but surely chip away at

238
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.270
all these problems. Yeah. It's not something you're gonna fix overnight.

239
00:13:41.271 --> 00:13:42.990
Cause it didn't happen overnight, you know?

240
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.670
<v 1>Right, right. No, there has to be great leadership and there has to be, but man,</v>

241
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:48.070
you got.

242
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.310
<v 0>Eight years. You're you're president, you've got four.</v>

243
00:13:50.311 --> 00:13:51.870
And if you're lucky you get eight. No. I.

244
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.500
<v 1>Mean, local leadership, you need to, you know, city councilmen, you know,</v>

245
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.460
mayors that, that are really looking at the community and figuring,

246
00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.500
and each one's different.

247
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.100
<v 0>You know, I feel like the, if, if it, if it's that way, unless it's federally,</v>

248
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.820
if it's that way, like you're gonna,

249
00:14:05.821 --> 00:14:08.620
you're dealing with communities that don't have as much money already. Yeah.

250
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:09.341
You know,

251
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:13.580
because just by virtue of the fact they're crime written and that this is and

252
00:14:13.581 --> 00:14:16.650
poverty stricken, these are communities that you don't have any money. Yeah.

253
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.330
<v 1>Low tax base. Let's go back to talking about farts, YESS me out.</v>
