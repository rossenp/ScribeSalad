00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.090
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well,</v>

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:07.680
Fox news has taken a turn ladies and gentlemen, they are, uh,

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.580
they seem to have made a conscious internal decision to, uh,

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.960
not favor Donald Trump.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.310
<v 1>I don't think Fox news was ever that behind Donald Trump. I mean,</v>

6
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:19.670
there's a few people at Fox news who are hardcore behind Donald Trump,

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.380
but as an organization, I mean,

8
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:24.920
remember they were very hostile to him in the Republican primary.

9
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.660
He wasn't the Fox news guy, Jeb Bush was the Fox news guy. Um, and he,

10
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.930
I think a lot of people were very happy, are very happy to get rid of.

11
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.570
<v 0>Him. You see that article again? This is interesting.</v>

12
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.840
I wonder what that means. X hot hunter Biden, associates records don't show,

13
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.561
but what does that mean?

14
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:47.150
So they don't [inaudible] but listen to this X hunter Biden's

15
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.690
associate's records, don't show proof of Biden,

16
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:53.930
business relationship amid unanswered questions. That doesn't mean.

17
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.170
<v 1>Much. No. Well, what he claimed was that, and they're saying Joe Biden,</v>

18
00:00:57.171 --> 00:00:59.330
that he couldn't prove Joe Biden was a,

19
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.050
it's a very confusing title because he claimed that he had met with Joe Biden

20
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:07.030
and Joe Biden was aware of all the dealings that that hunter was doing here.

21
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.820
Fox.

22
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.740
<v 0>News has revealed email reviewed emails from look at that name, Bob Balinsky,</v>

23
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.170
uh, related to the venture.

24
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:19.880
And they don't show that the elder Biden had business dealings. Yeah. But see,

25
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.640
I could that's that's weird. Like, you know,

26
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.170
we can say that Jamie is my business associate, right. And if I'm, uh,

27
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.100
involved in some shady and Jamie doesn't know about it,

28
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:34.100
and Jamie and I are emailing back and forth and they get into Jamie's emails and

29
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:38.930
they say, X Joe, Rogan's a business associate doesn't show.

30
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.110
Any association you should making the claim is that.

31
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.300
<v 2>This is the evidence is the emails though. They're like, Hey,</v>

32
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:46.490
we found some emails and emails say this,

33
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:49.130
and now they're saying this fog court and the Fox news, or like that does,

34
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.230
that's not what they say. Right.

35
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.510
<v 0>But the emails to who is it to that guy,</v>

36
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.140
because if it's not to that guy, then this is not relative.

37
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:58.730
And then they're playing games with words.

38
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.020
Like I would have to read what exactly they're saying, what exactly he's saying.

39
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.390
<v 2>I've looked a couple of times. I've,</v>

40
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.650
that's what I sorta just looking again where normally this gets leaked.

41
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:12.320
You know, like when all the celebrities got their iClouds leaked,

42
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:15.830
all those pictures hit the internet instantly and you could find them all over

43
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:20.600
the place. These emails are, have like barely been seen by. I feel like anybody,

44
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.050
well.

45
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.550
<v 1>These emails, I believe he turned these over to the FBI. Um,</v>

46
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.110
so I don't know, you know,

47
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.480
where they would leak from not to say that they couldn't leak. But I think the,

48
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:33.530
the point of this article is that what he claimed with this bobble Linsky guy

49
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.120
claimed was that Joe Biden himself was very involved in all the business deals

50
00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:39.860
that that hunter and him were doing.

51
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.460
And that his emails couldn't prove that because they, you know, the thing was,

52
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:46.550
they said they had these references to like the big guy and stuff like that,

53
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:49.910
but that they couldn't prove that that, that Joe Biden knew about this.

54
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.250
But he's claiming whether this is true or not.

55
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.790
He's claiming that he's met Joe Biden several times and they've talked about it.

56
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:59.030
And Joe Biden was well aware of what hunter Biden was doing,

57
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.030
where he was making his money from. Again,

58
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.840
I think it's kind of run of the mill political scandal. That, that aspect of it,

59
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.110
the bigger thing is like that this goes on all over the place, right?

60
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:12.100
I mean all over the place, like th the, the conflicts of interest,

61
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:14.920
the corruption where you see where Obama, you know,

62
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.290
w w was spoke after he's president,

63
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.340
we get like $400,000 or something like that for a speech in front of bankers.

64
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.980
And he was the guy who like, presided over the bank, bailout,

65
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.510
and then you get out and it's like, oh,

66
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:29.110
here's what the bankers really just wanted to hear. Barack Obama speak. I mean,

67
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:32.850
he's a good speaker, but come on, man. Like Hillary got a lot of those too.

68
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.320
Oh yeah. Tons of them.

69
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.330
<v 0>And that's where they make the bulk of their money. Right.</v>

70
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.420
When they get out of the office, then they do these speeches. Yeah.

71
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.950
Which is kind of hilarious.

72
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.010
<v 1>Clinton and bill Clinton, I believe the ballpark numbers,</v>

73
00:03:44.011 --> 00:03:47.400
they left the white house. They were like net worth was around $4 million.

74
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.450
And then it was like, well, over a hundred million dollars by 2016.

75
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.450
So they made a lot of money after today.

76
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.000
<v 0>Us plan sale of F 35 fighter, Jesse UAE, and $23 billion arms deal.</v>

77
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.320
Trump administration.

78
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.120
<v 2>Yep. They're saying that I was reading today.</v>

79
00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:05.970
They're saying he's making a bunch of deals now on his way out. Oh, I'm sure.

80
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.950
<v 0>That a plan to sell 50 advanced F 35 fighters to the United Arab Emirates as a</v>

81
00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:14.340
part of a broader arms deal worth more than 23 billion.

82
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.850
That's the weird thing about someone on the way out they can do something.

83
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.610
<v 1>Well, I don't know that he's on the way out. I mean, he's,</v>

84
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.500
you don't think he's on the way. Well, yeah. He's oh,

85
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.290
he's almost certainly not the way out, but he's going to fight it.

86
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.400
<v 0>Yeah. But do you know how insanely difficult it is to prove, first of all,</v>

87
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.630
to prove that there's voter fraud and then to prove there's enough voter fraud,

88
00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:34.464
where they could overturn.

89
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.430
<v 1>It's, uh,</v>

90
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.060
it's incredibly difficult and it's not just that he would have to do that.

91
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:41.790
He'd have to do that in a few different states.

92
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.260
And so it's an incredibly difficult task. Uh, but it's pretty interesting.

93
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.690
This is unlike anything I've ever seen before,

94
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:51.270
where you have one president just saying like, no,

95
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.820
this was and I'm going to fight it legally.

96
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.640
And another thing that I thought was really weird, uh,

97
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.140
from the press is that they, so there, I saw it twice now,

98
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.720
um, was on MSNBC and CNN where he was giving a press conference talent saying

99
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:10.470
how the votes were stolen from him. And the system was unfair and they cut away.

100
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.320
They say, we will not show this because he's lying.

101
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.240
And then just the other day on Fox news, Neil, Cavuto cut away from, uh,

102
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.540
Trump's press secretary saying there was voter fraud. And he goes, well,

103
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:24.840
you know, we can't verify that. So we can't air this on our, and he's like,

104
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.650
look, man, whatever you want to say, this is a story, right?

105
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.500
The fact that the president is claiming voter fraud is a story.

106
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:36.210
So air this and then debunk it afterward. But what is this thing where you go,

107
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.870
no, we won't show people. Right? You can't see this story well,

108
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.280
because the lies could poison.

109
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.790
<v 0>You or something. What if it's proven to be true? What if there is voter fraud?</v>

110
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.750
Well, there.

111
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.870
<v 1>Is, it's a question of how widespread it is. Cause there's always voter fraud,</v>

112
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.270
which is another secret that they don't like to tell,

113
00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:53.880
but there's always some degree of voting.

114
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.550
<v 0>You find it odd that everybody insists that it's impossible to vote like</v>

115
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.830
safely and accurately online.

116
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.910
<v 1>Uh, yes. I find that odd. I also find it really, really odd that we,</v>

117
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.260
um, overhauled the way we do voting in this country.

118
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.880
And that now it's almost an entirely different process where both candidates are

119
00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:18.880
getting way more votes than they would normally get.

120
00:06:18.881 --> 00:06:20.920
And it's just very weird.

121
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.280
There were a lot of things that were weird about this election.

122
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.990
Like the actual logistics of it.

123
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.860
<v 0>Seemed like if we can bank online, we should be able to vote online.</v>

124
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.790
It doesn't seem like if you could use like apple pay or Samsung pay or something

125
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:37.630
like that and go buy something, you know, you use your fingerprint. Yeah.

126
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.920
And it registers your fingerprint. And then you could, you could buy a house.

127
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.510
Right? I mean, if you, I mean, how much can you spend on apple pay?

128
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.583
There's no limits.

129
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.320
<v 2>It's not about like that. It's the ease for everyone.</v>

130
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.790
Not everybody has that access.

131
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.290
<v 0>And I was telling everyone, get kit together. Like.</v>

132
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.790
<v 2>They had to the day of the elections,</v>

133
00:06:57.791 --> 00:07:00.010
they were supposed to be where I'm from in Columbus, Franklin county,

134
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:02.710
they were supposed to have like registration via iPads or something. Right.

135
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.490
And that morning they were not confident that everything got downloaded.

136
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:09.610
So they just scrapped the whole thing, went back to paper. It was like that day.

137
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.290
So it just the problem with.

138
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.210
<v 0>These weird deadlines,</v>

139
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.250
like we have to choose the leader in the free world and 20 hours ready go.

140
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.340
Yeah. Like what is this a big, important thing? Like,

141
00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:23.920
do we really want to boil this down to 20 hours?

142
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.490
<v 1>The whole process is retarded. Like the whole thing about it,</v>

143
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.650
the whole thing that it's like. So we, the,

144
00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:34.270
the system is that we have to basically like 10,000 votes in

145
00:07:34.271 --> 00:07:39.130
Wisconsin is going to determine which half of the country is furious and

146
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:43.210
which half is like elated because they get to rule over the other half now.

147
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.660
And then hopefully in four years they can be happy and you're miserable cause

148
00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:49.690
they get to rule over you. Now it's so bizarre.

149
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.200
It's democracy in general is a very bizarre process to have it in a country.

150
00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:58.070
This big, with this powerful of a government, it makes it insane. Like we're,

151
00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:02.770
we're going to determine the course of history based off what a few votes in

152
00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:06.310
swing states determine. There's gotta be a better way.

153
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.380
<v 0>And this thing about Plato, excuse me about Socrates. Socrates was, uh,</v>

154
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.120
he was talking about how he didn't like the idea of democracy

155
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.430
because Socrates felt like in order to make really important

156
00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:22.264
choices,

157
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:27.400
you should almost have to prove your understanding of these issues and that

158
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:31.000
this, if it wasn't the case, I'm pretty sure it was Socrates. Look,

159
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:35.500
look that up just in case. Cause he,

160
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.770
he saw the pro like what we basically have,

161
00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:42.670
like there's a lot of people that were on the ballot in California. I was like,

162
00:08:42.671 --> 00:08:45.550
what is this guy doing? What does he want? I didn't know much about them. Yeah.

163
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.370
And I was like, Hmm, does that sound right? I mean,

164
00:08:48.371 --> 00:08:50.170
I'm looking at this thing for an hour, right?

165
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.910
I've got an hour to go and then I can Google some of these, these bills. Right.

166
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.370
And that's just me, how many people didn't. I mean,

167
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:03.900
I gave a very cursory review of these

168
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:05.970
ideas. How many people didn't at all,

169
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:09.840
they just went blue all across the board or read all across the board.

170
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.830
<v 3>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

171
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.980
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

172
00:09:18.981 --> 00:09:20.120
they're going to be available everywhere.

173
00:09:20.121 --> 00:09:23.690
But after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

174
00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:27.740
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

175
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.090
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify,

176
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:33.950
Bubba.
