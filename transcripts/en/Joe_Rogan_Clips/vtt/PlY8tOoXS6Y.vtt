00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.680
<v 2>I don't know what to think about that. I've been saying this.</v>

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.280
That was little Wayne. Yeah.

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.360
If that was little Wayne and little Wayne was going crazy,

5
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:11.920
spending all his money and putting diamonds in his forehead.

6
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.200
That was that Lil vert. Who was that guy that did that with diamond vert?

7
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.960
<v 0>Yep. Yeah. What do you mean put diamonds in his.</v>

8
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.640
<v 1>Forehead, dude,</v>

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.630
<v 1>Like grabbed it, ripped it outta his head. Wait a minute.</v>

12
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.190
<v 0>You don't know about this? No. Like the guy from so someone he's got a new one.</v>

13
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.830
No, there's a new rapper that has, uh,

14
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.030
gold chain surgically implanted into his head.

15
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.390
He did it before he beat somebody doing it.

16
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.990
And someone stole it like in pulled Avengers, like Thanos,

17
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:40.950
they pulled the thing out of.

18
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.900
<v 1>Was fun. So this guy has these gold chains inserted into his head. Yeah. Oh,</v>

19
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.420
that's that's hurt. Wait minute. Wait, wait minute. Wait. Be screwed

20
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.340
about the connection. What is he doing with his teeth? He's wait, who's this?

21
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.380
So these are, these are metal teeth too. He's got metal teeth. This is a.

22
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.300
<v 0>Kid. Wow. Really is.</v>

23
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.100
<v 1>Brushing his metal teeth. But this,</v>

24
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.010
I wanna know how he got those inserted in his head. The gold.

25
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.010
<v 0>Chains. They can do that plug shape's.</v>

26
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.970
<v 1>That's a cool look. I'm thinking about going that way here is there.</v>

27
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.850
<v 0>Guys that had snap on hair is that.</v>

28
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.530
<v 1>I'm bald. I can't wear it too, but I could wear that.</v>

29
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.170
I'm thinking about wearing, oh my God. Gold. Imagine just did just,

30
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.530
how about this? Not gold chain, but just gold studs. That's.

31
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.480
<v 0>A really bad idea though. It just like beads gold beads.</v>

32
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:25.560
That's a very yank thing.

33
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.360
<v 1>Uh, look, he's got the neck thing where his neck is gonna grow.</v>

34
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.120
Are you saying that's.

35
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.960
<v 0>Not removable? He's gonna have a draft neck. Yeah. He's.</v>

36
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.793
<v 1>Gonna have a draft Kyle.</v>

37
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.640
<v 0>Around his neck as a child. It's actually very Regal to have a long neck, by.</v>

38
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.600
<v 1>The way. It's very loyal. Like a seven foot tall guy's neck. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.750
Those it's not a, he,

40
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.830
he underwent surgery in April allowing him to hang dozens of chains from his

41
00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:48.664
head.

42
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.310
I had it as a hook that's implanted in my head and that hook has hooks.

43
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.990
So they're all hooked in my skull. Under my skin. It's not hook to hook.

44
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.870
He said in a viral clip, this is my hair golden hair,

45
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.620
the first rapper to have gold hair imprinted in human history.

46
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.460
<v 0>That word hair and a hook has said so many times.</v>

47
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.160
<v 1>Jamie,</v>

48
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.140
please see if there's like detailed images that depict the surgery and the,

49
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.660
the subsequent, uh, bleeding.

50
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.820
<v 0>Trump did it first, dude. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

51
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.580
<v 1>Imagine that though. This kids are very innovative.</v>

52
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.610
<v 0>That's like side ever. Punk, dude, dude, it's pretty wild.</v>

53
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.290
<v 1>I'm impressed. It's a waste of money. No, no, no, no.</v>

54
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.410
A 40 million stupid painting is.

55
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.810
<v 0>Awesome. If I looking at the painting wild,</v>

56
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:39.330
if you had gold chains and planted into your head, how cool would that look?

57
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.803
I might, I don't.

58
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.400
I'm thinking of doing something radical like that or get that clown here.

59
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.160
Yeah man. Why don't you out?

60
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.600

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.680
<v 0>Have that salad. You know, one.</v>

65
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.960
<v 1>Thing for, I don't know what I searched for on Instagram. Right.</v>

66
00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:06.520
But you know how you search something and then the algorithm shows you all these

67
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:09.320
things now. Yeah. Maybe I clicked on one that I saw in the search.

68
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.440
Just taking a one day. Bored. Yeah.

69
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.160
But there is a whole movement of guys gluing wigs to their head.

70
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.470
&lt;laugh&gt; oh, yes. There. Yeah. Yeah. Like, wait, what do you mean gluing?

71
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:21.590
It like, like ball guys.

72
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.070
It's like all the ones that I get are from take off sometimes. I don't know.

73
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.070
But they show a guy like looking like this,

74
00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:32.310
like mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then the guy like squirt the glue on the head and

75
00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.750
puts this crazy wig. And then the guy's like, ah

76
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.500
it's why does he do that? Because this guy does this. I'm excited about the, uh,

77
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.940
this is his move. I'm gonna show you. I'm gonna show you.

78
00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:46.860
I'm gonna send this to Jamie because I, I don't know. They, I,

79
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.620
you know how you get on an algorithm and then the algorithm just sends you. Oh,

80
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:53.740
I know. Immediately. I get, I get to one. It's pretty great.

81
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:57.820
Because like YouTube does that too. Where you just it's just seems okay. Glue.

82
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.290
<v 0>I'll find you one. Your shirts says superior.</v>

83
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.170

93
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.470

94
00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:47.070
How do you get that off? It's rough. I've seen this. It does look good.

<v 0>Looks good. It looks amazing. That looks good. &lt;laugh&gt; but that.</v>

97
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.663
<v 0>The guy from.</v>

<v 1>Uh, the glue would get loose. How heavy would your C.</v>

99
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.060
<v 0>Joelle? Joel? I met him in person and his, whatever.</v>

100
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.100
Cuz you remember where he came from? Right? The burger king commercials.

101
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.380
<v 1>I do not remember the.</v>

102
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.860
<v 0>Burger king commercials. Yeah. Before all that,</v>

103
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.780
he was a guy who was going bald in burger king commercials. It was like, uh,

104
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.620
copying the success of the office. And it would be like,

105
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.660
I thought I told you a Whopper &lt;laugh&gt; it was like a and uh,

106
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.210
he was losing and then he had an amazing dragon ballsy hair. &lt;laugh&gt;.

107
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.450
<v 1>Like he does.</v>

108
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.370
<v 0>Have great hair dude. And I asked him point blank, cuz I would've been like,</v>

109
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:33.050
what do you do to hold your hair? I immediately, when I asked somebody that.

110

<v 1>Okay, so this is back in the di you look, look.</v>

111
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.970
<v 0>Oh yeah. So that's right. When I was at that hair loss, I asked him,</v>

112
00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:43.800
what does he do to hold his hair? He didn't tell me he wouldn't tell you. Huh?

113
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.840
<v 1>He probably had great. Gotta keep it tight. A good plug slips, sync ships.</v>

And you got loose slips pal about it right now.

116
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.240
