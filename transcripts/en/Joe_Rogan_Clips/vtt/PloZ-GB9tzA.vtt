00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.560
<v 2>Well, the white house commented on what I said about vaccines.</v>

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.320
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; it's so funny. Fauci.</v>

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.120
<v 0>Hit you up. Well, he didn't hit me up necessarily. He disagreed with me.</v>

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.920
<v 1>Right? Yeah. Yeah. I got backed up, baby. Did you? I got one shot in the arm,</v>

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.910
but didn't you already get COVID yeah, I had Ronna. I had it October.

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.150
<v 0>So why did you get a vaccination?</v>

8
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.870
<v 1>I'm a sheep old dude. Part of the sheep, dude.</v>

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.070
I wanted it because my antibodies, I think, were gone.

10
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:32.830
The last time we got tested for antibodies was three months after mm-hmm

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.630
&lt;affirmative&gt; and they said they were there, but they weren't super strong.

12
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.550
So you're scared. Yeah.

13
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.750
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; which you had the Johnson and Johnson?</v>

14
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.950
<v 1>No, dude. I'm AUR a mama. You.</v>

15
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.020
<v 0>Only got one though. Yeah. Why.</v>

16
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.740
<v 1>Didn't you get two? Because my second one is in like two weeks or a week. Oh,</v>

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.860
they have to spread you out a month. Yeah. 21 days. Right? I got it. Nothing.

18
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.140
No, uh, I don't know, man. The whole thing,

19
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:54.260
like her Corona for me was weird already. So I was like, I don't know.

20
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:57.020
I'll just do that thing to not have it again. I bought into the system.

21
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.460
I'm a sheep. Well, it's.

22
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.210
<v 0>Not being a sheep. It's I mean, there's some legit intimate science behind this.</v>

23
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.090
It's not, this is like the thing about this whole thing. This, uh,

24
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:13.050
people being upset at me. I didn't say I'm not, I'm not an anti-vax person.

25
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.930
Right? In fact, I said, I believe they're safe.

26
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.570
And I encourage many people to take 'em. My parents were vaccinated.

27
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.080
I just said, I don't think at if you're a young,

28
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:27.960
healthy person that you need it, their argument was you need it for other.

29
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.840
<v 1>People. So you don't transmit the virus. That makes more sense. So.</v>

30
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.000
<v 0>I'm a young, but that's a different.</v>

31
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
<v 1>Argument. That's a D conversation. I'm not so healthy person.</v>

32
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.600
You're not that young. Okay, Joe. Thanks, man. You're not okay.

33
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.560
<v 0>If you were a hot chick.</v>

34
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.600
<v 1>Then you'd say I was young. I'd be.</v>

35
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.960
<v 0>Like, you're on the ropes. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

36
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.030
<v 1>I backed up a little bit. How old you? 37. Yeah. You're on the ropes bro.</v>

37
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.870
<v 0>I, what do you mean? That's you have no children.</v>

38
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.830
If you had no children and you're a hot chick.

39
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.950
<v 1>Let's be honest. I'm older now you're on the ropes. Okay. Fine. It's not bad.</v>

40
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.870
I'm getting older. I'm old.

41
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.750
<v 0>As. Yeah, you are okay. I'm 53. I'm old as. I'm almost 20 years older than you.</v>

42
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.300
<v 1>When we celebrated your 50 year old 50th birth day, we were in Detroit.</v>

43
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:07.900
Where were we? I forget. And I, and it hit me hard that you were 50. Yeah.

44
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.580
I was like, oh, my friend is 50 and I was starting to plan your funeral.

45
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.700
I was like, I was going through all that stuff. &lt;laugh&gt; I was like, what,

46
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.140
what are we.

47
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.940
<v 0>Gonna do? But honestly it doesn't bother me.</v>

48
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.020
<v 1>No, because why? Cuz you're you're in such a great stride of I I'm.</v>

49
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.660
<v 0>On steroids. &lt;laugh&gt; I.</v>

50
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.780
<v 1>Choose. I give 'em.</v>

51
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.250
<v 0>To me, bro. I'm on uh,</v>

52
00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:29.130
testosterone replacement therapy and every vitamin known demand. I take a, a,

53
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.530
a giant athletic greens every day. Yeah.

54
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.050
I take a pallet of vitamins. I what do I need to take? Fantastic.

55
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.930
What do I need in the sauna every day?

56
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.170
Here's the thing like all these people that are saying, and in, in many ways,

57
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.920
listen, here's the thing. These are not like planned statements.

58
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.320
Let's be real clear. Yeah. When I say something stupid,

59
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.920
I'm not thinking about what I'm gonna say before I say it.

60
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.720
I'm just saying it right. I don't have an off air. An on-air voice.

61
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.640
I don't no, I have me. This is us. This is it. Yeah. Yeah. I,

62
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.680
I got through the net and I'm swimming in open water. &lt;laugh&gt; okay.

63
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.880
And that's just how I live. Yeah. Did I don't like,

64
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:10.680
if you say you disagree with me, I probably disagree with me too.

65
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.800
I disagree with me all the time. If you said, if someone said you have yeah.

66
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.360
Young, healthy,

67
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.310
21 year old people who eat and exercise are not at high risk

68
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.510
for coronavirus, but you should think about other people. I would say, well,

69
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.870
that's a different argument and yes, that makes sense.

70
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.510
But I would say aren't those people vaccinated and shouldn't we vaccinate the

71
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.070
vulnerable people. Yeah. And then we'd have a different conversation.

72
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.510
Or the problem is today, everything is all headlines and highlights.

73
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.060
It's all click bay, which is fine. That's the business. Yeah. And I, listen,

74
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.540
I have a deep respect for real journalism.

75
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.740
I love Glen green wall and Matt Taibbi and people that stick their neck out and

76
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:51.660
do real journalism.

77
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.700
But there's a lot of people out there that have to make a living.

78
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.500
And what's the best way to make a living. Well, here's one way,

79
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.570
take a jacket like me. &lt;laugh&gt; go over their podcast.

80
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.290
Go over this three hour drunken ridiculous podcast. Do we drink with Dave? Yes.

81
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.770
No. Dave Smith. I don't know. I don't think so. No, no.

82
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.970
I don't think we drink say no, probably not, but that's unusual. Yeah.

83
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.570
A lot of times we're drinking or time I'm here. We're high. Yeah. You know,

84
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.640
and I say, stupid. I get it.

85
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:26.520
And if you mind that and you make money off of that more power

86
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.200
to you. Sure. I don't care. Yeah. I'm happy for you. Right. But just don't lie.

87
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.920
Just don't lie. Right, right. Make, get a little click baby. We're good. Yeah.

88
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.920
That's okay. But I'm not gonna lie. Let me, let me say one other thing. Yeah.

89
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:39.120
I was going to get the vaccine.

90
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.470
I was scheduled to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.

91
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.910
The UFC had allocated a certain amount of vaccines for all their employees.

92
00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:50.110
Right. And so Dana said, do you wanna come in and get the vaccine? I said, sure,

93
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.910
what day? And he said, we'll,

94
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:55.630
we'll set one aside when you come in for the fights, come get vaccine. I said,

95
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:57.550
okay, great. I went in there, I spoke to Dr. Davidson.

96
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.220
He said the way the CDC has the VA vaccines allocated,

97
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.820
we really have to do you at the clinic. So can you come to the hospital?

98
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.260
And I said, I can't, I don't have time. He said,

99
00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:12.140
you'd have to come back on Monday. I said, I'll work this out.

100
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.340
And then it got pulled, right? Like right afterwards Johnson,

101
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:18.620
Johnson thing got pulled, which now here's the thing.

102
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.530
Any medication again, I'm not a doctor. I'm a moron.

103
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.330
And I'm a cage fighting commentator. Who's a dirty standup comedian.

104
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.610
&lt;laugh&gt; who just told you I'm drunk most of the time.

105
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.010
&lt;laugh&gt; and I do testosterone and I smoke a lot of weed,

106
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.730
but I'm not a respected source of information. Even for me,

107
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.570
if I say things, I'm always going check on that, Jamie.

108
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.200
I don't know if that's true. Right. I do do that all the time. Right.

109
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.440
But I at least try to be honest about what I'm saying

110
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.880
or what you feel. Yes. Yeah. That's what it is.
