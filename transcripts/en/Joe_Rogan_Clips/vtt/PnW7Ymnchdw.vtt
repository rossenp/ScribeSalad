<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.641
<v 2>This idea,</v>

3
00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:07.920
this concept is so fantastic to me to take elite gr

4
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.320
elite grapplers and pay them for matches and then stream it online and

5
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.680
flow grappling is doing this and they're very successful. Yes. A lot,

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.080
lot of jujitsu people are tuning into these things and, and, you know, it's,

7
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:21.790
it's real, really become a hit. Um.

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.350
<v 1>It, a true key in the development of any sport is some kind of,</v>

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.910
uh, organization which showcases it, uh, for mixed martial arts.

10
00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:35.070
It was the UFC and grappling always struggled with, uh,

11
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.390
the idea of showcasing the skills of the athletes. Um,

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.420
there were local shows when,

13
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.060
when you and I started Jud through those crazy local shows where people would

14
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:48.300
just informally coming and compete against each other. Um,

15
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.260
but there was nothing that had any kind of overall vision or sustained

16
00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:54.340
program over time.

17
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.300
And that I believe is what flow grappling is trying to do here.

18
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.090
They're trying to give something a grappling version of what the U S he has done

19
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:05.010
for mixed martial arts. And, uh, uh,

20
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.890
the athlete pay is improved dramatically over, uh, earlier years.

21
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.290
And athlete exposure is massively improved. So it's a very encouraging thing.

22
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.170
<v 0>And the productions. Excellent. Yes, it's really good. It's uh,</v>

23
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:21.290
great commentary. Great. It's something.

24
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.440
<v 1>Where you could to takes someone who didn't know much about grappling a friend</v>

25
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:28.160
of yours, invite them over, watch it together. And, and they'll be, Hey,

26
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.800
that's an impressive sport. Like, as you said, the production looks like it's,

27
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:32.800
it's a legitimate sport,

28
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.800
as opposed to like going to the local high school on a Saturday and watching you

29
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:39.640
compete and, um, yeah. In, in that fashion.

30
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.321
<v 0>Well,</v>

31
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:44.070
one of the things that's made the sport more power is the approach that your

32
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:44.850
athletes take.

33
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.430
And many other athletes are following suit is that it's a very submission based

34
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.750
approach instead of just trying to score points,

35
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.110
because I think there's been a problem with these rule sets where,

36
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.950
I mean, even though Abu Dhabi's done an amazing job of showcasing elite,

37
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:05.100
grapplers, there's something weird about out there's score sets systems.

38
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.940
So the first was it first five minutes? There's no point score that's correct.

39
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.340
Yes. And then the next five minutes you score points. So,

40
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.340
so you get guys stalling out for five minutes.

41
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.900
So you almost guarantee a boring five minutes,

42
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.420
unless you have some sort of Marcela Garcia,

43
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.780
attacker who just ju just dives on submissions and goes after it right away,

44
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.770
which is not the norm. The norm is points based,

45
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.450
guys who are just trying to win. That's correct.

46
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.210
<v 1>Um, as a general rule, you know, athletes are smart and they want to win.</v>

47
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.530
So, um, they will, as a general rule,

48
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:42.530
always try to find the least risky way of attaining victory and doing the

49
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:46.800
minimum amount of work I, in order to get to a win. Um,

50
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.880
and yet the,

51
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.080
the spectators are demanding something else they're demanding entertainment.

52
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.120
And in the Sportage you did.

53
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.280
So the most entertaining thing you can do is to push the action towards

54
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:04.560
submission holds and submissions function and grappling the same way a knockout

55
00:03:04.561 --> 00:03:08.160
punch does in boxing. And it's the most desired result.

56
00:03:08.161 --> 00:03:10.760
It's also the most impressive result. If you think Joe,

57
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.160
back to when you first started jujitsu,

58
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.480
what was its primary appeal? Well,

59
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.390
I think for the overwhelming majority of practitioners of Judis,

60
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.430
who was the idea of submission.

61
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.710
<v 0>I think that's the only appeal. Yeah. It's I don't,</v>

62
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.470
I don't think you could ever say anybody. I find it appealing to win on points.

63
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.733
Yeah. Or.

64
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.350
<v 1>It's ridiculous, or even worse on advantage. Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.230
<v 0>You just wrestle if you wanna do that. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.350
<v 1>Um, when, when you look at, uh, at Judit,</v>

67
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.470
so what makes it remarkable is the idea that it's a form of grappling with the

68
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:40.700
outcome is determined in a way,

69
00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:44.940
which it it's understandable to anyone it's it's surrender.

70
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.900
You make someone surrender to you, like, um, as impressive as, uh,

71
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.180
judo wrestling are sports,

72
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.060
the mechanism by which they win and Jude's case the eon throw,

73
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.290
they do have submissions in judo, but they're much less emphasized. Um,

74
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.170
and in wrestling at pinned, they're not as decisive. Like, you know,

75
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.410
it's easy to imagine someone who got pinned with their shoulders on the mat for

76
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:10.010
three seconds, but came back to win the fight.

77
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:11.650
That's not a difficult thing to conceive of.

78
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.770
It's easy to conceive of someone who got thrown pretty hard and still kept

79
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.730
fighting and won. But when you surrender that, that's you saying,

80
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.320
I quit it's over.

81
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.280
And that's the most definitive form of victory possible in, in any, uh,

82
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:29.960
form of grappling. And that I think was the true appeal of jujitsu.

83
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.360
The further you get away from the idea that jujitsu is about control leading

84
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.320
to submission, the less interesting the sport becomes. And, uh,

85
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.470
we must do as much as possible to push athletes towards

86
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.750
that, that, that form of, uh, that expression of UTSU,

87
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.150
don't just win by the minimum amount to get the job done,

88
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.390
but go the extra distance and try to win by submission. Now,

89
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.830
you just mentioned the name of Marcella Garcia.

90
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.140
He was one of a handful of athletes. You, you see, um,

91
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.460
harder Gracie was another who at a time, when the rule set didn't demand,

92
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.100
it went out of their way to go the extra distance and fight

93
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.700
from beginning to end for submission.

94
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.450
And what do you notice about those athletes? Their legend they're legends.

95
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.170
They're loved to a degree which all those other athletes, and don't forget,

96
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:31.090
they both lost, okay. They both had their losses, they weren't undefeatable,

97
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.170
but they're legends because of the way they fought as much as

98
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.930
for the victories themselves. Yeah. They represented true jujitsu.

99
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:42.400
They represented the ideal of controller mission.

100
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.400
And there's a sense in which athletes have to understand,

101
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.200
if you want to build a brand in jujitsu,

102
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.960
you can't just go with that minimalist approach of do enough to win,

103
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.080
be happy with that.

104
00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.680
And you have to go into expressing the ideal of jujitsu.

105
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.520
Now, the natural response on the part of many organizers is to try and

106
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.200
create rules,

107
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.320
which force athletes against their will to go the extra distance.

108
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:17.070
That was the intention in ADCC, the Abu Dhabi, um, uh, approach.

109
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.150
They, they took away points in the first five minutes.

110
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.430
So that athletes would be encouraged to go for submission holds.

111
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.830
Now some of them were, but as you correctly pointed out, most of them weren't,

112
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:31.630
they actually used it, not as a means of encouraging submission,

113
00:06:31.631 --> 00:06:36.270
but actually avoiding any form of contact and making for a very boring first

114
00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:38.860
five minutes in any cases. Um,

115
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.780
so what I truly believe is that it's,

116
00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:48.660
there's never going to be a rule set, which forces athletes towards submission.

117
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.540
The way it's gonna change is through culture. It's gotta come.

118
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.780
I believe from coaches,

119
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.250
creating a culture athletes strive for a higher ideal in jujitsu,

120
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:05.370
which is control to submission rather than minimum

121
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.650
advantage or points to score a win and, and be happy.

122
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.610
It's gotta come from a training room culture rather than rules.

123
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.200
A good athlete can always game rules to get the

124
00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:23.960
minimum, uh, method of victory. There's always a way like,

125
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:26.360
just as a lawyer will find any interpretation of a,

126
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.600
of a law in order to get the result they seek.

127
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.760
So to an athlete can find any interpretation of the rules to get to the minimum.

128
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.080
When, so it's not gonna come from rules,

129
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.440
they've tried in the past and it just hasn't worked. In fact,

130
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.070
just actually had some negative connotations as, as you pointed out. Um,

131
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.510
so it's gotta come from a training room culture,

132
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.750
and that's what I try to do with my squad.
