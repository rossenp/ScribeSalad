00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.000
<v 2>Was Amanda, Nuez your, your most difficult fights?</v>

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.560
<v 0>Uh, I never was considered like, um,</v>

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.080
difficulty of the fight only for the fight for

5
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:21.070
this fight for on soles. Uh, for me,

6
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:25.150
difficulty of the fight it's combination of training camp,

7
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.110
your approach to the fight fight week and the fight

8
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.990
itself. So, uh, I still cannot like,

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.430
um, answer this question. I think it's the hardest question.

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.300
And uh, every time people ask me, like, what is your hardest fight?

11
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.860
Hardest disappointed. And I just cannot answer because it's so different.

12
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.300
Each fight. It's a different approach, different training camp.

13
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.700
Everyone's difficult, difficult. There's their like own style.

14
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.170
Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; something like that. Uh, this hard to say.

15
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.690
<v 1>Hard. What is difficult about Amanda's style?</v>

16
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.850
<v 0>Your size is &lt;laugh&gt; size. It's not her style. It's not her style. It's just,</v>

17
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:12.970
she's big and heavy.

18
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.730
<v 1>Yeah. And power.</v>

19
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.450
<v 0>Uh, everyone has power. Everyone has power. One.</v>

20
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.720
If you're speaking about 1 35 weight class,

21
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.480
every everyone has like a lot of power, but, uh, Amanda,

22
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.800
I think she's just like big than anyone bigger.

23
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.640
<v 1>You think she's bigger than the rest of the division?</v>

24
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.720
<v 0>Well, she's both weight, uh, which is her boy and weight 1 60, 1 70. I DT know.</v>

25
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.573
Is it really that big?

26
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.750
<v 1>I don't know. Well, she does fight at 1 45 and she looks the at 1 45.</v>

27
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.150
She does it 1 35 and obviously at 1 45, she's able to knock out cyborg.

28
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.590
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like, you know, what's about in the accounts. Um,</v>

29
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.790
everyone has like chances to knock out each other.

30
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.300
So it's just like, it's, it's 50, 50. It's the situation. If &lt;affirmative&gt;,

31
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.780
for example, you have interchange,

32
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.980
the chances are more for each one, right. But you have to smart to have,

33
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.020
you have to fight very smart. You know, that, uh,

34
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:19.820
small glove is like more possibility to be knocked out mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; or

35
00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:24.410
you make the knock knock out. So if, um, it's kind of like,

36
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.250
are you, or you gonna hit or they gonna hit you? So it's kind of like,

37
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.130
this is what I saw in their fights.

38
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.330
So it was interchange and this interchange who's on that moment were more

39
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.164
like.

40
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.250
<v 1>If you had a long time out, like if the UFC said, uh,</v>

41
00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:46.320
here we are it's uh, we are in October.

42
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.200
If they said Valentina, August next year,

43
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.240
we would like you to fight Amanda. Nuez that's gonna be this big, super fight.

44
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.520
Would you try to gain weight? Would you lift weights?

45
00:02:59.521 --> 00:03:03.880
Would you do anything differently or would you just concentrate on technique and

46
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.160
strategy and maintain the same weight you're at now?

47
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.160
<v 0>We are October and August. Yeah. Do you know anything?</v>

48
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.280
They can approach me with.

49
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.000
<v 1>This I'm I'm I'm gonna try &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

50
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.070
So I think when I look at the two of you, it's the most compelling fight in,

51
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.030
in the UFC, in, in the women's MMA.

52
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.470
I believe that's the most compelling fight is cuz you're both at the top of your

53
00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:27.510
game and you there's an argument for both of you to be the greatest of all time.

54
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.190
<v 0>I'm not gonna, um, do anything special to lift up my weight. You.</v>

55
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.310
<v 1>Wouldn't start working out lift weights.</v>

56
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.100
<v 0>No, no, no, no, because, um, I believe it's gonna help.</v>

57
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.900
I believe it's gonna be worse for the fighter because if

58
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.540
in your whole life you was like, um, certain body type,

59
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.380
you know how to carry like certain muscles amount of muscles mm-hmm

60
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.100
&lt;affirmative&gt; and then suddenly for last two,

61
00:03:58.101 --> 00:04:02.810
three months you start to carry are way more. So what's gonna happen.

62
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.930
You're gonna be slower. You not gonna have same, uh,

63
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.770
resistance for the whole fight because you have to care more.

64
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.330
&lt;laugh&gt; mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; wait on top of you. So I will do the same.

65
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.090
I just want to do the last, like last day, wait,

66
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.880
cut for what I do for I'm gonna lose.

67
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.720
I'm not gonna lose this six pound. What is like, um,

68
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.840
that's what you do for 1 30, 1 25.

69
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.800
And I just will eat normally as I do and train the same ways

70
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.733
as I do.

71
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.480
<v 1>It's interesting to see different people's approaches, right? Like, uh,</v>

72
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.510
when Israel outta Sanya in up to challenge Janovic for the 205 pound

73
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:43.810
title,

74
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.710
he did the same thing that you're saying mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he didn't gain any

75
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:47.410
weight.

76
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.510
He just mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; just concentrated on his technique and training.

77
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.630
But there was moments in that fight where the size of ya BEOV, which was,

78
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.550
it was evident when in the grappling exchanges,

79
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:00.710
when he was able to control him on the ground.

80
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.420
&lt;affirmative&gt; do you think that there's any benefit? I mean,

81
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:06.620
this is why I'm saying, if you have a long time,

82
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.860
I'm not saying if you just have a, a normal eight week camp,

83
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.940
I'm saying if they give you eight months,

84
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.340
nine months and they let you know in advance,

85
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.780
you still don't think you'd ever try to gain any weight.

86
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.700
<v 0>I don't think it's, uh, it's still gonna help because, uh,</v>

87
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.450
some and naturally bigger,

88
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.050
every time they'll have this advantage being bigger,

89
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.130
no matter how more weight you're gonna put on top,

90
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.250
you are still the same just with extra weight on you.

91
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.930
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; well, that's why I'm interested in John Jones and John Jones.</v>

92
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:38.850
When he is trying to move up to the heavyweight division,

93
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.120
he's gained a lot of weight and he wants to be over the

94
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:46.880
265 pound limit and then cut back down to 2 65.

95
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.640
So I believe he's walking around somewhere in the two sixties. Now.

96
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.320
<v 0>I think we will know the answer only when he will fight in this weight class.</v>

97
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.800
And we will know exactly how it's gonna affect him.

98
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.480
Will it be good for him or bad for him? So we don't know, as I say,

99
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.600
every person is different and I know how my budget works. I know,

100
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.760
uh, what is good for me? What is bad for me, Israel?

101
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.590
He knows exactly the same about his body type John Jones. He knows, uh,

102
00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:21.550
exactly about himself. So this is, uh, everyone's approach.

103
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.870
And I think everyone should do what they think is gonna help them

104
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.803
to win.

105
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.910
<v 1>So for you from going down from 1 35 to 1 25</v>

106
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.870
was the right move. You felt like much better at 1 25.

107
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.780
<v 0>It's my natural weight. Plus it's like, uh, it's like what? I was competing all.</v>

108
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.060
<v 1>The time. Have you ever thought of going lower.</v>

109
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.780
<v 0>One 15? Yeah. And, uh, die from the hunger. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>
