WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.560
<v 0>And it's and he's supposed to be cheap,</v>

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.490
like in terms of like how he pays workers at the Amazon factor as well.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.360
<v 1>I would imagine that when it comes to blue origin, his rocket company,</v>

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.340
that he is not cheap. Oh, I didn't.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.270
<v 0>Even know he had a rocket.</v>

6
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.890
<v 1>Competency, has a rocket company.</v>

7
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.180
<v 0>Elon Musk. Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.290
<v 1>Look at you over these Jeff.</v>

9
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.270
He thinks that he thinks that that space X and Elon Musk are the

10
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.040
hair and he's the tortoise.

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.440
So he has launched a rocket the same rocket eight times now and

12
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.650
landed it again. Really? Yeah. Same rocket. The same rocket.

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.860
So he's demonstrated multiple reuse.

14
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.600
The problem is that his rocket can't or can only get to the fringes of space.

15
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.000
It can't really get into orbital space.

16
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.530
<v 0>There he is right here at Jamie. Just pulled it up.</v>

17
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.000
You can look at it right there. Yeah. It, wow. It's that real?

18
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.560
That's a real Jamie, why does it look fake? She haven't seen it before.

19
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.610
I don't know it. Doesn't it look like CGIU well, I sound like Eddie Bravo.

20
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.200
<v 1>So it could be, but he's actually launched this thing eight times.</v>

21
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.410
What's with the golf ball inside of there. I have no clue.

22
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.160
It's probably demonstrating that it, that it's weightless.

23
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.060
<v 0>The extraordinary time of super genius is dude. Incredible.</v>

24
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.570
And this is how it lands. It lands the same way. That's exactly.

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.730
<v 1>Got it. That's incredible.</v>

26
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.740
And Elan says Elan's been landing his rockets and he wants to

27
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.180
read and he's been reusing them.

28
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:27.180
I think he's done 11 reuses so far something like that.

29
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.590
But Ilan is saying that he's going to get so precise in his landings that the

30
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.210
rockets will land precisely on the brackets from which they took off.

31
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.430
Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

32
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.190
<v 0>And that was on the same pad. I mean,</v>

33
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.370
there was a fairly small pad that the Bezos rockets.

34
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.250
<v 1>So basis is a very well-controlled rocket. Elan's you,</v>

35
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.890
you saw after the Falcon heavy launch,

36
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.110
the pictures of the two boosters landing simultaneously within a

37
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:57.090
hundred yards of each other. Oh,

38
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.300
you have to bring that up sometime because it's an astonishing.

39
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.310
<v 0>Bayzos is, uh, the Amazon prime videos they're putting out,</v>

40
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.870
they're putting out some really great shows.

41
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.480
They're putting out a lot of standup comedy now as well,

42
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.300
which they're trying to somewhat compete with Netflix. And if you have a, a,

43
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.450
there it is right there.

44
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.700
<v 1>Just heavy. Well though, that's that's it? Yeah. That's the money shot.</v>

45
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.110
Yeah. Wow. That's incredible landing simultaneously. Unbelievable. Yeah.

46
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.470
So the goal here is up until now, NASA,

47
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.360
which has been dumbed down so much,

48
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.780
it's ridiculous by Congress and the Senate because Congress and the Senate are

49
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:41.700
insist on designing their own rockets and ordered Bruce jobs programs not to

50
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:43.800
get us to space. Um.

51
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.680
<v 0>Is that what the problem is, is it's a funding issue too, right?</v>

52
00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:50.400
It's like you have to have immediate results for the amount of money that you

53
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:50.670
put on.

54
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.120
<v 1>Worse than that. The there's a little thing called the Alabama mafia.</v>

55
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:57.930
It's a bunch of senators and congressmen from Texas and Colorado and Ms.

56
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.400
Mississippi and all the states that have rocket jobs.

57
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.240
And they have designed a rocket called the space launch system,

58
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.890
and it's going to cost $30 billion to design it. And it's a throwaway rocket.

59
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.040
So it's going to cost one to $2 billion for each flight.

60
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.940
You think this is intentional? Um, it's intentionally yes.

61
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:18.160
It's intentionally stupid. He thinks that, yeah,

62
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.050
because it's designed for jobs and the result is we Americans haven't

63
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:26.920
had access to space on American made vehicles since 2011.

64
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.900
That's a long time now, um, when we do get access to manned space,

65
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.280
it's going to come from Milan mosque.

66
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:35.740
It's not going to come from any of the major space companies.

67
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.490
And $3 billion a year is sunk into this space launch system,

68
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.260
this Turkey and another Turkey called the Orion and that's money that needs.

69
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.090
We need that money to actually design habitats on the moon,

70
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.070
to design mining equipment, to mine,

71
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:55.810
the ice on the moon and turn it into a rocket fuel and breathable oxygen and

72
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:59.590
drinkable water. And there are tons of things we need,

73
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:03.430
but NASA is not producing them because it's trying to compete with Elan and Jeff

74
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.390
Elan and Jeff know secret. If I volunteered to fly you to New York city,

75
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.240
and I told you, I'm going to do this for free.

76
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:13.060
I'm not going to charge you a penny. All you have to pay are the expenses.

77
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.750
And then I bought you a Boeing 7 37 for

78
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.140
$325,000 and allowed you and one friend to get into this thing.

79
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.670
And then I flew to New York and then I flew the plane out into the Atlantic,

80
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.260
over the Atlantic and plowed it into the Atlantic ocean and discarded it. Now,

81
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.010
when, but I'm doing this all without charging you anything you realize.

82
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.180
So when you want to fly back from New York to California,

83
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.500
I'll buy you another 7 37, another $325,000,

84
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.660
um, and fly you back.

85
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.710
And then I'll fly the 7 37 out over the Pacific and I will ditch it.

86
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.040
This is the way we do space at NASA right now.

87
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.960
So how much would it cost you per ticket for you on a friend to go from

88
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.790
LA to New York and back again,

89
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.650
approximately $325,000 per ticket.

90
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.370
How often would you fly from New York to, from LA to New York?

91
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.460
Not very often if ever.

92
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.270
So that's what NASA is doing with the space launch system.

93
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:17.680
And it's gobbling up so much money.

94
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:20.830
There's no funding left for the stuff we really need to do. Do you think.

95
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.890
<v 0>It would be better if they just privatized the entire venture?</v>

96
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.010
<v 1>It would be better if they offered what are called cots programs,</v>

97
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:31.870
where you ask companies to bid on getting a rocket wherever you want it to go

98
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.140
and doing with that rocket, whatever you want it to do.

99
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.570
And then let Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and United launch

100
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:44.410
Alliance, which is a big company underwritten by the government. That is, uh,

101
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.840
I can never remember the names of the companies,

102
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:51.640
but it's Boeing and Lockheed Martin combined and allow them all

103
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.900
to bid on this. Um, because Elan is going to bring it in for a 10th.

104
00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.950
The cost Elan has developed the Falcon heavy for approximately $2 billion.

105
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.270
He's developed all of his rockets for approximately $2 billion for all of them.

106
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.740
It's crossing NASA $30 billion to develop a Turkey. Now.

107
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.890
<v 0>How do they keep doing that in the face of these guys like Elon Musk and Jeff</v>

108
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.040
Bezos.

109
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.290
<v 1>Congressmen and senators don't care,</v>

110
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.380
they simply want to maintain the jobs in their districts.

111
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:25.880
Plus if they feed the Smick, the space military industrial complex,

112
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.040
the space military industrial complex will kick back contributions to their

113
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:35.340
campaign funds as a result. So this is a,

114
00:06:35.341 --> 00:06:37.310
an evil spiral, um,

115
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.870
buzz Aldrin calls these the Darth Vader's of space for Lockheed Martins and

116
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:45.290
Northrop Grumman's and the big aerospace swept traditional aerospace

117
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:47.750
contractors. So, um,

118
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.300
congressmen sent a certain number.

119
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:54.680
It's a cabal of senators and congressmen who are screwing us up because a

120
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:59.540
country, a country that dreams big gets big. A country that looks up,

121
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.410
goes up a country that looks down, goes down. We've covered.

122
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.950
We become accustomed to looking down because we don't have that

123
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.670
glorious option. The moon is way behind us. Um, BAAs and,

124
00:07:11.671 --> 00:07:15.440
and Neil Armstrong walking on the moon. That's a long time ago.

125
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:18.830
That's two generations, two and a half generations ago.

126
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.020
And kids in America have lost that dream of creating a paradise above the

127
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:26.870
sky because NASA is abandoned them.

128
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.890
And it's mass has been forced to abandon them by these congressmen and senators

129
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:35.420
who steal this money from the NASA budget. But if that money were used,

130
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:40.040
look that $3 billion a year would mean that you could develop an entire Elon

131
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:44.210
Musk pace program and launch roughly 20 rockets.

132
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.420
<v 0>This is the issue, the, the actual engineers and the scientists themselves.</v>

133
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:48.254
I mean, they must.

134
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.030
<v 1>Obviously politicians, right?</v>

135
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.600
<v 0>But the politicians are they able to dictate what the actual scientists and</v>

136
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:58.520
engineers create say, Hey, you must create something that is disposable.

137
00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.953
<v 1>Uh, yes.</v>

138
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.840
<v 0>But is that really a conversation that's taking place?</v>

139
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.600
<v 1>Yes, because these guys have said, okay, we want to use, um, a space shuttle,</v>

140
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.250
leftover space, shuttle technology. And we, and they,

141
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.430
they mapped out the specifications of the rocket that they want.

142
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.330
These guys are doing what? Yes, that's right. How's that possible? Oh,

143
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:23.570
it's easy. That seems disgusting. They control the budget.

144
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:27.290
And one of the trucks that they smack the space military industrial complex has

145
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:32.240
known for a long time is you try to parcel our jobs to as many states

146
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:37.070
as possible. So major programs like the, the latest,

147
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.520
uh, fighter, um, that the air force,

148
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:44.390
the Navy are being told to use. Um,

149
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.320
those represent jobs in roughly 45 states. Each,

150
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.470
that means that if you're Lockheed Martin and you want to keep your contract for

151
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:55.170
a plane,

152
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.850
that people are claiming can lose to a 1951 era MIG,

153
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.610
um, all you have to do is hit the congressmen and senators from those 47 states.

154
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.740
And they'll all back you. Why?

155
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:10.020
Because they're counting on your campaign contributions,

156
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:13.440
where are you going to get the money to give them a campaign contributions from

157
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:17.010
that billion to $3 billion nipple per year,

158
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.750
that NASA has been forced to extend you or that the air force has been forced to

159
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:25.530
extend to you. It's a very corrupt system, that's a dirty system.

160
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.970
