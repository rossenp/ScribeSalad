WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.120
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yes. Also since then,</v>

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.620
you've had a bunch of surgeries and 13 so far. And what,

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.880
what started that off?

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.070
<v 1>Well, I kind of hurt my back in high school when I was power lifting.</v>

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.170
And then I heard it again in college when I was playing football and my back

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.280
end neck, uh, the chiropractor for a long time.

7
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.890
And then one day in the gym, I heard it like at 96,

8
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.520
I kinda herniated a disc. And, uh,

9
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.080
I guess it just got worse over, over time.

10
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.130
<v 0>When you herniated that disc, what did you do to treat it?</v>

11
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.960
<v 1>Nothing. Uh, nothing I'm with the chiropractor. Chiropractor. Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.470
I've been doing chiropractic all my life. Yeah. So I didn't, you know,

13
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:54.950
I didn't have surgery or nothing like, like that. When I herniated that this,

14
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.270
they, they offered me to have surgery. I told Noah.

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.260
<v 0>So the surgery they wanted to do was probably trim the disc down.</v>

16
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.850
Cause it was pushing against the nerve. Yeah.

17
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.370
<v 1>Yeah. Laminectomy, whatever they call it.</v>

18
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.340
<v 0>And um, so 13 of those, huh?</v>

19
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.760
<v 2>38.</v>

20
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.600
<v 1>Back, uh, like two or three hip, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3 neck.</v>

21
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.120
<v 0>And did this all like happen all at once where it's like, it feels,</v>

22
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:27.080
it felt like everything was falling apart or was it like you get a surgery and

23
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:29.600
then you better for a little while and then you hurt something else?

24
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.760
<v 1>Uh, yeah, something like that. Yeah, because the first one was back,</v>

25
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.870
the second one was back and then I think the third one was neck.

26
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.170
And then, uh, back, back and hip back,

27
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.640
back, back.

28
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.320
<v 0>And now what, what did you get done to your hips to get your hips replaced?</v>

29
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.240
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Both of them. And like, what were they when you was at 14?</v>

30
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.120
I think, yeah. 14. And how were those now?

31
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.120
I just had a hip surgery in January.

32
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.670
Uh it's it's it's holding up a little bit better now. Uh, one,

33
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:10.130
one kind of went bad. Uh soccer's broke

34
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.310
and they had to replace both of them. And uh, they.

35
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.830
<v 0>Say they only last a certain amount of years, right? Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.130
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.430
Every night I had the titanium ones and the titanium,

38
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.920
the other hardest ones.

39
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.940
Cause they roughing and they titanium and they kind of hold onto the body.

40
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.250
Oh yeah. Because of that and you know,

41
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:35.810
and to me working out and all this kind of stuff and it kinda just broke the

42
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.740
sockets.

43
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.450
<v 0>Well, I follow you on Instagram and I watch your workouts and it's,</v>

44
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:44.540
it's inspiring that after all this, you still love working out. Yeah.

45
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.850
You can really tell. I mean, you and Joe.

46
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.540
<v 1>Still a hobby. I look forward to it every day.</v>

47
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.080
<v 0>Does it give you any pause at all,</v>

48
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.300
knowing that you've been through all these surgeries and.

49
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.030
<v 1>Nah, no. You know, when you're doing something you truly love and Jordan doing,</v>

50
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.650
that's what you look forward to doing all the time. So really, regardless of,

51
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.360
you know, how you feel,

52
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.910
know of course I'm still in pain and all that kind of stuff,

53
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.280
but are you in pain all the time? Yeah.

54
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.580
But as long as I'm doing what I love doing, I'm okay.

55
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.200
You take that away then I probably won't be. Okay.

56
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.480
<v 0>But so just even sitting here right now, you're in pain, uh, just.</v>

57
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.240
<v 1>A minimum amount. It's nothing major, you know,</v>

58
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.740
if you're an athlete, you didn't paint all your life. Yeah. I mean,

59
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.060
I can remember in high school and college, you know,

60
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.460
I was in pain some days all the time. All the time. Yeah.

61
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.050
So after a while you kind of get used to it and doesn't really bother you.

62
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.690
<v 0>Okay. That's why, you know, I'm,</v>

63
00:03:47.691 --> 00:03:51.390
I'm imagining that you have a spectacular tolerance for.

64
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.620
<v 1>Pain. Yeah. I have a hard time. I remember when I herniated my disc,</v>

65
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.210
I finished my workout.

66
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.180
I was squatting 600. I remember like it was yesterday.

67
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.270
I was coming up on rep number eight and all of a sudden PI it was a

68
00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:14.040
loud gunshot sound. I do 600 for like 12,

69
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.930
13 reps all the time.

70
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.340
This time I had took a couple of weeks off and I thought I was still in the

71
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.180
strongest. I was, you know, when I took the time off, but I wasn't,

72
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.500
I lost a little strength and that's why that disc snapped on me like that.

73
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.020
I heard it and I felt it. But you know,

74
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.570
the athlete in youth, like, you know, let's go on finish, let's finish this up.

75
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.590
So I finished up, you know, I did that leg press and some other exercises.

76
00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:51.330
And every time after I finished working

77
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.660
out doing legs, I always had a, uh,

78
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.200
a real bad pain in my back every single time.

79
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.680
But it would always go away and like an hour

80
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.220
this day, it didn't. And I was, I just went home, ate,

81
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:12.450
put on my uniform, was headed to work and I'm like, wait a minute.

82
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.380
My back is still hurting. This is two hours, almost 12 hours later.

83
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.880
Something's wrong. I ain't going to work today. I'm going to emergency room.

84
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.960
So yeah, it was that bad. Yeah.

85
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.900
<v 0>And so he went to the emergency room. They probably like,</v>

86
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.440
what the are you doing the size of this guy?

87
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.450
<v 1>Yeah. Like we all see nothing wrong with your back. Yeah.</v>

88
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.220
They probably couldn't get to it.

89
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.383
<v 2>Well, they.</v>

90
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.560
<v 1>Did an x-ray and they like, we don't see anything.</v>

91
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.780
So that's what I had in MRI.

92
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.670
And a couple of days later and found out it was herniated.

93
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.340
So I stayed at home for a couple of weeks and uh,

94
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.030
sat on the couch and didn't do anything. And two weeks later I went back,

95
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.560
the gym first exercise was squats. Oh my God.

96
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.530
Did it hurt again? No, no, no, no. I'll get ready for a show. So it was okay.

97
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.490
<v 2>Yeah, it was okay. Two weeks after you herniated your disc,</v>

98
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.510
you're doing squats again.

99
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.520
<v 1>I don't, I only did 300 only 300. Yeah.</v>

100
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.560
That's the most I could do for 10 reps, you know? Wow. 10 to 12 reps.

101
00:06:20.561 --> 00:06:22.480
So I'm like, okay, this is good enough. You know,

102
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.400
but you knew that something was wrong. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

103
00:06:24.401 --> 00:06:26.110
I couldn't do 600 no more. You know?

104
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.820
<v 0>So, so after that, how long before you got your first surgery?</v>

105
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.580
10 years later. 10 years. 10 years. So it was just intolerable pain,

106
00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:37.450
like what was going on?

107
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.283
<v 1>I couldn't,</v>

108
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.180
I couldn't walk like no more than like 25 feet without my,

109
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.050
my leg being on fire on my feet being on fire.

110
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.880
And now I am a LA a whole lot of pain. Wow.

111
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.190
So I knew it's time to get some

112
00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.050
serious done here now.

113
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.060
<v 0>So what was the first, did they fuse it?</v>

114
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.020
<v 1>Lemonade lemon next to me when they shaved it off. Okay.</v>

115
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.300
So that was the first one. Yeah. And I was, I was good for awhile, you know,

116
00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:13.990
I went back to squatting and everything. And while you're still Mr. Olympia?

117
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.530
No, you know, I had retired. That was, I retired in oh seven.

118
00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:19.360
So I had my first surgery in oh seven.

119
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.650
<v 0>Okay. So this is after you're retired. You're not doing too bad.</v>

120
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.600
Just in a little bit of pain. Yeah. So how does it all go down hill from there?

121
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.703
Yeah.

122
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.490
<v 1>I don't, I think maybe the, you know,</v>

123
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:37.870
the second one about a year or so later I started having problems again,

124
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.380
being in pain, again, same area, same area.

125
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.170
So it was like heavy, still? Yeah. 600 pounds.

126
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.050
And still that kind of stuff. No, because I wasn't competing.

127
00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:54.400
So I was probably doing about four or 500 somewhere in there, but then,

128
00:07:54.401 --> 00:07:57.860
you know, it's still kind of heavy and uh, I,

129
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:00.790
I don't ha I didn't have the weight that I used to have either, you know,

130
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.770
I wasn't 300 and something pounds no more.

131
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.560
So it was a little bit more difficult.

132
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:09.190
So it just kind of went bad on me again.

133
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:10.600
And I had to have another surgery.

134
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.450
<v 0>Same kind of surgery. They trim more off of it.</v>

135
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.310
<v 1>Actually. They did what you call, like, uh,</v>

136
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.710
I forgot actually what they did.

137
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:28.630
It's been so long ago that was back in like 2008, 2009,

138
00:08:28.631 --> 00:08:32.590
somewhere in there, they kind of like did a reef refresh it. Like they,

139
00:08:32.591 --> 00:08:36.970
I think they did trim a little bit more off it though. But, uh,

140
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.380
you know, it was all pretty much kind of like down here from there.

141
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.210
<v 0>And so after that injury and that surgery, then how, how does he,</v>

142
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.850
how do you round up with the other 11 surgeries?

143
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.463
<v 1>Well,</v>

144
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.740
I think like the first time you herniated disc,

145
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.420
it's like you can stack a bunch of cans on top of each other and you snap one

146
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:02.550
out. Well,

147
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.240
after a while the other one's going to start falling out of place too.

148
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.820
And that's kind of what happened, you know,

149
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.250
the other day started to just herniating on their own.

150
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.260
Of course I was working out too. And, uh, I still have one.

151
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:20.350
Now you got a herniated disc now. Yeah. Well.

152
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.900
<v 0>How many discs have you had operated on all of them? All of them.</v>

153
00:09:23.901 --> 00:09:25.370
Every single desk, everything.

154
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.970
So this one that you ever herniated disc on now,

155
00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:30.350
if you already had it operated on before?

156
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.540
<v 1>No. This will be the first time for this. This is the last one. Yeah. Wow.</v>

157
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.980
<v 0>And so what did they do with your bag?</v>

158
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.130
They basically fuse everything together now. Yeah. So the whole spine.

159
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.070
<v 1>Is fused. Yeah. Wow. Neck and back.</v>

160
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.290
How much mobility do you have? I mean, I can still, you know,

161
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.820
bend over and Thomas shoe and do all that kind of stuff.

162
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.430
<v 0>But your back is one solid piece. Yeah.</v>

163
00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.680
So there's no like articulation of your discs in your spine.

164
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.090
<v 3>And spinal column? Nothing. Wow. What does that feel like?</v>

165
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.820
<v 1>Uh, I mean, I guess it just feels kind of normal after a while, you know,</v>

166
00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:14.360
you get used to it. Yeah. It happens over time.

167
00:10:14.361 --> 00:10:18.920
So it's like a gradual thing. So it's, it's not all of a sudden,

168
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.310
so it was just like one day, you know, you know, I,

169
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.180
I used to be able to just bend over and do all these stretches,

170
00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:30.190
these crazy stretches. Well, I can't do all that no more. Yeah.

171
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.600
I can just bend over a little bit, you know, do a minor stretch. Yeah.

172
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.250
<v 0>The doctors. Are they confident that this is the last one?</v>

173
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.790
I mean, you've got them all fused.

174
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.580
<v 1>Yeah. It's always something though. You know,</v>

175
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.740
when you are an athlete and you always working out and always in the gym is

176
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.100
gonna always be something. You just accept that. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

177
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.020
You're used to it after awhile.

178
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:57.801
<v 0>A lot of people,</v>

179
00:10:57.801 --> 00:11:01.400
that's a hard thing to accept this idea that he's just going to keep smashing

180
00:11:01.401 --> 00:11:02.234
your body.

181
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.420
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. I've got used to it now. It's been so busy having to say like,</v>

182
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.160
oh, seven, 13 years now. Wow. Hmm.

183
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.020
<v 0>Now, um, are you in this wheelchair all the time? No. No.</v>

184
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.400
<v 1>I, I don't have crutches. It's just that, uh, I left them at home.</v>

185
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.520
I can walk, uh, maybe about from here to that wall on the assistant,

186
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.660
but you know, after, after, so,

187
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:38.120
so after being up for so long, my legs get real weak because of your back.

188
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.990
Yeah. I.

189
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:43.040
<v 0>Was my back. Is it something that's like cutting off the nerves or something?</v>

190
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.680
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. Winding off the nerves. Yeah.</v>

191
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.050
<v 0>And is there anything they can do about that?</v>

192
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.020
<v 1>Uh, I mean, you know,</v>

193
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.960
maybe one day come out with something that'll help get us stronger.

194
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.910
I was thinking about trying to stem cell thing. Yeah.

195
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.050
I said that that should help a lot too right there.

196
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.830
<v 0>So a bunch of places that they do it,</v>

197
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.950
where they could do it with a lot stronger stem cells and they can do in

198
00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:11.370
America, like the place in Columbia does it. And, um,

199
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.210
there's a place in Panama that I actually sent my mom. Yeah. My mom,

200
00:12:15.211 --> 00:12:19.560
they wanted to give her a knee replacement and um, doctors just,

201
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.660
they want to operate right away. And I was like, Hm, let me, let me see. Yeah,

202
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.100
we can send you down to Panama.

203
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.450
Let me see if Dr. Reardon he'd been in here before with Mel Gibson and he was

204
00:12:30.451 --> 00:12:34.740
talking about Mel Gibson's dad and Mel Gibson's dad was in real bad shape when

205
00:12:34.741 --> 00:12:38.850
he was 92. And then now he's a hundred and he's fine. I mean,

206
00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:42.450
just gone back there a bunch of times keeps going back for stem cells. Yeah.

207
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.260
Long story short, my mom was scheduled to get a knee replacement.

208
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.520
I sent her down to Panama and six months later it started to feel good.

209
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.180
Eight months later, no pain at all. Yeah. It, it really did a great,

210
00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:57.180
and then I sent her down a second time. It's it's pretty amazing stuff.

211
00:12:57.181 --> 00:12:57.840
What they can do.

212
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.490
<v 1>Yeah. So that's, that's, that's my thing to do next. And uh,</v>

213
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.310
people I've talked to, they, uh, think it will do me a lot of good. All good.

214
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.310
<v 0>So is it there's scar tissue around the nerves?</v>

215
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.540
That's pushing it's the nerves now.

216
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.590
Cause if all the disks are gone and everything's fused, what's irritating,

217
00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:17.424
the nerves.

218
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.840
<v 1>Scar tissue, uh, all that hardware.</v>

219
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.110
I got 14 screws, two cages.

220
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.050
Uh, I got two rods, but this long in there too.

221
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.690
So it's a lot of hardware, a lot of cages. And uh,

222
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.250
what are the cages look like?

223
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.360
<v 0>So it's a cage around your spine. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

224
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.000
And what's the purpose of that?

225
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.990
<v 1>I hold it this together. Keeping them in place. Yeah. That was the wild. They,</v>

226
00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:51.900
they, they don't want them to come, uh, loose,

227
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.460
but the cages around them keep them together. So you're like Robocop in there.

228
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.660
Yeah. Pretty much because I got that in my neck and back.

229
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:05.760
<v 0>You have a cage in your neck? Yeah. You got an x-ray of any of this. Yeah.</v>

230
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.530
I'm not sure. What is it? Is it online? Yeah.

231
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.500
<v 1>I posted a couple of times online. Yeah.</v>

232
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.880
<v 0>On your Instagram page. Yeah. See if you can find any that Jamie that's crazy.</v>

233
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.980
Yeah. You Liz laughing about it.

234
00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:19.320
Like you're fine with it when you get used to it. That was the one.

235
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.750
But is it also that you look at like,

236
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.890
you're legitimate legend and so do you look at it like, Hey,

237
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.830
this is the price that I paid to be a legend.

238
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.390
<v 1>Uh, I look at it like, Hey, I'm still alive.</v>

239
00:14:33.391 --> 00:14:38.060
And I still work out every day and I'm still normal. So I'm good.

240
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.470
<v 4>Wow. That's a great.</v>

241
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.440
<v 0>Healthy attitude, man. You're obviously still huge.</v>

242
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.820
And you're still very strong. Well.

243
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.780
<v 1>Not as strong as I used to be. I'm not as big as I used to be either.</v>

244
00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:50.250
I'm only like two 50 now, you.

245
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.980
<v 0>Know, when you say you're,</v>

246
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:56.900
you're judging it on you being multiple time. Mr. Olympia.

247
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.410
That's not a regular person. I'm not as big as I used to be. Like,

248
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:02.560
you can't stay that big possible.

249
00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:07.300
<v 1>No, no, no way. No way. No. How many like that? No more. Right?</v>

250
00:15:07.301 --> 00:15:11.200
I bet it's not ideal to eat when you want me to eat half the food I used to eat.

251
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.760
I can only imagine. Now I only, I used to eat six. I only eat three.

252
00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:20.470
Now that's a normal person. Yeah. You got anything, Jamie?

253
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.240
Oh, that's going to be hard to find.

254
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:27.820
<v 0>Oh my God. That's crazy. That's what a cage looks like.</v>

255
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.463
Yeah.

256
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.760
<v 5>Wow. All that, that stuff's heavy duty.</v>

257
00:15:33.761 --> 00:15:36.130
The size of those screws in that picture. On the left.

258
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.750
<v 1>Yeah. They're about three inches long.</v>

259
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:46.210
Two to three inches long. Yeah. And they got screws on the end of them.

260
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.830
Boats on the end of you,

261
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.930
you can see on the end right here on that one on the last,

262
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:56.890
those are boats right there. So no, the big screws in between there too.

263
00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.730
Wow. Yeah, that goes all the.

264
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:05.380
<v 4>Way up. All the way up your whole back. Yeah. So there's no neck.</v>

265
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.070
<v 1>To my neck. My neck is the same way. Wow.</v>

266
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.470
For 3, 4, 5, and six.

267
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.400
<v 0>And so in doing this, they've saved your back,</v>

268
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:19.870
but they've all the hardware's what's fun. Come with your nerves. Yeah. Yeah.

269
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.230
All.

270
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:24.820
<v 1>The hardware. Yeah. It's pinching on the nerves causing pain and.</v>

271
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.040
<v 0>Stuff. What does the doctor say about that stuff?</v>

272
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.850
<v 1>I ain't nothing they can do about that. It's just going to be like that.</v>

273
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.510
They said they can take your screws up maybe one day, but it's, it's a,

274
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.360
it's a major surgery. They do that. Yeah. You know,

275
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.490
they got to cut me from all the way,

276
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.610
top to bottom and take all those out.

277
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.510
It's 14 of them that started from the top all the way down to the.

278
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.210
<v 0>Bar. Would that be possible that if they did that,</v>

279
00:16:49.211 --> 00:16:50.380
it would alleviate some of the pins.

280
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.530
<v 3>Yeah. Yeah, sure. Have you thought about it? Yeah.</v>

281
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.220
<v 1>I just went to the doctor and talked to him about it last week. Oh yeah.</v>

282
00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.340
What he say? He say, I got another herniated disc. Oh boy.

283
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.000
And they need to fix that for you think about taking them.

284
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.490
Where's the one that's herniated. The new one is hurting. It's up top.

285
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.650
See all the ones, the lower ones are already fused. Just the one on the,

286
00:17:11.651 --> 00:17:13.630
on the top is the one that's herniated. Now.

287
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.820
<v 0>That was a bulging or is it herniated?</v>

288
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.630
<v 1>Uh, he said herniated. So.</v>

289
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.010
<v 0>Pushing out,</v>

290
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.910
I had a bulging disc that I had fixed with something called Regena Keene.

291
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:26.650
Have you ever heard of Regena keen? No.

292
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.780
They invented it down in Germany and uh, a lot of, uh, athletes,

293
00:17:31.781 --> 00:17:35.680
like Coby Bryant and paint and Manny, they all went to Germany.

294
00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:39.670
It's a blood spinning procedure. Have you heard of it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

295
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.850
They do it in America. Now they have an office in Dallas.

296
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:47.260
They have an office in Santa Monica and I went to the one in Santa Monica and

297
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.440
um, they, they take your out, they spin it and they apply some medication to it.

298
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.220
And then it becomes this yellow serum. And then they inject the,

299
00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.320
the yellow serum directly into the area where the disc is and it alleviates all

300
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:06.120
the inflammation and the disc slowly goes back into place for me within

301
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.170
two weeks, I had extreme relief within two weeks.

302
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.140
And then now there's no, no bulging disc at all.

303
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:17.940
I went back after I did the full round of treatments, which I think was for,

304
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:21.690
I remember correctly, five or six different treatments. I went back.

305
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:23.580
I got a new MRI and there's no bulge anymore.

306
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.290
<v 1>Yeah. That's sort of like what they do when they do a PRP.</v>

307
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.870
<v 0>Yes. It is like, PRP is just more advanced.</v>

308
00:18:29.871 --> 00:18:34.100
It's just another level of PRP injection thing. Did you do the PRP? Yeah,

309
00:18:34.101 --> 00:18:37.430
I did all that. Did that help your neck at all? No, I didn't do anything for me.

310
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.750
It did in my neck and back actually. Well, I would,

311
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.530
I would wonder what would help you like stem cells and

312
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.110
screws out? Pretty much.

313
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.200
<v 1>The only thing that's going to help me. I think.</v>

314
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.360
<v 0>So all this stuff with your legs though,</v>

315
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:57.980
that wasn't the case before the screws and before all the no, no, no. Yeah.

316
00:18:57.981 --> 00:19:01.010
I would imagine that's what's going on, man. It's all fused up, right?

317
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.630
It doesn't have to be screwed in.

318
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.190
<v 1>No, no. Uh,</v>

319
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.540
that's why I went to the doctor because they said after about a couple of years,

320
00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:12.650
everything would be fused up Korea fused up and I can take the screws out.

321
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.050
<v 0>Where does the doctor want to operate in your neck as well?</v>

322
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.160
<v 1>No, he just fixed my neck a year ago. But the new bolt. Yeah.</v>

323
00:19:19.161 --> 00:19:22.610
This is a new bulge in my back now. Oh, it's in your back? Yeah, this is my bag.

324
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.680
Yeah. That's why

325
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.780
that was the result of a cat scan I had done, uh, last week.

326
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:32.563
Tam dude, you.

327
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.170
<v 0>You're at a hospital like every couple of weeks. It's.</v>

328
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.620
<v 1>Not seem like it though. But uh, I,</v>

329
00:19:39.621 --> 00:19:43.160
I was just wanting to get the screws out cause um, you know,

330
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.060
it's been a long time and it's still in pain. And like I said,

331
00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:51.860
it's still pinching me to got, you know, nerves being pinched. And I think,

332
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:56.660
you know, my legs are numb to my foot. Totally. No. Yeah.

333
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.380
And I, I was thinking maybe if I took the screw though,

334
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.820
I get some of this numbness to go away. Yeah. You know,

335
00:20:03.821 --> 00:20:07.310
I get some strength back also. Do you think you're going to wind up doing that?

336
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.510
If possible one day I would like to man, I'm hoping.

337
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.660
<v 0>Someone hears this. That's a specialist that has a solution for you.</v>

338
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.130
How many different doctors have you seen?

339
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.430
<v 1>Uh, right now just one. Just the one doctor. Just the one.</v>

340
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.750
Hmm. Is a local guy near you. Yeah. Yeah. Local guy

341
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.840
in Fort worth, Texas. Also my first surgery,

342
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.490
my non, uh, probably like my fourth or fifth one.

343
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.640
They operated on me for about 13 hours.

344
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.000
They cut me in the front, turn me on the side, cut me on the,

345
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.300
and then they put me on my back and cut me on my back. Jeez.

346
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.580
And, uh, that gave me a lot of problems that started the, uh,

347
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.220
immobility thing right there. What was it? I was good until I did that surgery.

348
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.150
<v 0>What kind of surgery was that as another fusion? Yeah.</v>

349
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.130
Why did they have to cut you in so many places?

350
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.350
<v 1>Cause they had to fuse so many deaths. Ugh.</v>

351
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:17.190
Put in so many screws and uh,

352
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.960
that was in 15, I think. Wow. At 16,

353
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:27.570
decent 15. I remember getting off the plane in Russia and Russia. Yeah.

354
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.220
You got that done in Russia? No, no.

355
00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:32.340
I remember getting off the plane in Russia and I'm like, man, my back is hurting

356
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.070
and I was walking fine to the hotel the next day.

357
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:44.790
Uh, my mobility got worse and the day after I was on

358
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:50.010
crutches and I've been on, on everything. It's just so out of nowhere.

359
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.020
<v 3>I don't know where and how far.</v>

360
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.550
<v 0>Out from the surgery was? This?</v>

361
00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:59.220
<v 1>The surgery was like the next month. Oh, so this was before the surgery?</v>

362
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.170
Yeah, this was before. Yeah. Okay.

363
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.960
<v 0>So then they cut you open the front and the side,</v>

364
00:22:03.961 --> 00:22:06.120
the back and then everything's downhill from there.

365
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.970
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Everything went down here from there, man.</v>

366
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.990
<v 0>I'm really hoping that somebody listens to this and some doctor hears about</v>

367
00:22:12.991 --> 00:22:16.590
this. Well, one thing is you're in Fort worth. Dr. Reardon is actually,

368
00:22:16.591 --> 00:22:19.470
his office is in Dallas. So that's pretty close to you. It's really close to me.

369
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:23.130
I'd love to connect you to him and see if there's anything that he could do.

370
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.590
Yeah. That would be nice because I'm.

371
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.050
<v 1>Always looking to get better. Cause this,</v>

372
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.740
these crutches getting on my nerves,

373
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.310
I can only imagine five years now. And.

374
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.370
<v 0>A guy who was a, the level of athlete that you were when you.</v>

375
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.560
<v 3>Were in that crime and how old are you.</v>

376
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.480
<v 1>Now? I just turned 56, 2 weeks ago. Well, you look great.</v>

377
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:50.160
Well, I'm still working out every day and uh, eating good.

378
00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.790
<v 0>Yeah. It would be nice if they could do something to, I like.</v>

379
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.150
<v 1>To get her in this background. I like to get my strength.</v>

380
00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:01.260
<v 0>Back. Yeah. I guaranteed. Dr. Reardon could probably help. Yeah.</v>

381
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.730
I don't want to guarantee, but he's, he's a real expert in, you know, uh,

382
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.200
stem cells and the benefits of stem cells. Or maybe I'd give him a call. Yeah.

383
00:23:10.201 --> 00:23:11.480
I'll connect you to, for sure.
