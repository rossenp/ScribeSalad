00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.840
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience .</v>

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.430
<v 3>And the Taliban have taken over Afghanistan. That's.</v>

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.600
<v 0>One looks.</v>

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.190
<v 1>Weird. Um.</v>

5
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.100
<v 0>I see the people falling from the plane. I did.</v>

6
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.160
<v 1>That's wild. It's it's weird.</v>

7
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.510
<v 0>It's rushing the plane,</v>

8
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:18.750
trying to get on board and trying to get rescued and taken out of the country.

9
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.550
<v 1>It's so odd. You know, I was having a conversation with, um, with friends just,</v>

10
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.850
just yesterday. And I was saying, I literally had forgotten, like I was like,

11
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:30.900
why, why was the U S in Afghanistan again? Like it had been so long.

12
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.550
I was literally trying to remember what the initial reason for going in there

13
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:40.110
was, but I mean, I'm no foreign policy expert and not going to pretend to be,

14
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:44.130
but it seems very obvious that the way they withdrew

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.420
was crazy and leaving all the,

16
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.590
leaving all the weapons and ammunition and vehicles and stuff like that for the

17
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:54.450
Taliban to just come and scoop up.

18
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.380
<v 0>If one was a legit conspiracy theorist,</v>

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.910
like a real tinfoil Hatter, you would look at this and go,

20
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:07.590
this is probably the best way to ensure the support

21
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.720
of a re-invigoration like leave a bunch of weapons behind,

22
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.640
make the whole thing disastrous,

23
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.390
have the Taliban take over the entire country in a short period of time,

24
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.010
start executing women,

25
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:24.870
mayors do all the crazy that they're probably going to do. And then,

26
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.590
you know, have some real public outcry.

27
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.911
<v 1>So had people,</v>

28
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:33.780
are I still get people who are confused as to why I do not generally trust the

29
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:34.201
government.

30
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:38.670
And I don't know how many examples I need to pull out from recent times.

31
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:40.860
And from further history to just feel like you look,

32
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:45.420
whether whether this is malice or it's incompetence

33
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.190
or, um, with some things that doesn't matter. All right.

34
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:51.024
Whether it's malice.

35
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.850
<v 0>Competence and competence in.</v>

36
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.690
<v 1>Anything, but how can with certain things, I'm like, how, how can it be like,</v>

37
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:00.390
it's so obvious, right?

38
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.840
It's so obvious what is going to happen in a certain situation.

39
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:08.130
And then you do it anyway. And I don't,

40
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.010
I don't understand that one person can be in competent, but it's like,

41
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.760
it's not just one person who makes all these ideas.

42
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:18.210
They've got actual people who are supposed to be experts and advisors,

43
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:18.781
et cetera. I mean,

44
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:22.350
you even had people in the media last last month and the media is pretty

45
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:25.200
friendly towards Joe Biden here for the most part.

46
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.260
And people in the media are saying, Hey, if you do this,

47
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:32.040
aren't the Taliban going to just take over everything? There's no.

48
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.380
<v 0>No, no. There's three RS thousand Afghanistan,</v>

49
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.940
armed soldiers and only 75,000 Taliban.

50
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.030
Meanwhile, they took it over and they just did it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

51
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:49.290
there was no gunshots fired it's no, I, I just,

52
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.590
I just think the whole thing's a disaster. The whole,

53
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.390
this nation building ideas of disaster and Afghanistan itself has never been a

54
00:02:57.391 --> 00:03:01.690
traditional country in the sense of like a central leadership. It's like,

55
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.010
it's basically for most of history has been run by a warlords

56
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.320
warlords, that controlled regions.

57
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.813
<v 1>Here's a question, Joe,</v>

58
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.050
this is something I wonder about a lot,

59
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.850
both on an individual level and on an, on a nation level,

60
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.890
how much,

61
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.780
and at what point should say a country

62
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.410
get involved with the affairs of another one where.

63
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.360
<v 0>That's a good question. Well, it's,</v>

64
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.130
it should be probably at a L w we should have levels of

65
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:38.470
atrocity that are intolerable, right?

66
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.640
Where it's like Nazi Germany type levels. But if that's the case,

67
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:44.320
why aren't we not invading North Korea?

68
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.210
Because North Korea talked to why Nomi park or any of the people that have

69
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:51.700
escaped form from North Korea,

70
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.940
it's essentially a form of Holocaust.

71
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.070
There's people that are in concentration camps.

72
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.320
They've lived their whole lives there.

73
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.520
Their children will be born there there's people that are starving to death.

74
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.280
There's people that are cannibalizing people. It's a weird,

75
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.930
up horrific situation over there. Yeah. And, uh,

76
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.040
there's no,

77
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.110
there's no plan to do anything about it. Yeah.

78
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.200
But yet we keep talking about doing things in the middle east,

79
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.030
and there's a lot of resources in the middle east that may or may not

80
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:29.740
be a motive to being there. One of them is drugs.

81
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.940
It's a up until the invasion of Afghanistan. I mean,

82
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:38.770
I'm not sure what the number is now, but Afghanistan, once we invaded,

83
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.510
I think they were the supplier of 94% of the

84
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:47.770
world's opium. Oh, I didn't know that. Oh yeah. I didn't know that. Well,

85
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:52.300
the United States troops are guarding poppy fields because these

86
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:53.800
people that were there,

87
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.990
that was their main way of making a living and the us

88
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:03.890
troops were guarding the poppy fields. It's crazy. Let's,

89
00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:06.400
let's, let's find out what the actual number is as of today.

90
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:10.630
But I believe that I think that was the number at one point in time that

91
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:15.520
94% of the world's opium supply was from Afghanistan

92
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:16.354
specifically. Wow.

93
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.100
This is also a massive supply of minerals of

94
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.760
conflict minerals. Ironically, in 2014,

95
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:29.140
the estimated opium production was 6,400. What is an empty,

96
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.270
uh, yet in 2070 production climb to a new record of 9,000 empty

97
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.820
Bubba, Bubba, as a result of a drought,

98
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.930
these levels of production are enough to supply most of the world's opiate

99
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:41.830
markets. Wow.

100
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.100
<v 1>So study from the Brookings brookings.edu.</v>

101
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.930
<v 0>Oh, metric tons. That's what it is. Okay.</v>

102
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.490
The 2007 Afghan opium production climb to what was then seen as a

103
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:58.940
staggering 8,200 metric tons, uh,

104
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.420
interesting. In 2018,

105
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.780
climb to new record of a 9,000 metric tons and falling in 2018,

106
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.650
6,400 metric tons, massive amounts of opium. Wow.

107
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.510
Yeah, this is what's crazy. Um, the, the, uh, trafficking.

108
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:22.370
Okay. Well, here it is estimated the gross value of the Afghan opiate economy,

109
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:27.260
including the cultivation of poppy processing into heroin and trafficking up

110
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.620
to Afghan borders to be between us

111
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:35.180
4.1 billion and 6.6 billion in

112
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:36.530
2017.

113
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.490
<v 1>Wow. It's so funny. Seeing those numbers,</v>

114
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.160
they are compared to like these trillions and trillions that they just keep

115
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.100
printing. Sounds like nothing.

116
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:48.800
I don't even know how these numbers are just getting to a stage.

117
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.783
We can't find them.

118
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.000
<v 0>It's just like too many zeros. Yeah. It's it's also like,</v>

119
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:54.920
where's that money going? Like if that's,

120
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.430
if they're making that much money selling heroin, where's it going?

121
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:03.140
Who's getting it. Who's selling it. Where's it going?

122
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:07.100
How's it getting out of the country? Are you guys watching it? Watch the fields,

123
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.540
keep an eye on it.

124
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.980
<v 1>I have no idea, man. The world is such a weird place and always has been,</v>

125
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:15.920
I did listen to the podcast you did with them. Y'all may park,

126
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:19.370
which was amazing. Amazing by the way. Um,

127
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.590
and wild North Korea is it blows my mind that here in

128
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:27.380
2021, with everything, you know, we're doing and whatever,

129
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:30.830
that there's just one country out there that we know

130
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.610
almost nothing about. It's just blacked out,

131
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:38.210
totally disconnected from the world. Virtually everyone. No,

132
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:40.580
one's met anyone from there virtually. No one's been there.

133
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:41.720
Even if you've been there,

134
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:46.190
you can only go on like a guided tour to like one small part of it.

135
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.960
It amazes me that that's a thing. I always just think like,

136
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:53.830
how is that possible? Given how interconnected we all?

137
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.570
<v 0>And she was saying that if it wasn't for China's support,</v>

138
00:07:56.571 --> 00:08:01.040
they wouldn't be able to survive a week. Yeah. Would be like China.

139
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.120
They need China support. And that's the reason trying to prop them up.

140
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.670
<v 1>It's so weird. How do you think that, um,</v>

141
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.070
how do you think that that will come to an end?

142
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.660
<v 0>Am I not? Am I going for hundreds of years?</v>

143
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.510
<v 1>I think it will. I think evil always evil, always falls, eventually it.</v>

144
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.250
<v 0>But what is eventually, if a human lifetime is, you know,</v>

145
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.490
if a hundred years of you're lucky there's has been many evil regimes have

146
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:28.550
lasted longer than that. So I mean, many, many,

147
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:31.700
many generations of people are going to suffer. Yeah.

148
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.343
<v 1>It's so odd.</v>

149
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.610
<v 0>That they can't do anything about it. The thing is like they're starving.</v>

150
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.520
They have no access to weapons. The government has full,

151
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:43.910
complete control of them. And when you pass the borders,

152
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:47.390
they have landmine set up. So if you're, you're making a run for it,

153
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:48.560
you're gonna blow up.

154
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.690
<v 1>And what's, do you know what what's China's interest with</v>

155
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.200
keeping or allowing it to stay that way? Is there some benefits to them?

156
00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.603
<v 0>That's a good question.</v>

157
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.700
<v 1>Because I know that I know that they're propped up by China, but what,</v>

158
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:06.400
why would China wants, you know, why,

159
00:09:06.401 --> 00:09:09.540
why would they want it to S to stay like that? I don't really understand that.

160
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.261
<v 0>Well,</v>

161
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:14.250
they probably enjoy the fact that there's a conflict between north and South

162
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.660
Korea, as they're both close to each other.

163
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.890
And South Korea is allies with the United States. You know,

164
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.450
China has their tentacles in so many different things, man. It's why.

165
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.500
<v 2>I've got some more numbers here for you to help with the Afghan thing.</v>

166
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.200
It was from Wiki, but from the Afghan papers,

167
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:33.120
I think is where a lot of this information came from.

168
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.100
<v 0>As of 2017 opium production provides about 400,000</v>

169
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:42.480
jobs in Afghanistan, more than the Afghan national security forces,

170
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:45.390
the opium trade spiked in 2006,

171
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.240
after the Taliban lost control of the local warlords.

172
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.770
<v 2>93%.</v>

173
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.630
<v 0>93% Of the non-pharmaceutical grade</v>

174
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:58.830
opiates of the world market originated in Afghanistan.

175
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.590
<v 2>Or land is used in, uh,</v>

176
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.600
Afghanistan to grow for opium than Coco cultivation in all of Latin America.

177
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.503
Wow.

178
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.930
<v 1>Uh, I did not know this. I I'd never linked Afghanistan with huge amounts of.</v>

179
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.030
<v 0>Yeah, man, it's in a sturgeon Simpson song. I mean,</v>

180
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.830
we are, we're repeating what happened in the Vietnam war, right.

181
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:23.880
And the Vietnam war.

182
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:27.360
That was a big part of what the Vietnam war was all about was the heroin trade.

183
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.840
This is what's going on here, man. Yeah. It's like, it's,

184
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.310
it's gotta be a factor.

185
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.630
This idea that it's not a factor of why we're there and that some

186
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.640
scumbag is not profiting off of this, for sure. It is.

187
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.680
There's no way they're not. I mean,

188
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:48.330
if these are the same people that paid Barry seals to run Coke over from south

189
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:50.730
America and drop it into MENA Arkansas,

190
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.720
you don't think that they would be making money over in Afghanistan. I.

191
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.570
<v 1>Do, man. I, I believe that every, every government is.</v>

192
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.403
<v 0>Corrupt.</v>

193
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.150
They're going to make a documentary about the poppies that they're going to have

194
00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:06.030
to someone now that we're out of Afghanistan,

195
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.280
someone is going to make a documentary about the heroin trade and people are

196
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.660
gonna blow their wig off. They're going to be like what?
