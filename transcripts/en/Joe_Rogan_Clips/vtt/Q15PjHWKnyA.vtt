00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.240
But that's why I was asking about like the full house days. Was it hard? Uh,

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:07.560
that's.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.550
<v 1>Interesting. Cause you were, you had a dirty act,</v>

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.260
but it was blue until after.

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.950
<v 2>And full house in the video show were simultaneous and they were family,</v>

7
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.520
you know, seven o'clock at night on a Sunday I'm hosting videos.

8
00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:25.910
I can't say here's another video. You know, you can't do that. Right.

9
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.180
And I didn't say, that much. In fact, few years ago, dice called me. He goes,

10
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.850
sag it. I've got to tell you something. We got to see each other, but also,

11
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:36.230
you know what, man, you stole my, my after you, uh,

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.370
after full house ended stole mine. I said, what did I steal? Well, you didn't.

13
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.690
<v 1>Use to say as much. I still. Was he joking?</v>

14
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.440
<v 3>Kind of, but not really. But then he wanted, the tour would be,</v>

15
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.510
so it was kind of like CJ dice.

16
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.100
<v 0>Always half pranking. You, I love him. He's always half with you.</v>

17
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:58.130
I started going on the road because of dice. I was just doing the store.

18
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.580
And this is when I was on news radio. And one day he, uh, were in the bathroom.

19
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:06.050
He goes, Hey, you should go on the road. And I'm like, yeah. And he goes, yeah,

20
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.610
you're funny. He goes, you don't want to be beholden these suckers. He goes,

21
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.740
these in the movies and their shows. He goes, he goes, you go on the road,

22
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.480
you make a good living. And I was thinking about it. I was like,

23
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:20.030
why don't I go on the road? So I just started booking gigs.

24
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:22.640
I literally just listened to him because first of all, you know,

25
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:25.430
I'm 27 years old. I can't believe dice is talking to me. Right.

26
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.760
And am I going to talking to dice? Like, and then he tells me to go on the road.

27
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:30.710
I was like, he's right. Why don't I go on the road?

28
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.810
So I started doing gigs here and there, you know? And then, um,

29
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.060
when I really started going on the road,

30
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.220
like what really was when I left the store that 2007

31
00:01:43.221 --> 00:01:45.740
time when I left the store, that's when I started touring.

32
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.310
That was when I really started touring because I was kind of angry too.

33
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.840
I was like, you know, I put all that time into that place. And I was,

34
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.740
I thought what we're doing like that men see it thing. I thought that was,

35
00:01:57.741 --> 00:02:00.410
we're doing the right thing. I thought that was a real problem.

36
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.400
And so when that was the reaction, I was like, okay, I'm going to show you.

37
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.670
I had this, this attitude, like, I'm going to show you.

38
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.390
And then I did my best work and nothing wrong with that. Yeah.

39
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.860
That was my best work was after that because I was, you know, my best,

40
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.520
my first real big special was 2009, just two years after that.

41
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.860
And then, um, you know, and I don't have any hate for that dude.

42
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.810
And I hope he gets better. Like I hope he's doing great. I really do.

43
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.960
<v 2>I think, I think he has learned his lesson from.</v>

44
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.250
<v 0>Hope. He has. I hope people forgive him too. I don't, I think that's a problem.</v>

45
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.533
You know, I think.

46
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.340
<v 2>Many people have had it, you know, some very famous people have had it. No,</v>

47
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:44.330
I didn't. I don't even mean that.

48
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.520
<v 0>Yeah. Many people have had that like Robin. Right. You know,</v>

49
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.620
a lot of people had that and yeah, his.

50
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.720
<v 2>Healing and his loss is so in his talent is so gigantic</v>

51
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.010
that he was just a vacuum cleaner of stuff here. He didn't. Yeah.

52
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.060
And I loved him beyond and he was.

53
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.610
<v 4>He's. He was so yeah,</v>

54
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:07.500
he's a he's he's from every a hundred years of Robin Williams comes.

55
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.020
<v 2>Here. This is what it's, uh, you,</v>

56
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.030
you brought up what was going on,

57
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.880
doing those family shows and then doing stand up, Richard,

58
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.043
Jenny comes into play.

59
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.870
Harris is kind of an interesting thing that you brought them up because he hits

60
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:23.110
me in the solar plexus. I did a, uh,

61
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.020
special while the two shows were in the top 10 full house.

62
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:28.870
And America's funniest home videos, long names to say,

63
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.240
they sound like I'm saying porn. When I say the names of the shows.

64
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.880
<v 1>I was like dirty to me, full house.</v>

65
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.320
<v 2>Oh, that's so filthy. But, um, but I love doing family entertainment.</v>

66
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:42.370
That's my, uh, many different sides.

67
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.770
I love doing stuff. The whole family can watch together.

68
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:48.400
I don't look at that and go, oh. That that's. You know,

69
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.320
that's not the cynical guy that can come out and be blue for the sake of blue.

70
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:58.240
I, I wasn't blue for the sake of blue. I just did what I did. You know,

71
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.990
just like you did what you did, you, your UFC stuff. It's like,

72
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.570
I wasn't doing anything athletic, but two,

73
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.060
I did an HBO special and it, it did well, but in the ratings or whatever,

74
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.040
but it was not good. And I made it so you can't see it. Uh, and Richard,

75
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.270
Jenny loved it. And he would say to me, I loved that special. And I was,

76
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.000
I was saying it, but it was like an hour long. And it took a half an hour.

77
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.870
It was about me being in a dream, trying to missing my gigs.

78
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.360
So I was trying to make a film because I wanted to be a filmmaker.

79
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.780
And then the next half hour was basically half hour standup.

80
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.830
And I just didn't do any of it. Right. You know? And,

81
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.270
but there were a couple of really funny moments in a couple of good bits. Um,

82
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.580
and Richard told me,

83
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:51.700
he thought it was one of the funniest specials and most invented that he'd ever

84
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:55.120
seen. And I was always thrown by that. And, and,

85
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.920
and I started to get more like, well, what do I want to do in standup?

86
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.850
And I was like, I, I just want to make people laugh. I just want to,

87
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.830
and then when the shows ended,

88
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.140
I started directing some stuff and then I did a special called that ain't right.

89
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.040
And that was the HBO special that upset a lot of people.

90
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:18.610
And also put me in rolling stone and Newsweek and all that.

91
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.100
<v 3>That was because it was dirty. It obsessed a lot. Cause I was at, I was at a.</v>

92
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.320
<v 0>Subject matter as well. No. Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.980
<v 2>A little bit. I used as a verb a few times. I don't, I, you know,</v>

94
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.040
you know, if it's an expressive.

95
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.050
<v 0>Right. But it was your whew. I mean,</v>

96
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.100
it's what I felt because that's what you had always been doing,

97
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.730
but they didn't expect that out of you because they wanted full house and

98
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:43.350
America's funniest home who would go.

99
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.870
<v 2>To see that, what am I going to do? Hug people and clean.</v>

100
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.660
<v 3>You know, they wanted that sort of how.</v>

101
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.160
<v 0>We man, Dell thing kind of Holly's blue. He is blue sometimes, but not anymore.</v>

102
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.530
<v 1>But he does stand up. I saw.</v>

103
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.660
<v 0>Him at the laugh factory was actually talking about the dangers of doing a bit</v>

104
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:02.240
that could get him fired from the show. Oh yeah.

105
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.780
She talked about that on stage that if he says anything wrong, I mean,

106
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:09.080
he's on the squeakiest of squeaky family entertainment, you know,

107
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.320
he went from deal or no deal to this other thing that he's doing now,

108
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.770
what does he America's got talent or yeah. Yeah. I mean.

109
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.900
<v 1>He's been talking to him a lot. Um, he's.</v>

110
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.450
<v 2>Great. Yeah. He's a great guy. And he's been,</v>

111
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.500
had a lot of mental health issues that he talked about in the book and his OCD

112
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.480
is just, uh, the outskirts.

113
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.330
<v 0>Of it. How bad is it now with the coronavirus?</v>

114
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.880
He's holding on a germaphobe yeah. Of the whole world. So by the way, somebody,

115
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.390
he wrote that down the whole world is how he Mendell now. Yeah.

116
00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:40.570
I said something like, he's a prophet. I forget.

117
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.550
<v 5>Who it was. I forgot who wrote.</v>

118
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.480
<v 0>Maybe it was Gaffigan. Someone, someone said that like that someone had, I love.</v>

119
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.040
<v 2>I love Jim. It was great. But anyway, uh, so, you know,</v>

120
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.330
I don't know why people think that you're like a character you play in

121
00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:59.170
something. Well that's you played that character for a long time, for so.

122
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.430
<v 0>Long. And this was pre social media. This was pre podcast.</v>

123
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.550
They just associated look bill Cosby. Okay.

124
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.600
For the longest time people thought bill Cosby, but I got it. Hi, bill.

125
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.450
<v 2>Always was offended that I talked blue on stage.</v>

126
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.990
Cause he said you don't need it. And when I would see him,

127
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.170
I would almost hear lucky saying in-between.

128
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.820
<v 0>What did bill Cosby think about?</v>

129
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.670
Kennison I want to know that I would have loved to seen that. I'm sure.

130
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.090
<v 2>He does. He just disapproved anything, uh, blue,</v>

131
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.810
but the truth is liquid. He acted out in his real life.

132
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.550
I would just do it.

133
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.250
<v 3>That is why that's what boys club.</v>

134
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.260
<v 2>That he was in my boys club.</v>

135
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.180
Or I hate to say that because it's so massage monistic but it was a

136
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:46.930
guy that looks like, I know what I look like. I look like your dentist,

137
00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:50.500
your accountant, or somebody, maybe your gynecologist, if it's a good week,

138
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.210
but not yours, but, but, um, I'll continue. I swear.

139
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.140
I just had a moment of doing like 10 of those that go nowhere. But,

140
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.730
but the truth of it is for me to say that is the joke for me.

141
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.370
And that gets nowhere also.

142
00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:11.290
So I have to have content and the more specials I did and the more I've done

143
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.230
standup, like I was about to shoot a new one this year.

144
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.990
I've got like an hour and a half of stuff. Of course.

145
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.120
So everybody's going to have 12 minutes of COVID,

146
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.150
but I dunno what it's going to be. But it was really,

147
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.040
I was about to talk about racial injustice, ready to go.

148
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:32.170
Cause I've got all this stuff when I was a kid and segregation and I was living

149
00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:35.470
it and didn't understand it when I was six, seven years old in Virginia.

150
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:38.170
So it was like, I started to have, I have more,

151
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.390
much more in as much more intent in what I want to do right now. Um,

152
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.540
and make people laugh. I got to throw a Dick joke and just to make myself.
