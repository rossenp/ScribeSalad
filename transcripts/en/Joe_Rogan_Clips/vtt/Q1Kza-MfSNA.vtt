1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>I'm fascinated by you and I'm fascinated by anybody who does the kind of</v>

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.200
that you do. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean,

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.400
please explain to people all the different ultra marathons you've

4
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:13.560
done and like what you've accomplished.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.160
<v 1>Yeah. You know, it's, it's interesting because like,</v>

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750
I still kind of see myself as a pretty average runner because as like, um,

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.031
I mean,

8
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:25.350
I competed in high school and made state cross country and state track and that

9
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:27.390
kind of thing, um, for a small school.

10
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:30.990
And then I went to a small divisioni school and was, you know, pretty much,

11
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.950
you know, average amongst a real good program at the D three level. And, uh,

12
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.150
I always just did kind like running longer though. So, um,

13
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.300
like once I got done with the college, I, I kind of decided, well, let's,

14
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.300
let's see, what's longer. I think some of those traditional,

15
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:49.220
like collegiate races of like 5k to 10 kilometers and, uh, you know,

16
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:52.860
I started kind of just dabbling that stuff. And then in, in 2010,

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.140
I think I actually did my first ultra marathon, you know,

18
00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:58.500
partly because I was just like looking around in there,

19
00:00:58.501 --> 00:00:59.740
turned out to be one in the state.

20
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.890
I was li I was living in Wisconsin at the time. And, uh, there was one that, uh,

21
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.450
was kind of in my neck of the woods.

22
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.970
And I actually had just decided to go back to grad school and that one had a,

23
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.570
a thousand dollars prize purse on it. And I was like, you know, what, if I,

24
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.770
if I can win that a thousand bucks go a long way during grad school &lt;laugh&gt;.

25
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.450
So I did that one and I ended up winning it and it, uh, it definitely hooked me.

26
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.560
It was like the type of thing where I was like, I wanna of these. And, um,

27
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.840
by 2011,

28
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.000
I kind of jumped all in at the end of the year and ended three 50 milesers and I

29
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.280
think it was about a, a nine week timeframe. And, uh, &lt;laugh&gt;, that's so crazy.

30
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.760
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah. And I mean, it gets crazier there's,

31
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:38.080
there's some freaks out there. Um,

32
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:41.440
there's guys who'll do like a couple and a weekend and stuff like that.

33
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.390
So &lt;laugh&gt;, I mean, it's, it never ends. Um, but yeah, you know,

34
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:48.630
it was one of those things where after that I was totally hooked. So, uh,

35
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:52.110
what is it that got you hooked? Um, you know, it,

36
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.750
it had to be partly just a little bit of success, you know,

37
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.510
I wasn't necessarily used to winning, so like, I mean,

38
00:01:58.511 --> 00:02:01.630
I've had good races and good times relative to what you probably see,

39
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.900
like in an average person. And, but, you know,

40
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:05.540
when I went to like a competitive 5k,

41
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:08.540
competitive marathon or something like that, um, you know,

42
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:12.100
I wasn't gonna win unless it was kind of a local race. So kind of finding,

43
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.620
you know, it's like anything,

44
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.100
I guess you kind of gravitate to what you feel you're good at,

45
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.260
and then that kind of peaks your interest. Um, so that was part of it.

46
00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:24.130
The other part was just, uh, I really enjoyed doing the long run.

47
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.170
Like when you break up kind of like a training week,

48
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:29.330
you have like a variety of different things. You've got like kind of, you know,

49
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:32.490
base level runs. You've got specific workouts for the distance.

50
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.930
And then most training programs, um, are gonna have a long run once a week.

51
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.450
And that was the one that was always my favorite.

52
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.730
So wrapping my head around doing a bunch of those a week instead of just one

53
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.650
was, was really kind of appealing to me.

54
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.040
And when you're putting that much time into whatever you're training for it's,

55
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.320
I think important to enjoy it.

56
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:52.320
So being able to kind of enjoy the training process a lot was really appealing

57
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:56.520
to me. Um, and, uh, and then it's just the variables,

58
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.360
like when you're out there for that long,

59
00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:00.920
there's so many variables to consider and it's like,

60
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.760
it's a blast for me to kind of like work through those plan for those,

61
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.160
and then adjust to them on the fly when you're out there and, you know,

62
00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:10.960
things inevitably go wrong or things pop up that you didn't expect. So it's,

63
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.400
it's, uh, it's just, uh, it's, it's kind of hard to explain, but it's,

64
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.121
it's weird.

65
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:18.830
One of the things and ultra marathon running that people will always say is

66
00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:21.590
like, they'll have a race. And even if they have a bad race, say like,

67
00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:24.190
I'm never doing one of these again. And then the next day they're on, uh,

68
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.190
on the internet looking for another race. So it's,

69
00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:29.150
there's this weird thing about it that you don't really know until you do it,

70
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.390
but it, it sucks you in &lt;laugh&gt;.

71
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.030
<v 0>That's the case with a lot of people when they talk about things that are like</v>

72
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.070
that they have to suffer through. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

73
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.660
I've heard that when guys talk about like those extreme hikes, you know,

74
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:41.780
when they, you know, like they do that, you know,

75
00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:44.220
that one that goes from Georgia all the way to Maine,

76
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.900
do you know that insane hike? What is that call the Appalation app trail trail.

77
00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:51.060
Yep. Yeah. That they say, I'll never do that again. And then they're like, okay,

78
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:53.940
what other, what other hikes can I go? It's just, once the pain,

79
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.140
the physical pain dies down.

80
00:03:56.141 --> 00:04:00.170
There's something about that challenge that stimulates in people like you and

81
00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:04.450
people that are into these really long distance things.

82
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.010
Like there's something about distance, there's something about like,

83
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.010
like you were saying, like,

84
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.290
you weren't the best runner in high school or college. Right.

85
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.010
But there's something about the mind of an ultra marathon or it's a different

86
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.560
mind, the per the type of person that can run a hundred miles, 200 miles,

87
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.360
238 miles, those type of people, they're different people. And there's like,

88
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:26.280
there's a strength,

89
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.280
a mental strength and the ability to just keep going on and on and on that I'm

90
00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:32.560
absolutely fascinated with.

91
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.320
<v 1>Yeah. You know, and it is interesting too, cuz it's, uh,</v>

92
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.160
the sport's grown a bit, quite a bit in the last decade or so,

93
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.200
but it's still very much kind of a niche.

94
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.150
And then when you kind of hang out in that group,

95
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:43.990
you start to kind of normalize it a little bit. I think.

96
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.870
So then you start thinking like, oh, a hundred miles. It's just what we do.

97
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.230
And then you, you know,

98
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:52.830
you actually try to like separate yourself from the fact that you've done a few

99
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:55.670
of those or separate yourself from the fact that you've been hanging out with

100
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:57.150
other people of doing it and you realize, oh,

101
00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:00.990
this is actually kind of a weird thing to kind of do as &lt;laugh&gt; as a human.

102
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.420
I mean, nowadays &lt;laugh&gt;, it's.

103
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.220
<v 0>Very weird. How many of these things have you won?</v>

104
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.140
<v 1>Uh, I don't know how many I've won it.</v>

105
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.500
It's I think I've done just shy of 50 total now. Um, you know,

106
00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:15.900
everything from 50 kilometers to the furthest I've done is 200 kilometers,

107
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:19.060
which is about 125 miles. Um, yeah.

108
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.850
I I'd have to look to see how many I've won it. It's, it's, it's really goofy.

109
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.170
Cuz when you start getting into the longer stuff,

110
00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:28.890
like a hundred miles and beyond you start, at least in my training program,

111
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.690
you start to kind of pick smaller races to kind of use as training runs. Um,

112
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.770
and some of it I think is just because for me,

113
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:39.410
if I'm gonna go out and do like a 30 mile or a 40 mile training run or something

114
00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:40.120
like that,

115
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.600
it's kind of tedious to do that by yourself and then plan all the logistics of

116
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:47.920
it. So if there's a race nearby and that's not too hard to get to,

117
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:51.320
it's easier just to sign up for that, go and do that. So some of those,

118
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.000
you know, I'll, I'll win if they're, if they're small enough,

119
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:57.760
even though I'm not necessarily trying to go for, you know, go all out,

120
00:05:57.761 --> 00:06:01.480
so to speak, cuz I'm hoping to recover kind of and, and get back into training.

121
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.560
Um, so.

122
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.200
<v 0>You'll pace yourself at, at one of these local races maybe.</v>

123
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.360
<v 1>Yeah. You know, the way I describe it is, um, and this is,</v>

124
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.880
this is a real hard thing for a lot of people to do. I think it's, uh,

125
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.920
like you go into a race saying this is gonna be a moderately difficult,

126
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:17.150
long run. Um,

127
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:19.510
so maybe a little faster than what I would do if I was just gonna do it by

128
00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:21.990
myself, like unsupported, that sort of thing.

129
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.910
And then I always tell myself 80% is the hardest you can go if you want to be

130
00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:30.150
able to come back and start training on time to meet the actual goal or the,

131
00:06:30.151 --> 00:06:34.510
a race. Um, so when I do those, it's like, it's one of those things where like,

132
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.460
you know, who knows someone might show up that's it's like as fast as you,

133
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.180
or maybe a little slower than you normal.

134
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.540
And if they're deciding to just hammer it that day,

135
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:45.700
they might beat you and you gotta be okay with that. Um, cause.

136
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.500
<v 0>The competitive part of you flare up though.</v>

137
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.940
<v 1>For sure. Well, yeah, it does. And that's the hardest part and that's,</v>

138
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:53.540
I think the main reason why some people won't do that approach mm-hmm

139
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.900
&lt;affirmative&gt; because there's certainly people who just,

140
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:58.450
they stay away from races unless it's their a race. And they just say I'm,

141
00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.650
if I'm gonna do a long run, I'll do it on my own. And, and, and you know,

142
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:03.090
not do that or, you know,

143
00:07:03.091 --> 00:07:07.770
there's certainly I'm sure folks who do it and then they get caught up and then

144
00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:11.250
end up leaving their, a race out on, on the B race, I guess, so to speak. So,

145
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.090
um, yeah, it, it's interesting. It's, A's kind of a,

146
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.040
a sport that I think is still a lot to learn,

147
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.680
which I think is actually the case for a lot of things that, you know, even,

148
00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:24.640
even things that are well established, you know,

149
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:28.120
there's always something to learn or new things to pick up on. Well.

150
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.400
<v 0>It's one of those things, right? Where once,</v>

151
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.440
once someone runs a hundred miles and then a bunch of other people start doing

152
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.600
it, like you said, it, it almost becomes normalized.

153
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.480
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then people start to try to push that boundary.

154
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.390
Now I' hearing talk about, uh, the woman Candace, who runs the Moab two 40.

155
00:07:42.391 --> 00:07:43.191
Yeah. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah.

156
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:46.910
They're talking about doing a 500 &lt;laugh&gt; I heard that I was like,

157
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:49.030
you're you're outta your mind. People are gonna die,

158
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.990
but maybe that'll be normal in five years and we'll get used to like four or

159
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:53.830
five day races.

160
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.830
<v 1>Yeah. So, so it's really fascinating.</v>

161
00:07:55.831 --> 00:07:58.430
It took me a couple years to do this before I got into the sport.

162
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:00.780
But once I was, was in it for a couple of years, I kind of did a little,

163
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.780
a little, a little research to see like what the deal was with them,

164
00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:05.340
some of this stuff. And the,

165
00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:10.020
the funny thing is like that type of a distance isn't even unheard of. Uh,

166
00:08:10.021 --> 00:08:12.620
they actually they're. I forget what the book is called,

167
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.140
but they actually had in Madison square garden,

168
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:18.660
they used to host a six day event where guys in gals, I,

169
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.370
I'm not sure if the gals were doing it back then, but, um,

170
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.730
guys for sure were going there and seeing how far they could run in six days.

171
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.730
And uh, yeah, I know crazy. And uh, I think if I remember right,

172
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:33.050
they would actually, people were betting on 'em that way.

173
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:36.210
And so they'd fill it up. Like people would come and watch this like spectacle.

174
00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:36.950
Wow. When, what year was this?

175
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.250
It was in the late 18 hundreds I think is when they started it.

176
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.183
I'm not sure when.

177
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.640
<v 0>Here it is six day cycling. Yes.</v>

178
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.720
The six day grind Madison squarebook garden probably ran too. Oh, wow.

179
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.720
<v 1>Look at this man. So some crazy person decided to leave the bike at home.</v>

180
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.560
I guess &lt;laugh&gt; this.

181
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.800
<v 0>Is super old. We're looking at this on YouTube folks.</v>

182
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.120
It says six day cycling the six day grind at Madison square garden.

183
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.400
And so it's just a track and these people are, this is old, tiny.

184
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.560
These, this looks like the thirties, right? Yeah.

185
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.200
And that guy just went down and so they're,

186
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:14.120
they're just riding their bike for six days. Oh. When they wipe out,

187
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.790
oh my God. &lt;laugh&gt; they probably had terrible breaks back then, right? Yeah.

188
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.750
That was their feet. &lt;laugh&gt; probably right. Or the railing.

189
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:23.810
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

190
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.190
<v 0>So this is so endurance sports. Like this are nothing new.</v>

191
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.030
<v 1>Yeah. It's actually fascinating when you like, kinda look into it.</v>

192
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:31.910
Cuz nowadays in the United States,

193
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.910
the trail running scene is definitely way bigger than like the road running or

194
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.020
certainly the track, the track scene. But that wasn't always the case.

195
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.020
If you look back into like the seventies and eighties,

196
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:43.940
there was a pretty big surge in ultra marathon running, uh, for flat fast stuff.

197
00:09:43.941 --> 00:09:46.220
That's where we see a lot of the, the records coming from.

198
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.200
<v 0>Um,</v>

199
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.060
so that's like a track and you run as far and long as you can on a track like

200
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.580
track.

201
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.100
<v 1>Or a road or really flat road.</v>

202
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.850
<v 0>I had Goggins on David GOs. Oh yeah. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; was talking about, uh,</v>

203
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.010
the first time he did one was on a track. Okay. Just ran in circles on a track,

204
00:10:01.011 --> 00:10:05.370
which is almost gotta be more taxing for your mind cuz you're just seeing the

205
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.210
same over and over and over again.

206
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.370
<v 1>Yeah. It's, it's really fascinating to me cause I've done, I've done both.</v>

207
00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:13.210
I've done a hundred milesers on the trail and I've done a hundred miles on a 400

208
00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:17.240
meter track. And uh, the fascinating thing is it is like what you said,

209
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:21.400
it's almost a different event where mentally you're doing everything you can on

210
00:10:21.401 --> 00:10:25.280
that track to kind of separate yourself from the actual environment and vision

211
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.920
yourself being somewhere else. You know,

212
00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:30.680
looking forward to little things to kind of not necessarily be thinking too far

213
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.920
in advance cause that can get overwhelming. Whereas when I'm out on the trails,

214
00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:36.080
it's like you're using a pretty pristine,

215
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:40.150
beautiful area and you can kind of just take it as it comes and say, oh cool.

216
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.003
Now I get to see that.

217
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.830
Or this is a neat area or I like this section and you look,

218
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:47.430
you look forward to that kind of diversity, whereas on the track, it's,

219
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.590
you know, you see it once and you've seen it every time. Um, and then it,

220
00:10:51.591 --> 00:10:54.990
you know, it just kind of beats you up mentally from that side of things. Um,

221
00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.790
but then, you know, there's other things about that too,

222
00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:00.580
that that help out like logistically when you're on a track for 400 meters,

223
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.620
you bring out one person,

224
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.980
you put everything you may possibly want on a little table.

225
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.300
And if I want something I say, Hey, can I get that? And 400 meters later,

226
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.820
I have it. And even, even if we mess it up, I'll get it 400 meters after that.

227
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.020
So &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Where, whereas, you know, the trails, it depends,

228
00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:17.260
they've gotten a lot better with aid stations as the sports's grown. Um,

229
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:18.930
but like, you know,

230
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.210
you mess up your aid station or if you get caught up in the moment and just blow

231
00:11:22.211 --> 00:11:23.490
through it and don't take care of yourself,

232
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:26.130
you might have to suffer for an hour plus before you get help again.

233
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.410
So that's where it kind of gets a little different,

234
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.130
I think logistically when you're on the trails versus versus on the road.

235
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.530
And um, but, but yeah, it's, it's kind of a, a different thing. It,

236
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.010
the track is interesting too, in the,

237
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.200
a sense that you're essentially making that same exact Mo exact motion the whole

238
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.480
way. So like there's certain areas of your body that fatigue, um,

239
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.920
and they don't get a breakcause of the turn, the turn and just running flat,

240
00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:51.800
right? Like running flat.

241
00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:55.600
You're gonna kind of localize some of the way you stimulate your muscles or your

242
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:59.080
gate is gonna be pretty similar throughout. Whereas when you're on the trails,

243
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:02.440
like you might be going on a slight incline, a steep incline, a slight decline,

244
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.160
a little bit of flat, some rolling, all kinds of things in between,

245
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.240
and then trails can be kind of undulating.

246
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.680
So you're just kind of moving all that forces around your legs a little more

247
00:12:10.681 --> 00:12:14.630
than you would be when you're running on a flat at surface. So, you know,

248
00:12:14.631 --> 00:12:17.430
it's one of the things that I always tell, like my coaching clients and,

249
00:12:17.431 --> 00:12:19.270
and myself, when I'm planning for something is like,

250
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.790
if you really want to meet your full potential, like specificity as king,

251
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.830
you need to be on that environment in the environment you're gonna race on and

252
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:30.270
really get your body used to kind of that type of Mo motion. And, um,

253
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.340
it makes it a little more interesting when you're doing a track race cause means

254
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.100
some kind of long runs on a track. So, um,

255
00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:39.140
you're kind of balancing doing just enough to get ready for it and not doing too

256
00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:41.500
much so that when you get to the race, you're like, screw this.

257
00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:45.540
I've done too much of this already. I don't wanna see another loop. Um, yeah,

258
00:12:45.541 --> 00:12:47.220
it's kind of a, an interesting concept.
