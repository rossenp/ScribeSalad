00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 2>First of all, I think it's amazing that no one's talked you into do an MMA.</v>

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.440
It's incredible. I've been close.

4
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.160
<v 1>How close, but mostly the lady outside, my wife,</v>

5
00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:13.760
Lauren really is the one that's talked me out of it. Really? Yeah, bro.

6
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.320
Like when I graduated from college in 2011,

7
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.670
university of Nebraska wrestling was still on the brink of if it was

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.590
in its infancy of marketing and branding and really making it a professional

9
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:26.010
career.

10
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.830
So MMA was the new kid on the block and it was growing and expanding.

11
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.390
And we had a lot of our guys transitioning in HEA judo,

12
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.750
Ben ASIN and Daniel Cormier. And so I really thought about it. I was like, okay,

13
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.980
I'm gonna wrestle the Olympics in London, 2012, win the gold.

14
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.140
And then I'm gonna make the transition to MMA. I'll be 25 years old.

15
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.980
I'll have plenty of time. And then I met Lauren and she's like, listen,

16
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:51.780
you're doing well in the sport. Stay here. You're comfortable.

17
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.540
It's just a different, it's a different sport MMA in comparison to wrestling,

18
00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:57.374
but it's a good thing.

19
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.720
<v 0>It,</v>

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.570
it is a different sport and it'll also has a lot head trauma and

21
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:03.850
there's a lot of things to consider.

22
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.610
<v 1>100%. That's what I think about all the time. I, well, I &lt;laugh&gt; listen.</v>

23
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.290
I think about going to MMA until I see a guy like platinum,

24
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.210
Mike Perry get his whole thing,

25
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.370
split nose crooked. I'm like, eh, I'm good. It's like in wrestling, you lose,

26
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:23.120
you get taken down, pushed out, you know, you get pin and fighting,

27
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.640
you lose, you get something broken, choked out, tap, you know, it's unconscious.

28
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.360
It's a very, very different sport wrestling. It's much E it's a,

29
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.800
you score as many points as possible doing the least damage as possible.

30
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.760
And MMA, I feel like it's, it's different.

31
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.830
<v 0>It's a shame that there's not more attention per put</v>

32
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.630
on the professional. Like, like at one point in time,

33
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:49.070
professional wrestling was actual wrestling. Yeah. Yeah.

34
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.310
It wasn't like WW entertainment.

35
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.350
It was professional wrestling and it was done for PO why can't they do that?

36
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.110
I know they tried to do that a few years back. There was a,

37
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.700
an organization I think was it Kevin Jackson that was doing it? Yeah. Yeah.

38
00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:07.660
He was doing something where he was doing a professional wrestling organization,

39
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.540
but it just didn't catch on for some reason, but yet golf is on TV. For sure.

40
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.220
So baseball and all these things.

41
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.740
<v 1>That are bags, bro. Corn hole.</v>

42
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.780
I was watching the corn hole championships on ESPN the other day. I'm like, bro,

43
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:25.570
this is wild. Like corn hole is on ESPN more often than.

44
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.070
<v 0>Wrestling,</v>

45
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.810
but isn't that just now because there's no crowds in COVID and there's all the

46
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:32.570
weirdness and there's a lot of that's on,

47
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.210
like if you follow sports center on Instagram,

48
00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:39.050
like half the they do is like people in their backyard, like doing crazy dunks.

49
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.490
<v 1>And stuff. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I think the,</v>

50
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.010
the invention of the internet has definitely changed the game.

51
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.113
Him for our sport.

52
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.000
We are in an epic time where anyone can be famous.

53
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.440
All you need is an iPhone. Yeah. Cell phone period.

54
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.440
Like if you can film footage and upload it. And it's funny,

55
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.840
it's inventive. It's disruptive.

56
00:02:58.841 --> 00:03:01.720
Like you have an audience and people are gonna follow it.

57
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:05.200
So people that are going viral now becoming superstars aren't even the most

58
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.680
particularly talented people in society.

59
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:11.080
They just have a niche and they know how to stay consistent with it.

60
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.640
<v 0>Well, sometimes it doesn't even make sense. Like something just catches, like,</v>

61
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.910
remember the dude that was on the skateboard, uh, doing Fleetwood, cranberry.

62
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.743
<v 1>Juice. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

63
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.750
<v 0>Like, just for whatever reason, everybody's like, that guy looks like he's.</v>

64
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.870
<v 1>Having fun. Get this man, a truck, get him more cranberry.</v>

65
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.550
<v 0>Juice. And now he's on. I look, he's always on podcast. He's all over the place.</v>

66
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.110
He's a man. He bought a house. He bought a car. I mean, it's really incredible.

67
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:32.430
That's.

68
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.231
<v 1>The beauty of it. Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:35.270
That's the beauty of it is it gives people an opportunity.

70
00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:36.750
There it is right there. Yeah. So it was,

71
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.580
it was professional wrestling league that a established and you know,

72
00:03:40.581 --> 00:03:44.620
when people reference what we do, I call it Olympic wrestling. Honestly,

73
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:49.460
I don't even call it professional wrestling cuz that is kind of an O to the WWE

74
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.500
and old time WWF. So it's a, it's a unique thing that we had at this time.

75
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.980
And this is Tommy Rolands day. Cormier both extremely competitive, both uh,

76
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.530
great wrestlers, Oklahoma state, Ohio state.

77
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.970
This probably was around oh 4 0 5 ish. Um,

78
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.970
so I was still in high school, real pro wrestling. That's right.

79
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:13.130
So they had different cities across the country that had their own teams.

80
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.530
It was almost like XFL ES it kind of had that vibe. And you had, so it's.

81
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.450
<v 0>Ruan Gardner. Yeah. Ruan Gardner.</v>

82
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.240
<v 1>And the Tim Johnson in the middle. He works for the big 10 network.</v>

83
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.080
And also for ESPN, he does commentary for the, uh,

84
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.760
NCAA championships yearly.

85
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.640
And then the last guy's Nick car who was a NCA champ world.

86
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.600
<v 0>Medalist and Ruan is another guy that made the transition.</v>

87
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:39.160
He made the transition to MMA. Did he? Yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah. Yeah.

88
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:42.430
He fought a bunch of times over in Japan and actually that's crazy.

89
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.670
I think what stopped him was he lost a toe in a frostbite that's right.

90
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.350
Accidents.

91
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.910
<v 1>He's a former Cornhusker is he?</v>

92
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.510
And we went to the same university and I got a chance to kind of spend some time

93
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:55.790
with &lt;inaudible&gt;, but he was out when I was kind of transitioning in. Oh.

94
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.950
And so he's an interesting cat and he is one of those guys that's like shrouded

95
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:02.260
in this mystery, but they so many like

96
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.380
epic stories about who he was, what he's done, how much he's eaten. He's.

97
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.940
<v 0>Gorilla dude, massive man.</v>

98
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.180
<v 1>The size of that guy. Massive man. Um, and then obviously him beating Carella,</v>

99
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:19.700
which is pretty much considered the most legendary victory and wrestling history.

100
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.050
<v 0>Does that's a weird right.</v>

101
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:25.850
Because it's like corre and all he did was get Corll and to break his grip.

102
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.930
Yeah. And it was a new rule, right? Yep.

103
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.090
<v 1>The rules are evolving all the time and wrestling. So it's uh,</v>

104
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.410
one of those rule changes that year in particular, which wasn't,

105
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.930
it didn't translate well to the average fan. Mm.

106
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.720
So like the toughest thing about wrestling is that the rules change so often

107
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.280
that a non-traditional wrestling fan can't really keep up.

108
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.680
You watch a football game, you know, listen, you put the ball into the end zone.

109
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.000
It's six points, extra point, a point field goal, three points, right? Safety,

110
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.560
two, you watch basketball. You know, if you're behind this arc,

111
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:59.440
it's three points. If you're within it, it's two points and wrestling.

112
00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:03.680
There's so many different subjective rule sets that you're like, okay, well,

113
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:06.280
if you unlock your hands here or if this guy gets pushed outta bound,

114
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.080
it's a point. But if you shove him outta bound, it's no points.

115
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.520
If he's grounded, it's no points. But if his knees off the mat,

116
00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:14.400
then it's a point. So there's so many different,

117
00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:17.910
like little nuances in the sport that make it difficult to follow.

118
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.590
And even if you're within it,

119
00:06:19.591 --> 00:06:23.350
like sometimes you have to address what the rule set is before you even compete

120
00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:26.270
in a tournament. There are times when we're meeting with, uh,

121
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:27.950
administration and referees,

122
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:30.030
before we compete at the Olympics world championships,

123
00:06:30.031 --> 00:06:34.630
just so we can stay current on the rules set for that year because it's,

124
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.870
it's just that much, always evolving, always evolving.

125
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.340
<v 0>That, is that something that plays in your head while you're actually competing?</v>

126
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.660
Do you, do you have to think like, oh wait a minute. What is,

127
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.820
what's the rule for this.

128
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.420
<v 1>Place? You know, that's a good question. I think in the heat of the moment,</v>

129
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:49.820
sometimes I, I imagine you've seen it a lot in MMA, whether it's a guy,

130
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.780
you know, hitting someone in the back of the head or mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

131
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.500
you know, kicking them when they're down on a knee,

132
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:58.890
like all these little things that when you're in the battle and you're fired up

133
00:06:58.891 --> 00:07:00.330
and you're trying to put this man out,

134
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.490
like you don't even think about the rule set. You just, you know,

135
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.170
it has to be programmed. I think experience just, uh,

136
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.410
multiple times within this position.

137
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.250
There's a certain level of savviness and mental toughness that you have to have

138
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:14.490
to get there. Catch.
