00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.400
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.080
Do you have any high hopes for things like CRISPR things where

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.040
there's going to be genetic alterations and they are starting to do

4
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.360
some experience. You have a big smile on your face right now.

5
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.200
So I'll let you talk, go ahead. Tell me what's up. Uh, well.

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.950
<v 1>Uh, so I'm a geneticist and I'm just down the hall from George Church.</v>

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.790
Who's in my department at Harvard, and I'm a big believer in CRISPR,

8
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.590
uh, in the sense that it will revolutionize medicine. Now, right now.

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.430
<v 0>Explain it to people who don't know what it means.</v>

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.910
<v 1>So CRISPR is, uh, uh, an acronym for basically a,</v>

11
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.660
a system that is from bacteria that they use to, uh,

12
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.660
kill and destroy the DNA of invading organisms, like a virus.

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.060
But we can now use that system to cut and change our own genomes.

14
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.740
It's basically a,

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.780
a DNA cutting enzyme that doesn't cut randomly.

16
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.730
You can give it a barcode, uh, in the form of what's called the, an,

17
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:06.450
a molecule that tells where that enzyme will cut in the genome. Let's say you,

18
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.970
Joe Rogan have, uh, a terrible gene that's causing heart disease.

19
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.970
We take this CRISPR system. We say,

20
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.250
here's where you need to go to cut. We can tell the enzyme to go and cut it,

21
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.560
put it into your cells. It'll go cut it and destroy the enzyme and delete it.

22
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.960
And you can also use it to cut the genome and insert new pieces.

23
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.240
So you can both subtract and add DNA at will now, not just randomly,

24
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:34.160
but what's important is you can tell it where to go.

25
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.520
And that's the big breakthrough.

26
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.480
<v 0>And they're doing some experiments on human beings.</v>

27
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:43.470
And I know there was something that they were doing.

28
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.670
I believe somewhere in Asia. If I remember correctly,

29
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.870
I believe it was China where they had done some

30
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.950
manipulation to people to help prevent aids and in the

31
00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:58.110
process of doing so,

32
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.350
they may have boosted intelligence or the potential for intelligence,

33
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.300
which was so convoluted that my puny little brain cannot understand the study.

34
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.660
I was, I was, I had to go over the same paragraph like four or five times,

35
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.860
just try to figure out what the they were saying. Am I making any sense?

36
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.940
<v 1>Uh, yeah, you are, you are. And that was a study that, that, uh,</v>

37
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.540
I don't believe it's been published, but it's been reported, right. That, uh,

38
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.010
he is his name. His last name is he, uh, he took, um,

39
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.770
embryos and engineered them to delete CCR five gene,

40
00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:34.290
which is required for HIV to infect cells. Now that was, we can, we,

41
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.730
most of us scientists think that that was, uh, reckless for the fact that, um,

42
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.890
first of all, HIV,

43
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.490
isn't a huge risk in China to one in a thousand chance of getting HIV.

44
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:45.320
There are plenty other thing, other things they,

45
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.480
that you could do that could be more helpful. Let's say, why not mutate? Uh,

46
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:51.680
what's called PSK nine to prevent heart disease,

47
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.320
which would probably have 50% to kill the boys. A boy. Um,

48
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.120
so anyway, it wasn't the most, um, risk, uh,

49
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.320
benefit ratio modification. That that's one thing, but the other is,

50
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:08.560
we don't know what happens when you cut genes in embryos.

51
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.400
Does it have changes to the DNA clock? Did it accelerate their aging?

52
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.560
Did it mess with other genes? Did it cut in other places and scrap those genes?

53
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.560
We don't know that yet.

54
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.430
And so that's why the scientific community had a negative reaction to it.

55
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.950
But what's interesting is that the scientific community and the press has pretty

56
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:29.830
much gone quiet on this. Imagine if this happened during the Bush era, we'd,

57
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.870
we'd have protesters all over the place,

58
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:33.830
it'd be outlawed and that hasn't happened.

59
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.390
And I think it's because we live in a world with a 24 hour news.

60
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.140
<v 0>Cycle, but isn't that also because it's being, if it was during the Bush world,</v>

61
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.260
I mean, where the protest would really take place, if it was done here,

62
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.540
the thing about things that are done in China or overseas, like, huh, it's like,

63
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.660
it's so far away like, well, let's keep an eye on 'em, you.

64
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.660
<v 1>Know, like that's true. There is the fear that,</v>

65
00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:58.140
that some countries gonna engineer and, and army of humans. I mean,

66
00:03:58.141 --> 00:04:01.610
we have the technology to do that. Yeah. Uh, we,

67
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.770
we believe we understand how to slow aging. Uh,

68
00:04:03.771 --> 00:04:07.050
there are genes that predispose you to, to long life.

69
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.330
We could make offspring a family that would potentially live a lot longer,

70
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.730
but.

71
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.290
<v 0>Is this something that can only be manipulated in embryos or in</v>

72
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.910
fetuses?

73
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.200
<v 1>No. Now we can do it in adults. Uh, actually, there's, there's a,</v>

74
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:25.520
there are drugs that are in development to actually correct genetic diseases,

75
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.120
such as, uh, vision loss. Really?

76
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.720
<v 0>Yeah. Dude, my eyes are gone. I could barely read like print on a laptop.</v>

77
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.680
I, I, I need glasses to read my laptop. All.

78
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.190
<v 1>Right. So, so we just put up a study online, uh, on a site. I archive.</v>

79
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:43.990
Anyone can go there and see it. Just Google my name and bio archive.

80
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.310
B I O R X I V. Uh, reason.

81
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.590
That's interesting is that what we are showing is in mice,

82
00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:56.150
at least we can reverse the age of the retina and restore the vision of old

83
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.173
mice.

84
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.373
<v 0>What do I have to do?</v>

85
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.700
<v 1>Uh, well, I think you have to blow me a few more.</v>

86
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.700
<v 0>Times. Hey, come on, man. Well, you're gonna lose your job.</v>

87
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.300
Let you gotta let me crack those kind of jokes. Sorry.

88
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.900
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; Harvard. I was joking.</v>

89
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.180
<v 0>I know I started it folks. Yeah. It's not his fault. What, so what,</v>

90
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:18.580
what would someone, I mean, is this gonna be available to the general public,

91
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.900
any time in our lifetime?

92
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.930
<v 1>Uh, I I'm trying my best. Uh,</v>

93
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.650
we are hoping to do clinical trials starting in two years from.

94
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.370
<v 0>Now. Really. And what would you do in those clinical trials?</v>

95
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.410
<v 1>Uh, so we'd reprogram the eye to be young again.</v>

96
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.530
So we now know that there's a set of genes called reprogramming factors.

97
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.370
Also known as yamanarka factors that are from named after this Japanese

98
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.890
fellow who won the Nobel prize in 2012, these factors,

99
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.480
they used all over the world, even, probably in,

100
00:05:44.481 --> 00:05:47.600
in high schools to reprogram skin cells, other cells,

101
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.800
to be what we call Flury pottent stem cells.

102
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.680
These are cells that can be used to make new organs or new blood cells. Mm.

103
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.680
But what people hadn't tried until recently was can you do this in a living

104
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.400
animal? Or are you just gonna mess it up? Uh, and what we found out is that,

105
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.200
uh, if you do it the wrong way, you mess up the animal and it'll die.

106
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.280
But what we've shown for the first time in this paper is you can do it in a safe

107
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.880
way. And not only that reverse the clock,

108
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.670
make the cells young and restore how they work and get back vision.

109
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.790
<v 0>And what's the methodology. Right? Good.</v>

110
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.990
<v 1>Question. So the, the, the current method is using a virus that's on the market.</v>

111
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.110
Uh, these are called AAVs at dental associated viruses. You put them in the eye,

112
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.990
they're already patients getting this in on the market. Really? Yeah.

113
00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:37.740
Spark therapeutics is an example of a company that is Q you areing genetic

114
00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:40.420
diseases in the eye with viruses or in a new world.

115
00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:41.940
Most people don't know about it. Wow.

116
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.380
<v 0>So what is the company again?</v>

117
00:06:43.381 --> 00:06:46.980
Jamie look got this spark genetic injury spark therapy. Jamie's already got it.

118
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.380
Look at that. Bam, Jamie Vernon in the house.

119
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.540
So these folks are already doing this to people.

120
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.730
So is this for people that are sort of desperate and they'll try something

121
00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:00.564
experimental.

122
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.370
<v 1>Right? Uh, well, they're desperate in the sense that there's no other choice,</v>

123
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.810
no other cure. I mean, we're now curing genetic diseases.

124
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:10.530
Someone was just treated and cured of sickle cell anemia.

125
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.610
<v 0>That's phenomenal. And that, you know,</v>

126
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.570
I learned that that comes from malaria, right.

127
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.480
That was the idea that people were the resistance to malaria.

128
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.120
Was that trait from people that evolved in the area where they would get

129
00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:29.120
malaria was also what led to people getting sickle cell. Correct? Correct.

130
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.840
So thi I learned that from tiffanyhanish, by the way,

131
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.680
amazing Tiffany shout out to Tiffany, that Luxe turn of stuff

132
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.350
is something that someone like me could take right now.

133
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.070
<v 1>Uh, no, not easily. Your doctor would need to prescribe it.</v>

134
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.150
<v 0>And so if he did prescribe it, I could literally get vision back. Well.</v>

135
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.030
<v 1>This is not the same technology that I'm talking about it from my lab.</v>

136
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.990
<v 0>This is inherited retinal diseases, our commitment to R.</v>

137
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.900
<v 1>IRDs. This is gene replacement, not reprogramming the body to be young,</v>

138
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.780
but it's the same virus that we'd use to correct.

139
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:04.840
<v 0>Aging. Oh,</v>

140
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.620
so they're using this for certain retinal diseases where they're

141
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:13.980
correcting it now, how is this bacteria fixing your vision?

142
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.060
Well.

143
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.260
<v 1>The virus is adjusted to get the genes into the cells. That's all,</v>

144
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.530
and these are benign viruses. They don't hurt you, but they're a carrier.

145
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.170
And maybe eventually we'll have other ways to do this.

146
00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:29.690
But right now the virus is the best way. And in the mice to restore the vision,

147
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.290
we have this three gene combination of these yamenarka reprogramming genes.

148
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.490
We put them into the eye, uh, and then we turn them on with a drug. In fact,

149
00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:43.360
the same drug that I took when I was in Africa called doxycyclin is the same

150
00:08:43.361 --> 00:08:46.960
drug we can feed to the mice, turns on the reprogramming genes for a few weeks,

151
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.560
restores their vision back to a young mouse.

152
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.600
And then we just take away the doxycycin an antibiotic and the mice have their

153
00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:56.000
vision back. And how long does it take.

154
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.600
<v 0>For it starts deteriorating. Again, we.</v>

155
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.360
<v 1>Don't know yet how long, but we think that it's permanent. Wow.</v>

156
00:09:01.361 --> 00:09:04.480
Because the age of the cells has gone back. Those are young eyes again.

157
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.360
<v 0>So you might have a whole full cycle from like, uh,</v>

158
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.040
20 or 10 to 40 years old. Again, that's the.

159
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.750
<v 1>Future that you'll get a delivery of this virus.</v>

160
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.390
You'll take the antibiotic for a few weeks, be fully rejuvenated.

161
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.870
And the doctor says, come back in a couple of decades, we'll fix you again.

162
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.510
Or we'll give you some antibiotic in a couple of decades,

163
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.950
but then it gets really weird. If you have a,

164
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.830
if you engineer your children to have this system, if that ever happens,

165
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:34.470
let's imagine it could, we could do this right now with technology.

166
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.940
And you have people engineered to be able to be reversed in their age,

167
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.860
or let's say they have an accident and their optic nerve gets damaged, or they,

168
00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:44.740
they lose their hearing from a bomb,

169
00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:49.740
something that a spinal injury give 'em a dose, an IV of antibiotics.

170
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.540
And they become just like an embryo. They can rejuvenate,

171
00:09:53.541 --> 00:09:58.090
they can regrow their optic nerve. Reg are their spine fixed back, back.

172
00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.890
<v 0>Like new, the, the vision thing.</v>

173
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.330
Do you think that we're gonna see that in our lifetimes? I mean,

174
00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:05.290
is this something that you're gonna see that's gonna be available to the general

175
00:10:05.291 --> 00:10:05.960
public?

176
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.730
<v 1>Well, so, uh, so I've got, I'm an entrepreneur, uh, as we discussed before. And,</v>

177
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.890
uh, so one of the companies that I've started is exactly that raised money to be

178
00:10:14.891 --> 00:10:18.120
able to make virus we're making it now takes a few million bucks.

179
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.400
And we'll hopefully with the FDA's approval injected into people's eyes. Now,

180
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:26.040
first, it won't just be guys like you, first of all,

181
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:30.240
we have to go into an area where it's FDA approvalvable,

182
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:32.480
which is a disease like glaucoma,

183
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.400
which is pressure in the eye or a maculargeneration that's our first goal.

184
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.350
But then if it's safe, why not do old eyes? Wow.

185
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.670
<v 0>That's incredible. Now what about people with injuries? Yeah.</v>

186
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.630
<v 1>Well, yeah, you could theoretically put it into the spinal cord or give it,</v>

187
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:50.110
give an IV, but people with.

188
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.890
<v 0>Eye injuries.</v>

189
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:51.610
<v 1>Oh, for sure.</v>

190
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.710
So one of the things we also did in this paper that we've put online is, uh,

191
00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:59.700
we pinched the optic nerve. And what normally happens is it just degrades?

192
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.020
I mean, nerves don't grow back, right?

193
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:03.500
Unless you're a baby mouse or a baby human,

194
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.220
but we made those cells so young that the optic nerve grew back to the brain.

195
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.780
Wow. First time that's been able.

196
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.860
<v 0>To, I know a guy to have it from fighting. He's got a,</v>

197
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.370
a detached retina detached so bad that his, his vision and his right eyes,

198
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.810
like extremely poor shout out to Michael biing. Um,

199
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.690
do you think that that's something that inside of his lifetime,

200
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:29.130
they could see something use of this technology that could regenerate his eye?

201
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.530
<v 1>Uh, well, you know, I get, get a lot of emails,</v>

202
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:34.010
so I'm not really trying to over promise anything. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,

203
00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:36.570
what I, what I think is possible is that, uh,

204
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.600
initially it'll be used for disease, um, a chronic disease,

205
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.920
then it'll be used for injuries like, like that, but fresh injuries.

206
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.840
I think it's probably totally likely to work better if it's fresh. Mm.

207
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.400
I don't know where this technology's going. I can imagine a lot.

208
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.720
We can all imagine, uh, that you could get vision back and people walking again,

209
00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.120
but that's where this technology's going. We only,

210
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.720
so I described the discovery in the book as actually, what,

211
00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:03.200
what happened while I was writing the book is we were making these discoveries

212
00:12:03.201 --> 00:12:04.800
and they were remarkable. And so we,

213
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.680
I wrote them down in the book as we went along.

214
00:12:06.681 --> 00:12:10.720
So people can see how it feels to be a scientist to make these discoveries. Uh,

215
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:14.150
but it's only been a year or less that we've known about this. Mm-hmm.

216
00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:16.790
So imagine 50 years from now, what we can do, even 10,

217
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.750
it's gonna be a remarkable future.

218
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.390
<v 0>It's very exciting. Now,</v>

219
00:12:20.391 --> 00:12:25.350
what kind of a timeline are you anticipating for bringing this to, you know,

220
00:12:25.351 --> 00:12:26.350
people with injuries?

221
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.310
<v 1>Uh, well, injuries, uh, already,</v>

222
00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:33.500
we have a study plan for spinal injury in mice, uh,

223
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.260
and that we'll probably know the results in less than a year. And then we could,

224
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.700
you know, as fast as the FDA allows us go into a clinical trial.

225
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.060
<v 0>Now is the same scenario applicable for people with spine spinal</v>

226
00:12:47.061 --> 00:12:47.980
injuries as vision,

227
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.980
like people that have a more recent spinal injury will be more likely candidates

228
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.210
than people that have had older spinal.

229
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.770
<v 1>Injuries. I, I think so that would just be my guess that it's easier to fix a,</v>

230
00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:02.010
a recent recently damaged system, anything in the body that's fresh,

231
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.410
but I wouldn't rule out anything. When we, when we first discovered this,

232
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.170
the experiment was to have a fresh injury, the pinching of the optic nerve.

233
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.690
But then I said to my student, why don't you just try old mice? And he said,

234
00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:16.760
come on old mice, are you kidding me? How's that gonna work? Just try it,

235
00:13:16.761 --> 00:13:19.520
just try it. Uh, so he did it and, uh,

236
00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:22.640
in collaboration with another lab at Harvard, um, so that they're the experts.

237
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.200
Um, and so Bruce Cassandra is his name. So Bruce called me,

238
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.400
the professor at Harvard is 10 30 at night. I just got off a plane. He said,

239
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.840
David, you won't believe it. I didn't believe it. I just looked at the data.

240
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.910
It freaking worked. Wow. Old, micsis sing again. He said,

241
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:38.750
I wanna go down to the FDA and tell 'em about it.

242
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.390
Cause right now eye disease is typically, all you can do is slow them down.

243
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.710
And he's actually a reversal of lost function.

244
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:46.830
<v 0>Now, does this apply to injuries as well?</v>

245
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.470
Do you believe old injuries or just old macular degeneration?

246
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.030
<v 1>Uh, we haven't tried old injuries now. My, uh,</v>

247
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.980
we've done coglaucoma which is an old injury mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; okay.

248
00:13:56.981 --> 00:14:01.140
So theoretically, what we could do is at least with the existing nerves,

249
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:02.060
if they're still attached,

250
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.380
we should be able to rejuvenate those and make them work.

251
00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.620
<v 0>Better. Cause he has some vision in his eye.</v>

252
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.860
<v 1>So yeah. So that's possible that, that makes more sense, but very little.</v>

253
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.820
<v 0>Very limited in one eye. Yeah.</v>

254
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:14.740
<v 1>Well, we'll have to see.</v>

255
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:24.610
<v 2>And.</v>
