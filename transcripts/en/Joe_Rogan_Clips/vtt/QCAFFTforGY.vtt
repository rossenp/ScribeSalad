00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I contacted you right when the looting hit.</v>

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.853
<v 1>Because that's racist.</v>

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.700
<v 0>Well, because there are a lot of IP ballooning.</v>

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.100
It was a thing where I recognize that there was a giant shift in people's

5
00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:17.900
perception of the second amendment. And I said,

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.080
this is a good time for you again, appreciate it, brother. Yeah,

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.100
because you're out there beating the drums and sounding the alarms and all these

8
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:28.610
people that are anti second amendment people where a lot of these that were

9
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.070
lined up in California, trying to buy a gun last minute,

10
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.080
because as soon as the lockdown hit,

11
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.680
people started getting really nervous when people started getting locked in

12
00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:40.430
their homes and then people, when they realized they weren't going to work,

13
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:44.480
people started worrying about people stealing and things along those lines. Um,

14
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.850
I heard about people getting carjacked and, uh,

15
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.000
or get their groceries jacked rather where they're headed to their car from the

16
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.100
grocery store. Things got real weird.

17
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.490
And then you saw these giant lines at these LA gun stores,

18
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:58.940
and that's when I got ahold of you, because I think it's very,

19
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.680
it's a really important conversation.

20
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:05.390
I think you're the best at explaining it from a very rational perspective

21
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.100
that, you know,

22
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.230
people in during the times before COVID they didn't think that this was

23
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:16.250
important. Yeah. But you were always one of those guys where I was like, Hey,

24
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.970
what if goes down? Well, guess what went down.

25
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.580
<v 2>You don't like me carrying a firearm. You know, a lot of people ask me,</v>

26
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.860
they're like, when I started carrying a gun, I'm like, why,

27
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.290
why do you need to carry a gun? Like what,

28
00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:28.580
what do you think you're a drug dealer or something. I'm like, look,

29
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.350
it's nothing for me to take my, my, my phones, my wallet,

30
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.280
my keys, and then put my gun on and go about my life. It's nothing for me.

31
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.800
And it's not much of a,

32
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.130
it's not much of an encumbrance in my life where it's like, okay,

33
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:46.850
it's not worth the day-to-day of me carrying a firearm. But if I ever needed it,

34
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.200
that's going to be the most important thing I have on me to protect that life.

35
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.300
So it's a small price to pay for something that has such a huge upside if it

36
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:57.134
ever happens.

37
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.060
<v 0>Yeah. You're a best case scenario though. You're you're a lawyer.</v>

38
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.170
You're super intelligent. You're a really nice guy, but you also love guns.

39
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.410
Yeah. Look, what people are worried about is worst case scenario.

40
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.430
They're worried about someone who's a criminal who just wants to Rob people who

41
00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:16.040
has this ultimate power over folks.

42
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.350
And that's what everybody's worried about when it comes to guns.

43
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:21.560
So worried about a school shooter, they're worried about a mass murderer.

44
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:23.960
They're worried about a guy who breaks into a mosque and starts going and people

45
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:25.490
down. That's what they're worried about. And that's.

46
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.300
<v 2>That's, I, I totally get it. Like I really truly honestly get it.</v>

47
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:32.570
I know guys and sympathize with that, but my whole thing is this.

48
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.150
Once we move past that understanding of, so, you know,

49
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:39.110
you have the best case scenario, which you pointed out was theoretically me,

50
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.680
so to speak. And then you have the worst case scenario where you have criminals.

51
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:44.630
You have crazy people, mass shooters, things of that nature.

52
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.110
Once we get out of that realm. So let's talk about the reality because you know,

53
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:51.980
there's overlaps, right? So I usually ask people, well,

54
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.350
what law are you going to come up with? That's going to completely stop that.

55
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.920
<v 0>Here's a deceptive one that I've read. It was really up.</v>

56
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.650
They were talking about this, who was a, I think he was 17 who died from COVID.

57
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.880
And they said, uh, he, he was, uh, they were said he was healthy,

58
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.480
no under no other, uh, health issues. They said,

59
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.350
but then you read the article deeper. It turns out he had diabetes.

60
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.630
He had type one diabetes and he was 400 pounds. And it's like,

61
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:24.220
wait a minute. The that's not no issues. These articles are full of.

62
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.360
And they write those articles just so that you click on them because they get

63
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:31.000
the ad revenue from clicks.

64
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.290
So they're incentivized to trick you into being scared. Like, oh my God,

65
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:39.160
a 17 year old died. What happened? My 17 year old can die. Holy.

66
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.940
And then you click on it. And if you don't read, you know, six,

67
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:44.620
seven paragraphs into the article,

68
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:49.390
you don't find out that this was a 400 pound diabetic kid that,

69
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.520
you know, that's.

70
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.680
<v 3>What have died from the flu three months earlier.</v>

71
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.080
And it would have been the same. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

72
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.530
so the numbers are fudged. So I don't, I don't want to believe your numbers.

73
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:01.740
Don't come to me with more scare tactics. But like the numbers are spiking.

74
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.280
Well, you already said that 50% of the positives or false positives.

75
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.780
<v 0>Finally, they're saying, when they say the numbers are spiking, I haven't.</v>

76
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.240
<v 3>Heard the 50%. I got a video.</v>

77
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.110
That was the chick that is with Fowchee. That other one,

78
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.880
she was saying 50%. Yeah.

79
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.080
I don't know how old the video was that our testing is we're coming up.

80
00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:25.500
And if you have 1% of whatever and we test it,

81
00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:29.580
then 55th year at about half of the positives or false positive Jesus,

82
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.030
and then don't wear a mask and you have to wear a mask. And he said,

83
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.530
the whole reason we have to flatten the curve is because it can live on anything

84
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:38.850
for up to like nine days.

85
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.900
And even an asymptomatic person can still transmit it.

86
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.880
Then it comes out. They say the exact opposite.

87
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.390
<v 0>Yeah. Now they're saying asymptomatic people very, very rarely transmit.</v>

88
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.690
<v 3>It. I don't choose to believe that, Joe. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.</v>

89
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.540
We're going to believe what they told me the first time. Not the newest,

90
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.790
not the new facts that they have now.

91
00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:58.710
So we're still gonna wear masks all the time.

92
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.980
<v 0>Yeah. People get mad at you. If you suggest differently.</v>

93
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.770
There's a lot of people that like being scared too. And they're like,

94
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.570
you wear your God mask. We need to protect people. Love it.

95
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.310
But meanwhile, who's.

96
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.490
<v 3>Going to protect you in you. Who's going to protect your family. Me.</v>

97
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.421
<v 0>Being bald.</v>

98
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:18.780
There was no these people weren't freaking out when you see these mass protests

99
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.890
and the spikes, guess what happened right after the protest.

100
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:24.600
And at least they're saying that now,

101
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.250
at least they're saying they're being forced into saying is probably

102
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:33.600
connected to the protests. Well, of course I miss you on TV right now.

103
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.670
I really do. This is a perfect time for you.

104
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.290
It's kind of crazy that you're not hosting that show anymore.

105
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.430
<v 4>But there's so many people doing that object. You know, I was,</v>

106
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.800
I really did burn out. Like I, I felt like it's just redundant. You know,

107
00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:54.510
the nice thing for what you do is you get to curate and

108
00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:59.210
kind of be more active in to follow your own rhythm for it.

109
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.550
I was really tied to that rhythm of the 24 hour news

110
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:09.260
cycle and how redundant it is and how cyclical.

111
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.790
And at a certain point, I was like, I don't know what else to do with this.

112
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.560
And so I didn't want to stay just cause I could, I just done it long enough.

113
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:21.230
And so I thought, well, let me just, it was just time.

114
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:24.260
I thought like the audience needed a fresh perspective.

115
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.060
I needed a fresh perspective. Like I just, I just felt done. Like I was more,

116
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.860
I was more mad about. Then, then inspired.

117
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.630
You know.

118
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.530
<v 0>I appreciate that. You decided to go out at the, literally at the very top,</v>

119
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.960
but it seems like,

120
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.050
especially like right now, John, Oliver's killing it. And Trevor,

121
00:06:47.051 --> 00:06:50.410
Noah's doing your show and it's like, this is, this is,

122
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.840
there's so much to mock.

123
00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:57.340
It's almost like an overload and doing real commentary on politics today in my

124
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.790
it's almost like you're doing commentary on pro wrestling.

125
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.010
Like this is a rig game and you're out here pretending like this makes

126
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:06.844
sense.

127
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.240
<v 4>Yeah. It's you're right. Well,</v>

128
00:07:10.241 --> 00:07:15.220
it's also because that's the economic system that's been set up around

129
00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:19.930
politics is the very same that Vince McMahon set up around

130
00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:23.560
wrestling. You create, I mean, it is a kind of, you know, kayfabe,

131
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.710
it's a sort of like, yeah, there are characters.

132
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.610
You know what it's like when you're trying to produce something every day,

133
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.610
you're going to go with kind of a boiler plate structure.

134
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.300
So you're going to say, all right, our show revolves around your,

135
00:07:37.301 --> 00:07:39.880
from the right ear, from the left, whatever comes in,

136
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:44.140
we're going to filter it through that. We're going to keep it producible,

137
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.130
but it starts to, like you say, it becomes, you know, authentic.

138
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.360
But the same thing would happen to me sometimes with like,

139
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:53.500
I'd be doing shows and,

140
00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:57.850
and you would know you weren't necessarily feeling the

141
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.220
outrage of something or, uh, that,

142
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:03.370
that the commentary was going to be as spicy spicier,

143
00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:06.820
as deep as you might want it, but you might kick it up a notch anyway.

144
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.850
Cause it was performative. And I,

145
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.580
I always had to fight that instinct to not,

146
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.060
to not give into the gravity of like what was expected

147
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.363
of me.

148
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.000
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
