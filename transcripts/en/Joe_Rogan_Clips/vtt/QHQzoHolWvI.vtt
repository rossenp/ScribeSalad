00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.720
<v 1>Yeah, that's what I realized that something was going on.</v>

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.480
I didn't know what it was. A lot of it was anger, man. I wonder.

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.720
<v 0>It was, I don't know. Nothing, no specific reason.</v>

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.200
<v 1>I tried. I mean, I tried like, um, I've just done a ton of yoga.</v>

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.160
I did.

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.110
<v 0>Oh yeah. Yeah. Isn't that amazing for like relieving anger. Oh,</v>

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.790
you're so peaceful after you get out.

9
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.310
<v 1>Of there. Yoga meditation. I try the ketamine. Um.</v>

10
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.510
<v 0>Oh, you did the nasal spray. No, I did.</v>

11
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.350
<v 1>The shoot. 'em up. Oh, did.</v>

12
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.310
<v 0>You really? You do the IV? Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.430
<v 1>You went to a doctor successions. Yeah. With a therapist in the room.</v>

14
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.110
Did you trip.

15
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.230
<v 0>Balls? Mm-hmm.</v>

16
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.940
<v 1>&lt;Affirmative&gt; were I thought &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

17
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.660
talk to me. There was a moment. No joke where I thought it was a tonsil.

18
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:51.460
There was a time where I thought it was a tonsil, a.

19
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.540
<v 0>Tonsil. Maybe you.</v>

20
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.420
<v 1>Are you? Yeah, totally. I.</v>

21
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.620
<v 0>Wouldn't be shock. Maybe we're all cells in a tonsil.</v>

22
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.540
Cause you know how like an Adam, if you think of an Adam,

23
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.690
most of it is like empty space, right?

24
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.050
<v 1>Yeah. Just like solar system.</v>

25
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.610
<v 0>Right? Maybe that's like the whole universe is like an atom. Oh, all.</v>

26
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.810
'em be shocked by that. And you really are an atom in a tonsil, but.

27
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.450
<v 1>That the reveal on that wouldn't be,</v>

28
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.650
I need something Dar I need something more than that. So.

29
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.490
<v 0>When you thought you were a tonsil, tell me what, what the experience was like.</v>

30
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.370
<v 1>Okay. So they put you in the thing,</v>

31
00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:24.000
you're sitting the chair and then suddenly like, um,

32
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.800
you have your eyes closed and you're talking with a therapist the whole time

33
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:29.080
during this place. Is he talking.

34
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.680
<v 0>Too much? No. Is he like me? &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

35
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.080
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; no, I don't think he I'm glad you talk. Cuz I don't. It's hard for me.</v>

36
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.440
The, the most I've ever talked to my life is a couple times with you.

37
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.710
<v 0>All right. Like back to ketamine. Yeah.</v>

38
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.630
<v 1>Okay. So I'm sitting there in the chair and a man named John.</v>

39
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.030
The SHERP, the shepa kind you're in there with a SHERP and it's a SHERP.

40
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.630
<v 0>I thought it was a, like a counselor or something. I mean.</v>

41
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.750
<v 1>It's a, he had a whistle around his neck. That's the, only to little bit dicey,</v>

42
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.620
but oh, it. But it was sanctioned. It's in a beautiful facility.

43
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:09.380
It's a nice facility. So go in, they put it in. You I'm sitting in the chair,

44
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.940
he had a whistle. Uh, I think it would like,

45
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:14.940
it might have been a safety piece he had from being a child or something.

46
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.980
He might, he could have been, I don't know, lifeguard.

47
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.500
I have no idea what his past was like, but he was a nice guy,

48
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.290
but he is a therapist. So I'm sitting there and I start dreaming, you know,

49
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.530
like a regular dream, you know, I start dreaming a little bit.

50
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.530
I'm still talking to him. And then I start talking about being a kid, you know,

51
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.250
I love thinking about being a kid and stuff.

52
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:39.370
And so I start talking about being a child and then I start talking about my dad

53
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.400
and now like the darkness is starting to have like kind of shapes in, in it.

54
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.760
And things are starting to feel that I'm talking about are starting to feel

55
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.960
real. Like this feels real.

56
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.840
I'm sitting in here with you and there's this table here and this.

57
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.400
So I can feel, this feels real Jamie's right there. So things like that,

58
00:02:57.401 --> 00:03:00.120
I'm talking about start to feel. It has a feeling, not just a vision.

59
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.240
So I started to feel, I was talking about my dad and next thing you know,

60
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.960
I'm spending time with my dad, like I'm with my dad. Whoa.

61
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.360
And I had, you know, and I ain't gotten to spend time with my dad in 20 years.

62
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.110
So like I'm and I remember let, I got to let my dad know that I loved him.

63
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.190
I didn't know if he ever knew, you know, and it was this crazy thing, dude,

64
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.350
I'm sitting there and I'm bawling, crying. And like,

65
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.990
I didn't plan on that when I went in there.

66
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.230
But it felt like I was really with my, like,

67
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:35.910
it felt as real as sitting here with you. Wow. Which for,

68
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.060
for somebody being deceased and gone, it, it was so powerful. I.

69
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.060
<v 0>Would think that that would be a hard thing to share with someone you don't</v>

70
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:43.894
know.

71
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.700
<v 1>I guess that maybe that's where the academy really comes in and I didn't, uh,</v>

72
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.660
it.

73
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.580
<v 0>Didn't bother you that you.</v>

74
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.020
<v 1>Didn't know. And I'm okay with sh I shared a lot of emo.</v>

75
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.060
I share a lot of E like yeah. I share a lot of emotional stuff.

76
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.300
So I think I'm probably more prone to it maybe than some people. But.

77
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.770
<v 0>I would just imagine that, like,</v>

78
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.210
if you don't know this man and you're sitting down and it's like an intensely

79
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.490
personal part of your life.

80
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.170
<v 1>Well, he became, the therapist became just somebody I would check in.</v>

81
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.450
I would say, John, is everything okay? Am I okay? Cuz I started to feel,

82
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.890
then I started to slide down the edge of the universe for a minute.

83
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.423
<v 0>What's that like.</v>

84
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.480
<v 1>It was, it was, it was hard. It was hard.</v>

85
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.720
Cuz you don't have any ropes or anything. I mean you're out there just,

86
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.280
you're like, you know, hope solo or your solo hope or whatever that guy is.

87
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:32.760
Who climbed that guy? You, you had him on.

88
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.800
<v 0>Free solo. Alex, hon. Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.680
<v 1>You're like that dude. But, but there's no, but there's no Mount, no ropes,</v>

90
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.390
no Mount, but you have a, I do, you do have a bag of chalk on your, your belt.

91
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.310
I didn't notice that, but I felt like a cryptocurrency.

92
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.910
I felt myself like going through these channels. Um,

93
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.310
and then I came back to another moment I got to spend time with, oh,

94
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:58.270
I got to see my mom when she was a kid, which I thought was kind of interesting.

95
00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.363
Wow. Uh,

96
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.900
and just see that she was like a &lt;affirmative&gt; happy child or something,

97
00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:03.980
you know, or just, I don't know.

98
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.980
So there was moments like that for me that were extremely intense and real.

99
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.420
Um, and otherwise there was a lot of moments where I was just out of my,

100
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.060
I was out of the chair. I remember at some points thinking,

101
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.060
how am I ever gonna get back into that chair? Wow.

102
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.690
They'll never get me back in there. I'm was just so far out in my head. How.

103
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.523
<v 0>Long did it last?</v>

104
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.930
<v 1>It felt like it lasted for about maybe, maybe 13 minutes,</v>

105
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.063
but it was an hour.

106
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.210
<v 0>Neil Brennan told me about it first. He was the first guy telling him about it.</v>

107
00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:38.130
I'll never forget. We're in the hallway of the comedy store. You know,

108
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.290
Neil's an intense guy. Yeah. And he looks at me and he goes, uh,

109
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.720
uh he's like I was tripping &lt;laugh&gt;

110
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.560
he goes, I didn't know what it was gonna be. He goes, I was tripping. Yeah.

111
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.680
And it was, uh, for him it was to deal with depression. Yeah.

112
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.400
He said it was very effective. Wow. To help him a lot. I, I.

113
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.880
<v 1>I, I, I took away from it. If you had like a,</v>

114
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:05.600
some severe tragedy or something like that, then it would really help for me.

115
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:07.280
It didn't feel like a long term solution.

116
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.080
It didn't help me with my anger really.

117
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.840
<v 0>So where do you think your anger's coming from? I don't know, man.</v>

118
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.000
I don't recognize you as an angry guy.

119
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.670
Like you and I have only had laughs like when you and I have been hanging out,

120
00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:20.830
it's always been just like this fun.

121
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.390
<v 1>Yeah. I think, I think some of it's maybe responsibility, um.</v>

122
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.910
<v 0>Responsibility makes you angry.</v>

123
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.190
<v 1>Yeah. I think sometimes I think maybe I think,</v>

124
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.470
I thought that whenever my life got a,

125
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.340
like whenever I got more success in my job or something that I would

126
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.523
feel

127
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.820
some satisfaction.

128
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.980
<v 0>Something like you feel like you made it.</v>

129
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.460
<v 1>I thought I would feel like yes, different. Right. And I'm feel appreciative.</v>

130
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.340
I feel happy. And I'm, I'm not saying I'm amazing in my job,

131
00:06:55.341 --> 00:07:00.050
but I'm once I started to have some in my job that I would feel

132
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:04.490
different. I see what you're saying and I just didn't, I don't know.

133
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:06.810
You're still the same. Everything's still kind of the,

134
00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:09.610
you still have all the same things, you know? Do you ever have.

135
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.010
<v 0>Imposter syndrome? I've heard about it. You don't have that.</v>

136
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.730
I don't know if I do the,

137
00:07:14.731 --> 00:07:17.970
the idea is that like you can't believe that you're successful and you feel I

138
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.920
eventually the world's gonna wake up and go, why the am I paying attention?

139
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:24.040
This guy he's out here talking crazy.

140
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.320
But his cousin getting bit by a gay guy.

141
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.400
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; well, it happened on Halloween. &lt;laugh&gt; you know,</v>

142
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.600
that's my favorite joke. You do well happened in Los Angeles, dude,

143
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.640
that still kills me the. It happened in Los Angeles.

144
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.270
The guy was dressed up like a baby deer. And my cousin loved to deer hunt.

145
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:45.270
That was the crazy part &lt;laugh&gt;. So the dude comes out and he, you know,

146
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.070
his first instinct is to feed him or whatever, you know,

147
00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:52.190
sprinkle that out there or whatever &lt;laugh&gt; and the dude bit him, man.

148
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.710
That's you know, that's.

149
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.470
<v 0>Newsom a guy biting. It was, is it Newsom's fault?</v>

150
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.540
<v 1>I mean, I know what's it might.</v>

151
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.460
<v 0>Be his fault. I'm willing to go with you and blame Newsom.</v>
