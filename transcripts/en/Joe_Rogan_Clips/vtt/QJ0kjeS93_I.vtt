00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.970
<v 1>Experience. I'm a little nervous about Iran though. That seems like real.</v>

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.200
That, that makes me want to get educated on the subject. So I could really.

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.120
<v 0>The one thing that made me feel better is when they were screaming death to</v>

5
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:19.650
America, death to America recently, the president of Iran was like, well,

6
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:22.830
when we say death to America, we don't mean the citizens.

7
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:26.160
We like the citizens we're talking about, you, Donald Trump, you know?

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.340
<v 1>Yeah. Saying that for a long time,</v>

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.760
that death to America chant that's been around. Right. That's a tough sell.

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.070
Yeah. We know what you're saying. You're saying death to America. Okay. Like,

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.650
that's one thing that you don't want to be misconstrued.

12
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:44.010
If you want to make signs and yell. Like you don't like you don't like, Hey,

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.460
we're not talking deaf, deaf guys, right? Oh yeah. Definitely not. Death. Death.

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.970
Let's go out and scream debt to America. Everyone's going to know like,

15
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:53.580
that'd be the worst way to communicate something. Like why,

16
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.020
if you don't really think that,

17
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.270
why would you say death to the American political system,

18
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.200
death to the American military complex, not death to America, right?

19
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.850
That to America is everybody. How did they got us all mixed?

20
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.820
Mean we don't have nothing to do with this guys. We're just over here, chilling.

21
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.330
How they got us messed up in some international conflict that you actually have

22
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:18.900
to think about. Might come in, knocking on your door. What,

23
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.820
what ineptitude mixed with scumbag theory led us to this

24
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:27.270
position? Who did, who did this? Is it the Iranian guys?

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.610
Did Trump do something he shouldn't have done?

26
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.750
<v 0>Doesn't it seem weird timing though, with this whole, uh, impeachment.</v>

27
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.850
<v 1>It's all weird, dude. It's all weird. The fact that Trump can kill people,</v>

28
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.410
just understand how crazy it is that you got a guy like Trump,

29
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.130
who could just go send it in, send the missile, just shoot missiles.

30
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.210
He could just listen, man. Don't give me that power either.

31
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.880
Don't give anybody that power for sure.

32
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.890
But a guy like Trump guy was a famous for

33
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:02.010
being mean to people on a reality show. You're fired,

34
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.310
famous for being a baller. I mean, that's what he's famous for.

35
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.450
He was in that's.

36
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:10.320
The crazy thing is like he was in rap songs all the time and like a

37
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:14.850
complimentary way that guy's life has gone through an arch.

38
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.410
<v 0>Home alone too.</v>

39
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.830
<v 1>He who's at home alone too. And in Canada, those silly,</v>

40
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.350
they edited it out. The CVC edited out the Donald Trump scene.

41
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.610
Cause it's offensive,

42
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.710
offensive to a suit who really enjoy films without

43
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.480
Munsters that's history. You're going to go into naked gun and get rid of OJ.

44
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.760
We can do, what are you gonna do? You gonna take OJ out of the NFL archives.

45
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.990
What are you going to do? Now? This is life.

46
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.330
You can't make life prettier by pulling Donald Trump out of home alone.

47
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:50.010
You're supposed to look at it and go, holy,

48
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.570
who would have thought that guy would be the president one day it would be

49
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:57.600
killing dudes. And it may be starting world war three,

50
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.630
like a Stephen King novel. You know,

51
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:06.370
Stephen King's freaked out by Trump. These media posts, oh,

52
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:07.204
what happened there?

53
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.150
These media posts will serve as notification to the United States.

54
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.070
Congress that should I ran strike any us person or target the United States will

55
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.560
click quickly and fully strike back.

56
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.680
And perhaps in a disproportionate manner,

57
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.570
such legal notice is not required, but it is given nevertheless,

58
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.790
dude, this that I don't like to see on Twitter.

59
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.810
That seems so bizarre. That almost seems like the, the,

60
00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:40.720
the simulation theory has hired like comedy writers to come in and

61
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:45.430
subtly with everybody that he can just put that on Twitter.

62
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.800
How can they just put that on Twitter?

63
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.000
Like I thought there was a series of checks and balances, you know, I mean,

64
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.290
this is ultimately a one guy can have like an instantaneous press conference

65
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:59.020
anytime he wants just by putting something on Twitter.

66
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.170
And then there's all these people that go, you got to ban them for Twitter,

67
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.170
but here's the problem. You ban him from Twitter. Gab is going to,

68
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.830
he'll go to gab, right? If he goes to gab, gab, all of a sudden skyrocket,

69
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.970
because everyone's going to want to go to gab to see Trump talk on gab,

70
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.570
where it's full freedom of speech. What if he starts swearing on gap?

71
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.750
What if they make a deal with them? Well, if they give them 50% of gap,

72
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.200
because they think it's eminent because of this, a war in with Iran,

73
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.490
this could be a movie where they're going to ban them from Twitter and Vigia

74
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.090
and, and Jack Dorsey has to leave. He's in a meditation,

75
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.290
a silent meditation and Bally, and the has to fly in.

76
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.830
And he has to figure out whether or not they can make this executive decision to

77
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:41.080
ban Trump, but everybody's calling for it.

78
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.920
Ban Trump ban Trump ban ban them. And then they,

79
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.360
if they bend them off Twitter,

80
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.180
imagine if you went to the thing and the page said banned,

81
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.780
you would just open up your windows and hear liberals cheering like king Kong

82
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:57.730
just fell off the empire state building he's banned.

83
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.520
The YouTube videos would be spectacular.

84
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.900
Do you know how many virtue signaling dipshits would have YouTube videos,

85
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.280
just screaming and pumping their fists in the air and pointing to the screen

86
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.170
with Donald Trump and says owned. You know, maybe it would be,

87
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.760
it would be hilarious.

88
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.080
And all he would have to do is do that and go over somewhere else.

89
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.770
And that new platform would be gigantic.

90
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.680
Cause everybody would want to know what he says. And if he says it over there,

91
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.810
everybody else has just retweeted on Twitter. Anyway,

92
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.440
it would probably be like killing coyotes. You know how you kill coyotes.

93
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.800
And then they make more coyotes like a female. When they, when they,

94
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.850
when they shout out, that's like a roll call. And if someone's missing,

95
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.390
the female makes more babies. That's one of the craziest things about coyotes.

96
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:45.550
That's why they're everywhere. That's what would happen with Trump.

97
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.760
If they banned him off Twitter, his signal would be bigger than ever.

98
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.410
It would be bonkers. Like they're in a precarious situation now too,

99
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.920
because these, these social media companies, they're,

100
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.190
they're being labeled as someone who would ban freedom of speech from certain

101
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.290
people, if they don't believe with their ideas.

102
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.640
Now this happens to be the president that they say,

103
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.940
you can't have freedom of speech on our platform anymore.

104
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.230
Then everything is like out the window. Like, what is this? What are we doing?

105
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.030
And then if it backfires and Twitter loses all of its power and some other

106
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.810
company comes along and takes the spot.

107
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.330
Some company that promises to never do that to the president,

108
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.680
let people express themselves,

109
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:32.510
but explain perhaps through a series of checks and balances while you can't

110
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.910
stalk somebody or be mean to somebody or make any sense. Or we just.

111
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.700
<v 2>Him being on the most popular, it's like Twitter.</v>

112
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.340
Then like the most popular platform. Cause he could do radio.

113
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.170
He could do anything and nobody sees it.

114
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:47.600
No one's paying attention to the radio or the TV things that he does.

115
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:49.190
And everyone pays attention to his tweets.

116
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.210
<v 1>Well, it's interesting because he's kinda think he has he, I mean,</v>

117
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:57.890
he's a guy that obviously he does a lot of business deals and he does a lot of

118
00:06:57.891 --> 00:06:59.180
deals simultaneously.

119
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.510
It's the only way he can have as many properties as he has. You know,

120
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:04.370
he's got Trump towers everywhere.

121
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:08.120
He's got them in Vegas and Chicago and all over the world. Like,

122
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:11.480
he's gotta be a guy that's always thinking about doing the next thing.

123
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.850
And if he was like, you would think he's like setting himself up as a business.

124
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.830
It's like, he's a business. He's he's now not just the president.

125
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:24.550
And he's always been a business. He's always been a celebrity in, uh, in,

126
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.660
you know, iconic financial character.

127
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.780
But now his entertainment,

128
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.730
like what he says about life and everything is super valuable.

129
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.590
If Trump like Trump had that show, if he decides to have a podcast,

130
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.640
do you know what God crazy? It would be. If Donald Trump just pulls up,

131
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.970
has a YouTube channel, talks to the camera, says what?

132
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:51.260
He really thinks about everything. They release it as a podcast as well.

133
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.890
And no one can stop him because that's freedom of speech.

134
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.990
His freedom of speech has let this guy talk.

135
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.260
Do you know if he started threatening people like threatening?

136
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:02.720
I ran from his YouTube channel. Like what the?

137
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.150
Imagine if world war three is caused by a tweet.

138
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.670
Imagine if Trump threatens someone and they retaliate to show,

139
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:17.990
they're not scared. We nuke them. And then, oh my God,

140
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:23.300
from a Trump tweet, is that possible? It seems like anything is possible.

141
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:23.690
He's probably.

142
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.950
<v 0>Going to do it right at the end to.</v>

143
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.770
<v 1>The end is a weird one, right? Like, is it going to be a few months from now?</v>

144
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.210
Or is it going to be four years?

145
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.220
<v 0>That's with all this Iran things,</v>

146
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.640
it might happen faster if I didn't think it was going to happen at all.

147
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:40.460
But now maybe this Iran thing. Yeah.

148
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.710
Maybe this is for.

149
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.550
<v 1>The purpose. He's not going to just go. That's the thing.</v>

150
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:48.380
And there's a lot of people that don't want them to go.

151
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.570
The Republicans don't want to lose power.

152
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.770
And they're very smart in that. Even ones are, you know,

153
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:58.740
that were never Trumpers. At one point in time, they've accepted him.

154
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.860
He's a fascinating guy. He's a fascinating like human character.

155
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.020
If you look at him in terms of like

156
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.570
just his PO go back to that photo that we're just looking at.

157
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.960
Let me see that big time. He's a fascinating character, man.

158
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.410
And he's also a very strong guy in a lot of ways,

159
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:22.650
like mentally strong in terms of what he's been able to accomplish.

160
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:24.600
All the business deals always believes in himself.

161
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.740
There's something about that that gets other people. And they,

162
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.700
they sort of like,

163
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.050
they get a little kissy around them and they just,

164
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.680
they want him to like them. Cause if he doesn't like you it's devastating.

165
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.560
If Trump goes after you on Twitter, he gets mad at you devastating.

166
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.620
So they all want them to like him. So look at them all reaching for him.

167
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.120
Like that's like a, that's a painting one day that they'll have on the caves.

168
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.520
They'll cave. Paint that after world war three,

169
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.090
after we get Newton to the stone age, they'll they'll cave,

170
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.710
paint how a guy figured out how to be

171
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.000
just mean enough,

172
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:04.470
but just nice enough and have all these people like them and

173
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.380
literally be able to kill someone with a press of a button.

174
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.010
And then everybody wants to touch him. Like, look at that.

175
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:13.860
They're reaching for them. They're reaching. Look at the guy in the back.

176
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.220
They're all reaching. It's like a Michael Angelo painting, bro. It is.

177
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.080
And that this guy somehow got into this crazy position from hosting a reality

178
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:24.210
show and getting really famous by telling people they're fired.

179
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.820
And now all of a sudden he's he's deciding whether or not

180
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:34.290
they can nuke generals into another dimension from a robot

181
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.770
that flies and just shoots missiles.

182
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.320
And the missiles are called hellfire missiles. Did you hear.

183
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.510
<v 2>I think Russia has it. That Supersite goes 20 Mach 27. Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

184
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.530
We'll drop it from space.

185
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:48.750
And it just like rollercoasters itself it and like we don't,

186
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:51.660
I guess we don't have a thing to stop it yet. It's 27 times the speed of sound.

187
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.823
Oh Jesus.

188
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.390
<v 1>This is the space war. This is why Trump wanted to have a space for us.</v>

189
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.330
When I heard about a space force, I was like, what do you, what are you doing,

190
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:05.190
man space for us. But here's the other thing when you're 74,

191
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:09.330
whatever he is, do you realize you're 74? Are you just alive?

192
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:13.020
I think you're just alive. Especially if you're on diet pills,

193
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.070
then I think you're really just alive. You're out there. You're just grinding.

194
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.650
You just like grinding because that's how you do it.

195
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:20.970
You just go out there and you kick.

196
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.400
He's not thinking about riding off into the sunset.

197
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:25.650
He's not thinking about any of that, but people,

198
00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:29.670
we think that way when we see someone in 74, but like, oh, by the time he's 78,

199
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:33.210
he's going to want out. He's not going to want out. He's not going to want out.

200
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.810
He's alive. Is he alive? Yeah, he's gonna, he's going to keep going.

201
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:41.520
Especially if you're stimulated, if you're, uh, artificially stimulated,

202
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.590
you know, I mean, I'm talking right now. I'm drinking coffee.

203
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:47.543
That's why I'm so excited.

204
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.720
<v 3>Does he take talking yet? I hope he does. I hope that'd be great.</v>
