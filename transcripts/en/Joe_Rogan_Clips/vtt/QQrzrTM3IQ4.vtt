00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.160
<v 0>What, but driving, driving a race car, I mean,</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.440
you have a giant engine you're strapped into a seat.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.480
You're hurling down the road at extreme speeds,

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.600
right next to other cars doing the same thing, just the intensity and the,

5
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:15.480
just the everything being on nine at all.

6
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:20.080
Times like that is a wild way to make a living, sir. Yeah. Thanks.

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.030
<v 1>I mean, I, um, it, when I was a little, uh,</v>

8
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.030
when I was little thinking about, you know,

9
00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:29.150
what the hell am I gonna grow up and be, uh, I was,

10
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.270
my father was really successful in the sport.

11
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.150
So I would go to the races and I would watch him race and see him win and watch

12
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:38.150
him go through victory lane and, and celebrate and all those things.

13
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.380
And I thought, man, this is what I gotta do. I gotta do this. This is,

14
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:46.060
this looks fun. This looks exciting. People are, you know,

15
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.740
people are in awe of the drivers, the race, my father, the, the,

16
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.900
the personalities. And I just wanted to do it real badly,

17
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.340
but I knew that the odds of making it are tough.

18
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.570
So there's only 40 guys in the field every weekend. So there's 40 guys in this,

19
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.810
in the whole country that are gonna get the shot to do it. You know, and me,

20
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.690
the odds of me, even with my dad being as successful as he was,

21
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.530
I'd have a lot of doors open to me,

22
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:17.170
but the odds of me actually getting there and being able to stay had the stay in

23
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:19.930
power and the success and talent, I just knew were tough.

24
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.400
So I didn't know if I I'd ever get that. Um,

25
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.440
but it is. I don't, you know,

26
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.480
I remember the first time I went to a two and a half mile track it's Talladega

27
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:36.440
and you hold it wide open. I was, uh, working at my dad's dealership,

28
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.840
changing in oil. He owned this, uh, Chevy store in, uh, Newton, North Carolina,

29
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.990
and, uh, the phone rang and he said, my dad, my dad was on that end.

30
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.110
And he was in Talladega for a test. And he said, uh,

31
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.470
get your helmet and your suit and meet me at the racetrack. The next day,

32
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.270
you're gonna fly in the king air to the, to the track. Don't no,

33
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.910
don't ask questions, just do it. And so I got there and I,

34
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.710
I knew I was going to Talladega and I thought, man, I must be driving this.

35
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.300
This is gonna be crazy. I'm gonna go around this two and a half mile, two track,

36
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.020
full speed at 190 miles an hour. I'd never done.

37
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.460
I never went faster than 90 or 95 on a race track before never drove anything

38
00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:17.180
bigger than a half mile. And, uh, I pulled out he's, you know, I got there.

39
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:19.020
He is like, you're gonna test this car, get in, get ready.

40
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.260
He puts me in there and he's like, you gotta hold a wide open.

41
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:24.450
If you don't hold a wide open me. Motor's not gonna work.

42
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:25.370
It it'll hurt the motor.

43
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.650
You gotta hold it the way they tune the motor to run wide open.

44
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.650
It has to run it. It has to run at full throttle.

45
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.450
If you try to go around there at half throtle to burn the pistons,

46
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:38.810
it'll run too lean. Wow. All those things. So he, he was saying that,

47
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.690
and I thought to myself, is he just telling me that?

48
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:43.690
Just to make sure I hold it wide open, cuz he thought I would, I would,

49
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.640
I would be a and not do it. &lt;laugh&gt;. And so I was like, man, I,

50
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.800
I I'm a little nervous, uh, to hold it wide open. But I,

51
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.240
I pulled out on the track and I mashed the gas full throttle and I'm going down

52
00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:59.000
the back straightaway. And I was like, I'm looking down the back,

53
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.920
straight away into the next corner, this long corner. And I'm like,

54
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.600
how's it gonna stick? You know, how's the car gonna, how's the car.

55
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.240
Not gonna fly outta the racetrack. Like it I'm going so fast. I don't,

56
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.480
it doesn't feel like it's going to stay in the track.

57
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.160
And uh, and I kept running.

58
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.870
It kept running that through my head about my dad saying I gotta hold of wide

59
00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:24.830
open. I'm like, well, dad's it. It'll it'll, it'll go wide open around here.

60
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.990
So I don't think he would, you know,

61
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.590
I believe everything he says and you go in the corner and you turn,

62
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.440
uh, into the corner and there is more grit than you can imagine.

63
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.670
Like the, there there's so much grip. The,

64
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.430
the car is stuck to the track with such grip that you've never felt this before

65
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:49.190
in your life. This, this grip, like you can't slide across that track.

66
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.390
The tr the tires and the car, a hold of the track.

67
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.790
So tough and tight that nothing's gonna make it. It just goes around there.

68
00:03:56.791 --> 00:04:01.780
Like it's, it's the craziest thing. And so today when I tell people, uh,

69
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:02.501
when I got, I,

70
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.260
we got this two seater car and we take people for rides and they get in there

71
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:06.980
and I'm, I'm like, man, what am I gonna do?

72
00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:09.540
What are you gonna do to explain to somebody what this is gonna feel like? Well,

73
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:12.460
they, I'm gonna tell you things to pay attention, to pay attention to the grip.

74
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.820
You're not gonna believe how much grip this car has. Like it's, you're,

75
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.650
you're just not gonna believe that it'll stick to the track way. It does.

76
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.850
So pay attention to that and pay attention to how bumpy and violent it is.

77
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.370
You know, you drive a Cadillac or, uh, any car down the street. Well, it's,

78
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.050
you know, six, eight inches off the ground,

79
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:34.450
these big old inflated tires and big giant sidewas.

80
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.770
And it's gonna feel nice. You know, when it hits little bumps,

81
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.520
our cars are rigid and sucked to the ground and don't have much travel in the

82
00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:45.920
suspension. And you know, it just, it's, it's built to hand to go fast,

83
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.120
not to feel good, you know, and it's gonna, it's rough as hell. And it shakes,

84
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.480
shakes the hell out of you. And, um, that's what I remember about that. And,

85
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.840
and as soon as I got over that initial fear,

86
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.560
I think that was the only time I ever had any real fear of driving a car.

87
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.150
As soon I was like, well, all right, what, you know, anything,

88
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.150
nothing else is gonna be as scary as that was right. Driving a car.

89
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.670
And I mean, flipping.

90
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.190
And when I flipped for the first time and our, you know,

91
00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:18.150
the car's tumbling and flying parts flying off the air, my, I,

92
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.540
I thought to myself that I wasn't scared,

93
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.020
or I never was scared of flipping. My thought was, I just did something.

94
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.740
A lot of people never gonna experience. You know, I did something that,

95
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.180
uh, that only a few people know what that's like. And,

96
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.220
and I feel safe. I've always felt incredibly safe inside the car, you know,

97
00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:44.170
with, especially with, with the, I mean, in the last 20 years, this,

98
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.930
the safety stuff has really been focused on and improved and

99
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:49.970
better and better and better.

100
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.170
But I look at the interior of our cars today versus 20 years ago. And it's,

101
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.610
I can't believe of some of the stuff that we used to climb into,

102
00:05:55.611 --> 00:05:59.680
but so you felt calm while it was flipping. Oh yeah.

103
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.320
I always, well, I've seen cars flip, right? I've seen it for years. Right.

104
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.440
And so I know it's possible.

105
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.240
So I get in there and I got turned around at a race in 1998.

106
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.000
I was racing at Daytona and, uh,

107
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:16.440
I got turned around and the car, so I'm flipping for the,

108
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.350
a first time in my life. And this car's like over 3000, uh, 3000 pounds.

109
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.630
So it's it's, but it flies up in the air. Like it's paper, man.

110
00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:27.350
It's the craziest thing in the world. It's so weightless, you know,

111
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.070
and what it felt like to me,

112
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.150
cuz so the car rolled on its side and uh,

113
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.790
came down kind of on its side.

114
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.220
It felt like somebody rolled a prop wall of grass up against the car.

115
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.740
You know what I'm saying? Right.

116
00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:43.580
When I was on my side and I could see the ground,

117
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.180
I felt like I was right side up because as you're flipping the,

118
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.140
the force pushes you down in the seat. So you feel eternally, it, you feel, uh,

119
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:56.540
gravity all the time. Like you're, you know, as a car is flipping you're,

120
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.810
you're pushed into this seat.

121
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.170
So you feel GRA you feel weight of yourself in the seat that never changes.

122
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:04.650
You never kind of come map out of the seat, right? Like that, you know?

123
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.690
And so it is like somebody rolled a prop wall of grass up against the side of

124
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:11.290
the car and then against the roof and then against that side. And then that's,

125
00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:12.610
you know, it kept doing that and I'm like,

126
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.890
it's just the weirdest feeling and you feel completely safe, you know? Wow.

127
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.360
You feel like, you know, nothing's gonna harm me, but this, but,

128
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.560
and you know, this, you just, one of the things we always talk about is like,

129
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.760
get your hands, um,

130
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.960
onto to something because the spinning makes your arms just go like this.

131
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.880
And if you watch a lot of old wrecks from the sixties and seventies,

132
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.680
you'll see the guys' arms come flying out the window and they're just kind of

133
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:40.430
flopping around. They can, 't pull, it's spinning so fast.

134
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.790
You can't pull it in and uh, your arms will go like that.

135
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.630
So as soon as you know, you're going upside down,

136
00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:48.470
you grab the bottom of the steering wheel and just kind of, you know, watch.

137
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.303
But, um,

138
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.070
I flipped my pickup truck one time on Christmas day and I wasn't holding on the

139
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.390
steering wheel and my arm went out the window, you know,

140
00:07:58.391 --> 00:08:02.420
for like a split second. It banged around in the, in the, in the windows seal.

141
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.820
And I was like, man, you know,

142
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.900
I got it back in and grabbed a hold of the steering wheel with both my hands.

143
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.300
And so ever since then, I've like, you know,

144
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.780
now I know like anytime I'm in a crash, you gotta have your hands,

145
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.980
a hold of something. Cuz that's the one thing that you can't control.

146
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.010
You're strapped in with your seatbelt and everything. But your arms are,

147
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.810
you know, can go anywhere.

148
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.330
And in that moment when the car is rolling or barrel rolling or flipping you

149
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.250
it's so fast, like you can't your arms just go this way. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

150
00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:36.330
It's the craziest thing in the world. That's the only fear I guess,

151
00:08:36.331 --> 00:08:39.490
is that your arm could get outside the window and get crushed or something cuz

152
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.320
the guys have that happen. Yeah, I would imagine. Yeah.

153
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.040
How'd you flip when you were on Christmas? On Christmas day? My sister, uh,

154
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.880
she knows this. She just won't be news to her, but um, uh, it,

155
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.000
it's probably not fun for her to hear every time I tell it, but we,

156
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.440
I had a pickup truck with the tape deck in it and I had,

157
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.560
she got me that walk man CD with the adaptor,

158
00:09:02.561 --> 00:09:06.360
for the tape tape deck that you stick into you, you know,

159
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:11.000
you set adapter and she bought me the walk mancassette adapter and I'm in my I'm

160
00:09:11.001 --> 00:09:13.360
in, I'm in my truck. I got an extended cab, S 10.

161
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.550
I'm driving from my I house to my,

162
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.590
my Mamaw's house where fam reunion is my dad's there. Everybody's there.

163
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.590
The whole family's there, I'm a little late. Um,

164
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.030
and I'm driving down the road and I got to mess him with that walk man.

165
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.790
And I drove off into the ditch and I hit a driveway cul pipe drainage pipe in a

166
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.940
driveway and went like seven flips and destroyed this truck.

167
00:09:36.941 --> 00:09:40.660
And in the middle of the flipping, I remember that happening and everything,

168
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.460
all my change jacket, anything that was loose in the car,

169
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:46.900
ended up down in the one corner, like floorboard,

170
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.580
everything sort of collects into that one corner as it spinning. And uh,

171
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.290
it crushed the windshield down. The mirror was down into the rain. You know,

172
00:09:56.291 --> 00:09:59.330
it was, it crushed the roof down real bad. I was really lucky.

173
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.050
I had my hands on top of the steering wheel and the windshield kept slapping my

174
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:07.490
knuckles and knocked all my busted, all my knuckles real bad. And so then I,

175
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.490
I let go and my hands went this way.

176
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.930
And then I finally got 'em back in and grabbed the bottom of steering wheel.

177
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.080
It broke it, the tire were flip, you know, broken and busted off the,

178
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.000
the truck and this, I got outta the truck and I was fine.

179
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.480
Didn't have any injuries other than just the knuckles kind of being scraped up

180
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.320
this, this newly married couple, they just,

181
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.680
or either got engaged or just got married,

182
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.990
were driving the other way and saw the whole thing and stopped.

183
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.590
And uh, they were like, yeah, right. I'm like, yeah. And uh,

184
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.110
of course there's this line of cars behind me stopped on the road and this one

185
00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:49.310
lady pulls up and I was like, I need to borrow your cell phone to call my dad.

186
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.510
She's like, you're in shock. You need to sit down. I was like, no,

187
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.750
I'm not in shock. I just need to borrow myself, borrow your cell phone. So she,

188
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.500
so I walked in the next car &lt;laugh&gt; and got a cell phone from this person.

189
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.660
I called my dad and I was like, dad. I was like, man, I flipped my truck.

190
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.500
I had paid, I had got I'd financed this thing for five years.

191
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.500
I was paying a hundred dollars a month. It's perfect.

192
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.100
I was working at dealership, changing in oil, probably making $130 a week. And

193
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.290
I mean, just got this truck for probably 2, 2, 3 months and um,

194
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.050
used truck. But it was, it was good. It's junk. Uh,

195
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.170
I called dad and I'm like, man, he's gonna be mad.

196
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.330
Can't be too mad cuz I'm paying for the truck,

197
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.810
but he's gonna be mad at me cuz I'm screwing up family reunion and Christmas,

198
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:40.000
he comes to get me, uh I'd flip truck, real close to our where our farm was.

199
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.800
So he ran over to the farm and got this flatbed truck. And uh,

200
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.240
he pulls out there with the flatbed truck and he pulls up as soon as he pulls

201
00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:47.361
up,

202
00:11:47.361 --> 00:11:51.960
the state trooper pulls up and the state trooper guy and dad talked for a minute

203
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.840
and the guy state trooper's like, you know, one single car accident. You okay?

204
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:59.400
Yeah. Everybody's okay. Dad, dad, are you gonna put this on the flatb bed?

205
00:11:59.401 --> 00:12:01.680
Take it home. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You know, I ain't gonna,

206
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.760
I ain't gonna investigate or anything. Everything's cool.

207
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.320
Y'all just go about your business. So he left.

208
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.400
So he did us a solid there and uh, didn't gimme any kind of traffic ticket.

209
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.950
And so me and dad put the truck on &lt;affirmative&gt; the flatbed and we're driving

210
00:12:13.951 --> 00:12:16.990
back and he started laughing and I was like, man,

211
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.710
I expected you to be really mad cuz he was a, uh, fiery kind of dad, you know,

212
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:26.630
and, and uh, pulled a belt out and go to town, you know, be he was a rough,

213
00:12:26.631 --> 00:12:31.030
strict, tough, tough dude. And so I thought I was gonna get, um,

214
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.540
a good cussing at least, but he started laughing and I said, man,

215
00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:38.660
what's so funny. And he goes, I was 18 when this happened. He goes,

216
00:12:38.661 --> 00:12:42.660
when I was 18 years old, I flipped my car. He's like, I can't get mad.

217
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.100
He's like, it's just, I'm just glad you're not hurt. I'm like, that's nice.

218
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.540
So we drove back. I took a couple pictures of it and uh, got me,

219
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.660
got any insurance for it.

220
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:55.690
Got like 11 gram for the insurance to be able to buy another truck.

221
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.450
&lt;laugh&gt; so it all worked out. Yeah.
