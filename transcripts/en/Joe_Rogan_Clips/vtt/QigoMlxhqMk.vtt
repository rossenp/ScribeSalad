00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 1>Experience. Um, I have enjoyed your restaurant many times,</v>

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.440
my favorite steak restaurant in all of Los Angeles. Thank you. And, uh,

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.280
it's one of the reasons why I wanted to bring you in here because, uh,

5
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:16.240
this is a really crazy time for restaurants. And,

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.950
um, I, I mean, that's basically that that's the J of it.

7
00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:22.630
This is a crazy time it's it's.

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.630
<v 0>Bananas. It's absolutely crazy trying to just get a handle on it. It's just, uh,</v>

9
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:31.110
overwhelming. So for me, it's just head down and cook, try to help people,

10
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.310
you know, that are in need. And, uh, and then we'll figure it out later. Well.

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.790
<v 1>I know you've been doing a lot of cooking for first responders and for hospitals</v>

12
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:42.420
and like, what, what have you been doing with your time now that this is.

13
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.620
<v 0>Well, it really first started where, um, basically everything, just,</v>

14
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:51.860
everybody was just staring at each other and saying, what, what is going on,

15
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:53.940
what's happening? And I had,

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.860
I didn't lay off any of my employees and it's all happening.

17
00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:59.500
Everybody else is closing up shop. And, you know,

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.570
I'm just overwhelmed as a business owner. What am I gonna do?

19
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.330
And I actually had my GM come up to me and, you know,

20
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.010
cause I'm trying to figure it out. Everybody's asked what's gonna happen.

21
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.770
My GM came up to me and just says, Hey, listen, you know, we're with you. Um,

22
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.210
we know you didn't create the coronavirus, you know,

23
00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:20.130
you do what you have to do and we know your heart's in the right place

24
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.680
and was just like, I just like kind of just let out a breath. And I'm like,

25
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.880
okay, well I appreciate you saying that. And then I was just head down,

26
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.520
get down to business with it. And, um, um, we had a cut back, um,

27
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.640
90% of the staff and, uh, we were just like,

28
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.790
just cook, um, didn't know who we gonna was gonna buy it or anything,

29
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.230
or it was just crazy.

30
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.710
<v 1>So what'd you just tell her, but it's the, the steakhouse is called APL. Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:52.230
And it's in, uh, LA in what, what is that like the theater district?

32
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.070
What is that called? The.

33
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.470
<v 0>It's in the heart of Hollywood. Hollywood and vine. Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.150
And it's right next to Theus theater, which we,

35
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.510
and what's ironic was it was literally when they closed down all the restaurants

36
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.140
was the gonna be night of, uh, Hamilton, premiering,

37
00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:08.580
which is a big deal for us as a business. And, uh, you know,

38
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.340
all of a sudden it's like, it stops.

39
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.020
<v 1>Yeah. We, um, I went to your place right after we saw something.</v>

40
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.020
It was uh, oh, it was frozen &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Okay.

41
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.940
&lt;laugh&gt; I have daughters, right? Yeah. We went to see frozen.

42
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.290
And that was the last time I was at your place. Um, it's,

43
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.410
it's gotta be a very strange thing. This has never happened before.

44
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.370
And one of the things that we've talked about, uh,

45
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.130
a lot on this podcast is what's so devastating about this is there's a lot of

46
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:40.810
people that have lost lost businesses in the past because markets changed and

47
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:44.600
because maybe they didn't do what they could have done or were work as hard as

48
00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:45.420
they could have worked.

49
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.960
But for so many small businesses and restaurants and bars,

50
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.600
they've been doing the best work they've ever been able to do,

51
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.000
they they're putting in the hours, they're showing up,

52
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.840
they're putting out these, uh, amazing meals.

53
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.480
And then because of nothing, that's their fault.

54
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.520
It just gets shut off. It.

55
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520
<v 0>Just gets shut off. It's.</v>

56
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.353
<v 1>Crazy.</v>

57
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.160
And without any real understanding of how long it's gonna take or

58
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.120
when, when you're gonna, I mean, we just had a conversation. I was saying,

59
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:14.320
we should just talk about this on air.

60
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.200
Cause we're just talking in the green room. Yeah.

61
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.630
Like there's no clear indicate of when you'll be able to go back to work

62
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.750
and, and serve food to the general public and what that's gonna look like.

63
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.620
I know.

64
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.030
<v 0>It's, it's, it's the unknown. Um,</v>

65
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.390
but how I'm investing my time,

66
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.190
how a lot of other chef restaurant tours are investing their time is

67
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.710
trying to serve takeout to the public,

68
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.700
but also doing charitable and things to provide for fir first line, you know,

69
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:46.340
frontline, you know, defense. And one of the things is, is, you know,

70
00:03:46.341 --> 00:03:50.500
Jimmy Kim and I teamed up to, um, for every meal that we prepare,

71
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.820
we donate a meal to St. Joseph's center.

72
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.900
So that was the first thing was for our, our attitude was, is like,

73
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.730
we want to help people and let them know that they're cared about &lt;affirmative&gt;.

74
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.930
And then the other thing is to really just keep, um,

75
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.810
even just the five people working,

76
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.370
cuz we didn't even know if people were gonna order. So, um,

77
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.370
we jumped into it like that. And then these services such as, uh, uh,

78
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.290
frontline LA, which comes in and um,

79
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.800
brings is like the glue between us and the hospitals. And we,

80
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.080
we prepare meals for 150 meals at a time for the hospital workers.

81
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.720
<v 1>And do you guys package them up and then have them delivered to the hospitals?</v>

82
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.040
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. I mean, so we'll just sit there. They'll say, Hey,</v>

83
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.680
we have a need for this particular hospital, you know, um,

84
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.310
Hollywood Presbyterian. Okay, great. 150 people, we package up the meals.

85
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.391
<v 1>How do you do that?</v>

86
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:47.430
Do they order off a menu or do you just prepare stuff that you think that

87
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:48.230
they'll enjoy? We.

88
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.870
<v 0>Prepare, um, healthy things, things that they would appreciate.</v>

89
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.190
And then also sometimes they just serve comfort items.

90
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.710
So sometimes they'll do meatloaf gravy and mashed potatoes cuz you know,

91
00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.830
if they're just all healthy,

92
00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.380
sometimes they just need a little bit more of like a, you know,

93
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:03.380
warmth and like just kind of like pulling it.

94
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.540
<v 1>That's a weird word, comfort food, you know it is,</v>

95
00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:08.540
but that's what's happening now. It makes, but it works like the comfort.

96
00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:11.220
Like when you say macaroni and cheese comfort food. Yeah. It is.

97
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.700
<v 0>That's what people are gravitating towards. That's where my menu is right now.</v>

98
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:17.100
It's all comfort food and barbecue. Really.

99
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.380
<v 1>Yeah. So do you do, is that because that's what people are asking for? Well,</v>

100
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.410
that's, that's, Cook's stakes, right?

101
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.490
<v 0>That's my read on the market. You know,</v>

102
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.330
I had experienced a similar thing where things shut down and uh,

103
00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:33.530
people needed help and that was around, you know, during nine 11 and you know,

104
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.050
our attitude was is like, how can we help people those, you know,

105
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:37.970
those in need and,

106
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.130
and really comfort food really kind of just blossomed outta that.

107
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.880
<v 1>So, so when you are doing right, so you're doing takeout as well.</v>

108
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.440
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and how does that work?

109
00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:51.600
Do they order online or do they call up like how how's that working? Like.

110
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.120
<v 0>We prefer curbside, um, as opposed to just doing Postmates and GrubHub,</v>

111
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.280
you know, people can do that. And so we'll get people to come deliver. Yeah.

112
00:05:58.281 --> 00:05:58.680
Let's get.

113
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.000
<v 1>To that because how does that work, Postmates and GrubHub,</v>

114
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.280
is that good for your business? Is that,

115
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.200
is it less good than people ordering directly from you? Like how does that.

116
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.841
<v 0>Work? Well,</v>

117
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:13.160
it's great for our business cuz it gives us a greater range and we really can't

118
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:16.160
deliver. So it gives us an opportunity. So it's a whole nother market,

119
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.310
but you know, they charge a backend fee on it. So we have to upcharge it a bit.

120
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.390
And you know,

121
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.910
for us we'd prefer just to kind of sell directly to the customer curbside,

122
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:28.870
which we're doing a good clip up to. It's probably about half and half.

123
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.190
<v 1>So like what if you had to guess like what's the capacity is as part</v>

124
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.260
is like for your business is like full on wide open

125
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:43.380
where people can come and sit down versus now, like how much is it deteriorated?

126
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.890
Oh.

127
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.940
<v 0>It's it's maybe 10,</v>

128
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:50.340
15% of the business compared to yeah.

129
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.140
And that's so that's why I'm just focusing on, like I just gotta keep moving.

130
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.580
That's how I'm emotionally getting through this thing.

131
00:06:56.581 --> 00:07:00.970
And also keeping the business going is just basically just cook for people that

132
00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:03.890
are in need, you know, focus on the hospitals and then,

133
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.290
and the neighborhood just right around us. So it's a tough spot.

134
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.170
<v 1>And you have,</v>

135
00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:12.450
obviously you have a lot of friends that are in the restaurant business.

136
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.610
And so what is you talk all the time? What's the general feeling like what is,

137
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.480
uh, what's the, the temperature, like how how's everybody dealing with this?

138
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.920
<v 0>You know, first of all,</v>

139
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:28.160
knowing that a good number of us are not gonna be around, um,

140
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.680
because just even figuring out all the rules and the laws that are gonna happen

141
00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:34.400
around this thing or unfolding,

142
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:37.240
they're just very hard to read and get a clear understanding of what's

143
00:07:37.241 --> 00:07:41.830
happening. So a lot of people just don't know the unknown, um, you know,

144
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.750
landlords, you know, we're deferring rent, but at the same time, you know,

145
00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:47.750
they're not accepting of that.

146
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.830
So we're like on the hook and we don't even really know where we're gonna end up

147
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:55.750
with it. Even just the P PPP loans. Um, uh,

148
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.270
only what is PPP,

149
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.780
it's the paycheck protection pro Ram and that's really a government funded, um,

150
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.300
assistance to supply restaurants and all businesses.

151
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.780
I think of all the loans given out,

152
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.740
I think only 5% of all the loans given out were actually to restaurants.

153
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.660
So, um, they give, they give you a chunk of money,

154
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.380
essentially that covers eight weeks of payroll.

155
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.450
And also a portion of that for uh, 20 that's,

156
00:08:24.451 --> 00:08:27.530
75% has to be spent on payroll covers for eight weeks.

157
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.810
And then the other 25% is for rent and utilities.

158
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.650
So it's like an eight week li lifeline. So.

159
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.730
<v 1>And so far, how long has it been now?</v>

160
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.600
We're looking at like six weeks of lockdown so far or something like that. Like.

161
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.880
<v 0>It feels like longer. It's gotta be a little bit longer.</v>

162
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.400
Like for me mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it feels, it,

163
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:50.360
it probably is that I don't even have a, a concept of time I'm working so hard.

164
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.480
It's just me and four other people and two are in the front and two with me in

165
00:08:54.481 --> 00:08:57.040
the kitchen, we're doing dishes, we're cooking, we're cleaning,

166
00:08:57.041 --> 00:09:00.640
we're doing everything. I mean, it's a great sense of, you know, with, you know,

167
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.360
accomplishment. And like, I got a, uh,

168
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.200
an email from a nurse thanking us for the healthy meal that we prepared for them

169
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:11.080
and that makes it worth it. But you know, like for me,

170
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.280
I'm actually like inspired and just kicking it into high gear.

171
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.070
I gonna like just wall in it. I'm just gonna keep working, head down,

172
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.550
do what I do and just hope at the end of the day, at the end day,

173
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:25.470
people have to eat. So the world's gonna be different, you know,

174
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.910
probably not gonna be the same at all in terms of, for my business. But what,

175
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.870
what choice do I have?

176
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.270
<v 1>Right. You want one of these man, so yeah, sure. Till cliff CBD drink delicious.</v>

177
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.020
Oh yeah.

178
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.060
<v 0>Hang on. Nice.</v>

179
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.660
<v 1>Sorry for people listening to me slur. I like that. Um, so</v>

180
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:48.780
when you're operating at 10% capacity, obviously this is not sustainable.

181
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.100
10% of your business is not sustainable. That's right.

182
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.970
Just because operating costs and all the above. And then you're,

183
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:57.770
you're obviously in a very high profile area,

184
00:09:57.771 --> 00:10:00.210
which must be extraordinary rent too. Yeah.

185
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.970
<v 0>Um, we're just not paying the rent, you know, we're just pushing it off.</v>

186
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.930
We can't, we don't have the money for it, so we'll have to work it out.

187
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.240
<v 2>Okay.</v>
