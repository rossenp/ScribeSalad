00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience who goes in there?</v>

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.850
<v 1>Well, people are liking me. Clint, Eastwood's gone. He's not really a member.</v>

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.803
Look.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.390
<v 2>Look, is it fun? Look, it's.</v>

5
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.780
<v 1>2,700 Acres. It was shut up by mark Twain.</v>

6
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.180
And it was a liberal deal for like hookers and engages and just everything else.

7
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:21.014
Just big.

8
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.770
<v 3>What'd you say [inaudible] gate. Okay, dude. So no.</v>

9
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.740
<v 1>I'm saying, if you go back to like the 1870s, when mark Twain set up,</v>

10
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:30.950
it was classically liberal, it was partying. It was there on 27 acres.

11
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:34.910
It was saloons. They brought in female hookers. There was gay guys in there,

12
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:35.930
everything. It was just,

13
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.480
it was Bahamian groves where they call it that cause people do whatever they

14
00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:39.410
wanted and it was, it was,

15
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.200
it was open and they had like poetry and they had plays and the,

16
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.130
all the rest of it, then by the time of Howard Taft became president,

17
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.810
the Republicans basically bought it.

18
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.290
So the reason it's important is the Republicans go there too.

19
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:54.410
Like they ship in all of these private hookers, all these jets land nearby,

20
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.360
but they also have a lot of gay sex,

21
00:00:56.361 --> 00:01:00.110
which they use them to basically compromise people into the cult.

22
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.770
And so there's a lot of gay sex. How do you know this? Uh,

23
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.140
it came out of news articles. No one ever got footage of it.

24
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:08.990
I was in there for one day. I snuck in at people. I looked good back down.

25
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:12.470
They hit on me a lot. I had like people I recognize from TV Walker. Right?

26
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.430
Let's go right now. I mean, it's a big gay hookup deal for Republicans.

27
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:19.370
I'm just telling you where it is. And then, and then they've got this,

28
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.830
this ritual, that's only the feeder group.

29
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.710
So I'm sitting there during the ritual and I'm going, Hey, this is pretty cool.

30
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.770
And she go shut up. I'll kill you. And they're all taking it very seriously.

31
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:29.930
And I'm not saying it's a gay thing. I'm saying something that you.

32
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.360
<v 3>Were saying it was cool. And people were getting angry that you were saying.</v>

33
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.460
<v 1>No, I mean, I was just quietly going, oh, this is really interesting.</v>

34
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.590
And I'm like, shut off. This is a very important ritual.

35
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.240
And they were taking it very serious.

36
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:41.210
As hers comes in with the body of a child that is an effigy.

37
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.770
They're not just a bundle of sticks. Right? Well, it looks like a kid later,

38
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.280
others infiltrated later that worked there and got his photos of it's image of a

39
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:51.380
kid. It's a little kid. Cause Molokini.

40
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.100
<v 2>In, in, in biblical is who they sacrifice the Canaanites bull.</v>

41
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:58.790
But they do it as an owl, but it calls an Aliya. But that's from the Bible.

42
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.970
As you would sacrifice a child to give not your children to the fires of mullet.

43
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.320
And.

44
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.770
<v 1>So I've, I've given it to experts in religious history. It's not even, you know,</v>

45
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:09.530
from Christian perspective, it's a foul,

46
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:13.630
Stijn deal mixed with Babylonian and religious stuff from,

47
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.520
yeah. It's quick. Look at that. Look at that.

48
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.930
<v 3>Owl God and look at the fire underneath. Yeah. And there's Ronald Reagan. I.</v>

49
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.711
<v 2>Mean, if you saw that,</v>

50
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:24.830
if you were in the woods and you just saw that you would be terrified.

51
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.390
<v 1>And Richard Nixon said,</v>

52
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.380
Richard Nixon on the Richard Nixon tape says it's a gay orgy.

53
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.430
Richard Nixon said they could pull up. Richard Nixon talks about, yeah.

54
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.390
<v 2>Richard Nixon said something about it where he most faggy thing you've ever</v>

55
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.060
seen. I think it's, I think it's just allowing.

56
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.740
<v 1>Not that it gets gets what, a thing. I think it's.</v>

57
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.540
<v 2>Guys that aren't gay that are, that are,</v>

58
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.540
that engage them in the acts in the woods.

59
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.900
And then they have something on each other similar to Epstein's island.

60
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.410
<v 1>Where it's, that's what, it's a rich, it's a, it's a,</v>

61
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.760
it's like a fraternity doing that. You got to scrub.

62
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.400
<v 2>Pause it. Hold on a second. What is this here? They don't allow women. No,</v>

63
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:04.030
it says.

64
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.400
<v 3>Founded 1872 by a group of male.</v>

65
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.250
That's the context that YouTube talking about Bohemian Grove.

66
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:13.210
This is the title of the video I told you founded 18 Richard Nixon Grove.

67
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.530
Most faggy, thing he could ever imagine. Yeah. Yes.

68
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.220
Play it a hundred percent. Play it. I want to hear the Nixon tapes. Yeah.

69
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.143
Let me hear this.

70
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.153
<v 4>[Inaudible] California.</v>

71
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.920
[inaudible] class is that way. [inaudible]

72
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.723
[inaudible].

73
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.500
<v 3>Let's go. Crowd goes in there. It's just terrible. Okay. So.</v>

74
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.740
<v 2>We are, did the owl and the, uh, it's interesting in it.</v>

75
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.040
I don't know how seriously they take it. I mean, that's a real question, right?

76
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.190
<v 1>I mean the whole gate things are side issue, right? The point is,</v>

77
00:04:04.191 --> 00:04:08.240
is that I've talked to people that, I mean, according to Ted Gunderson,

78
00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:11.180
first time I ever heard about this was from this former high-level FBI agent who

79
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:13.490
was with the FBI director, but he wouldn't go along with corruption.

80
00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:15.880
So he wasn't it's on record Gunnerson, almost picking up that record.

81
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.400
He blew up.

82
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.990
<v 2>Like the things like the Franklin scandal.</v>

83
00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.600
And he's been a he's a finders and the [inaudible], which was huge, which would

84
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.600
, the CIA was caught trafficking. The, you know, the finders is a cult. It

85
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.433
 was called trafficking children. And the CIA squashed the Florida.

86
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.600
<v 1>A and the Gunderson got it raided in, in DC.</v>

87
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.240
And it's not a whole CIA facility with a snuff films.

88
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.250
<v 2>Every relax machine. So he told me.</v>

89
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.590
<v 1>About all this and I thought he was crazy. Even.</v>

90
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.630
<v 3>Though he was Ted Gunderson, you told us about it.</v>

91
00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:45.020
And we actually pulled up one of those stories and I was correct. Yes,

92
00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:47.000
you're correct. Yes. Thank you. So.

93
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.220
<v 1>Ted Gunderson is the reason I know about this. And he said,</v>

94
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.240
he said that they get people interested with, with, with that ritual.

95
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.820
Most there's like 2000 members that bring about a thousand guests.

96
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.730
Not everybody can bring a guest. I want the head of each Canterbury, a guest.

97
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.340
Most of them are nice clinics. What goes there? You know,

98
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.680
Kenny Glover goes there, but it's an all male.

99
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.930
<v 3>Deal. Who's the other one? Danny Glover. Oh, Danny Glover.</v>

100
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.740
<v 1>Has mentioned who's the weapon, Danny glass on there. How the is he in there?</v>

101
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.310
<v 2>They probably liked them from the most a fun guy. I saw him when I was there.</v>

102
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.660
I saw Danny. Interesting.

103
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.210
I'm starting to believe this is not I'm sorta believe we can get it.

104
00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:18.530
I'm sorta believe it's not that Joe.

105
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.270
<v 1>Rogan they'd have him in immediately. I mean,</v>

106
00:05:20.271 --> 00:05:24.080
not now do a podcast in front of the owl. Hmm.

107
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.810
But I just want to say that overall,

108
00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:30.980
I started out as a truly artsy liberal thing that I think is good.

109
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.730
I think guys deserve to go off to the woods. Like we've done since humans,

110
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.560
humans, and partying and whatever. Right. And so, and so,

111
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.180
but the thing is then the weird skull.

112
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.880
Here's what happened about 1900 skull and bones.

113
00:05:43.881 --> 00:05:47.900
That was at a Yale in new Haven, Connecticut. That was a German death cult.

114
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.730
It took over Bohemian Grove.

115
00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:52.100
And that's when they shut up that as the central deal.

116
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.710
So it's this big inviting fun party. What happens.

117
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.790
<v 3>Is going bones.</v>

118
00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.050
Cause that's one of other rumors about scoping boss minimize you.

119
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.950
I know they compromise you so that you were always a part of this organization.

120
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.570
<v 1>Before he died. I did multiple interviews with Anthony Sutton,</v>

121
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.680
the top congressional advisor to Senator Frank Church.

122
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.440
And we only know about Sutton because Charlotte is Herby whose father was high

123
00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:20.740
level still. And bones gave him all of their internal manuals.

124
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.120
And she's been a frequent guy. She's retired, America's secret establishment.

125
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.200
<v 3>And an introduction to the order of skull and bones. Yes. Okay. And so.</v>

126
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.290
<v 1>This is, this is a Russell trust, uh,</v>

127
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.850
true Illuminati Illuminati set up 1776 to counter our revolution by Adam

128
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.540
Hobbit funds, the Jacobins, it funds the French revolution. It's the,

129
00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:43.360
it's the opposite of a true egalitarian open liberal revolution.

130
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.940
It's the leftist always say that the liberal,

131
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.140
liberal and leftist are two different deals. Leftist is left-hand past Satanism.

132
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.110
Liberalism is a galitary and open society, true liberalism.

133
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.090
And so the left-hand path set this up and then they wanted,

134
00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.500
they sent all this opium money.

135
00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:04.360
They had over in 1831 to Yale to

136
00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:07.420
set up a German secret society of the Illuminati,

137
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.030
which then has become one of the dominant secret societies.

138
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:14.350
And in there that you actually say tannic rituals, they get in a coffins. Uh,

139
00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:17.170
they, they, they do simulated human sacrifices.

140
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.310
They have gay sex as part of the ritual. They, they, they bathe in, uh,

141
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.490
huge facilities of feces. Uh, this was,

142
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.670
this was a made by Robert de Niro made a movie.

143
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.760
<v 2>Skull and bones. They're doing that stuff now. Absolutely.</v>

144
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.230
<v 1>I don't mind broke into it, but wow.</v>

145
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.080
<v 2>Who's the, how can this be proven?</v>

146
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.840
<v 1>Well, Matt Damon made a movie called the good shepherd, I think. Yes. And,</v>

147
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:41.860
and in that it's Robert DeNiro directed it. Okay.

148
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.920
And that's super accurate where it's got the sword and the dabble and they're in

149
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.600
there in these big vats of Calvin.

150
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.800
<v 2>They did leak a Facebook of photo album of a bunch of skull and bones,</v>

151
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.720
kids hand on a deer island. It kind of looked like losers. I know,

152
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.710
I know they're not, but they kind of looked like loose. I mean,

153
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:58.990
it was kind of like a barrel billionaires look like losers.

154
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.440
They look like it may. You were like, these are the, these are the Illuminati.

155
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.590
<v 1>It was kind of like, oh, I totally agree with you. Yeah. For ABC news,</v>

156
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.100
because they wanted to get Bush in trouble right before the 2004 election,

157
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.500
another frat was able to,

158
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.410
because they're all doing this crap shoot video down into it,

159
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.470
where they're going devil equals death, Satan. And they had girls.

160
00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:21.130
They finally brought it into the membership who was all boys before sacrificing.

161
00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:24.340
So of course it's idiotic, it's training wheels for what they do.

162
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.640
But inside they go grave, Rob, they've got Geronimo street. Yeah.

163
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.670
<v 2>The George H w Bush stole, supposedly stole Geronimo skull.</v>

164
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.190
You got to do things like, I don't know if that, but that's a route.

165
00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:35.770
That's a legend rumor. Well.

166
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.750
<v 1>I it's been broken into I one time the police went in there, but the point is,</v>

167
00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:44.170
is that skull and bones order 3, 2,

168
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.630
2 is the Illuminati Germanic death called that.

169
00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:50.230
Now set up chapters all over the U S and it took over Bahamian Grove around

170
00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:54.520
1900. And so that's why Bohemian Grove is still this artisan, you know,

171
00:08:54.521 --> 00:08:55.860
deal of artist.

172
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.390
But then it got co-opted by the Republican party and sculling boats and Helmut

173
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:04.230
Schmidt, German chancellor wrote men and powers a political retrospect.

174
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.560
What he retired in the late eighties saying,

175
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:11.640
I love our Illuminati rituals that we have in Germany and our own sacred groves.

176
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.180
But I think they've taken it to a new level with skull and bones at Bohemian

177
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:16.710
Grove. And I really enjoyed the time we have there.

178
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.530
<v 2>So these are just these elite institutions where it's,</v>

179
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.720
I think they seek to like create a close friends amongst people that may not

180
00:09:26.721 --> 00:09:29.790
know each other, create loyalty amongst this group of people.

181
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.670
They've got to tell them all the things that you gotta tell them,

182
00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.020
all the sexual history, all that stuff.

183
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.840
They want these people to be loyal to each other. So when they,

184
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.990
they're not loyal to the laws of America, they're loyal to this,

185
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.420
this oath that they take with each other, and exactly.

186
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.770
<v 1>Like the team America.</v>

187
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.320
<v 3>Yep. Descendants Sue's skull and bones overdrawn.</v>

188
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.510
Those bones documents show George H. Bush and George W. Bush, his grandfather,

189
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:54.680
Rob Geronimo's grave members, uh, members of the secret society,

190
00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:58.790
allegedly steal valuable things and put them in tomb. Great.

191
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.640
Grandson says Jeronimo should be burned,

192
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.620
buried in accordance with the tradition.

193
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.150
Federal law protects native Americans rights to their family members remains.

194
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.240
<v 1>And let's expand on that. What he just said, there's this guy's done.</v>

195
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.680
He's studying. It's like, it's like a team America. When the head guy goes,

196
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.790
the only person who's ever said, no, no, nobody says he goes, suck. My, Gary.

197
00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:23.600
It's not about sex in skull and bones and Bohemian Grove.

198
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.470
What he said is most of these guys are not gay. It's an act of dominance. Like,

199
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.020
oh, you're a Senator. You want to be president bend over.

200
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:33.140
And like a former president screws you in the. And that's what they do. I mean,

201
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.500
the ritual is I'm in charge, bend over. Well.

202
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.850
<v 3>Isn't that a thing with fraternities anyway, like hazing is on a cracker.</v>

203
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:41.390
Exactly.

204
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.460
<v 1>You know, what's the next deal. Yeah. But most people.</v>

205
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.100
<v 2>Are fraternity. I mean, these are the top kids.</v>

206
00:10:46.101 --> 00:10:49.220
These are kids that they think are going to occupy leadership positions.

207
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.780
<v 1>In the world and often do often do, let me give you an example.</v>

208
00:10:53.781 --> 00:10:57.150
Even Jon Ronson saw the photo of me when we snuck into and Grove. Yeah. And,

209
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.270
and they had it hanging in and people said, why don't get a video?

210
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.660
I have a camera hidden right here. It's Henry Kissinger, Ben,

211
00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:06.530
over in a woman's dress, sticking his fingers in his. Bill Clinton in a.

212
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.810
<v 2>Blue dress with Jeff in Jeffrey Epstein's house.</v>

213
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.850
<v 3>Yeah. But that's just an artist's rendition. Do you know that?</v>

214
00:11:10.851 --> 00:11:12.650
That was just an artist. Maybe.

215
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.460
<v 1>This was an artist rendition we're in a clubhouse Ronson wrote about this. Oh,</v>

216
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.990
suit. It's a photo or it, it like a photo, but let's just say it's a painting.

217
00:11:20.991 --> 00:11:24.920
I don't know. I wasn't mean it's ancient memory 20 years ago, 20 plus, you know,

218
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.160
but I mean, Ron says like, look at that. I'm like, oh, is that Kissinger? Yeah.

219
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.010
And it's Kissinger. It's all about being improper.

220
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.880
And then they all go get caught to compromise each other, to be in the club,

221
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:35.900
right. To hazing so.

222
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.500
<v 3>That they can trust each other. Cause they're all doing. Yes. Even if it's.</v>

223
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.230
<v 2>An artist's rendition. Why is Jeffrey Epstein having in his townhouse?</v>

224
00:11:42.231 --> 00:11:45.440
A picture of the president in a blue dress because the president.

225
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.090
<v 3>Flew in his that's what.</v>

226
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.070
<v 1>I that's what I mean. Yeah. And by the way,</v>

227
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:54.010
his name Maxwell is now come out in court is getting no attention. Okay.

228
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:57.520
Clinton did fly to that island that broke four days ago. It's gotten zero.

229
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.563
<v 2>Tips. They're not paying,</v>

230
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.270
they're not paying it till we haven't heard anything other than those court

231
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:02.110
documents that just came.

232
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.320
<v 1>Out. And I told you, listen, guys, it's not like, I'm even that special.</v>

233
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.640
My mom's brother was a famous helicopter pilot in Vietnam,

234
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.360
running black ops into Laos and Cambodia and stuff. And then he,

235
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.720
I shouldn't tell these stories, but no one's ever heard this stuff.

236
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.810
But you know, I remember growing up, him telling me this stuff and it was,

237
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:22.810
it was true. Like they were like, I'm not going to do it.

238
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.420
No problem. I just can't do it. What's the danger. You said so much. Uh, well,

239
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.980
I mean, let's just say he took the fall for something that was going on.

240
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.160
He didn't get in trouble for it. He got promoted and he was involved in Iran,

241
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:36.670
Contra.

242
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.900
<v 2>And that's how people get promoted.</v>

243
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:41.170
They fell upward by taking a lot of times to blame for something.

244
00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:43.090
Or this is that's like.

245
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.410
<v 1>I grew up. I mean, I grew up not just him, but other family, you know, that was,</v>

246
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.940
it. Wasn't like something special, you know?

247
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.670
But those Navy seal guys got a security, done, a bunch of crazy stuff.

248
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.510
That's what our military does. It's not what you hear on the news. And, and,

249
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.350
and it it's just completely out of control stuff. Right. And I mean,

250
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:01.980
my uncle told me, he said, he said, yeah, I don't.

251
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.680
I got out of working for these groups and everything. Uh, as you know,

252
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:07.920
an army officer that was sheep dip, he wasn't there. We went there.

253
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.960
He wasn't wearing an army uniform. He was, yeah. We were talking,

254
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.430
high-level talking, running the real stuff, like special ops. He was in charge.

255
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.230
He'd like to command basic Guatemala city. Right?

256
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.750
Cause he was like a top Morse code guy. Of course he had satellites,

257
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.250
but nobody could read the sports code coded.

258
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.190
So he was sending stuff to the white house Moore's coat. Like he was like,

259
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.130
when he was a kid, he was a champion wars killer. So he wasn't just in command.

260
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:29.440
He was like running all the stuff. And uh,

261
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.890
he just said I had to do it because he said it was kids being smuggled out of

262
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:36.190
orphanages by the CIA for sex option. DC.

263
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.050
Jesus told me that. He told me that when he was dying of pneumonia, Jesus.

264
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.170
<v 2>No. What is it with kids? Why Selena compromised people? It's the.</v>

265
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.680
<v 1>It's the energy to, I mean, if somebody will hurt kids,</v>

266
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.270
if somebody will hurt kids, they'll.

267
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.103
<v 3>Do anything.</v>

268
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.380
Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.

269
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.500
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

It'll also be free. That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much.

274
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:16.380
Buh-bye.
