00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.300
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And today's podcast.</v>

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.240
<v 1>Okay. Today's podcast. So first of all, um, you can reach it now.</v>

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.140
And I finally got a website which is Eric weinstein.org.

4
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.870
And, um, I told you that we have to leave this planet and that

5
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.280
it's hard not to laugh. Sorry. It's just hard not to laugh, but you're serious.

6
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.710
I'm deadly leave this planet. We have to leave this planet. Why,

7
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.270
why do we have to, well, because we can't all be.

8
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.220
<v 2>As planned as the best beaches as.</v>

9
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.220
<v 1>This planet. It's China, Russia, Iran,</v>

10
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:42.620
and the United States under ridiculous leadership.

11
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.510
There's lots of reasons why we have to leave this planet.

12
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.420
We're not good stewards. We're not wise enough to stay on this planet.

13
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:49.400
We're too powerful. We went through this. And by the way,

14
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:53.210
you pointed out this quote, which is, we are now God's, but for the wisdom,

15
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.820
and that became a meme. So that was very interesting.

16
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.260
Uh, I, I gave these lectures, um, I think in 2013.

17
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.710
<v 2>Best quotes ever.</v>

18
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:09.510
Isn't it don't know at Oxford who originated that

19
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:13.530
quote. It was me. That was you. Yeah.

20
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.723
When did you say it.

21
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.020
<v 1>On your program? What day?</v>

22
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.460
<v 2>Which one? Do you remember? Which one? You've probably turned into a clip.</v>

23
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.353
I'm trying to think about,

24
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.410
because it just came off my tongue and you it's one of those ones where I'll

25
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:29.100
drive down the street and it'll pop in my head. You're like the nicest person.

26
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.590
No, no, no. It's, it's a, it's a fantastic quote, but it's so right.

27
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.950
It's like every now and then someone can get the whole thing in a sentence.

28
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.680
We now gods, but for the wisdom.

29
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.060
<v 1>So that's why we have to get off this planet diversify because there too many</v>

30
00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:51.380
people have God-like powers like Donald Trump commands a tremendous amount of

31
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.420
godlike power. Thanks to our physics community.

32
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.720
<v 2>Well, has ratings. See how hard they are.</v>

33
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.140
Just stay on focus. Sorry. Okay. Okay.

34
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.530
So be just too much godlike power, right?

35
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.780
<v 1>So the best hope that I can come up and it's a slim one is is that if we could</v>

36
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:15.380
figure out what goes beyond Einstein's theory,

37
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.590
the Einsteinian speed limit might be bendable or breakable because we would be

38
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:23.450
in a framework that was larger than Einstein's.

39
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:27.290
People often interpret this as what they call FTL or faster than light travel.

40
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.210
But that's not what I mean necessarily.

41
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:34.070
What I mean is is that the underlying source code gives us opportunities that we

42
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:38.540
don't normally have. So seven years ago, I tried to release,

43
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.640
I tried giving these lectures at Oxford,

44
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:44.960
which is probably the university that is spiritually closest to what I care

45
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:48.170
about because they care about geometry and physics and they interrelationship,

46
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.320
and they've kept the face with faith with that tradition through people like

47
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:53.150
Roger Penrose and Michael [inaudible]. And, um,

48
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.150
 I released this theory of geometric unity, um,

49
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.150
 or rather I released the video of the lecture that introduces this theory. So this was the first time since 19 83, 84. 

50
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.150
Um,  that I talked in public when I started this, uh,  program, uh,

51
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.150
 when I was 18, 19, something like that. Um,

52
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.983
 and I just released the video today on our YouTube channel. Um.

53
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.840
<v 2>And it's the video of you giving this discussion? Yeah, so it's.</v>

54
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.860
<v 1>Introduced by professor Marcus DeSoto who has, uh, Richard Dawkins,</v>

55
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.190
old job as the somone professor for the public understanding of science.

56
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.530
And he just, he met me in a bar and he got me a little drunk and he said, okay,

57
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:49.450
what are you really working on? And I told him, and at first it sounded crazy.

58
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:53.770
And then he started thinking about it and he asked me more questions.

59
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.810
And he brought me over to Oxford. He got me an appointment,

60
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:57.220
had me talk to their experts.

61
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.700
And then he decided that he wanted me to give these what he called special

62
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.983
somone lectures.

63
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.430
And they are an attempt to go beyond Einstein,

64
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.410
to look for a unified theory of physics between the two major

65
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:16.240
branches that have resisted unification. Now that's usually in the modern era,

66
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.780
confused with the idea of quantizing gravity, but the quantum,

67
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.760
the quantum gravity imperative is a, um,

68
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.350
it's a political program that comes out of what would have been the quantum

69
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:32.050
field theory community before it became the string theory community,

70
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.280
which the idea is we have to take Einstein and make him submit to the will of

71
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.390
bore. And I don't think it's exactly like that. They don't,

72
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.080
I think they got it wildly wrong and they synchronize themselves and sort of

73
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.170
took the field off the cliff and they weren't able to ship a product.

74
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.210
They couldn't deliver on any of this promise.

75
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.090
And so when I saw that they were about to go off a cliff, I switched fields, uh,

76
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.010
as an undergraduate into mathematics.

77
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.450
And I used mathematics as a stalking horse to study the same sort of underlying

78
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:04.480
structures, but not to get swept up in the politics of physics.

79
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.930
And I had this theory, uh,

80
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.320
which I can now talk about for the first time in like 37 years or whatever it

81
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:12.154
is.

82
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.900
And like today's the first day that I'm sort of free because I've kept this to

83
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.760
myself. So if you want it any question about geometric unity.

84
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.120
<v 2>But why, why did you keep this to yourself? Cause I don't trust these people.</v>

85
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.180
You don't trust these people in the same.

86
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.480
Like I know there was some people that had written some article it wasn't Sean,

87
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.703
correct. It doesn't matter.

88
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.300
<v 1>If it's not them. It's a,</v>

89
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.080
it's an entire system that believes in peer review at it believes in four

90
00:05:36.081 --> 00:05:37.910
citations, you have to be at a university,

91
00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:42.020
you have to get an endorsement to use that preprint server. Um,

92
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.870
it's too few resources, too many sharp elbows.

93
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.820
<v 2>Do you think that there's, there's a logic to that method? No,</v>

94
00:05:49.821 --> 00:05:54.110
I think to preserve it from charlatans and you have to do crackpots that are,

95
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.490
yeah. That just want to publish stories. So this way you have to be sponsored,

96
00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.470
it makes sense, right?

97
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.490
<v 1>Yes. But doing whatever mistakes I'm making,</v>

98
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.220
[inaudible] I'm wrong about it, but this theory that's just fine. Um,

99
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.430
I'll find out that I'm wrong. Give me the layman's version of the theory.

100
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.050
All right. First time ever. Yeah. Um,

101
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.030
do you know that let's start off with Asher's drawing hands.

102
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.240
So do you, Jamie, do you have a picture for that?

103
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.500
The key problem that we have in a fundamental theory that people don't think

104
00:06:29.501 --> 00:06:33.760
about is not why is there something rather than nothing?

105
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.650
I don't think we can answer that. It's why is there so much that is,

106
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.340
that is rich out of almost nothing.

107
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.870
And so this issue shows that if you had a piece of paper,

108
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.180
could you will into being the hands, holding pens,

109
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.460
using ink to draw each other, right.

110
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.190
That problem is akin to the problem that we face in a fundamental theory.

111
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.870
If you had the canvas,

112
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:05.620
how would the canvas bring all of the richness that you see around you into

113
00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:09.760
being? And what I did was I said, okay,

114
00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:12.640
we have to go below Weinstein. So we have four degrees of freedom,

115
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:16.930
but they're not yet space and time it's prodo space time. But before,

116
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.410
and then I said, okay,

117
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.780
that those four degrees of freedom are like the stands in a

118
00:07:25.781 --> 00:07:29.560
stadium in the stands somehow need to build the pitch.

119
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.660
And the pitch is a 14 dimensional space.

120
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.190
So if let's imagine, um, that you had,

121
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.870
uh, okay, we have got four objects here, right?

122
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.620
So the four degrees of freedom correspondent for objects,

123
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.240
then we need a ruler to measure how much of each of these four objects we have.

124
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.790
So that would be four additional variables.

125
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.360
And then you have angles cause length and angle is what Einstein gave us in

126
00:07:58.361 --> 00:07:59.194
space time.

127
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.830
So the angles between any two objects are the same as the reverse of the angle.

128
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.980
So then you can count it up in there, six angles to be hat.

129
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.170
So there's four degrees of freedom,

130
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.880
plus four rulers plus six protractors, which is 14.

131
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.890
So there's a 14 dimensional auxiliary space. And in my estimation,

132
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.690
you and I are in some ways potentially having this conversation in a 14

133
00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:26.830
dimensional world that we perceive back in the stands,

134
00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:30.520
rather than on the pitch as a four dimensional conversation,

135
00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:33.430
that is we're in a three-dimensional room going forward in time.

136
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:34.901
So I've called this,

137
00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:39.760
the observation and the observation is two spaces rather

138
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:41.890
than Einstein's one space. Can I.

139
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.560
<v 2>Stop you right there? Sure. Why 14 dimensions?</v>

140
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.930
<v 1>Because I'm saying that the fields that is the stuff</v>

141
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.880
is dancing, not mostly on the four dimensions that we think we,

142
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.600
but it's also dancing on the rulers and the protractors. So in other words,

143
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:02.130
if I have X, Y, and Z,

144
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:05.400
I need rulers in the X direction of the Y the direction of the Z to measure

145
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:09.090
things. And I need a watch, which would be like a ruler in the time direct.

146
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.310
So those four rulers are in fact in play as well. And the,

147
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.570
the protractors because of like a space-time is four degrees of freedom plus

148
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:19.770
rulers. And protractors,

149
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.440
I'm saying work over the space of all rulers and all protractors as part of

150
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:27.660
where these particles and fields can dance.

151
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.130
So the rulers and the protractors are part of the system,

152
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.480
not just a choice of particular rulers and particular protractors.

153
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.080
So by choosing particular rulers in particular,

154
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:44.820
protractors Einstein is grabbing a tiny filament of the space of all

155
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:48.150
possible rulers. And protractors. So in, in effect,

156
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.070
space-time has recovered as the act of the observation contemplating itself.

157
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.541
That's a little bit poetic,

158
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:58.200
but I mean that the choice of a space-time metric inside of the space of all

159
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:03.180
metrics is a section of a 14 dimensional bundle over a four dimensional

160
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:07.920
space. Now that's the first sort of mind-bending weird thing is,

161
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:10.140
is that this is not happening in one place.

162
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.820
It's happening in two places in X and in Y the stands and the pitch

163
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:15.391
there,

164
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:18.180
things that are happening in the stands and the things that are happening in the

165
00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:19.840
pitch. So, you know,

166
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.860
when a guy's like trying to make a free throw and everybody's waving their giant

167
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:24.240
noodles, trying to get them to miss,

168
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.990
there's an interaction between what's happening in the stands and what's

169
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:28.980
happening on the floor.

170
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.310
And the observers is the bundling of two spaces and saying, Hey,

171
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.520
you're confused as to what's going on here.

172
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.040
Some fields are happening in the stand.

173
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.260
Some fields are happening on the floor and there,

174
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.630
everything feels as if it's happening in the stands.

175
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.430
Cause that's where you're sitting in some weird way.

176
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.650
Then you've got this really crazy stuff, which I think, um,

177
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.390
one aspect of it is everybody in theoretical physics is looking to figure out

178
00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:01.860
whether there were three or more generations that is copies of matter.

179
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.080
Everything in this room is generation one,

180
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.590
it's all made up of up corks down corks and electrons.

181
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.700
So that up quirks and down corks give you protons and neutrons and electrons

182
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.750
give you the sort of interesting personality of the various chemical elements.

183
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.330
They're also neutrinos, but they're streaming through us.

184
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:23.190
I'm not going to count them. And that's all generation one of matter.

185
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.830
So everything in that thing of that is like plastic Lego.

186
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.410
Then there's another Lego set made out of wood.

187
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.960
And then there's another Lego set made out of like led, you know,

188
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.940
and we don't see those other two Lego sets,

189
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.250
except if we're doing very energetic experiments.

190
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.570
So there were three copies of matter and everybody was trying to figure out

191
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:45.180
three or more. And I thought maybe it's two or fewer.

192
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.090
And so one of the aspects of this theory is,

193
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:50.670
is that the third generation of matter is an imposter.

194
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.820
It looks like this generation of matter in terms of its particle personalities,

195
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.040
but if you were actually to heat up the system,

196
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.950
it would unify with a bunch of particles nobody's ever seen before.

197
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.790
And so their predictions for what those new particle properties would be.

198
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.470
There's also a fourth pseudo generation of what would be called spin three

199
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:10.960
halves matter, which is not prohibited,

200
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.000
but has never been seen as a fundamental.

201
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.950
So it makes predictions for the particle properties of new spin,

202
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:19.870
half a new spin, three halfs particles.

203
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.030
It attempts to say that there are sectors of matter that I think decoupled that

204
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:27.790
the universe is not in fact left, right. Asymmetric,

205
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.380
which would be called [inaudible]. Um,  and if you think about, uh,

206
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.380
 the weak force, so if you have a new neutron on a table it'll

207
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.380
 decay, and I think something like 17 on average, half-life when it decay

208
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.380
. There's an asymmetry in that decay called beta decay. And that was found by a woman 

209
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.380
up Madam

210
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.380
 blue from Columbia and the cobalt 60 experiment. So in the fifties, this, uh,

211
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.380
 this gal, Madam Wu, uh,  who should have

212
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.380
 won a Nobel prize, discovered that when cobalt 60 decays through beta decay, the electrons come spin out one side and not the other meaning that the universe is like 

213
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.380
a

214
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.380
 Marilyn Monroe or Cindy Crawford, having a birthmark that lets you tell the left from the right. So this is like the ultimate experimental bad-ass who never got recognized

215
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.213
, uh,  fully.

216
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.840
Uh, and she did an experiment based on work of yang and Lee that for the first

217
00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:32.160
time showed that the universe had a preference of one of its leftover it's

218
00:13:32.161 --> 00:13:35.430
right. If you will, I don't believe that preference is fundamental.

219
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.810
I believe that there's an another copy of matter that,

220
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.330
so the analogy I give is that if you think,

221
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.760
if you look at your three fingers in the center of your hand,

222
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.150
your middle finger, which is my favorite, uh,

223
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.890
is obviously symmetrical about itself,

224
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.040
your digit ratio two and four is pretty close,

225
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.520
but is determined by the amount of testosterone you're exposed to in utero.

226
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.970
And then your thumb and your pinky are wildly off,

227
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.390
but you could try to make it symmetric and say, well, you know,

228
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.640
a pinky is like a lame thumb, which it isn't.

229
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.280
If you're just looking at your hand,

230
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.350
you're trying to figure out why is my hand asymmetrical?

231
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.270
But you don't realize that you've got another hand and it's thumb to thumb,

232
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.310
not thumb to pinkie. That is the symmetry.

233
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.690
So when you place your fingertips together, you see that if you didn't know,

234
00:14:21.691 --> 00:14:23.580
if you were like, oh, all of her sexed out,

235
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.910
and you could only see part of your body, you would think about, oh,

236
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.290
their world is asymmetric. Well,

237
00:14:28.291 --> 00:14:31.410
my belief is that in weak gravitational situations,

238
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.790
this other matter decouples so you only see one hand or the other. And we're,

239
00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.880
we're all in one hand in this. Um,

240
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:44.310
so yeah, what I'm starting to do, uh, is, is that I'm terrified,

241
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.030
um, of talking about this stuff. I don't have the right credentials,

242
00:14:48.031 --> 00:14:52.130
not a physicist. Uh, I've been out of this game for forever.

243
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:56.120
So I often say the wrong things and break rules and who knows what?

244
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.860
And I haven't really talked about it. This is like really a very lone S I mean,

245
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.130
I've been completely alone on this project all.

246
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.830
<v 2>My life. What do you think the end result of this project potentially could be?</v>

247
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.240
Cause you're saying we could get off this planet. What do you, what, like,

248
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.540
what are you talking about in terms of the actual implementation of this,

249
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.740
this theory of yours.

250
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:23.020
<v 1>Amy, if you could bring up, um, my answer to the final edge question,</v>

251
00:15:23.021 --> 00:15:27.160
which is what is the last question John Brockman asked when the final year that

252
00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:28.840
he conducted the annual edge question.

253
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.690
<v 2>And that is the annual edge question is.</v>

254
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.940
<v 1>Ask like 200 people, many of them physicists or biologists or mathematicians,</v>

255
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.250
you'd ask a question and they'd write an essay.

256
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.340
And then every year he'd publish it as a book. And so I did that for 10 years.

257
00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:47.380
Finally, he got tired of it and he said, okay, this is my final year.

258
00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.870
We've exhausted. This, what is the last question?

259
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.600
So this is the question that I asked. So.

260
00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:57.340
<v 2>Does something unprecedented happen when we finally</v>

261
00:15:57.341 --> 00:15:59.530
learn our own source code? No.

262
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.260
<v 1>Nobody picked up on this, but that's what my concern is,</v>

263
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.270
which is what happens when the universe finally contemplates

264
00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:09.670
itself. When we are the first, like,

265
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.270
we're always worried about the AI becoming self-aware all a Skynet,

266
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.570
okay. We are the AI

267
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.910
and we're about to become self-aware if we can figure out what our own source

268
00:16:21.911 --> 00:16:25.110
code is. So we are a Skynet. So.

269
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:29.250
<v 2>You're talking about the source code of reality itself. Yep.</v>

270
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.800
And that our perception,

271
00:16:31.801 --> 00:16:36.150
our limited perceptions of reality are giving us a distorted view of what the

272
00:16:36.151 --> 00:16:37.470
landscape actually is.

273
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.630
<v 1>I'm trying to make sure I was somewhat holding this back because I'm afraid of</v>

274
00:16:42.631 --> 00:16:46.830
what it unlocks. And now that I know that we're willing to elect Donald Trump,

275
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:51.240
not store masks, uh, play footsie with China, uh,

276
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.140
be Putin's, all of this stuff, uh,

277
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.670
to hell with this, we're going to mismanage this planet into Armageddon.

278
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.800
If we don't get some grownups into the room.

279
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.320
And so I don't know that I'm a grownup,

280
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.880
but I'm willing to vie for leadership by putting something up, having it, uh,

281
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.670
investigated and seeing where it goes.

282
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.190
<v 2>What is your number one fear about this, uh,</v>

283
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.320
this source code being, I don't know of a better term mastered last.

284
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.090
<v 1>Time we gained some serious insight into the way nuclei</v>

285
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.380
worked, uh, that with a little bit of geometry, uh,

286
00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:32.310
from Stanislaus alum and Edward teller, uh,

287
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.180
gave us, uh, the namesake of the bikini.

288
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.160
That was a terrifying moment. We changed everything changed in 19.

289
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.590
I think that was 54.

290
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:48.240
The namesake of the bikini bikini Atol was an island in the Pacific

291
00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.640
where we up a hydrogen device.

292
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.770
<v 2>Is that, that insane,</v>

293
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.460
those insane images where you could see the water going a mile high into the

294
00:17:56.461 --> 00:18:00.990
sky. Gorgeous. Yeah. Is that what that is? Yeah, but they did that a lot.

295
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:05.360
<v 1>Well, they did it for a period of time now. And so when, to your question,</v>

296
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.980
what if, what,

297
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.940
so it's still expensive to create fusion devices.

298
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.710
So we don't know of any individuals who own the ability to create fusion

299
00:18:15.711 --> 00:18:20.630
devices. If you recall, at some point, um, somebody made a functioning,

300
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.620
uh, nuclear reactor out of discarded, uh, smoke detectors

301
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.220
and ran and got like 500 smoke detectors,

302
00:18:28.221 --> 00:18:33.140
took out the radioactive element and created a reactor, really think so. So kid,

303
00:18:33.141 --> 00:18:37.550
right? Yeah. Probably a kid who couldn't get into Harvard. Um,

304
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.580
so we have a situation in which we don't know when he

305
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.180
ordinary humans will gain limitless, destructive power, you know,

306
00:18:47.181 --> 00:18:49.730
try to imagine the Columbine kids, um,

307
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.980
weaponizing viruses or something like that.

308
00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.730
So one of the great dangers is that great power.

309
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.570
I can't tell what the power would be if the theory is correct,

310
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.870
it might give us the ability to escape. It might give us the escape though.

311
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.620
Yeah. Why.

312
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.440
<v 2>Do we have, this is what, what I'm, I'm always so confused about like,</v>

313
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.070
cause even when Elan talks about going to Mars yeah.

314
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.070
<v 1>Like Mars sucks. Mars sucks. Can't you fix here?</v>

315
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.360
Wouldn't that be the best approach? Well, you and I agree on that. Yeah.

316
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.110
What we don't agree on I think is,

317
00:19:25.111 --> 00:19:28.810
is that I am convinced that we don't have the ability to steward this place.

318
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.033
Why.

319
00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.860
<v 2>Don't you think we're better at it now than we were a thousand.</v>

320
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.180
<v 1>Years ago? No, no, no, no.</v>

321
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.450
<v 2>So Gangas Kahn was doing a better job.</v>

322
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.670
<v 1>Gingiss Khan was doing a better job because he didn't have limitless power.</v>

323
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.220
Just try to imagine it,

324
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.850
try to imagine a full-on nuclear interchange and then we're having this

325
00:19:49.851 --> 00:19:50.684
conversation.

326
00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.660
<v 2>So you you're concerned that nuclear war</v>

327
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.810
is, uh, not just possible, but inevitable.

328
00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.610
<v 1>It's certainly inevitable given a long enough time series because all these</v>

329
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.620
weapons simply will become cheaper.

330
00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:11.740
There's no countermeasure that we it's too easy to destroy things relative to

331
00:20:11.741 --> 00:20:12.550
building. Right, right.
