00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.840
<v 1>Punctuate. No. No. What,</v>

25
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.720
so what was the difference with what you thought the joke did? You didn't get,

26
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:33.640
but what made you get it?

27
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.360
<v 0>What made me get it was just the I'm trying to cause Dave is, Dave is a genius.</v>

Yo right? His is crazy. Right? It's like a lyric. You gonna get the what?

29
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.550
When you get the rhyme. Right? Right. So what he was saying, he said,

30
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.070
he don't understand how a man chop his Dick off, said what a man do.

31
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.383
A man just goes.

32
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.030
<v 1>Foul. The reason this.</v>

33
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.950
<v 0>Is, tell me what you got. I'll tell what.</v>

34
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.540
<v 1>I got.</v>

35
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.030
What I got was the most gangster phrase you could say,

36
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.060
it describes the hardest you could do. Like it Wang.

37
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.260
You know what I'm saying? Right now. Cut your Dick off. No, take back like,

38
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.340
like now.

39
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.460
<v 0>That's th now no.</v>

40
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.140
<v 1>One of your Wang did that. Exactly.</v>

41
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.050
<v 0>Hold on in. So now that's what it was did. So no.</v>

42
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:28.570
So there's so there's a, there's a dude that was affiliated with, with us,

43
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:29.530
right? Don't.

44
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.450
<v 1>Say affiliated, but he was a Wutang. He.</v>

45
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.930
<v 0>Was a Wutang say, hold on. Listen man. He wasn't part of the Wutang CLA okay.</v>

58
00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:11.040
street, life mathematics, follow me, but check it out. But this, so,

59
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:14.480
so we had other groups, we signed north star, actually signed north star.

60
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.990
I signed the black Knights, uh, both west coast groups, actually. So some,

61
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.830
some from long beach, some from Compton, you know, and, uh, you know,

62
00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:25.070
made a lot of songs with them, talented young brothers.

63
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.430
So one of the members of the north star zoned out,

64
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.630
he zoned.

65
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.630
<v 1>Out on some cases, zoned out one of them, drugs. You talk about zoned out.</v>

66
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.550
<v 0>And what they call him when you do it to I don't what they call it.</v>

67
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.220
Yeah. Oh, there's a word for it though. What's the, what's the word?

68
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:49.380
When you do it, castrate yourself cast. Yeah. Had to get the word brother. Okay.

69
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.140
So now, now, so, so he castrates himself, right?

70
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.580
So now that's the first line of his joke.

71
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.210
&lt;laugh&gt; the first line is like, cuz this dude for no.

72
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.770
<v 1>Reason, it was a call back. Yeah. Got.</v>

73
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.010
<v 2>So you got it in an elevator.</v>

74
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.450
<v 0>Yeah. I'm just walking on this in an elevator. I saying, oh. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

75
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.043
&lt;laugh&gt;.

76
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.660
<v 1>It's a.</v>

77
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.650
<v 0>Delay. I'm it.</v>

78
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.330
<v 1>Joke when he hits you like 20 hours later. Oh my God. That.</v>

79
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.223
<v 2>Has a long.</v>

80
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.120
<v 0>Fued. Yeah. So y'all but Dave, Dave does got those kind of jokes. Oh man.</v>

81
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.160
<v 1>I remember when we were on the road, when that actually was the news. Right.</v>

82
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.440
And he was like Wang, punctuated so much in anything,

83
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.520
whatever you do for, for anything Wang forever. Yeah. So when.

84
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.790
<v 2>A member or at least an affiliated bro,</v>

85
00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:44.350
the w routine cuts off his deck and then he does it think.

86
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.990
<v 1>He could have been, he could have been a, like a nephew, a woo.</v>

87
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.070
You did he up in a woo nephew or.

88
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.190
<v 0>Whatever, you know, what's so crazy about that incident. First of all,</v>

89
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:54.670
that incident was very hurtful. You know? Like, you know? Yeah. Hell hurtful.

90
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.910
I I'm quite sure it's hurtful to him even literally,

91
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.660
but it was hurtful in the sense, like when it had happened, I was,

92
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.420
I was doing a TV show called gang related. Right. Oh. And so, you know,

93
00:05:05.421 --> 00:05:09.540
like I would go like say it happened on the night it happened the next night is

94
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:12.860
a cast where the whole cast get together and this is the news.

95
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.860
This is like on every network, every TMZ, this is like, oh.

96
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.980
And I'll come in the room. And everybody's like, what the happened? Like,

97
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.940
you know what I mean? Yeah.

98
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.410
<v 1>But I would tell you thing about it's like,</v>

99
00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:24.490
I don't know what you need to do to represent your gangster,

100
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.130
but cutting your Dick off is the most go hard.

101
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.530
A could hard right now. You that's like next level. That's.

102
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.410
<v 0>Next level now, homie. So, so I had a buddy with me at the time,</v>

103
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.130
Paul Banks from Interpol and we was working on the album and, and so he saw me,

104
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.440
he was like, Bobby, you look kind of the press. I said, yo, man, like,

105
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.440
I don't like the way this sound, man. Right. It's like, you know what I mean?

106
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.200
It is like the press. It feels, it don't feel right. First of all, I don't,

107
00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:53.800
I don't think I found in the history of me or my study.

108
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.560
I never heard of a man chopping his own off. This is biblical.

109
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.800
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;. Yeah. So, so, so I'm already, even.</v>

110
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.960
<v 0>Though some people may have done it.</v>

111
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.280
<v 1>Know about it, this.</v>

112
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.040
<v 0>This is biblical. Turn it to yourself. Right. So my ha Parata.</v>

113
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.960
And when he said to what he said, he is like, listen, he probably was really up.

114
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.473
Probably.

115
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.790
<v 1>He said, he was, he said, yeah, nah. He was up.</v>

116
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.310
<v 0>He said his party. He said he was probably really up. I said, yeah, I said,</v>

117
00:06:26.311 --> 00:06:27.470
but then you know what I'm saying?

118
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:31.390
Then they say he jumped out the window out of a two story. Uh,

119
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.710
he jumped over the balcony of a two story, uh, barber building.

120
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.043
But then.

121
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.860
<v 1>It gotta be, they said he jumped after he be moving. Yeah. After no,</v>

122
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.900
not no disrespect to him.

123
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:47.700
Couldn't you Dick off jumping over and then hit full stride when he hit down.

124
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.460
<v 0>No, no. So, so, so my man Paul said this, he said,</v>

125
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.060
I think he was sober when he jumped.

126
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.290
<v 1>How can you get that high? Check it out.</v>

127
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.010
<v 0>He said, I think he was sober when he jumped.</v>

128
00:07:02.011 --> 00:07:05.930
And he went on to gimme this whole story by one of his friends that would had a

129
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:07.810
problem. He had a cause he had to console me. Right.

130
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:09.770
Right now I'm kind of puzzle. So he's like, he's trying to up.

131
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:13.730
He's trying to console me. And he told me, I said, yeah, but he didn't die.

132
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.480
He said, yeah, he didn't die. Cuz he wasn't going to die. Like,

133
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.480
you know what I mean? So it gave me a little metaphor in my head. So he said,

134
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.560
I had a friend who used to drink and.

135
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.120
And one night he had a problem with one night he was in a hotel and he,

136
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.720
and he laid on the, the, the balcony of a window. Right. And then it said,

137
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.920
and everybody said, you'll get the off that. And the window's over and said,

138
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:40.550
he fall this way. He, he is going down 10 stories. But if you go this way,

139
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:43.350
just hit the floor. He's in the room. And that's the, that's the whole thing.

140
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.750
Right? He said that he went this way.

141
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.950
<v 1>He went down every.</v>

142
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.070
<v 0>10 Stories, 10 stories gone.</v>

143
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.030
But during the fall he sober it up. But when he hit the ground,

144
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.660
he didn't die. He became quadriplegic the Dick cut off.

145
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.980
No, no, no, no. &lt;laugh&gt; this, the, this, the, this,

146
00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:09.260
the alcohol dude that's point point being made is that you ain't going go until

147
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:12.660
it's time to go. Right. Oh 1%. So, so you, you think you killing yourself,

148
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.060
it ain't happen. But if you cut.

149
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.860
<v 1>Your Dick off and you survive that, that's the time to go, hold on, hold.</v>

150
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.930
<v 0>On. But, so, so the idea is, was he sober when he jumped? And so,</v>

151
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.930
and I had the chance to speak to him, right? Uh, I sent him a Quran.

152
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.330
You know what I mean? I was like, I think, you know, you know,

153
00:08:28.331 --> 00:08:32.370
you might have to get into some studies brother, cuz and you know, so, so, so,

154
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.930
so anyway, I sent him a Quran. Can anybody hold you down off of that?

155
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:39.690
And then I said, uh, I said, let me ask you a question. And the question was,

156
00:08:39.691 --> 00:08:43.320
you know, did you know when you jump? You know, was, you said, yeah,

157
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.800
he's like for that moment, like it was everything else was whatever it was.

158
00:08:47.801 --> 00:08:49.920
And you know, you could read his story and he says, why?

159
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.200
He says what happened in the story. But when he jumped, he,

160
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:57.360
that was the moment of sobriety. And, and for me that was like, now that's the.

161
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:58.561
<v 1>When he jumped,</v>

162
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:01.520
when he cut his Dick off that wasn't the moment of sobriety it's.

163
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.040
<v 0>It's after. Okay. You know, when you ever do some, you ever been up. Yeah.</v>

164
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.240
And you do some that, oh, oh like, like I, I had a really bad,

165
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.750
uh, sexual thing, mad, mad. It was one of 'em sex in the nights you, I was,

166
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.390
I was, I was coming up. I kind of,

167
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.950
I kind of had like a blanket over me when we was going to room to room girls.

168
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.710
It was like, it was one of them like bad sex drug in your system.

169
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.310

I'm going hard body against the grain against the grain.

174
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.220
But then there's that moment like, oh, I up. Right.

175
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.220

176
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.770
and then the hot get back in. You go knock.

177
