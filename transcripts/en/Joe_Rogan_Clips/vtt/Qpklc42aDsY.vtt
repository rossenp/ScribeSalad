1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.690
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Where we're live right now.</v>

2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:04.501
So we'll just let everybody know.

3
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:06.630
We're talking about Cheech and Chong's album big bamboo.

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.370
It actually came with a real rolling paper.

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.420
<v 1>Yeah, huge. Just across the, I think it was across the double, the double album.</v>

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.080
Do you have a flip.

7
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.200
<v 0>Phone? I do.</v>

8
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.203
<v 1>That. I do that.</v>

9
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.380
<v 0>I do. I stepped out.</v>

10
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.060
<v 1>OTG brother.</v>

11
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.223
<v 0>You figured it out.</v>

12
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.900
<v 1>Create less data. That's my motto. Yeah. Well, two things, one,</v>

13
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.110
um, your phone is always with you. It's it's notifying and you know,

14
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.560
and I just didn't want to be a part of that anymore. I wanted to, you know,

15
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.290
be a little more connected to life outside so-called.

16
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.123
<v 0>People.</v>

17
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.180
<v 1>Well, this is, so this is actually a new flip phone from, um,</v>

18
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000
T-Mobile Alcatel and it,

19
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.780
it has Caio S which is so it's not really a trackable OOS. Uh,

20
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.840
although Google put an investment. Well, I'm very serious about it. Yeah.

21
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.980
Oh yeah. And you know, so all the apps are all, they're all tracking. You,

22
00:00:55.981 --> 00:01:00.840
they're all doing all kinds of, but initially really just to not be,

23
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.070
you know, a slave to this thing. Uh, and the further I got into it,

24
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:07.890
the more I liked it, uh, and you don't really need it. Now.

25
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.160
I have a device with me that's off this works as a hotspot,

26
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.480
so I can turn into a hotspot if I really, really, really needed to do something.

27
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.970
But what do you need? Text, phone call.

28
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.670
And if there's something that I really need to look up,

29
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.850
you just turn around and say, Hey, can someone Google this for me? They do it.

30
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.000
There's always someone around.

31
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.590
<v 0>You texting on that thing. Yeah. Yeah. Do you T nine, is that what you're doing?</v>

32
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.110
<v 1>Uh, it's like a T nine. It's a little bit better.</v>

33
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:34.260
It's there their version of predictive texting. Um, yeah,

34
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.580
I really am serious about it. Well, you should be. Yeah.

35
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.490
And everyone should be the pro. I mean, we have all this cool,

36
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.230
all this great technology, but the business model us all. I mean,

37
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.630
six years ago I had the first Amazon echo and like, this is groundbreaking, uh,

38
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.060
Devor act. My, my co-host, he was laughing at me. He's like,

39
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.430
why would you bring a spy device into your house? Said, look,

40
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:58.620
I'm just testing this out. If had an apple logo on it,

41
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.550
everyone would be losing their right now, but it didn't. And I loved it,

42
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.100
hooked it up to the light. You had all that stuff go.

43
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.360
And then as I started to understand what it was really doing and what is really

44
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:13.020
communicating all of these things right down to like your Roku remote,

45
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:16.680
you pick that up, it's communicating with home base. So all this stuff.

46
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.700
So I got rid of all of it.

47
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.770
<v 0>Well, I just got rid of it. Um, you know,</v>

48
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:23.220
I was listening to one of Sam Harris's podcast and, uh,

49
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.940
he was talking with someone that said that they had a really good,

50
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.740
great quote that we didn't realize that our data was something

51
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:35.250
valuable. Right. We didn't realize it was a commodity and it was being sold,

52
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:39.000
not just a commodity that's kind of value, but insanely fast,

53
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:42.000
extremely what that's, what we're Facebook makes all their money.

54
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.250
That's where Google makes all their money. Everybody. Yeah.

55
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.840
Everybody make it from your data and you never really understood what you were

56
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:53.220
doing when you signed off to give that data away when you sign the terms of

57
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:55.020
agreements and you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

58
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.400
And nobody breeds through that show.

59
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.860
<v 1>You know, what's even more egregious is, um,</v>

60
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.190
there's company called plaid P L a I D just sold the visa for, I think,

61
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.380
four or $5 billion. And it's the, um,

62
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.780
the financial back end are kind of like a bridge between all these apps that can

63
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:17.140
do stuff with your bank account and your bank account. So instead of,

64
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.550
so if you have an app like Venmo or, oh, uh, you know,

65
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.800
name, any payment patch app,

66
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.440
I didn't want to disparage anyone who might be advertising.

67
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.390
<v 0>Cash.</v>

68
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.370
<v 1>App. Uh, well, PayPal I'll do it. Uh, PayPal has their own system,</v>

69
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.690
but what you do is you sign up and you literally give this app,

70
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.370
your username and log into your bank account instead of an API or some kind of

71
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:45.700
programming interface, just lets the app, talk to your bank, accountant,

72
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.080
put money in, take it out. It can do anything. In fact, it is just like scream,

73
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.520
screen, scraping. It's going,

74
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.490
you can go through anything that's connected to your bank account.

75
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.050
It can look at and they do and, and credit karma another great, uh, great, uh,

76
00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.893
example of it.

77
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.790
And they are just sucking out all of your information when you pay your bills,

78
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:06.880
who you pay first. Why, you know, if, if you have, you know,

79
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:11.230
what your pattern is of, uh, of credit card payment, moving stuff around.

80
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.930
So you think you're just using it as a, as a utility,

81
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.310
but they're tracking your life to you.

82
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.300
<v 0>You're really concerned about this.</v>

83
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.770
<v 1>I'm like, well, everybody will get the world they deserve. You know?</v>

84
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.510
So I'm trying to protect myself and people.

85
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:29.410
I love also the drone can't target me that easily with this, you know?

86
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.850
So protecting you, Joe. Okay.

87
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.760
<v 0>Thank you. It seems somewhat inevitable, right?</v>

88
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:37.180
That this connection that we have to technology gets deeper and deeper into our

89
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:37.601
lives.

90
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:42.220
But that what disturbs me is that there are these giant corporations that are

91
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:44.650
not just profiting off of our connection,

92
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:48.280
but then they're using that money that influence to affect a lot of things in

93
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:49.114
our culture.

94
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.470
<v 1>W well, they're enslaving you. So credit karma is a great example, uh,</v>

95
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.390
which also just sold for $7 billion. It was literally,

96
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.900
um, changing your behavior to get a higher credit score.

97
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.510
And this credit score isn't really even an official credit score.

98
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:07.120
It's the one that they kind of made up. So they'll say,

99
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:09.700
pay your utilities on time. Then we'll raise your credit score.

100
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:13.090
Your credit score is higher. Now we can lend you this money. You see.

101
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:17.500
So they're training people to do certain things like, um,

102
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.930
the progressive app for insurance,

103
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.090
it's training you to drive in a quote unquote responsible manner because you get

104
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:29.650
discounts. If you don't break too hard, if you're not accelerating,

105
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:31.870
if you're not breaking speed limits, et cetera.

106
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.340
<v 0>The GPS. So it knows your speeds and everything is monitoring.</v>

107
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.860
<v 1>Your breaking velocity, all of that.</v>

108
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.370
<v 0>Oh yeah. So they take that into consideration every month when.</v>

109
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.450
<v 1>The point is to train the user to be a good</v>

110
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.660
fiscally good person, whatever that.

111
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.460
<v 0>Just because you want to save some money.</v>

112
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.190
<v 1>Well, of course everyone does that and you're going to be,</v>

113
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:57.980
you're going to be forced into it. Like I just got, um, health insurance,

114
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:01.340
new health insurance, and they're oh, download the app.

115
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:03.920
And if you download the app, we'll give you a break. Why?

116
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.130
Because they're going to tell me to do things. This app is saying, you know,

117
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.120
now it's small things, but it'll start telling you, stand up, you know,

118
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.990
move around and if you'd follow it, if you follow it,

119
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:19.400
then you'll get a discount. So we're really, really becoming enslaved that way.

120
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.890
<v 0>That's that is definitely a way to look at it.</v>

121
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.080
<v 1>That's the business model.</v>

122
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.090
<v 0>And it gets more and more immersive.</v>

123
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.100
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah.</v>

124
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.230
<v 0>Yeah. I didn't know that Progressive's.</v>

125
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.110
<v 1>App does that. That's all of them do Joe. All of them. The insurance company.</v>

126
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.270
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. I mean, that's,</v>

127
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.300
that would be the best way to figure out if you're actually a good driver or if

128
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:40.820
you're just some Dick who gets lucky. Well.

129
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.050
<v 1>Yeah, I mean, that's kind of the marketing is like, you know,</v>

130
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.510
if you're a good guy to worry about it, but they keep pushing,

131
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:48.620
they keep pushing, you know,

132
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.130
they'll just keep telling you and you don't have to have the app active for that

133
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:53.330
to be tracked or monitored.

134
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.680
<v 0>That was one of the grossest arguments I heard after the whole Snowden thing.</v>

135
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.350
Like, what do you care if you're not breaking the law.

136
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.350
<v 1>Changing a little bit. I have a 29 year old daughter.</v>

137
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:07.310
And she definitely had that, uh, that mindset and her friends did,

138
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.430
what's changing. You know, now it's like, okay, we totally get it.

139
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.800
They're tracking all of our. So we're going to,

140
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.800
might not use this or we'll leave the phone at home.

141
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.060
There's a little bit of that creeping in. But in general, it's like crack,

142
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:22.730
you know, how can you do with, it's not easy. It's I mean, this,

143
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.620
this phone it's sometimes like, ah, I could, but no, it's like,

144
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.360
and I just have to stand back and go,

145
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.870
do I really need to have this information right at this very moment?

146
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:35.330
Do I really need to do this? And typically, no.

147
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.620
<v 0>Yeah. When I feel any sort of anxiety or boredom,</v>

148
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.620
I just grabbed the phone. It's just instantly my little,

149
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.980
my little soothing blanket or my little teething.

150
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.240
<v 1>Absolutely. And, and I play a game with myself.</v>

151
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.030
I'll give myself points. As I'm driving around,

152
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.600
like person walking on the street, holding the phone in their hand,

153
00:07:56.601 --> 00:08:00.860
one point you don't need to actually hold the phone in your hand and women.

154
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.360
Holy crap. They got two phones sometimes with the little, you know,

155
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.090
little button plugs. So it doesn't fall off. They got their bag.

156
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.760
Maybe they got their kid or a stroller. And it's a pop-up,

157
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.180
I'm there doing all and just, they're all over the place all the time.

158
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:19.640
So it's one point for just holding it to, if you're walking and doing something,

159
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:20.690
I see a lot of that.

160
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.480
<v 0>How many points if you have a kid and you're walking and looking at your phone,</v>

161
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:24.530
that seems like there'll be excellent.

162
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.660
<v 1>If you're in the car, 10 points. If you're walking with your kid on the phone,</v>

163
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:32.690
it's five points and you can hit a hundred within five minutes. It's,

164
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:36.410
it's crazy. It's zombies. When you start to really pay attention to it.

165
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.273
When you're above.

166
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.950
<v 0>I have a truck and I wanna look down from my truck.</v>

167
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:42.650
You can see people texting and it's stunning.

168
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.680
How many people are on the highway texting at the same time.

169
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.290
<v 1>I got rear-ended. Um, uh,</v>

170
00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:52.850
with my trucks say maybe two months ago in Austin, you know,

171
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:57.420
right after a stoplight. And I was in the lane, I was going to turn left, bam,

172
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.480
full speed. It was maybe 30, 35 miles an hour. You know,

173
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:05.460
the girls air bags deployed. She's like, I was like, whoa, I was in the truck.

174
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:10.380
I'm like, yeah. Okay. I get out. And the whole front end is destroyed.

175
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:14.040
She's days. I'm like, so I'm trying to pry the door open. And yet there,

176
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:17.610
I see the phone on the floor still open.

177
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.410
And then her excuse was, well, my brake didn't work. Okay. I got my.

178
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.243
<v 0>Break. Didn't work.</v>

179
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.410
<v 1>Ever happened. My brakes. Didn't not.</v>

180
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.820
<v 0>Wherever we were into the same thing. Uh,</v>

181
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.210
there was a slowdown on the right lane and some, some guy plowed right into me.

182
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.170
<v 1>And I asked the cops. I said, oh, this is five times, five times a day.</v>

183
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.213
I'm sure.

184
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.530
<v 0>Yeah. It's, it's weird that that sort of snuck up on us.</v>

185
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.740
There's this thing that's incredibly, incredibly addictive. Um, uh, I was, uh,

186
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.550
with my family, uh, this past weekend in Dallas and we were at this event,

187
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:50.160
as we're walking through this crowd, I'm like, look,

188
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:54.540
how many people are on their phones? This is crazy. Like everyone, it's just,

189
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:56.430
you're, you're going through the crowd of the store.

190
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.640
And everyone is just looking at their phone. Just, yeah.

191
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.860
It's like a zombie movie. They don't know there's zombies.

192
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.380
<v 1>Truly is a zombie apocalypse.</v>

193
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.990
<v 0>Truly in the weirdest way. I mean,</v>

194
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:10.380
it gives you a little bit of reward every now and then someone has a funny meme

195
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.380
and you're like, ah, ha.

196
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.780
<v 1>That's what Silicon valley figured out is that the [inaudible] in response and</v>

197
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:20.640
the, you know, all the, all the brain impulses you get from a like, or, or,

198
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.360
uh, you know, a retweet or whatever it is, or even just something just blip.

199
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.530
Oh yeah. Ooh. And we have different sounds, bling. Blong all this stuff.
