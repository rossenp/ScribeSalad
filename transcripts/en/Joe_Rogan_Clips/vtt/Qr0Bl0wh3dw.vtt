00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I found out about your restaurant online.</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.640
I was just Googling new places to go for dinner. And, uh, I don't know.

3
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.200
It was like maybe a couple years ago and, uh,

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.040
I was Googling steakhouse and then I saw that you specialize in

5
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.680
dry age steaks and I,

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.190
I had a steak that you cooked once that was more than a year dry age was just so

7
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.710
it, it was delicious. Yeah. But it was really weird. I mean, it's weird,

8
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.110
&lt;laugh&gt; it doesn't taste. It's different. Anything like a regular steak? Yeah.

9
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:35.670
It tastes like, um, boy, it's like a different animal. It's like,

10
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:39.230
you're eating something, you know, some exotic animal. And I.

11
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.790
<v 1>That's what I like to do. I mean, you know,</v>

12
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.340
it's more age doesn't necessarily mean better.

13
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.100
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but you know, it's just different and that's, you know,

14
00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:51.540
for me as a chef, you know, I call my Drage room, an environmental chamber.

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.340
<v 0>I think that's, uh, yeah, there's a picture on Instagram of me and, uh,</v>

16
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.220
Adam in the, the basement that meat locker.

17
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.890
&lt;laugh&gt; weird meat room that you've got &lt;affirmative&gt; and, um,

18
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.330
it's it's for people that have never been to a dry aging room. It's very odd.

19
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.530
There's fans blown around. Everything's a very specific temperature.

20
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:14.650
You've got all these different things labeled as far as like what date it was

21
00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:19.290
put in there. And for no one for people who haven't seen dry aging,

22
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:22.960
it's very odd too, because you like, Hey, what is wrong with that meat? Yeah,

23
00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:27.760
exactly. The outside crust of it. You got the, here's a photo of it. Folks.

24
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.400
You can see it in the background of the, um, it's not working.

25
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.430
You got a technical. There it is. So for folks,

26
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.390
you can see it in the background. The meat has like a black crust to it.

27
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.500
And then you slice that crust off. What do you do with the crust?

28
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.020
Get rid of it, but is it edible?

29
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.340
<v 1>It's not enjoyable.</v>

30
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.340
<v 0>What about for dogs?</v>

31
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.860
<v 1>I wanna give something a dog. I wouldnt eat myself.</v>

32
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.060
<v 0>Wow. You eat dog food. What's that? Do you eat dog food? No.</v>

33
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.700
&lt;laugh&gt; but you feed your dog.

34
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700
<v 1>Dog food. I don't have a dog. I wish I did. To be.</v>

35
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.770
<v 0>Honest with, I have a dog and he eats dog food. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

36
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.610
I'd love him to death, but he eats, uh,

37
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:13.090
he actually eats ground elk mixed in with, uh, regular dog food. Even that.

38
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.050
<v 1>I mean, it gets a white Ash, which is almost like a, I call it a,</v>

39
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.810
there's a friendly oxidation. I refer to it and the whole process. Okay.

40
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.360
<v 0>Is that white Ash, like the same as you get on outset out of salamimi.</v>

41
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.080
<v 1>It's like that it's part of it. There it's a mold mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and um,</v>

42
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.080
the whole concept behind dry aging, it's based on three things. It's, um,

43
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.120
air velocity, temperature and, um, humidity, air velocity. Yes. Mm.

44
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.640
And it's really important. I, I like to, you know, uh,

45
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.880
when I teach people about dry aging, it's like,

46
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.750
if you are on a beach in Jamaica and there was no wind and you just start

47
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.150
getting sweat and you're just uncomfortable. Um,

48
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.270
but then if trade winds went through it,

49
00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:56.150
would've at the same temperature to evaporate the water off your skin.

50
00:02:56.151 --> 00:03:00.320
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so what we're trying to do is we're trying to at the right

51
00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:03.200
ratio, evaporate the water off the surface.

52
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.320
So it doesn't get like a smelly, stinky, bad mold mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and,

53
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.560
um, dehydrate it slowly. What it does is it concentrates the flavor.

54
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.040
It transforms the amino acids into a whole different compound and changes the

55
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.030
flavor of together. And then also enzymes within the meat,

56
00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:24.390
through the pro process of rigor, mortis. It breaks down.

57
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.590
So it becomes more tender. So you get flavor enhancement,

58
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.550
you get tenderization and it just, it just blows it away.

59
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.470
<v 0>So what does it do to the amino acids?</v>

60
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.150
<v 1>It transforms it into a whole nother compound.</v>

61
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.540
It's like a flavor it's it's like, uh, when we talk, have heard of like,

62
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:42.020
concept of like myard reaction. Yes.

63
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.420
<v 0>But I don't know what it means anymore. I I've read the expression,</v>

64
00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:45.820
but I forgot.

65
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.261
<v 1>What it means. Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:46.261 --> 00:03:49.260
The myard reaction is basically like when you're cooking something, um,

67
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.060
what ends up happening? Spell it. Um, oh God, I'm the worst spell. Is it Mylar?

68
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.020
No. M a I L L a R D, right. My Mylar.

69
00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:01.690
Okay. Okay. Mylar. Okay. I said my wired. Yeah. Okay. Um, that's what I know as,

70
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.010
um, so, you know, when,

71
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.690
whenever you're Browning or you're doing different things at different rates,

72
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.170
amino acid is transform into different things and you get different flavor

73
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.530
compounds. And that's really what happens, you know, with meat, you know?

74
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:17.170
So if I dry age, you have to handle dry age meat a lot differently.

75
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.240
You can't go on. It's like, okay, I'm gonna slow cook this once. It's dry age.

76
00:04:20.241 --> 00:04:21.074
Cuz then that just,

77
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.560
it develops a really nasty kind of like funky flavor.

78
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.360
But if you cook it under high heat, like really aggressive,

79
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:31.320
like that's why you have steakhouse broilers.

80
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.720
There's something about that Browning of that dry age meat that transforms that

81
00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:37.760
just like awakens your senses, you know? That's.

82
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.280
<v 0>Interesting. So you don't slow cook dry age meat. No.</v>

83
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.270
<v 1>I don't. It gets deliveryery it's almost like adelivery so if really, yeah.</v>

84
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.230
I don't, even, if anybody wants dry age above medium, I try to talk out,

85
00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:51.310
I'll cook it any way you want. But if you start cooking past medium,

86
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.150
it's almost like, you know, uh,

87
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.510
seeing someone like transform, like it, it just ages,

88
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.980
like when you cook it a long time,

89
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.260
it just ages and just turns into something else. It's just, it's nasty.

90
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:05.500
Those people.

91
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.580
<v 0>Who want, well done, steak are offensive. You should go and eat burger king,</v>

92
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.380
you monsters. What's wrong with you. When I hear,

93
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.740
when I go to dinner with someone, they order, well done steak. I just cringe.

94
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:18.180
Like, who am I eating?

95
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.460
<v 1>Yeah. Some it's a cultural thing. I notice too with some people like they,</v>

96
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.130
I just want cook, but if, if they want a well done steak,

97
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:27.650
then I recommend a wet age steak to do well done because you know, at least,

98
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.410
you know, you have a fighting chance for some type of flavor that.

99
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.090
<v 0>Would be be, but it's weird. Like why are you eating steak? Yep. Yep.</v>

100
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.450
<v 1>You know, it's true. It's, it's true. It's just, that's for me, you know,</v>

101
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.903
for everybody.

102
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.840
<v 0>It's a criminal to criminal act, you're wasting a piece of.</v>

103
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.320
<v 1>Meat. It's true. I kind of like, I kind of looked the other way. I mean,</v>

104
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:49.120
it's it's what do you it's ketchup with that? Yeah. It's, it's painful for me.

105
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:49.640
Yeah. You know.

106
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.800
<v 0>It's painful. I mean,</v>

107
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:54.680
some people grew up eating well done steak and that's how they like it.

108
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.720
Joey Diaz eats medium. Well, medium. Well I'm like, what are you doing?

109
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.680
&lt;laugh&gt; why it just doesn't taste as good.

110
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.920
Mm-m &lt;negative&gt; and it's also, there's an art to the perfect temperature, right?

111
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.680
What's the perfect internal temperature of a medium rare steak,

112
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.600
which should it be like 1 35 or something?

113
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.950
<v 1>No, it's, it's a bit less, but it's not necessarily a temperature.</v>

114
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.030
It's kind of like how you get there. Okay. Let me explain that to you. So, okay.

115
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.390
I have this method where particularly for thicker steaks where I'll cook it,

116
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.430
I start the cooking and then I get it to about 105

117
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:38.260
degrees. And then I allow it to rest at 105. And when ends up happening, I says,

118
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.100
I call the, at the, just like tempering of the meat and it basically,

119
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.420
it starts transmitting the, the temperature in, towards the center.

120
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.500
And then I put it back in again and then it will,

121
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.860
it'll it'll heat up the temperature if you like take it.

122
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.850
I would say from medium rare, even though like on many logs will say, okay,

123
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.570
1 21, 25 is rare, but it's not, you know, for me,

124
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.610
if you're gonna do that method, um, a solid medium rare will be about one 20.

125
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.800
Really?

126
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.810
<v 0>Yeah. So why do they think one 20 is rare? Like.</v>

127
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.650
<v 1>I don't really understand that exactly. You know, they'll get there.</v>

128
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.970
I think they're overshooting it. Um, particularly for me, it's not rare,

129
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.320
like rare is, is,

130
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.640
is one 10 using the method that I use.

131
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.680
<v 0>Now. Different people have different methods, which is really,</v>

132
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.920
what's fascinating about cooking meat. Um, I ate at, uh,

133
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.920
a couple times I've eaten at, uh, bizarre meats. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; in Vegas.

134
00:07:31.921 --> 00:07:34.720
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, which is a fantastic restaurant. Yes. Fantastic. My.

135
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.080
<v 1>Chef. Wasands.</v>

136
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.510
<v 0>Amazing. It's an amazing place too. Well, you walk in there. It's just visually,</v>

137
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:45.150
it's really interesting because they, they have these grills with live logs.

138
00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:48.630
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I mean, they take not live honestly, but they take logs.

139
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.430
Yeah. They're cooking all over fire. Yeah. And they have these greats,

140
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:56.550
these grill grates that rise and, and lower. And um, you know,

141
00:07:56.551 --> 00:07:59.540
you could see how they're doing it when you walk in the door,

142
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:01.860
like as you're walking to your table, you're passing by. Yeah.

143
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.140
And this method of this idea of cooking over, uh, logs,

144
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.020
like cooking over fire. Some people prefer that.

145
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.940
And then some people like those crazy broilers where they're gas,

146
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.650
but the broiler it's on top and you steak in and it's lowering down exactly.

147
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.450
Like what is the, is there a difference and why.

148
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.290
<v 1>It really comes down to, um, what your taste preference is. Okay.</v>

149
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.010
For me, like where I'm at right now, dry age,

150
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.810
without any type of smoke or wood is more preferable because I really want to

151
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:38.010
taste the dry age when you start getting into the wood fire, cooking,

152
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.440
and you're burning, um, uh, logs that aren't burnt out.

153
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.920
I like to cook basically my wood down to charcoal, like to Ash. Um,

154
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.720
so that it's cleaner. Okay. So then you really taste the meat when you start,

155
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.680
you know, burning UN unburnt fuel, you know, the, themselves,

156
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.640
it has like these creosos and different flavor compounds that will get on the

157
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:03.280
meat. And it's just, it kind of just like coats, your pallet. So for dry,

158
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.400
I like that from a wet age beef. Okay. But for the dry age,

159
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.720
I really like cleaner. I like the steakhouse broiler. I like using a planche,

160
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.640
you know, and that's just like a heated piece of steel. It's like,

161
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.350
you can do that in home with the cast iron. I'm kidding. Well,

162
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:18.110
it's called a plcher plancha, you know,

163
00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:21.990
it's just kind of like this flat sheet of steel mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, uh,

164
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.190
it's all about crust development and surface contact. So like,

165
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.070
I like to cut the steaks on a saw, so it's a perfect line.

166
00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:32.470
And it's all about contact direct with the surface.

167
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.300
It's about the Browning of the meat. You, you know,

168
00:09:35.301 --> 00:09:38.140
if you're going to get in there and you're gonna cook over, um,

169
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.980
live wood like that, he's doing it obviously. Right. Cuz he's amazing.

170
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.020
But you know, when you raise and lower the shelf, like I was saying,

171
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.580
how I rest it mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, you can start on the higher,

172
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.700
higher level of the heat and then you bring it up higher. Um,

173
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.930
the actual grill higher and it's actually resting while still getting like the

174
00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:58.610
tickle of, of heat up there.

175
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.130
<v 0>The tickle.</v>

176
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.890
<v 1>Of heat. Yeah. So I imagine like, so the flames won't actually touch the meat.</v>

177
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.570
It kind of tickles it.

178
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.570
So it's kind of like it kind of Whis at the bottom of the meat.

179
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.530
<v 0>And so the way he's doing it, it bizarre meats he's using wet age sticks.</v>

180
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:18.280
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; cuz that's how you would cook over or over that kind of, I.

181
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.840
<v 1>Don't know if he's doing it. That's my personal preference. I mean,</v>

182
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.680
I think he do some aging. He does do some aging, I believe over there. So.

183
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.480
<v 0>I mean, but it's, it's just,</v>

184
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.600
I've watched YouTube videos and how to cook the perfect steak.

185
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.640
You can watch three different videos and three different chefs and there's three

186
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:34.320
different methods and like, well.

187
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.870
<v 1>Same thing about dry aging though. I mean all dry aging is not created equal.</v>

188
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.150
I call it an environmental chamber.

189
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.990
So think about it like making cheese in France, you say, Hey,

190
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.710
I ought a goat cheese and you think you'd get one type of goat cheese across the

191
00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:48.750
line. I'm creating an environment, just like a cheese maker. Okay.

192
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:52.830
That's unique to my own. I actually have the culture from like 15,

193
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:56.670
16 years ago that I've traveled with, you.

194
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.260
<v 0>Know, put, hold on, you put culture.</v>

195
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.620
<v 1>So yeah, I've, I've like a method.</v>

196
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.140
I basically take meat that has been aged and I bring those

197
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.740
spores if you will, from that aging meat, cuz you know, there's a mold on it.

198
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:13.060
It's a friendly mold and it's a friendly mold. Yeah. I like it.

199
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.260
I don't wanna like &lt;laugh&gt; I don't wanna like, you know,

200
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.730
turn people off to it because this has been, I.

201
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.450
<v 0>Didn't know that you brought your own mold. Yeah. So I,</v>

202
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.530
I just figured you just let it dry age.

203
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.450
<v 1>It's not as, it's not as simple as that for me.</v>

204
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.530
Like it's each environment again.

205
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.690
So I get away from like someone can turn around and say like my dry age is

206
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.250
incredibly clean at a hundred, a hundred days, 120 days. Um,

207
00:11:37.251 --> 00:11:41.680
because I get the there slowly. Um, my temperature's very low. I like to,

208
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.840
you know, dry age of 32 to 35 degrees. I like a higher humidity.

209
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.720
So I don't dehydrate the meat too soon. I like 85%,

210
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.520
sometimes a little bit lower if I wanna pull. It's really depends. You know?

211
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.640
So when lots.

212
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.080
<v 0>Of fans, so when you say the cult,</v>

213
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.920
like how are you bringing this culture in and how do you get it to interact with

214
00:11:58.921 --> 00:11:59.480
the meat? I.

215
00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.840
<v 1>Basically take, um, I take pieces from the previous,</v>

216
00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.440
you know, dry age room and I bring it to that.

217
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.160
And so I put it up by the fan and it will circulate spores. You.

218
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.910
<v 0>Put it by the fan, like how do you.</v>

219
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.870
<v 1>Do that? Well, there's um, a fan in, in a, in a cooler Uh-huh and uh,</v>

220
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.110
it's blowing around. It's like blowing the, so it'll blow the,

221
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:25.630
the spores around the room. So my dry age has a unique flavor. You know, my try,

222
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.910
you know, some great guys who like masterveors in the Bronx,

223
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.460
which is these guys like my heroes, you know, they taught me practically aging.

224
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.060
Um, they have their own flavors. So their dry age tastes different. You know,

225
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.580
pat lafria's another New York guy does amazing dry age beef as well. You know,

226
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.420
his has a different flavor. So, you know, for me,

227
00:12:44.421 --> 00:12:47.300
that's why I take a lot of pride even though it's not the most cost effective

228
00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:49.820
thing to carry, you know, a hundred thousand dollars in inventory.

229
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.460
But it gives me unique flavor profile. That is,

230
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.010
is my unique selling point for my restaurant.

231
00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:01.570
<v 0>So you have these pieces. So like those stakes that we saw on that photograph,</v>

232
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.530
you would take one of those dry age stakes when it's ready and then you would

233
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:09.610
trim the pieces off. Then you'd use those pieces, those darkened pieces. Yeah.

234
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:11.610
Which just has the spores on it. And that would,

235
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.410
how do you know how much to put in there?

236
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.120
<v 1>I put a, as much as I can, you know, I'm really, I don't want it too.</v>

237
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.960
Like clean, clean in there. I want it to be an environment. So it's like a cave.

238
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.160
Um, and uh, you know,

239
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.000
I'll put a couple of trays in and then I I'm very tactile. So I'll,

240
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:31.000
I'll touch the meat and I'll, I'll feel it and you know, I'll taste it.

241
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.480
I'll see where we're at. I'm always cutting into a steak. It's like a lot, like.

242
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.270
<v 0>When you say taste it, like you cook it.</v>

243
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.270
<v 1>Yeah. Like I'll cut off a piece. Like how are we looking at 30 days?</v>

244
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:44.230
How are we looking at 50 days? So each room is different because, um, you know,

245
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:49.550
I had, uh, tried a room in Vegas and we had, you know, ceilings that were 30,

246
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.270
35 feet, a lot of circulating air. It was just,

247
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.460
it was just like had a different flavor per profile.

248
00:13:55.461 --> 00:14:00.060
We were able to age 150 days and that was like our sweet spot.

249
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:05.020
Okay. And then here in, in Hollywood, it's a lot less, I have a lower ceiling.

250
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.500
It, it circulates differently. It's just, you have to really kind of taste.

251
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.580
It's not just like, Hey, I have dry age or you go to the supermarket. It's like,

252
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:15.500
oh, you sell dry age. Okay, great. I'll take it. And if you,

253
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.530
you think that's what it tastes like. It's a good indicator of what it is.

254
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.010
But if you really want to get, you know, like down to it, you know,

255
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.090
each dryage can taste a lot different.

256
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.730
<v 0>That's so that that's really weird. So it's,</v>

257
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.050
it's very experimental in a lot of ways.

258
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.970
<v 1>It's constantly moving. I, how long.</v>

259
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:35.930
<v 0>Did it take you to dial it in?</v>

260
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.280
<v 1>Well, when I first did it, it was really by mistake,</v>

261
00:14:40.281 --> 00:14:43.080
particularly the extended age, cuz you just weren't selling the meat.

262
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:47.400
So I had a couple of PE, a lot of pieces like, like left, you know,

263
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.200
back for a long time. And you know, I was like,

264
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.240
I TA I cut into it and I taste and it's like, whoa, I mean, this is incredible.

265
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.720
And I was talking to the old school guys who, dry age, like, oh,

266
00:14:57.721 --> 00:15:02.160
you're wasting your money. Nobody wants steak over 42 days. You know,

267
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.320
it's just de hydratying whatever. I was like, no, I thinkmont is something,

268
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.880
you know, there's a, there's a big difference here in the flavor.

269
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.150
And as you know, we would see like a huge difference,

270
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.230
a jump into flavor and like good quality. Not like the funky stuff, like the,

271
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.590
the full year that like that's another level. That's, it's very.

272
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.790
<v 0>Good though. You say funky and I wanna, I just wanna clarify to people.</v>

273
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.750
It is delicious. It is delicious, but it's UN unusual.

274
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.230
It's like you're eating something from Africa.

275
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.460
Like you some unusual kudo meat or something like that. Some strange game. Yeah.

276
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:33.080
It's gotta.

277
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.740
<v 1>And you only wanna, you don't wanna eat too much.</v>

278
00:15:34.741 --> 00:15:36.580
Like people want like a whole steak. I'm like, no,

279
00:15:36.581 --> 00:15:41.420
you just want two slices of it. Savor it like a fine wine. Understand it,

280
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.740
get to know it. But don't like hunker down.

281
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.500
<v 0>On it. How come you don't want people to hunker down on it? Because.</v>

282
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:50.420
<v 1>Sometimes too much of a good thing is not good. Okay.</v>

283
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.330
I same thing also for, for the Japanese WAU, like, oh,

284
00:15:54.331 --> 00:15:57.730
you see all that fat and the marvelization it's incredibly rich.

285
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.770
And if you eat it like a westerner, it's not right. It's just,

286
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.090
it's too much. So certain steaks, certain types of beef,

287
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.010
you should be eating only a small amount and appreciating anything more.

288
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.720
Like you just, it's just, I don't know.

289
00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:16.240
It gets me it's it's too much for me. When did.

290
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.120
<v 0>People start dry aging a year? Like when, when did this really?</v>

291
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.080
Cuz this is not something, I mean obviously I know nothing about restaurants.

292
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:26.280
Yeah. Other than that, they're great. &lt;laugh&gt; but yeah,

293
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.720
but when I had heard about dry aging, I would hear like 30 days,

294
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.430
dry age, exceed days, dry age. I never heard of a year. Like,

295
00:16:35.431 --> 00:16:36.390
is this a new thing?

296
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.590
<v 1>Um, you know, they were doing it in Spain for some time,</v>

297
00:16:40.591 --> 00:16:44.310
particularly with the older animals, like the oxin, um, you know,

298
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.590
animals that are five years, eight years, 10 years old.

299
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.350
And they would age these for long periods of time.

300
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.750
I was not aware of this when I started doing it,

301
00:16:52.751 --> 00:16:56.260
but they were the first people that I heard about it was doing it while I was

302
00:16:56.261 --> 00:16:58.460
doing it. There was amazing, uh, food writer,

303
00:16:58.461 --> 00:17:02.460
Jeffrey Steingart who just like dialed into me. And uh,

304
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.540
we did a tasting with one of my culinary heroes, uh, Harold McGee, um,

305
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.540
who wrote the incredible book on food and cooking,

306
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:13.890
which is a scientific manual to all chefs around, um, he's amazing guy eye.

307
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:19.450
And he had put in his book that there's really no difference in flavor when you

308
00:17:19.451 --> 00:17:22.970
get to that, that point. And so that later stage,

309
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:27.090
so we cook three steaks and we cut a cube out of the center of it.

310
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.210
And at that point, you know, he says, wait, maybe there is something different.

311
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.250
Um, I'm not sure. I mean,

312
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.120
nowadays you hear more about out it because we're chefs.

313
00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:39.880
We like to play with things. We like to push the limits on things. But um,

314
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.520
not many people want to make the commitment cuz it's so costly to carry the

315
00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:48.240
inventory and they're scared to actually do it because if you screw it up,

316
00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.560
you know, you lose all the money. So, um, I see more of it now,

317
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.400
but back when I was doing it,

318
00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:00.120
there really wasn't anybody else pushing the limits, maybe a few people.

319
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.520
I don't wanna say like I was the only one, but you know,

320
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.200
possibly there could have been a few people, but you know.

321
00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:17.050
