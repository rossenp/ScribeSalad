00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.760
<v 1>So, uh, what do you remember from that moment on,</v>

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.000
uh, when I, when I regained consciousness, it wasn't real quick.

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.520
It wasn't real walking right up. Um,

5
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.910
it was real slow. It was dim. Uh,

6
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.790
my consciousness was kind of like in and out for a while.

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.510
I didn't know where I was

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.950
the pain and the feeling that I was mortally

9
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:37.270
wounded, something, uh, something was so wrong inside. I,

10
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.300
I felt like I was dying and this is what real fueled the

11
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:46.340
panic. When I finally laid eyes on these creatures,

12
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.980
uh, of course, you know, all of the

13
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.500
mental programming that we get from Hollywood that, uh,

14
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.580
aliens are invading monsters, you know, didn't help. Uh,

15
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.570
I instantly associated this feeling of,

16
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.570
of dying with pain with them.

17
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.050
So I was combative immediately. Uh,

18
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.650
where were you? I was lying on my back on a raised table.

19
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.320
There was a light above me. Um,

20
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.160
it was not real bright. It was, um, not so bright that I couldn't,

21
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.480
um, you know, see the outline of the, of the fixture,

22
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.480
but, uh, what did the fixture look like? Kinda like that only much larger.

23
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.910
Um, just a saw, uh, glow and,

24
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.510
uh, in the movie,

25
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.110
there's a little bit of striking on the part of the aliens,

26
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.830
uh, against me. Uh, that didn't happen. I lashed out at them,

27
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.310
no one closest to me. I, I, I felt really weak.

28
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.100
I didn't have enough strength to, to do much. So when I,

29
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.620
my arm contacted him,

30
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.620
he just fell back very unexpectedly,

31
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:14.380
easy into the other one.

32
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.340
And I rolled off the table in the other direction. And,

33
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.453
uh,

34
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.130
they came around table and the three of them were coming towards me.

35
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.730
And I just grabbed something from behind me, an object off of the,

36
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.290
uh, shelf there and started swinging it at them. What was the object?

37
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.690
It was just some large, uh, long cylinder or rod,

38
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.800
uh, glass, some clear material.

39
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.520
I wasn't studying it.

40
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.280
I was looking at them and swinging wildly screaming threats.

41
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.703
They stopped.

42
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.480
And I was planning on attacking more fully,

43
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.000
just making way past them.

44
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.360
The only doorway I could see was on the other side of them. And it looked.

45
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.193
<v 2>Like a doorway.</v>

46
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.600
<v 1>Yeah. It looked like a doorway, just a, you know.</v>

47
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.553
<v 2>And what did they look like?</v>

48
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.950
<v 1>Uh, I guess it's a pretty typical description nowaday, uh,</v>

49
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.990
very large eyes, uh, hairless, um,

50
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.430
Two eyes, nose, mouth. I didn't see them

51
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.260
speak or no change in the expressions &lt;affirmative&gt;

52
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.100
and, uh, to me that, uh, in,

53
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.780
in the face of all the screaming and, uh, the fear that I was, uh,

54
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.380
projecting, uh, their lack of reaction, probably just added to my panic.

55
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.360
But, uh.

56
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.570
<v 2>Did they feel like they were a living creature or did they feel like they were a</v>

57
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:01.080
robot?

58
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.410
<v 1>Like, well, they were without expression. I'll say that, but you know,</v>

59
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:09.690
I've had 45 years to think about that in more recent years, I think. Well, maybe

60
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.050
if they're telepathic

61
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.130
and it's developed enough to where they don't need to talk,

62
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.840
they also don't need facial expression. Right.

63
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.880
And so their ability to communicate with each other would be much richer and

64
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:29.600
more complete than we have and

65
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.680
speech and frown or smiles or whatever would become obsolete pretty quick.

66
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.080
<v 2>Yeah. Well that is, uh, a theory about where human beings are headed.</v>

67
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.870
If we continue to evolve that we will,

68
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.830
one day reach this point where the biological limitations of our monkey

69
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.710
bodies will slowly start to fade away and we'll have different abilities,

70
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.710
different abilities.

71
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.830
<v 1>To communicate, well, why would we need to, uh, frown or smile if,</v>

72
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.630
if you can save much more.

73
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.460
<v 2>And also their, their musculature did their musculature,</v>

74
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.180
did they look like smooth? Like they had no, no clear muscles.

75
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.620
<v 1>Yeah. They were pretty smooth, very light. When I, when I hit the,</v>

76
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.940
w it fell back into the other one pretty easily. It like,

77
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.620
he weighed hardly anything like a little kid.

78
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:19.763
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

79
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.090
<v 1>That was most terrifying experience of my life. But when I,</v>

80
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:29.890
when I tell this story and, and try to relate to people,

81
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.450
I'm trying to communicate what I experienced, how utterly,

82
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.010
utterly traumatic that was and how it was so devastating. I was, you know,

83
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.480
on the verge of catatonic for weeks after it happened. But, uh,

84
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.520
uh, I don't, I don't want to relate this story in order to,

85
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.673
uh,

86
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.440
inspire fear because I've had enough time to think about it

87
00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.520
that I think that it was unwarranted, that my reaction was, uh,

88
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.280
just due to my ignorance of the situation. Um,

89
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.960
the fact that I was returned at all is pretty significant, you know? Yeah. Uh,

90
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.830
the idea that these beings are just, uh, kid people, Willy Ellie,

91
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.630
and doing terrible things to 'em. I, I don't subscribe to that theory.

92
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.390
Now.

93
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.030
I try to separate what I actually experienced from things that I've concluded

94
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.430
just from thinking about it. But it seems to me that,

95
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.070
uh, I mean, they've been seeing, uh,

96
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.740
I'm sure if there'd been sightings for all, you know, before I was.

97
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.540
<v 2>Born, had you heard of the Betty and Barney hill story before you were abducted?</v>

98
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.420
<v 1>Uh, I probably had, uh, but if I,</v>

99
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.860
I thought if they had some sort of sinister intentions,

100
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.130
it'd be a Dundee, they wouldn't be sneaking around hiding and, uh, right. Um,

101
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.490
yeah, I, I believe with that level of technology, look at it this way,

102
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.050
human beings,

103
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.250
just virtually everything technological that we have is just a few hundred years

104
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.490
old before that the most technological thing we had was fire.

105
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.600
And just, uh, the last, uh,

106
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.883
50 years,

107
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.240
the progress of our science has grown to far

108
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:32.440
overshadow everything we had accomplished in thousands of years before that.

109
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.760
So I'm thinking, um,

110
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.430
what astronomers tell us about these other star system is that they could be

111
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.910
hundreds of thousands, millions, or maybe billions of years older than us.

112
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.630
So if we accomplished the kind of technology that we have

113
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.083
in a few decades,

114
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.110
what is possible with millions of years of development, um,

115
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.300
and we couldn't begin and to recognize what they're capable of. Right. Uh,

116
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.980
so I think it's presumptuous for people to say, oh, they could never do that.

117
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.980
<v 2>It really is a, an interesting conundrum because we know what we can do.</v>

118
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.580
And we know where we came from.

119
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.260
We have a very clear history of technology when it comes to humans.

120
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.940
And we also know that there are planets,

121
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.250
so rounding stars all throughout our galaxy and all throughout the universe,

122
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.290
but we're still skeptical. It's so funny. And so, yeah, it is, it is,

123
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.690
but for a guy like you who's actually encountered it,

124
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.250
even though you saw it, it, it had to not seem real.

125
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.240
<v 1>Oh yeah. Your questioning your sanity for sure. I mean, it, it was like, uh,</v>

126
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.880
I was, uh, practically CATA Toga for days afterwards.
