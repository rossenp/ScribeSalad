00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. So, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.310
I've been reading your book man tribe. I really enjoy it. It's really good.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.510
And it's it's so, uh, it resonates. It's very interesting. I will,

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.830
into the first chapter I wanted to move in with the native Americans. That was,

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.070
it was such a, I mean, it was, uh,

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.880
one of the more interesting aspects of it was something that I didn't know

7
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.500
about, which was, uh,

8
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.670
the European settlers that had been kidnapped and were living with the native

9
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:34.110
Americans. And then when they were rescued, many of them wanted to go back.

10
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.000
<v 1>Yeah. Or they would go into hiding.</v>

11
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:39.300
So they wouldn't have to be repatriated to colonial society.

12
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:41.490
They wanted to stay with their adopted tribes and there,

13
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.280
and there was also a lot of, um,

14
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.720
a lot of young white people, particularly white men, but young women too,

15
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:53.490
who basically absconded across the frontier into tribal society. Uh,

16
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.070
they, they fled white society. They didn't like it.

17
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:58.710
And as Benjamin Franklin pointed out,

18
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:02.790
we have lots of [inaudible] young colonials fleeing to the Indians.

19
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:07.170
And we have not one example of an Indian as they were called fleeing to white

20
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:08.004
society.

21
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.530
<v 0>Yeah. That was one of the more fascinating aspects of it.</v>

22
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:11.820
I didn't anticipate that.

23
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.720
I thought that there would be a lot of native Americans, so it'd be like, wow,

24
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.450
this is a way better. Look at all the food. Look at the houses.

25
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.980
<v 1>I mean, they had plenty of food, you know, whatever there sucks. It sucks.</v>

26
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:24.780
I was very successful society. In fact, they were,

27
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.430
they had better nutrition than the whites that, um, uh, a more very diet,

28
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.650
um, and a much, much more egalitarian society, uh, than colonial society.

29
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.050
<v 0>That was also interesting about it. Well, um,</v>

30
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.190
when you were talking about the women that had moved in with the native

31
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:45.240
Americans and were expressing how much more freedom they experienced.

32
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.480
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, Indian society, native society,</v>

33
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:52.020
wasn't crushed by Christian morality. So you could divorce,

34
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:53.970
you could marry as a woman, you can marry whom you wanted.

35
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:56.580
You could get divorced, you could do whatever you wanted. It was very,

36
00:01:56.581 --> 00:02:00.510
very Galatarian. What they've shown is that, um, the,

37
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.820
in societies where everyone is necessary for food production, food production,

38
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.550
uh, everyone, more or less equal. And in agrarian societies,

39
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.040
agricultural societies, industrial societies,

40
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.320
you have large segments of the population.

41
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.040
Often women who are not involved in food production and they're involved in

42
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:23.970
reproduction. And so they're, um, equality goes down.

43
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.940
<v 0>Wow, it's just,</v>

44
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:31.920
it's almost like society as we've created over the last couple of hundred

45
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:35.430
years is almost totally incompatible with,

46
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.590
with human genetics or with the human body or the human

47
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:41.820
spirit or whatever.

48
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.450
<v 1>Well, if you look at, um, I mean, genetics are complicated. I mean,</v>

49
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:48.360
obviously on some level, industrials is modern societies, very successful.

50
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:51.570
We have 7 billion of us. Um, uh,

51
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.020
but as wealth goes up in a society,

52
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:58.350
as modernity goes up into society, the suicide rate goes up.

53
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.430
The rate goes up, schizophrenia goes up, uh, in urban environments.

54
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.600
Um, they're not good for the human psyche. We are designed,

55
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.620
we evolve the live in groups of 30, 40 people in a harsh environment,

56
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.740
totally into reliant on one another for survival. Uh,

57
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:18.160
that creates a huge amount of equality within a group and loyalty within a

58
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.310
group. That's what we are designed for genetically, uh,

59
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.450
modern society allows the individual to be independent from the group,

60
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.030
which is in some ways a great liberation, uh,

61
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.330
and other ways it can lead to a profound alienation and depression.

62
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.500
<v 0>Yeah. It's, uh, it's just a very confusing thing.</v>

63
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:39.850
It seems for people to be amongst so many people, but to be alone.

64
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.081
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

65
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:45.820
we're not wired to be confronted with strangers all day long.

66
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.220
And I live in New York city and I love New York city. Um, but all day long, you,

67
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.030
you encounter strangers and you don't, and you don't recognize anybody.

68
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:56.740
So you can be alone in a crowd,

69
00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:00.640
which is not something that human beings have experienced until quite recently

70
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:01.474
in their history.

71
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.520
<v 0>Yeah. Um, that was,</v>

72
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.250
I think one of the more disturbing parts about this idea that these people, um,

73
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.360
were, uh, kidnapped by the native Americans and wanted to stay with them,

74
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.040
was that whatever that native American life was like,

75
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.700
however they were living, that just seemed to just resonate with them.

76
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:24.670
It seemed to, it seemed to be what was right.

77
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.170
<v 1>Well, we're, we're wired to want to feel like we belong to a group. Uh,</v>

78
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.100
native American society was, uh, sexually, uh, quite relaxed.

79
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.720
I was quite a Galatarian um, in a hunter gatherer society,

80
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:42.310
you really can't accumulate wealth very well because these societies are often

81
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:45.130
nomadic. So you can only accumulate as much wealth as you can carry,

82
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:49.990
which isn't much. Um, and, and ultimately in societies like that,

83
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.420
uh, as in a platoon in combat, which is another part of my book, obviously, um,

84
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.021
you're, you're,

85
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:59.440
you're primarily value valued for your contribution to the group.

86
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.480
And that has been lost in modern society. People are enormously self-serving,

87
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.690
uh, capitalism basically instructs us to do so. Uh,

88
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:10.990
that's a whole other evolutionary imperative, which is also important,

89
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:12.640
but in our society is way out of whack.

90
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:17.620
So we are wired to serve ourselves and we are wired to serve the group and in

91
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:19.060
a healthy society, those two,

92
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.790
those two are in a dynamic tension with each other.

93
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:26.080
And in balance in modern society, there really is no group to serve. Uh,

94
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.660
and it leads to a really profound sense of, um,

95
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.060
meaninglessness for a lot of people.

96
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.670
<v 0>Yeah. I also found it pretty fascinating that when you were really young, you,</v>

97
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.640
when you, when you were working, I think you said you were working construction.

98
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:39.940
So what it.

99
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.880
<v 1>Was, uh, I'm trying to remember the story you were about to you, you were.</v>

100
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.080
<v 0>Talking to,</v>

101
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.560
you were just saying that you were talking to someone you were working with and

102
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:50.140
they were telling you to slow down because some of us,

103
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.970
some of us have to do this for a lifetime.

104
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.700
<v 1>I heard about that story. Yeah. Yeah. I was on a construction, grew a,</v>

105
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.710
it was a highway department of my town. And, you know,

106
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:59.990
a lot of these guys were kind of lifers in the department,

107
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:04.460
not a particularly challenging job, um, in, in a sense, uh,

108
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.910
but you were on your feet all day long in the sun or whatever. And, and so, uh,

109
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.410
you know, I was a young guy and I, you know,

110
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.590
I wanted to sort of prove my metal or whatever I was, I was,

111
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.500
we were digging a trench and I was digging like crazy. And, uh,

112
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.860
and an older guy came up to me, you know, he's probably in his sixties,

113
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.250
he came up to me and clapped me on the shoulder. He said, son, uh,

114
00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:22.670
you want to slow down there? You know,

115
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.900
some of us are going to have to do this job, our whole lives.

116
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.410
And he knew I was a college kid. He knew I wasn't going to. Right. Um,

117
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.560
and I said, just slow down. You know, no one needs to work as fast.

118
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.010
<v 0>It just a,</v>

119
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.710
it was a really interesting that you were longing for something you were saying,

120
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:42.410
like almost to go wrong. So everybody had a band together,

121
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:44.600
whether it was a hurricane or something, and that,

122
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:49.580
that mundane life of just work and doing things you don't really want to

123
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:50.414
do.

124
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.561
<v 1>Well. I mean,</v>

125
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:55.400
the irony about modern society is that it has removed hardship and danger from

126
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:56.300
everyday life.

127
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.160
And it's in the face of hardship and danger that people come to understand their

128
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:05.030
value to their society and theirs. They get their sense of meaning from that.

129
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:09.320
And so what you have is when, you know, during the blitz in London,

130
00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:12.680
for example, um, 30,000 people were killed by German bombs.

131
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:15.740
It was a horror show over the course of six months. It was gasoline,

132
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.280
but people were sleeping shoulder to shoulder in the tube stations and putting

133
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:21.940
out fires with bucket brigades and digging people out of rubble. And,

134
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.170
and they were acting as a unified society.

135
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.820
And the English government was prepared for mass psychiatric casualties because

136
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:32.450
as a civilian population getting bombed to bits and the opposite happened,

137
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:33.500
admissions to psych wards,

138
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:38.210
went down during the blitz and then back up after the bombing stop. And, um,

139
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.580
and then afterwards there was an enormous nostalgia in England for the blitz for

140
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:45.320
those days. Uh, um,

141
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.300
as tragic as they were because English society felt, um,

142
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.330
people felt like they were together. Um, later I was,

143
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:56.510
I went back to Sarajevo where I'd been during the siege of Sarajevo in the early

144
00:07:56.511 --> 00:07:59.630
nineties and civilians, uh, would tell me, you know,

145
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:02.030
this is 20 years later or 20 years after the war. He would say, you know,

146
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.720
a lot of us missed the war because we were better people back then we took care

147
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:06.554
of each other.

148
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.480
<v 0>I've talked about that with September 11th. Um, I went to New York city, um,</v>

149
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.710
about, I guess it was maybe six months after September 11th. And, uh,

150
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.450
I was there a couple of times and the, before September 11th,

151
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.830
then after September 11th,

152
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:24.290
there was a very clear difference in the way people were behaving.

153
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.580
People seem to be more, more friendly, more open.

154
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.170
They were really appreciative of first responders. Um,

155
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.240
I was there once in a friend of mine, she fainted.

156
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.720
And so they called the fire department, came to check her out. And,

157
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.100
and when the firemen showed up, man, you would think superhero showed up.

158
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.740
It was amazing. Everybody was so happy to see him.

159
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.720
And it was in stark contrast to the way people used to behave and treat each

160
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:54.980
other. And it was directly because of having experienced this horrific.

161
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.190
<v 1>Well,</v>

162
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.960
adversity produces PR pro social behaviors and people,

163
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.120
adversity makes people act well. Uh, the lack of adversity,

164
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:11.010
safety and comfort allow people to act selfishly. Uh, so after nine 11, um,

165
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.710
the suicide rate went down in New York. Uh,

166
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.020
the violent crime rate went down in New York.

167
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.820
Vietnam bats reported that their PTSD symptoms went down after nine 11.

168
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.030
Um, what happens is, um,

169
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.390
people suddenly feel that they're needed by their society, by their people.

170
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.260
And if you feel needed, you are able to, um,

171
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.830
ignore your own personal troubles. As when someone in England, uh,

172
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.910
an efficient and English official said, uh, during the blitz in London, um,

173
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.740
he said, it's amazing.

174
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:44.550
We have the chronic neurotics of peacetime driving ambulances. Um,

175
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.070
and if you think about in terms of evolution,

176
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:51.510
if adversity in danger produced bad human behaviors, we wouldn't be here today.

177
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.890
Another way to say that is we are the descendants of the individuals a hundred

178
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:58.110
thousand years ago, who acted well in a crisis.

179
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.280
The people that acted badly in a crisis and just took care of themselves and

180
00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:05.460
didn't take care of their people, their group, those, those people,

181
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.490
those groups died out. Uh, it's people,

182
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:13.350
it's groups that encourage a form of altruism and souks self-sacrifice of

183
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:17.270
individuals for the group. During a crisis, those groups survive. The,

184
00:10:17.271 --> 00:10:19.230
that DNA gets passed onto us.
