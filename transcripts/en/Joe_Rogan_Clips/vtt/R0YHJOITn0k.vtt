1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>What's up Mo what's up, buddy. Good to see you, man. Good to see you.</v>

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.650
I'm glad we decided to get together and do this, you know, and, and talk.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.510
And, um, you know, it's so crazy subject, right? I mean,

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.700
uh, you and I have known each other for since 2012, when, uh, I did meet eater.

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.280
You were there filming when I shot my first deer,

6
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.230
which is very important part of my life, man. And, um, then you went on to,

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.450
uh, direct and produce parts on known with our late friend Anthony Bordain. And,

8
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.290
uh, we just thought it'd probably be good thing to come in here and just talk,

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.453
talk about.

10
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.380
<v 1>Yeah, man. And, uh, and I'm really grateful for it. You know, it's actually,</v>

11
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.040
you know, a lot of people, um, who've been saying to me like, oh,

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.540
it must be really hard to talk about that.

13
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:50.820
And that's really it's I actually find it kind of the opposite.

14
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.790
Like I want to talk about him.

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.390
I want to talk about who he was and what that experience was, you know? So,

16
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.453
um, thanks, man.

17
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.320
<v 0>My pleasure brother. Did you,</v>

18
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.050
did you know him before you guys started working together?

19
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.540
<v 1>No. No. I met Tony, uh, 10 years ago and I was called in,</v>

20
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.760
uh, he had a, uh, DP on a show who at the last minute canceled,

21
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.320
couldn't go to Egypt. So, uh, I got a call like a week before, you know,

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.170
it's like, do you want to go to Egypt with Anthony Bordain? I was like, you're,

23
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.810
absolutely. Right. You know? Um, and, uh, and so I met him in Cairo,

24
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:30.720
man. Like, you know, we kinda like perfect. Yeah. Holy.

25
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.950
<v 0>That's like Indiana Jones.</v>

26
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.643
<v 1>Exactly.</v>

27
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.230
<v 0>Episode when you guys ate a camel. No.</v>

28
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.820
<v 1>No, we didn't need a cam. No, but, um, you know,</v>

29
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.730
uh, I met him there, you know,

30
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:48.480
we started filming or on the streets of Cairo and like, you know,

31
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.730
it's like all of a sudden it's thrown into these kitchens. They're just like,

32
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.620
we're eating pigeon, you know, it's like go in, cover them cooking pigeon. And,

33
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.080
you know, I had seen the show like maybe once before, but I had,

34
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.460
I knew who he was and I knew what that adventure was. Right. You know,

35
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:05.730
and I was so amped for it. Um,

36
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.720
and then there was like this seminal moment on that show where, uh,

37
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.310
we go out and we,

38
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.170
we go ripping across the desert with the Bedouin and go out and cook a goat,

39
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.110
uh, in the ground, you know? Um,

40
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.220
and so as we're driving out over the desert, we're like, well, we need to,

41
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.470
we need some shots from car to car. Right. And I was like, oh,

42
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.650
I'll get on the roof. You know? And, uh, and there's like this for,

43
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:33.570
for some reason, there's a four post bed tied to the roof of this, a land Rover.

44
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.920
And so I get up there and kinda like, you know, latch my arm around it.

45
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:42.240
And these guys take off at, I swear, 80 miles an hour across the desert. I mean,

46
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.590
and you're on a bed.

47
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.543
<v 0>Absolutely.</v>

48
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.940
<v 1>Absolutely no regard for the fact that like I'm on the roof, you know,</v>

49
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.220
um, shooting. And, uh, and when we got there, we got to camp,

50
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.230
I survived it. Um,

51
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.840
I had this big black blue where I was holding onto the four post bed and I go

52
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:05.890
over and I show Tony. And, um, that was it, man,

53
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.250
from that moment on, it was, he was like,

54
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.190
I liked this guy and I started going out with him, you know,

55
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:16.390
I started getting invited to do more shows. Wow. So how was it?

56
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.530
How many years? 10 years. Wow. 10 years. Yeah.

57
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.430
<v 0>That's crazy. I didn't realize that parts unknown was even an oil. Well,</v>

58
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:25.960
you doing no reservations first.

59
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.800
<v 1>It was a no reservation show. And then we went to parts unknown, uh,</v>

60
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.570
five years ago. Wow.

61
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.270
<v 0>Yeah. So parts of no has been on for five years.</v>

62
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.200
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And that, uh, you know, that transition, no,</v>

63
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.000
no reservation was great. Uh,

64
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.830
and it really laid the foundation for what we do, what Tony did.

65
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.760
Um, I think it really built an audience and a following for him. Um,

66
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.910
that's where I found out about him. Right. Exactly. It was a great show,

67
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.280
you know? Um, but that,

68
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.450
like that transition going on to CNI and going into parts, unknown that really,

69
00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.980
um, that really changed things.

70
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:04.510
So it really opened up a lot of locations and stuff that we didn't have access

71
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:08.830
to before it opened up, you know, kind of CNN's, um,

72
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.980
logistics, uh, Rolodex and, you know,

73
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:16.660
things that we didn't have, uh, at the other network, you know? And,

74
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.290
uh, and so that's, you know, no reservations was awesome.

75
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:24.130
We did some incredible shows, uh, parts of unknowns where you got really fun.

76
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.700
<v 0>Yeah. That was on another level. I remember watching the change up there. Okay.</v>

77
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:30.220
This is more, more him, you know,

78
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.660
everything from the opening music to the tone of it and the narration. Yeah.

79
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.380
<v 1>Yeah, for sure. And then in, you know, you gotta hand it to CNN too,</v>

80
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:42.430
is like all of a sudden we had these creative partners who were like willing to

81
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:46.780
let him be him, you know, like willing to let him do a show.

82
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:51.550
Like the Tokyo show were like, you know, really climbing into, um,

83
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.050
Japanese subcultures, rope, technical porn, you know,

84
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:59.200
all this stuff that most network executives,

85
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.800
they're probably a little bit leery of, you know, CNN was kind of like,

86
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.080
you know, go for it, man, be yourself, you know,

87
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:07.300
and let's figure out what this is together. You know.

88
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.180
<v 0>That's amazing that there really is amazing.</v>

89
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:14.620
And one of the things that really made that show was Tony's narration because

90
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.040
the narration gave you a sense of the way his,

91
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:22.690
his sort of passionate enthusiasm for the world and for various aspects of

92
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:27.070
cooking and travel and food and culture, like you got it through his own words,

93
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.790
you know?

94
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.200
<v 1>Yeah. I think that's, um,</v>

95
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.850
I mean maybe in some ways the most important aspect of the show, uh,

96
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.100
you know, I mean he is after all a writer. Right. You know, and, um,

97
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.640
and that is how he experienced the world. Um,

98
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.710
but actually making the shows and the,

99
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.000
the technical part of actually making the shows, you know, we'd,

100
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.690
once you'd go through and kind of edit the show, you know,

101
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.850
none of that voiceover was in,

102
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.450
at the rough cut phase and then you send it to him and get his writing back and

103
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.560
record that VO.

104
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:05.450
And I keep describing it as like that kind of Dr. Frankenstein lightening bolt

105
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.490
to the temples kind of moment where like the monster rises would really

106
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:11.840
just bring the show to life.

107
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:15.980
So this kind of carcass that was laid out in rough cut form on the table,

108
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:19.790
all of a sudden, just gasped and jumped up. And, you know,

109
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:24.380
it was really beautiful, like to see that and to have, you know,

110
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:28.850
as a director, as a producer, as a creative, you know, at any level, you know,

111
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:32.150
to have that kind of power, um,

112
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.440
to have his voice and his writing and his introspection and thoughts, and,

113
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:40.460
you know, um, that would have like powerful, you know,

114
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.840
powerful force to work with.

115
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.651
<v 0>Well,</v>

116
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:46.640
it was a brilliant design the way the show is put together that narration really

117
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:50.540
did make it something special and different from all those other kinds of shows,

118
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:52.340
because it just,

119
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:57.260
his articulate and insightful and poetic and artistic

120
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:59.510
view of these things that he had,

121
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:03.980
this infectious passion for things he completely changed the way I thought about

122
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:06.320
cooking. I had always thought about cooking as, oh,

123
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:09.470
this guy knows how to make delicious food. Oh,

124
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.430
this place has good ribs is. And then when I saw his show,

125
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:16.250
when I saw parts unknown, I went, oh, it's an art form.

126
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.990
It's just an art form that you eat.

127
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:19.790
<v 1>Absolutely.</v>

128
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.170
<v 0>And it's just a contemporary art form.</v>

129
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.910
<v 1>Yeah. And, and even beyond that, it's an art form that's,</v>

130
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.630
that's taking and incorporating all of these greater kind of macro social

131
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:34.010
elements of, you know, where you are, the history of where you are,

132
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.800
you know, what people did for a living,

133
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:40.700
what people's ancestors did for a living, you know, it, um,

134
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.020
it's rooted in so much more. And what I think, you know, you know,

135
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:48.020
ultimately it feels like we kind of joke around a lot and say like, yeah,

136
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:50.270
it's a food show shows not a food show, you know,

137
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.110
but the reason that worked I think is because of what you're saying and,

138
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:56.060
you know, the food, um,

139
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.920
food is an art form that incorporates all of these other aspects.

140
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:05.870
And so it can be a jumping point off for exploration into anything you want

141
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:08.930
to talk about. We talked about the, the history of a place,

142
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:13.040
the politics of a place, you know, uh, the religion of a place, you know,

143
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.950
all of these things that inform who people are, well,

144
00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:20.270
that's all written into the cuisine of a place or an area, you know.

145
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.640
<v 0>And he was into stuff that wasn't necessarily even</v>

146
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:27.980
like high, you know,

147
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:32.270
high dollar items he was into like street food. Definitely. Yeah.

148
00:08:32.271 --> 00:08:35.450
It wasn't just the finest French, you know,

149
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.940
bistros where these celebrated world famous chefs were cooking these bizarre

150
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.650
small plate sort of masterpieces. No, he would love street taco.

151
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.740
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, and again,</v>

152
00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:53.180
I think that was kind of like a whole new kind of fresh take on looking at food.

153
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:56.010
You know, it's like, it's easy to, you know,

154
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.210
to look at these kind of high-end French preparations,

155
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.830
these highly talented, you know, highly trained French chefs. Um,

156
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.110
and there's, there's tremendous beauty in that.

157
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.970
And all of those other things we talked about,

158
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:13.890
but to look at the woman on the corner, you know,

159
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.650
that's making, uh, you know, the best, you know,

160
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:20.460
lingua tacos that was revolutionary.

161
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.050
And then the realization that, all of that, all of that greatness,

162
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:29.610
all of that nuance, all of that flavor, you know, um,

163
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.020
contained right within there, that was an access point to it as well.

164
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.280
It's just an access point that everyone can afford that everyone can go in. And,

165
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.960
uh, you know, I mean, right place at the right time, I think that people, like,

166
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:47.910
it seems like the culture at large was ready for that ready for that like

167
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.810
experience and food and ready to kind of chase that. Cause now, I mean, that's,

168
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.250
that's all anyone wants.

169
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.240
<v 0>No, well, I think it's because of him. I really do. I really do because I mean,</v>

170
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.780
I'm sure that he changed the way I look at things in terms of food.

171
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.850
And I think he had that effect on many people.

172
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.710
When you think about how many years was parts on unknown for five and then no

173
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:09.450
reservations for nine.

174
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.100
<v 1>No reservations yet for about 10. And then there was cooks tour before that.</v>

175
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:14.400
Right.

176
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.420
<v 0>So original,</v>

177
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:20.040
all told a decade and a half of his influence on

178
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:24.570
people's food choices and just appreciation for food. I mean,

179
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:26.820
I know personally I've had some great meals in restaurants,

180
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:30.180
but some of my favorite meals have been like stepping outside of a bar,

181
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.620
you know, it's one 30,

182
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.520
you got a little buzz on and some dudes got a taco truck and like, oh baby,

183
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:38.430
what do you got over there? My friend, or in New York, you know,

184
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:40.770
it's late at night and there's a falafel cart. And some,

185
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:45.780
guy's got a incredible kebabs like, oh, something about street food, man.

186
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.380
<v 1>Absolutely man. And, um, yeah, I kinda keep like a,</v>

187
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.180
like a loose running list of my favorite meals, you know? And, um,

188
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.170
and some of them are on the show and some of them are not on the show. And, uh,

189
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.560
I'd say most of them are that, you know,

190
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:04.980
most of them are accidentally stumbling into someplace where someone's doing

191
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:08.190
something completely awesome that isn't, you know,

192
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:13.440
some massive 26 course tasting menu know. Um,

193
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.850
and I think it's also about, you know, it's about place, you know,

194
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.000
it's about where you are, the context of where you're eating,

195
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:25.890
what it smells like, what it sounds like, what it looks like, you know, um,

196
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.510
who you're with, you know,
