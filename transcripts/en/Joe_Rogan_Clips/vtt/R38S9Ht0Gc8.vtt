00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I told you my friend Jack Carr. Got it.</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.910
Did a book signing. He caught it for a day.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.380
<v 1>A day. Yeah. He kicked it quick. He kicked it in a day.</v>

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.180
<v 0>Yeah. I said it felt like for one day. Some people that's weird, man. My friend,</v>

5
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:20.070
Michael yo. That's what happened to his mom.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.740
Michael y'all was in the hospital for a long time, man,

7
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:27.600
for like weeks and his mom got sick for a day, one day.

8
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.040
Right? Then she kicked it.

9
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.920
<v 2>It's a and weird virus. It's weird. Even coming.</v>

10
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.430
<v 1>In here getting pricked and you nervous. Yeah. Yeah. I.</v>

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.580
<v 2>Mean you're nervous before anything, right? Yeah, for sure.</v>

12
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.880
<v 3>That one's a nervous one. I'm like shut out whatever habit.</v>

13
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.290
<v 0>I haven't but I don't.</v>

14
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.210
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.030
<v 0>I made it nice to know. It's scary disease, man.</v>

16
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.110
<v 1>I don't know, man. It's so weird. It's such a bizarre time.</v>

17
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.780
<v 0>It's scary. It's scary. And when it's done, no matter what,</v>

18
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.260
even if you're not scared to getting it, even if you think, oh, if I get it,

19
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.360
it's just going to make me sick for a few days. I'll kick its.

20
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.140
Even if that's true. It's scary for what it's done to the economy.

21
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:14.090
It's scary for what it's done to civilization.

22
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.600
<v 1>It honestly, it's terrifying. And I saw</v>

23
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.240
a sign. You can get a fine for not wearing a mask. Yeah.

24
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.050
And sometimes it's up to 600 bucks. Yep.

25
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.880
<v 0>Yeah. It's crazy. They're arresting people for keeping gyms open. I've seen that</v>

26
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.230
the same people that didn't arrest the looters,

27
00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:38.510
I think is it the exact same people? Yes.

28
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.420
Arresting people for opening gyms.

29
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.870
Like give people that like there's going to come a certain amount of time.

30
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.770
I don't know what that time is, but here we are in August.

31
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.070
It's basically August. Right? And everything's still closed.

32
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.580
Like how long are we going to do this for we're going to stay close for a year.

33
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.530
Are we going to stay close for two years? Like what's going to be left nothing.

34
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.400
So it's a complicated question because you don't want people to die and you

35
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:10.490
don't want people to get to have right. Diseases and get sick.

36
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.960
<v 1>But then you have to,</v>

37
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.550
everybody has to live their life in a way everybody has to survive and

38
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.280
be able to pay their bills. And.

39
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.970
<v 0>Exactly. So when do you, when's that call get made?</v>

40
00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:25.850
That's what's complicated about it. And that's what no one from either.

41
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.330
So this is like one of the most, truly human problems we've ever faced.

42
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.050
Cause no one really knows what the right thing to do is there'll be a lot of

43
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:37.670
armchair quarterbacking after it's over where people who, you know, people die,

44
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.120
people will look back on and say they should've done this or they should have

45
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:43.250
done that. Well, that's great. And maybe,

46
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:46.130
maybe some people had a better idea of how to handle it,

47
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.750
but it's just guessing right now. It's just guessing. Yeah.

48
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.700
It's weird, dude.

49
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.120
<v 1>It's weird to me that there is a,</v>

50
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.150
it's like me in school having a tuck in my shirt

51
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.180
or out. So you get detention or whatever. It's weird to be

52
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.530
forced to wear something.

53
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.820
<v 0>Right. So that's what you feel about the mask. I see what you're saying. Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.310
Well you know that it does work, right? That's what's weird about it.

55
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.540
If you wear a good mask, it actually does prevent a lot of transmission.

56
00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:26.040
Apparently that's all Japan. Why do I say it that way? Japan? That's all Japan.

57
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.700
I was in the middle of the day in Japan. I stumbled through it. Weird way.

58
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.600
Niekro.

59
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.350
<v 4>Goblet words are hard. Sorry.</v>

60
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.850
<v 0>Um, Japan, they, they didn't shut their economy down. They just wore masks.</v>

61
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.670
<v 1>Well, I mean that's yeah.</v>

62
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.740
<v 0>They didn't suffer that many deaths either. It's really weird. The, um,</v>

63
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.670
I wonder, I would like to see like a documentary on how Japan, uh,

64
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.820
managed COVID-19. Cause they did an insane job.

65
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.250
Maybe as good a job as anybody. Yeah.

66
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.220
I think there's only a thousand deaths in all of Japan.

67
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.670
Kyle Kalinsky was telling me about this and he sent me to some article.

68
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.430
If you can't find it, I'll send you the article. But it's pretty crazy.

69
00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:09.900
It's it's all in how they never shut the economy down.

70
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.130
They just all wore masks. Everybody followed the rules and they contained it.

71
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.480
<v 1>That's and that's. And that no, I mean, at the end of the day,</v>

72
00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:23.130
it all comes down to respect for other

73
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:27.750
people. Sure. Right. That's what it means. Right? It's not,

74
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.630
it's not, it's not a government thing. It's not like

75
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.960
you shouldn't ha you're you shouldn't be forced to wear a mask,

76
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.000
but you should wear a mask, right? Yes. Yeah.

77
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.280
You should wear a mask. That's a good person. Right.

78
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.750
And that's because I respect you as a fellow human. Yeah.

79
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.200
It has nothing to do with being 600 bucks.

80
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.263
<v 0>That's what it cost.</v>

81
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.040
<v 1>But some places it's 600 bucks. I saw what, what is it in Beverly Hills?</v>

82
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.600
<v 5>What's the fine for loop. They have a fine 300 no time. No fine for loop.</v>

83
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.950
Hmm. 300.

84
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.700
<v 1>Bucks for not wearing a mask in Beverly Hills, you should wear a mask.</v>

85
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.300
<v 0>Just so people feel better for now. I mean, we got to get through this together,</v>

86
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.410
but I don't know about finding people for it. And the other thing was snitching.

87
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.890
They were paying people to snitch on people. Weren't social distancing.

88
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.110
That was the mayor. Mayor of gal, maybe mayor of Los Angeles. They were like,

89
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.070
ordinarily snitches get stitches. But now snitches get rewards.

90
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.270
They were literally giving people money or advertising.

91
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:35.310
I don't know if they ever gave any money out advertising.

92
00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:39.480
They would give giveaway rewards for people who turn in people who are not.

93
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.520
<v 1>It's like, they want not to say something to the guy.</v>

94
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.940
Hey, why not just say, Hey, put your mask on. But no,

95
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.270
that's too complicated. You're asking too much. Then you have to,

96
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.430
how long is the rebate? Is it like, uh, like you to mail in? Like,

97
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.550
that's a good question. Right?

98
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.760
<v 0>What if they still haven't gotten paid yet? They feel like a terrible person.</v>

99
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.630
Like bro, I turned you in. I need the money to pay my rent meanwhile,

100
00:06:07.631 --> 00:06:10.690
months later. But the money still hasn't come.

101
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.570
<v 5>If you it's rough.</v>

102
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.970
<v 1>And I know I slept in a closet,</v>

103
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.130
$300 jeans because maybe someone

104
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.040
sees you eating and you don't have a mask on.

105
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.750
And then you talk with a ticket. Yeah.

106
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.110
It blows my mind. It's weird.

107
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.650
It's all about the responsibility of,

108
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.300
and your character really.
