00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 1>Experience. So, um, like I said, you know, we,</v>

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.920
we carried on with the conversation, had a good time, you know, nobody got hurt,

4
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:11.840
everybody laughed. And, um, I thanked them,

5
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:15.400
shook their hands and they told me to keep in touch. I'm thinking,

6
00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:16.234
keep in touch.

7
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.040
<v 0>Guys are homies now. Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.310
<v 1>Yeah. But I did, you know, I I've call him and say, Hey man,</v>

9
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.710
I'm playing in your county. Come on and see me. How long.

10
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.670
<v 0>Did you guys talk that.</v>

11
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.510
<v 1>Day? Oh, maybe I don't know, two and a half hours. Something.</v>

12
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.070
<v 0>Like that did at the end, after the ice, did everything sort of loosen up?</v>

13
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.150
Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. So the laughter and then did the conversation loosen then.

14
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.470
<v 1>The conversation loosen then? Um, I mean, you know, it, you know,</v>

15
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:44.100
it wasn't like an know we, you know, we all Hugg each other, but, uh, did you,

16
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.880
did you offer.

17
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.860
<v 0>Any counter to the things he was saying? Like Charles Murray stuff?</v>

18
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.620
<v 1>Absolutely. Absolutely. Um, how did he respond to that? Uh, he said, well,</v>

19
00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:56.060
you know, I, you know, I don't know about that. You know, I know, you know,

20
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:59.620
that, you know, these guys are, are, are, are doctors and da, da, da, da,

21
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.010
and mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, so, you know, he to authority of course.

22
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.930
But of course, if you find authority in the, in the other direction, well,

23
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:09.410
something's wrong with them. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. You know, so you, you,

24
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:12.570
you take a narrative, you know, that that fits, that fits your narrative.

25
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.530
So like for confirmation bias. Yeah. So for example, um,

26
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.330
uh, he, he did bring up that the Bible preaches racial separation,

27
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.040
and I gave him the Bible. I said, show me where.

28
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.240
So I forgotten now the exact chapter in verse,

29
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:31.840
but I think it's in Leviticus and I'm gonna paraphrase. Um,

30
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.880
he pointed to this verse and I read it and it said something to the effect of,

31
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.360
um, a lamb should not lay with a Wolf. I said, well,

32
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.470
if it wants to.

33
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.303
<v 0>Live, yeah.</v>

34
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.703
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

35
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.350
<v 0>What the have.</v>

36
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.630
<v 1>To do with people. So I said, that's stupid. What does that mean, Mr. Kelly?</v>

37
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.990
He says, well, it means that two different species should not lay together.

38
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.630
I said, hold on. I said, blacks and whites are not two different species.

39
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.060
We are the name species two different colors. Oh no, no, no, no.

40
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.820
You know, we we're different species. So, you know, he, he takes what he wants.

41
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.940
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and twists it to fit the narrative. Okay. So he, um,

42
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.980
like I say, I thanked him, uh, I began calling him. He called to my gigs.

43
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.250
He bring the night honk. Um, I I'd I'd invite him down to my house.

44
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.690
He came down to my house with the Nighthawk. Wow.

45
00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:32.650
Nighthawk would sit on my couch next to him. Sometimes Nighthawk get bored.

46
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:36.490
Right. And pull out his gun and twirl it on his finger. Oh, Jesus Christ.

47
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.370
I'm serious. And um, but what the? I,

48
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.320
I felt, I felt very comfortable with, with them, you know, after time. And,

49
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.440
um, so then at that point I would begin inviting over some of my black friends,

50
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.440
some of my Jewish friends, some of my other white friends. Did you.

51
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.560
<v 0>Like let them know in advance sometimes.</v>

52
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.793
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

53
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.380
<v 0>Sometimes.</v>

54
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.680
<v 1>Not sometimes not. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.520
<v 0>What did they say when they come over and they see a grand wizard and a</v>

56
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:08.320
Nighthawk? Um, well or a dragon, is he a dragon or.

57
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.840
<v 1>A wizard? You know, he, he was still a dragon at that point. Okay. Okay. And,</v>

58
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.080
uh, sometimes they'd freak out and, and my band, oh my God, my band, um,

59
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.070
you know, we, I have a band, so they, they're all short in my house,

60
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.430
get in the van. We all ride at the gig together, especially if it's far away.

61
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.311
Uh,

62
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:29.110
and sometimes I I'd wanna stop at some clan rally on my way to a gig &lt;laugh&gt; and

63
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.670
so &lt;laugh&gt;, so my God say, dare, I'll what, I'll just meet you there. You know,

64
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.190
I'm not gonna ride with you. Jesus.

65
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.203
<v 0>Christ.</v>

66
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.030
<v 1>Oh. So, um.</v>

67
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.980
<v 0>So you, this became a full time project for you.</v>

68
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.973
<v 1>Yeah, it did. It did.</v>

69
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.300
<v 0>Like how much, how quickly did it escalate? So it went from this, you,</v>

70
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.620
you obviously had some,

71
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.500
you were compelled almost obsessed to meet this guy and get to the bottom of

72
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.380
this thing that had been bothering you since you were 10.

73
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.260
<v 1>Years old. And, and because my relationship with him was really growing.</v>

74
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:02.970
It was turning into a friendship. I mean, you know, I'm not gonna lie. Um,

75
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.210
I genuinely like this guy and I could see him beginning to like me a lot.

76
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.050
Um, I did not like his ideology, but I saw the human,

77
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.890
the humanity in him. Yeah. And he was seeing the same thing in me. We,

78
00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:20.760
we both want the same things. All right. Um, and I,

79
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.080
and I began interviewing a lot of other Klan people from different, you know,

80
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.880
areas up north, down, south Midwest, et cetera. Um,

81
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.480
some would talk to me, some would not talk to me. Some wanted to fight me,

82
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.080
you know, I, I ran, I ran the whole gamut and, um, I put it all in my book.

83
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.030
Um, now, you know, I, I would see him for, you know,

84
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.590
over like two years he'd come outta my house or we'd go out and have lunch or

85
00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:49.750
dinner together. Wow. Yeah. And, um, but during those two years,

86
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.910
and by the end of the two years, he was coming to my house by himself.

87
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.990
He trusted me that much. No Nighthawk, you drive on down. Right. And, um,

88
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.340
by the end of two years had not invited me to his house. You know, um,

89
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.900
after two years he got promoted from,

90
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.500
from a grand dragon state leader to Imperial wizard, national leader.

91
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.540
&lt;laugh&gt; at that point, he began inviting me to his house. Wow.

92
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.100
But now he was the man in charge. Right. So I go to his house,

93
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.410
I would see his clan then where'd have, is clan meetings.

94
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.570
They have a den at the house. Well, yeah. They call it a den. You know,

95
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:29.690
it's a room, you know, it's all set with a clan altar and, uh, chairs.

96
00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:33.970
What's a clan altar look like, uh, it's a table that has a clan flag across.

97
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.970
It has that big red circle with the white cross and blood drop.

98
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.090
Then they have a candles, things like that. And, and a,

99
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.200
and a cross and the cross, some, either candles on it. So it's like a flame or,

100
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.320
or light bulbs. &lt;laugh&gt; so, um, anyway, um, and,

101
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.000
and a sword then across the table, um, I took, I take pictures,

102
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.800
take some notes, and then he began, uh, invited me to clan rallies.

103
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.880
So &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Yeah.

104
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.160
And so I'd go to these clan rallies and they'd have this big wooden cross.

105
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.280
The wooden cross is wrapped in Burla.

106
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.280
The bur app has been soaked and what they call clan cologne,

107
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.830
which is actually diesel fuel, all right. Cares scene.

108
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.150
And the Klansmen and Klans women are all in their robes and hoods and they have,

109
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.350
they have these torches and the torches are lit and they walk in a,

110
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.390
in a big wide circle around this cross, which is in the center. And, um,

111
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.310
then either the Imperial, uh, uh, wizard or the grand dragon will, will,

112
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.380
will shout, you know, Klansmen halt, and they'll all stop in place.

113
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.940
Klansmen faced the cross, and they'll all turn in and face the inner circle.

114
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.740
And then you'll say for my God,

115
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.540
and they'll repeat for my God and bow for my race, for my race, for my country,

116
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.180
for my country, for my clan, for my clan, white power,

117
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:59.250
white power Klansmen approached the cross and they all close in.

118
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.330
And now they're all right there at the base of the cross Klansmen,

119
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.570
like the cross. And they drop their torches at the foot of the cross. And woo,

120
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.690
this thing is a flame and they stand there and admire this burning cross.

121
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.050
And then they give some speeches from the podium and then they have hot dogs and

122
00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:20.200
hamburgers, and the rally is over, you know, &lt;laugh&gt;, and I'm,

123
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.600
I'm sitting there watching this, I'm taking pictures, taking notes. And, uh,

124
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.080
how, where did it feel to be there watching all this? Uh,

125
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.040
it definitely felt different, but, you know, I knew what to expect pretty much.

126
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.080
Cause I read all these books. Yeah. So, you know, I mean,

127
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.400
I know that's what they do at Glen valley. They burned crosses.

128
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.150
Now let me explain something to you that I learned. Um, there are two times,

129
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.670
two occasions upon which they set the cross, the flame as they put it,

130
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.030
they have a cross burning and a cross lighting.

131
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.230
The difference being across burning is when they take a five or 10 foot cross

132
00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:01.460
wrapping that barrel lap soak and kerosene and put it in your lawn because

133
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:04.780
you're an interracial couple, you're gay, you're Jewish in a white neighborhood,

134
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.460
whatever the deal is, that is meant as, as intimidation, it's a warning.

135
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.980
We know who you are, ceases and exist. Move out if you don't, next time we come,

136
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:19.100
we mean business and that bomb your house or something. Okay. When they do that,

137
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.250
that's called a cross burning, right? A cross lighting is when they do a,

138
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:24.890
a,

139
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:29.890
a 30 or 20 or 30 foot cross at a ceremony and they parade around it and give

140
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:32.650
a lecture that's called a cross lighting. And that's what you went to.

141
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.850
I went to the cross lighting, how often they do those things,

142
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.370
as often as they want and several times a year, what do they talk about?

143
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.280
Like when they have meetings, um, the future of the white race, uh, you know,

144
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:47.040
and what they want, you know, and, and what the constitution guarantees them.

145
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.120
This is a white man's land. This land was built by white people.

146
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.040
The constitution was signed by white, by white men. This is their country,

147
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.120
you know, immigration, whatever the issues are that, uh,

148
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.400
the Browning of America is, is a big topic, um, or, or white genocide,

149
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.000
same thing. Uh, and when they say white genocide,

150
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.560
they mean their race is getting smaller through MIS.

151
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.880
So you know that these are the top, you know, that they cover. Um, it's, it's,

152
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.150
it's pretty, it ING.
