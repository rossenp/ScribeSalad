00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.760
<v 2>Have you ever considered something alternative to, uh, air inflated tires?</v>

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.640
Have you seen some of these, these alternatives that have, uh,

4
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:14.760
essentially spaces in between the upper wall and the wheel?

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.040
Have you thought about that? Yeah, we.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.430
<v 1>We've had, uh, we haven't found a, you know, uh,</v>

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.350
it's higher that because you gotta worry about road noise.

8
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.470
Uh, you gotta take out, uh, potholes and bumps. Um,

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.790
you, you gotta have like, um, good grip,

10
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.710
but you also want to have low rolling resistance so that, you know,

11
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.623
you get good range.

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.860
Those are a lot of things to try to put into one tire.

13
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.660
Um, then if you also say, and it can't have error, it's like, this is hard.

14
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.740
Um.

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.660
<v 0>So, but you're talking, I'm talking to a guy who's putting people on Mars.</v>

16
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.100
You can't figure out a airless tire.

17
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.780
<v 1>It's just, it's, it's an incremental constraint. Um,</v>

18
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.810
saying there won't be such a thing. I think there will be too precise.

19
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.970
<v 0>Cuz it seems like we've just gotten way too comfortable with this idea,</v>

20
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.730
the tires blow out and you get flats. It's very annoying. Flats are annoying.

21
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.450
Yeah. Very annoying. Yeah.

22
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.130
<v 1>Um, in non-sport tires, by the way,</v>

23
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.330
I'm much less likely to go to have flats cause.

24
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.720
<v 0>They bounce.</v>

25
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.120
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Like let's say you hit,</v>

26
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.440
you hit at the edge of a pothole mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; if you got more rubber

27
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.000
wall, you know, you got a longer way to go before you, you pinch the tire. So,

28
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.280
um, sport tires tend to that have more flats, um, in,

29
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:39.800
especially in, in LA potholes. That's the worst &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

30
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.910
Well there's one particular pothole on sunset hard.

31
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.030
It would just take out so many model S like a boom boom. Both sides of the car.

32
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.123
Really?

33
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.030
<v 0>Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

34
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.270
<v 1>Um, yeah, Steven Spielberg was actually once it's like, Hey,</v>

35
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.150
Steven Spielberg is like two tires went. I was like, God it.

36
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.550
I know that pothole &lt;laugh&gt;.

37
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.420
<v 0>Um, feel like you get pay to fix that. I.</v>

38
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.220
<v 1>Mean, fix that pothole. It seems like that's actually, you'll be like, man,</v>

39
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.980
there sure are a lot of taxes in California if, for roads this bad. Yeah.

40
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.900
<v 0>It's the place a mess. Yeah. Um, so,</v>

41
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.220
so ultimately one day that's a possibility of having some sort of an airless

42
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:24.850
tire, cuz I've seen prototypes.

43
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.650
I've never seen one in an actual car in physical, in, in real life.

44
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.850
<v 1>Yeah. I think we're the technology's gradually getting there. Um,</v>

45
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.810
and I think for something like a robo taxi where you want to have the tires last

46
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:39.610
for a long time and not go flat, um, it's gonna make a lot of sense.

47
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.760
<v 0>Yeah. Um, but other than that, essentially,</v>

48
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.880
most of what we saw in the demo is the same it's still gonna have now. Oh yeah.

49
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.880
There was the issue with the glass when, you know,

50
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.680
the accidentally shatter that. How, how annoying was that?

51
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.320
<v 1>That was shocking. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean, we, we, we literally spent,</v>

52
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.040
you know, hours beforehand with like lots of people throwing, uh,

53
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.080
steel balls at, at the window. Right. Um, I mean we must have thrown at least,

54
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.080
at least a dozen people must have thrown steel balls at the, at the same window.

55
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.960
<v 0>Though. Yeah. Same window.</v>

56
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.640
<v 1>Isn't that the problem? Yeah. That might,</v>

57
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.230
it turns out that might be the problem.

58
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.270
&lt;laugh&gt; if you keep throwing steel bulls,

59
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:25.950
eventually it's gonna break &lt;laugh&gt; and, and I did,

60
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.950
I did ask fronts to really wind up and give it all, you know, I should,

61
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.110
should have like, oh, take it easy. Yeah. You know, give a,

62
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.750
you don't need to wind up. We don't need the fast bowl. But I asked the,

63
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.510
I did ask for the fast bowl and we're like, okay,

64
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.900
let's for the slightly not slightly slower ball. Do you.

65
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.780
<v 0>Think it was because you guys were hitting the side wall with a sledge.</v>

66
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.260
<v 1>Hammer at first? Yeah. That could be like,</v>

67
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.060
we're trying to figure out how the hell this thing breaked, because I mean,

68
00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:52.740
we were just bouncing steel balls off it all day. Right. Um,

69
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.620
and we think possibly what had, what, what might have happened there was that,

70
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.730
uh, hitting it with the sledge hammer. I had to crack the base of it.

71
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.970
And once you crack the base of it, it loses all its strength. Right. Um,

72
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.130
and then, and then it was just have a hairline fracture and then, then you,

73
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.650
you hit, you hit it anywhere it's gonna shatter.

74
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.770
<v 0>Did you recreate that?</v>

75
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.170
<v 1>We, we didn't um, it's, it's also hard with, uh, test glass,</v>

76
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:20.840
like with, uh, you know, like when you actually do reduction glass,

77
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.120
it's much more of robust than, uh, demo glass, uh, cuz production, glass, you,

78
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.280
you, you, you know, um, you,

79
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.920
it like demo glass, you just can't make you,

80
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.760
you have to have like massive tools and ovens and everything to,

81
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.120
to make the production glass it's it's like, and if you don't, you know,

82
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:44.030
that takes a while to do so. The production class is always better than,

83
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.510
than the than demo glass. Mm. Um, nonetheless, it should have worked. Um,

84
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.790
and,

85
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.430
and it was probably because we racked it with a sledge hammer and then through

86
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:54.590
the steel bulleted. Mm.

87
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.583
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

88
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.630
<v 1>But, but, uh, it, it will be Bulletproof to handgun. Now, why.</v>

89
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.260
<v 0>Did you decide to do all that? Make it Bulletproof and make it like,</v>

90
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.020
you could hit it with a sledge hammer? Like what,

91
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.980
what was the motivation to make it different than just like a model S I mean,

92
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.520
I think.

93
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.820
<v 1>You know, it's like, what's cool about a truck trucks are tough and like, okay,</v>

94
00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:16.420
what's tougher than a truck, a tank. What about a tank from the future?

95
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.930
&lt;laugh&gt; okay. Now you have a tank from the future. Okay. Yeah.

96
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.890
That's Bulletproof. Yeah. And how's that compare to, you know,

97
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.370
it's way tougher than a regular truck. Look.

98
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.850
<v 0>It's cool. Yeah. There's no doubt.</v>

99
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.850
<v 1>Characters for the future. That like halo with a rock and launcher in the back.</v>

100
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.010
<v 0>Have you thought about doing something like that?</v>

101
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.880
Somebody's gonna do it for sure. For, for military use. Yeah. Seems like it.

102
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.240
<v 1>I mean, I don't know. That sounds like it'd be fun. I mean, like, you know,</v>

103
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:49.440
cruising around the field and like loving shooting.

104
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.600
<v 0>Rockets now,</v>

105
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.880
is there ever a possibility that these things are gonna be solar powered?

106
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.320
Is that, is that someday is the solar technology gonna get to a point where.

107
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.400
<v 1>It's kind of a surface area issue? So, I mean,</v>

108
00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:04.960
I think we could possibly put the, the cover of the truck bed, um,

109
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.920
you know, put some solar sales in that. So if you just leave it out in the sun,

110
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.360
you know, probably bring, you know, recharges a few miles a day type of thing.

111
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.440
<v 0>Oh, it was only, it would only be a few miles. Yeah. But what about one day?</v>

112
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.670
Is it possible that technology could evolve to the point where they could

113
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.070
extract? No, really?

114
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.070
<v 1>No, it's a, so there's about one kilowat per square meter of solar energy,</v>

115
00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:31.390
and then you're gonna get, uh, I dunno, probably 20, 25% efficiency.

116
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.670
So you got 200 watch of square meter,

117
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.260
and then that's assuming that you're normal to the sun. So, you know,

118
00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:39.860
like you're, you know, at the right angles basically, like,

119
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.340
are you facing this sun or not? So, you know,

120
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.820
you add all those things up. You say how many square meters can you really get?

121
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.740
And then, uh, how many, what hours per mile. So

122
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.980
it has basically, if you could do 10 miles a day, you'd be lucky. Really?

123
00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.770
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

124
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.250
&lt;affirmative&gt; and that's not gonna change no catch new episodes.
