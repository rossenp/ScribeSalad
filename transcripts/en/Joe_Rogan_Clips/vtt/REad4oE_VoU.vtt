1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>The more, the warmer and the more interesting the person is,</v>

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.520
the more I give them of myself. How.

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.480
<v 1>Does Larry David handle it? He's not.</v>

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.960
<v 0>Bad. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a big fan. Oh, thank you. You know all about that.</v>

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.640
It's not. Yeah, thanks. I've I've seen him go through because it was it.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.230
I saw him become famous. You know, he was Fridays,

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.630
he created Seinfeld, but that still wasn't the fame that he has now.

8
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:29.630
So I saw him through curb. Your enthusiasm become truly iconic.

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.470
So he's had trouble figuring out how to people want to

10
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:37.870
take a picture. People, you know, well, how do I do it?

11
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.950
And it's always changing. He's never an. It's.

12
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.980
<v 1>Truly one of the greatest comedy shows of all time. Well, thank you.</v>

13
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.100
<v 0>A hundred percent. And I have to say the new season,</v>

14
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:47.340
we're about to film in October.

15
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.500
The storyline may be my favorite and it's really subtle and

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.060
fun. It's like one of those things like, oh, I it's like,

17
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.260
I think people watching it will feel that they're living a fantasy.

18
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.890
And after the first one air, I'm happy to come back and talk about it.

19
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.650
You know what I mean? Yeah. Because that premise of where we're going is.

20
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.530
<v 1>Delightful. I love how HBO gives him sort of car blanche. They're like,</v>

21
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.930
you know, take a couple years off. Do whatever the you want. Like yeah.

22
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.450
Takes him.

23
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.690
<v 0>It's pretty great. Yeah. Well, for Larry, it's not about the money, right?</v>

24
00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:22.600
Of course. It's about, can I do another good show?

25
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.640
And that makes us different than most shows in history. Yeah. And, uh, he,

26
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.320
um, he only wants to do good work and enjoy himself.

27
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.360
Otherwise there's no reason. Yeah. And, uh,

28
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.680
and HBO is smart that.

29
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
<v 1>Way. The genius, I mean, look, you think about the,</v>

30
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.070
the show Sopranos gay Thrones. Yeah. No, they,

31
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.150
they know how to let a show, just be a show. They.

32
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.590
<v 0>From what I understand, they give a lot of notes on their pilots,</v>

33
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.430
but once you become a series, they kind of leave you alone. That's amazing.

34
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.070
You know, whereas, um,

35
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:02.950
when you're doing a network show or from other pay sources,

36
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.340
I've heard that the notes never stop.

37
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.460
<v 1>Well, when I was on comedy's radio, comedy is.</v>

38
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.940
<v 0>The easiest thing to ruin with notes. Drama can survive notes.</v>

39
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.380
Comedy cannot because it's like the, uh, you know, doing comedies, like,

40
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:17.940
you know, the, the, the dominoes.

41
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.980
And if you take one of those and just move it a little to the left of the right,

42
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.420
you're screwing up the whole.

43
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.370
<v 1>Thing. That's a very good point. Yeah. When I was on news radio,</v>

44
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.650
we weren't successful. And that is when you get the notes. We were,

45
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.690
so my friend, Lou Morton, who was one of the writers,

46
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.930
he would wear a shirt every Monday after the ratings would come in with a number

47
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:40.690
on it, he would take a white t-shirt and write it. And one day he came in,

48
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:45.080
the number said, 88. I go, dude. Really? He goes, yeah, we're 88th. I'm like.

49
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.800
I was like, God, I'm gonna save money about three years.

50
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.640
<v 0>Right. Five, five years. Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:54.680
So the point being is that was an immensely successful show. Barely.

52
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.400
<v 1>Bar barely made it. If.</v>

53
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.200
<v 0>You stay on the air.</v>

54
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.840
<v 1>That's pretty great. No, no, no. For sure. I mean,</v>

55
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.440
it's definitely better than being canceled.

56
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.240
But the point being is that we were never a hit. So we always got notes.

57
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.800
We're constantly getting notes. Like we need a gay neighbor,

58
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.160
we need a black guy, we need a, a, we need a, this, we needed that.

59
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.960
We need a love interest. We need a.

60
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.760
<v 0>I'd watch that show by the way, the gay neighbor and the black guy.</v>

61
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:18.910
If that was the name of the show, I'd be in, that's.

62
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.790
<v 1>A probably good name of a sitcom, a gay.</v>

63
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.670
<v 0>Neighbor, black guy lives next to a gay neighbor. And.</v>

64
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.351
<v 1>It's the problems they do.</v>

65
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:26.310
There's a lot of sitcoms and I don't wanna name names, but I watch them.

66
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.190
And I know they're very, very, very successful.

67
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.470
And I watch them and I'm stunned. I don't understand it. It's like,

68
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.870
they're speaking a different language.

69
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.790
<v 0>I don't get it either. I, I don't, I don't, but I don't watch comedy. Man.</v>

70
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.380
<v 1>Think it's middle America. I think there's,</v>

71
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:44.820
there's something going on on with tired people. No, you.

72
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.500
<v 0>Know what it is. Here's something that I notice.</v>

73
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.300
This is something that's recent to that audiences

74
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.500
now respond to what they think is supposed to be

75
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:59.890
funny. Like real comedy fans, Doug radio,

76
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.410
like people who dug comedy. I think Doug news,

77
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:09.210
radio people who did comedy dig curb. Do we have other kind of fans too? Yes.

78
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.490
But I find that comedy fans really do get comedy. Right.

79
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.450
But everybody likes to say they like comedy or they watch comedy and they may

80
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:22.920
not have any to humor. Right. So I find there was a show.

81
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.280
I'll give you an example. And this one was like the specific,

82
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:27.600
and I don't care if I'm slamming it.

83
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.880
It was the something in the girl in the apartment B or the

84
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.320
and something B &lt;laugh&gt;. It was, um, lead actors, very talented. But I,

85
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.320
I watched the show and the rhythms were,

86
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.630
this is what comedy is it. Wasn't funny.

87
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.190
It didn't have a natural vibe to it.

88
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.750
It had no reason for me to keep watching it,

89
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.150
but it was done in a style that other shows have done since

90
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.310
where this is how comedy's done.

91
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.710
This is the way we spin a line or do a situation.

92
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.020
And I don't know why, but it always involves a lot of that,

93
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.060
that putting the, the,

94
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.020
the spin on the ball or what English dancing in English. Yeah. Dance.

95
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.020
It has a lot to do with that.

96
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:16.620
Because even if you watch a lot of Nickelodeon shows or Disney shows,

97
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.580
they tend to do that. They put the spin on it.

98
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.930
It's never funny enough just to have, here's the thing about comedy, TV,

99
00:05:24.931 --> 00:05:26.690
comedy. I think for the most part,

100
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.650
you're supposed to be enthralled with the situation, right? It's the situation.

101
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.850
So the situation Lucy got into a situation. Yes.

102
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.290
And you laughed at Lucy dealing with the situation. I really,

103
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.760
I bet in tire time, Lucy ran on the,

104
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.840
ran on the air that there might have been 12 great jokes that she said in this

105
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.760
situation, you're laughing on how she deals with the situation.

106
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.880
It's a very good point. And you look at any great comedy and that's what it is.

107
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.840
It's Larry David dealing with a situation. Yes it's it's um,

108
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.680
so, and by the way, one thing,

109
00:06:02.681 --> 00:06:05.040
Larry and I are very proud about with Curber enthusiasm.

110
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.080
If one of us says something funny to the other one, cuz we improvise, we laugh.

111
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.080
So these shows you see, right?

112
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.830
People say these lines written by writers and then the audience laughs if it's

113
00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:19.630
on stage, but yet the actors don't laugh at one another.

114
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.630
<v 1>That's wrong. Right. It doesn't make any.</v>

115
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.710
<v 0>Sense. So on a lot of levels, it's just not right.</v>

116
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.550
And then there are shows now that I've watched for maybe five minutes where

117
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.590
my, I cannot believe how they're how terrible they are. Yeah.

118
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.860
And yet they're successful. Hugely successful, hugely success. Don't get it.

119
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.180
<v 1>Yeah. When you guys do a show,</v>

120
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.500
you don't really have like a full script in terms of.

121
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.060
<v 0>No, we have a very tight outline. We have seven pages written outline.</v>

122
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.380
Larry has written the story. Right. And in that story,

123
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.820
maybe a half dozen things are like says this or she

124
00:06:56.821 --> 00:06:57.260
says that.

125
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.970
<v 1>You're have to move the story a little yes.</v>

126
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.650
<v 0>For story purposes. Not cuz it's a great joke. Right.</v>

127
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.770
And then I play it every time differently unless I'm told by the director

128
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.050
or I'm one of the producers, we have a meeting of like,

129
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.530
we need to get this across.

130
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.930
This is not coming across and I'll make an adjustment. Right.

131
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.490
But in general I try and do it different. Every single.

132
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.080
<v 1>Take that is so crazy in how many takes will you do?</v>

133
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.520
<v 0>Well, if it's Larry and I just us, he and I alone in the scene, it, we can,</v>

134
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.960
we can have a scene done in less than an hour.

135
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.240
But if there's a bunch of other people could be three hours.

136
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.280
<v 1>Wow. And the idea is just like, this is what needs to take place. We,</v>

137
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.680
we have to figure out how to right.

138
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.870
Get across the fact that the refrigerators broken and we're gonna have to go eye

139
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:42.110
ice and who's gonna buy the ice. I don't wanna drive to buy the ice. Right.

140
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:43.030
And then you're all just talking.

141
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.910
<v 0>It's more in depth than that. The story is really there. Right. But yes,</v>

142
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.990
how we approach it. And sometimes that can change things. But that's one.

143
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.070
<v 1>Of the reasons why the show is so good because it seems so organic when you guys</v>

144
00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:54.770
are talking.

145
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.350
<v 0>It is well, that's what, what I get out of it. We don't rehearse.</v>

146
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.140
That's amazing rehearsal. Um, the Goldbergs,

147
00:08:02.141 --> 00:08:05.260
we don't even do a lot of rehearsing, but I have to stick to the script.

148
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:09.180
If I want to improvise on the Goldbergs, I have to let, uh,

149
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.380
the producers know not to get permission, to let 'em know this take,

150
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.460
I'm gonna do something different. And I have to let my fellow actors know. Ah.

151
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.780
<v 1>That's interesting. Have.</v>

152
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.810
<v 0>To, I have to let my, I.</v>

153
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.090
<v 1>Still do adjust to go from two different styles.</v>

154
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:28.170
<v 0>I w I don't know that it's difficult, but I find the curb, your enthusiasm way,</v>

155
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.930
way more enjoyable. Oh, I'm sure. But I'm really proud.

156
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.250
The Goldbergs is the number one show on TV that families watch together.

157
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.120
So I'm very proud of that. And I get why people dig it. It's not my style,

158
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.200
but when I watch it, occasionally I don't watch it very often.

159
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.400
I get why people dig it. I'm not confused by the show. Right, right, right.

160
00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:51.720
You know what I mean? Yeah. Like these other shows we're talking about,

161
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.440
I'll be confused as to why they're successful, why they're on the air.

162
00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.880
But other ones I watch, like I watch modern family. I get why people dig it.

163
00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:04.560
Right, right, right. It makes total sense to me. Yeah. Yeah. You know? Um,

164
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.960
so it's, it's much more enjoyable during the curve thing.

165
00:09:08.961 --> 00:09:10.080
It's Eder and all that,

166
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.390
but I still dig the Goldbergs and I also dig the crew and dig the people I

167
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:20.110
work with and I dig the writers. So it's a very positive, wonderful experience.

168
00:09:20.111 --> 00:09:23.750
And I'm lucky I'm on one of the most popular network comedies.

169
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.590
And I'm on the most popular alternative comedy. How'd you get to be so lucky.

170
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.390
Don't what, by the way, I'm grateful. I, I keep on getting told in therapy,

171
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.660
don't say lucky so much. Why is by why he tell you that?

172
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.460
Because grateful because I do have something to do with it,

173
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.820
but not from an ego standpoint of like, I've worked hard, I've done this.

174
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:48.460
I've done that. Yeah. So I'm just incredibly grateful. You're lucky too.

175
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.860
I, I think I'm lucky too. You're lucky. You're grateful by the way.

176
00:09:51.861 --> 00:09:55.300
What have I told you? I'm not kidding. That dude has taught me so much.

177
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.570
That might be the only thing I disagree with him on. Yeah. He doesn't know. No.

178
00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:00.930
Lucky is good. You know, Roger.
