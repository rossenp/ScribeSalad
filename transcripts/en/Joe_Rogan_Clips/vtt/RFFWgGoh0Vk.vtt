00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.730
<v 1>There's gotta be fitness in my jeans somewhere men,</v>

3
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:10.590
because my mom's dad was a boxer,

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.920
like growing up, like a, like a guy and he had a record,

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.930
he was a kid Dixie Schultz. Um, growing up, like in my grandmother's house,

6
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:22.950
there was a picture of a guy like, wow, in that position with trunks,

7
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:27.240
but old timey, like, and, um, I was like, who's that? And she's like,

8
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:30.460
that's grandpa. And he didn't look like grandpa, so I never associated,

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.600
but he apparently he was a boxer.

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.820
<v 2>One thing to not even box somebody, but have someone to hit hold pads for you.</v>

11
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.000
And you'll learn how to punch and hit pads. Cause it's exciting. It's fun to do.

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.860
It's like an interesting thing to do.

13
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.370
<v 1>And you hit things like Batman, that's how you sell it.</v>

14
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.550
That man hit pads and he hits, you know,

15
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.270
injustice and crying and like that. Um,

16
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.200
my boxer grandfather, I want to see if w if you agree with this thing. Okay.

17
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.220
So you're the, you've been the man in the ring, so to speak. Um,

18
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.200
you've been at the epicenter of attention of 1,005 thousand bunch of people as a

19
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.900
man on stage. Um, even the man in the ring,

20
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:13.680
sometimes when you're doing a UFC event and stuff like that, um,

21
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.210
you know what it's like the, the surge, the, the energy, uh,

22
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.260
that comes from like I'm here and everybody's got, I got their attention.

23
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:24.930
I command the room. It's part of why we do what we do.

24
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.790
My grandfather having been a boxer must've felt that, right? Like,

25
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.530
probably way more than I've feel when I walk up on stage or we're on the reboot

26
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:37.020
roadshow tour. I'm like, well, I feel clever sitting in the back,

27
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:38.880
watching the movie with the audience and hear him laugh.

28
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.170
This is a guy who is like, I'm the man in the ring. And like,

29
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.000
it's all up to me and my fists and I could be a God or a goat

30
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:48.990
tonight. And like,

31
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.080
and then it becomes primal and there's pounding and like that.

32
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.570
You would imagine there's a,

33
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.830
if you got in the ring and he pursued it enough to have a record,

34
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.600
there must've been some sort of call, some sort of satisfaction to it all.

35
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.190
<v 2>Maybe, um, it it's, sometimes people do it for money. Right?</v>

36
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.100
Ma maybe it's been a way to make a living. No.

37
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.020
<v 1>This guy, I don't know. He ma I mean.</v>

38
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.040
<v 2>He don't think he.</v>

39
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.080
<v 1>Did it. I think he was hoping for purses,</v>

40
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:23.790
but I don't think it was just like this or mailman or they'll,

41
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:26.370
although that's what the story is kind of going, not mailman,

42
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.820
but this was a guy who boxed professionally.

43
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.130
And the story was that my grandmother,

44
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.600
like when they had their first kid, my aunt, Virginia, my grandmother was like,

45
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:43.200
you can't be a boxer anymore. And so he was like, all right.

46
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.820
And then he stopped being a boxer.

47
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.320
And then my grandfather became a custodian in the Newark

48
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.423
courthouse.

49
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.060
And every day he would like get dressed up in a suit and take the bus to the

50
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:57.390
north courthouse. They lived in a different section or,

51
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.940
and then he'd put on his custodian outfit and like clean the toilets,

52
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:03.640
sweep the floors and stuff like that. Noble salt of the earth.

53
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.500
So my whole life, I never questioned this. You know, your wife says, you,

54
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.330
you quit and you quit and stuff like that until I became

55
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.110
older and I became something of the man in the ring myself,

56
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.140
I know what it's like to stand at attention for everybody where

57
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:25.810
everybody, you were the focus of thousands,

58
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:29.230
where you get a level of affection from a,

59
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.240
from an of one vociferous mass that you is unparalleled

60
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:36.250
from any amount of affection.

61
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.090
You give many other single human being in this world. It is,

62
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.300
I've never done heroin, but I imagine it's better than heroin.

63
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:47.140
It's one of the greatest drugs. It fuels us. And you know, we obviously like it.

64
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:49.330
We keep doing it. We make money off it. Yes.

65
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:50.950
But there's many ways to make money.

66
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.360
And we like it and we do it because there's power to it. And it feels fantastic.

67
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:57.670
And you feel like, man, they liked me. They really liked me.

68
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.850
And then I started thinking, why would he have put that all to the side?

69
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.740
Like, how do you step outside all that? Just because your wife is like,

70
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:10.150
I don't want you to do that anymore.

71
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.310
And then it made me reconsider my grandparents and I

72
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.220
figured out, and I want to see if you back me on this play,

73
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.380
you don't know these cats. So you got no skin in the game.

74
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:21.700
So you can't offend anybody.

75
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.970
Doesn't that sound like she did dirty that nobody else did you mean?

76
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.520
Yes, son, where else, but the bed.

77
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.980
<v 2>You didn't have that thought at all? No.</v>

78
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.460
My thought is that he recognized that it's very dangerous and he probably knew

79
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:40.900
people who died. And, uh, he probably wanted to find a way out of it. Anyway,

80
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.620
which most fighters do most fighters. At some point in time,

81
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:47.470
they realize I'm going to have to jump off this ride. One day,

82
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.810
I can't stay on this ride and tell them a dead man,

83
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.110
tell them 90 years old or a hundred years old. It's not feasible.

84
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.890
It's it doesn't exist. There's no 98 year old boxers out there. He.

85
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.020
<v 1>Faced his own mortality. Every boxer.</v>

86
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.490
<v 2>Does every fighter does you, you, you hit someone when you see them get hurt.</v>

87
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.580
Well then he's probably been hurt. You see people get hurt.

88
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.010
You see people get pummeled. You see people get knocked out.

89
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:10.480
Maybe you've been knocked out yourself.

90
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.560
And you realize that this is something that is unsustainable.

91
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.490
And if he's not making any money at it, it's extremely dangerous. And you start,

92
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.001
you know,

93
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:21.940
you start thinking what could happen to you when you know what can happen to

94
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:25.060
you. It happens to people. You see it happen. If it hasn't happened to you,

95
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:28.240
you watch it happen to other people. If you're around combat sports enough,

96
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.410
you're going to see people get up. And when you see people get up,

97
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.740
you realize like, Hey, this is voluntary. There's other ways to make a living.

98
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:37.930
I don't have to do this anymore. And I can get off this ride.

99
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.040
Or you're the type of person that doesn't give a. And you want to be a champion.

100
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:45.760
And your, your thought is you are here for glory.

101
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.550
You are here for a legacy. You're here to leave your mark.

102
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:53.230
You want to go down in history as a great, and if you don't feel that way,

103
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.700
I tell people to get out.

104
00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.620
I think fighting is one of the most singular pursuits a

105
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:02.510
person can get into.

106
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.400
<v 1>Giving. You're not only giving like the I'm dedicating myself to something.</v>

107
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.660
You're giving your body something that like you're taught your entire life,

108
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.530
protect this.

109
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.990
<v 2>So the consequences are so grave, the consequences,</v>

110
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:22.340
zigging and zagging. You, you go the wrong way. You run into a knee wrong way.

111
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:25.810
You run into a head kick, wrong way. You run into a punch. You know, you,

112
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.930
you duck into an uppercut, your lights, go out. You're laying on your back.

113
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.140
They're going to flashlight in your face and ice on the back of your neck.

114
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.330
And you, you don't even know what day it is. You don't know what,

115
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.230
and then that you never get back and you can only get so many of those your

116
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:42.710
life. You know, there's, it depends on the person,

117
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:46.580
but you get knocked out 3, 4, 5 times, whatever the number is.

118
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.380
There's a certain number that your life is going to be different now,

119
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.680
because now your brain doesn't work good anymore. That's a fact,

120
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.810
and maybe it'll get a little bit better over time.

121
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:58.790
Maybe you can go through some cognitive therapy.

122
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:01.910
There's some different things they're doing with magnets and different things

123
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:05.060
they're doing with stem cells, where they're shooting them straight into your,

124
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:06.920
a cerebral spinal fluid.

125
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:10.790
And they think that that might have some sort of a positive impact on CTE.

126
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.170
But man, that the reality is combat sports are a brutal,

127
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:17.450
brutal business. And um.

128
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.680
<v 1>Well, he just got to a place where he was like, probably smart. Like,</v>

129
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.840
this is my perfect excuse to not.

130
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.090
<v 2>Money doing it either. It sounds like.</v>

131
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.060
<v 1>I got to tell you. He gave me, he gave him his dignity back. I honestly,</v>

132
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:31.220
it was like, he gave it all up because she gave up the.

133
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.120
She was like a dirty German girl who was just like,

134
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.550
I will let you do the animal. You've got to get out of the ring.

135
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:39.680
And he was like, she's like, I'll give you one ring for the other.

136
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:44.420
And he was like, Gussie. He called her gussy. I think he imagined like.

137
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.183
<v 2>Love and family.</v>

138
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.953
<v 1>I knew these.</v>

139
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.020
<v 2>Love kids. It's got a kid, right?</v>

140
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.700
<v 1>He, they had, they had a few.</v>

141
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.500
<v 2>Kid, man.</v>

142
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.370
Everybody loves their kids and you want to be around to see those kids grow up

143
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:00.620
and you don't want to be brain dead. And everybody, look,

144
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.570
I personally know a lot of people that have combat

145
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:09.860
sports induced brain damage. There's no doubt about it. No, if ands or buts.

146
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.370
Yeah. This is why. When I see anybody, who's like half in half out,

147
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:16.790
I go hard in the paint. I tell them, Hey, you gotta get the out of this.

148
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.340
Now you got to trust me. And, and you know,

149
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:22.400
and I've done it to the point where people think I'm mean. And I'm like, look,

150
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.560
I'm not mean about very many things in this life.

151
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.880
But when it comes to people who are delusional about their abilities in combat

152
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:30.620
sports or their future in combat sports,

153
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:33.380
I get mean because I think you gotta know.

154
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:35.650
You gotta know with no uncertain terms. I,

155
00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:38.000
I can't be protective of your feelings.

156
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.570
I have to go in hard because no one else is going to people. Don't they, they.

157
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:46.970
You coaches. You trainers. You. They tell you got a chance, promoters,

158
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.010
willing to put you on fights. When you really should retire.

159
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.690
It is a dirty aspect of the business. And I don't, I don't play that.

160
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.850
If I think that someone should get out, I go hard and I,

161
00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.830
I tell them and you know, I've done it to friends. I've done it to, you know,

162
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.840
guys that I've done commentary for.

163
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.780
They've asked me and they pulled me aside and I said, you got to get out, man.

164
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.320
He got to get out because you could talk right now. You're okay right now.

165
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.450
But how many more shots can you take?

166
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:17.250
How many more times can you get knocked out? One Kao can change your whole life.

167
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.090
Meldrick Taylor got knocked out by Julio, Cesar Chavez.

168
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.370
And your tail was an Olympic gold medalist.

169
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:27.930
A fantastic boxer was fast as lightening, fast combinations,

170
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.060
beautiful skill. But Julio,

171
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:33.120
Cesar Chavez just kept wearing on him and wearing on him and boom.

172
00:09:33.121 --> 00:09:36.750
He dropped them in the final round and they stopped the fight with like second

173
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:38.520
school in the five. Richard Steele stopped the fight.

174
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:42.150
It was a big controversy like, oh my God, how could he stop the fight?

175
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.520
Meldrick was ahead on the scorecards. And you know,

176
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:47.340
there was only a couple seconds to go and Meldrick would have won a decision.

177
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.430
It was the right call because he was done after that fight, man,

178
00:09:50.431 --> 00:09:53.250
after that fight, he was never the same. You hear him talk today?

179
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:57.900
It's the saddest in the world. He can barely put together a sentence.

180
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.240
And he had a few fights after that against Terry Norris,

181
00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:03.090
who was a brutal knockout puncher, and a couple other guys.

182
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:06.630
He just was never the same. Again. It was at one fight, one fight,

183
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:10.020
one beating too much. And it was just, it all fell apart on them.

184
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.100
And that can happen. That can happen to any fighter. And when you're done,

185
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:15.690
you're done. And you, you, you,

186
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.470
the only way you should ever compete as a fighter is if it is,

187
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.160
this is your calling, this is the thing that you're obsessed with.

188
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.780
It is your 100% focus. And as soon as it's not,

189
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.010
as soon as you have doubts,

190
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.830
get out because there's a bunch of people out there that don't have doubts.

191
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.240
And I always try to tell people,

192
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:35.610
I think about Mike Tyson before he won the title.

193
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.690
Think about the Mike Tyson that destroyed Marvis Frazier. Think about that.

194
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.820
That guy's all in.

195
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.690
You don't ever want to face a guy who's all in when you're half in it.

196
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.570
And a lot of people are half-assed in it and they don't even realize they're

197
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.450
half-ass in it. They just have this thing in their head. Well,

198
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.120
I'm training pretty hard. I'm doing good. I got good skills.

199
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:55.020
I could beat this guy.

200
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.430
But when someone's in there in and co it's,

201
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.620
combat sports are uniquely dangerous in terms of the consequences

202
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:09.360
of you not being committed. So you gotta know when to get out and no one does.

203
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.890
Very few people does like a few guys, Andre ward, retired, undefeated,

204
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:16.020
Olympic gold medalist, two division world champion.

205
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:20.520
He's the rarest of the rare most guys. They keep going until they get up.

206
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.640
They keep going cool. They get knocked out. They get brutalized.

207
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.190
And then you meet them afterwards and they could barely talk, man.

208
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.660
They could barely talk.

209
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.320
I've seen so many guys that could barely string words together.

210
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.300
Everything's a mumble, all the words slur into the next word. It's horrible,

211
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:38.580
man. And I saw it in the gym.

212
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:43.470
I saw in the gym with guys who never made it. They still got brain damage.

213
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.610
The, the, the, the gods of combat sports. They don't give a.

214
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:52.020
If you win a title, if you're eating shots, you take punches to the head,

215
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:54.820
kicks to the head. You're getting up, man, no matter what seems.

216
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.670
<v 1>Like, wow, how come they didn't talk about that for years and years.</v>

217
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.300
<v 2>They didn't know. They did know that people get punched drunk,</v>

218
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:04.390
but they didn't know what was causing it. It's not even knockouts. It's,

219
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.200
it's sub-concussive trauma. That does the vast majority of.

220
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.340
<v 1>The world of hockey.</v>

221
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.070
<v 2>As well. Yes, sub-concussive trauma is terrible,</v>

222
00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:15.580
but knockouts are also horrific. And then for me,

223
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:18.160
my discussions with guys like Dr. Mark Gordon,

224
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:20.110
who's an expert in traumatic brain injuries.

225
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:24.820
And he works with a lot of soldiers and he runs his TBI foundation to

226
00:12:24.821 --> 00:12:28.990
deal with injuries that soldiers and football players and fighters face,

227
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:32.830
and his descriptions of it will scare the out of you. I mean, it's like,

228
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.410
he's like people can get brain damage from jet skiing.

229
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.830
Just why am I all that bouncing up and down?

230
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.860
<v 1>Can you get a jet ski accident? Just like just jet.</v>

231
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.260
<v 2>Skiing. And if you jet ski accidents exacerbated,</v>

232
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.080
but he's talking about like people, some people get an accident, uh,

233
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.510
some sort of, uh, uh, something happens to you.

234
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.370
We get knocked out and they are never the same. Again, this is a real thing.

235
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.450
You can get a shot to the head, a golf ball. So many misses.

236
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.490
They crack you in the head with a golf ball, right?

237
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.380
You get hit with a line drive. That kind of changes people forever,

238
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.880
forever. So your grandfather probably wanted out.

239
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.560
<v 1>Um, first of all, write some thoughts. Uh, number one, uh,</v>

240
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.990
is sober. Sober October gives you a different Joe Rogan. Yeah. Oh my God.

241
00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:24.970
You're so dialed in. It's beautiful. Um, I see you're the Ken burns of, of, uh,

242
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.950
combat sports. I can listen to you spin yarns, telltales. Um,

243
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.040
you know what, that's unfair. The Ken burns. I call you the Jean Shepherd.

244
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.530
<v 2>Of, I don't know who that is, but I hope he's awesome. You.</v>

245
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.660
<v 1>Love gene Chevy. Remember Christmas story.</v>

246
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.080
He is the guy that narrates Christmas. He wrote the books,

247
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:45.220
the essays that it's all based on. Um, my other thoughts, um,

248
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.350
that is far more dignity than, than I ever afforded my grandfather.

249
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.730
I appreciate it. My mom is gonna appreciate that. Um,

250
00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.580
and then fourth. I lost my point. I thought I hit enough of them.
