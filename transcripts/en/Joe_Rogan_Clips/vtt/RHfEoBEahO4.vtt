00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 1>Well, that's the crazy thing when people like kind of a, like,</v>

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:09.000
they have so much like hatred towards someone else for having a different view

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.950
than them, or being in a different situation. And you're like,

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.820
do just understand you were like two little circumstances away from being that

6
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.600
guy. I see that a lot with people and I'm on the side of like gun rights.

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.650
Like I'm not for gun control,

8
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.580
but the people who are like really to these teenage kids who are like becoming

9
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:24.900
famous and you're like, dude,

10
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.500
if you were a teenager and you could have just been on the news and everyone's

11
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:32.160
praising you because you take this position sub we'd all do that.

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.630
<v 2>The exact same thing yesterday,</v>

13
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.320
I was talking about one of these NRA guys that was mocking these kids. I'm like,

14
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:40.410
you're out of your mind. If anybody should be talking about,

15
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:43.350
we got to do something it's kids that got shot at sure. I mean,

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.420
this is they gun. They have the floor.

17
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.760
Now I understand they're supposed to have the floor. I mean,

18
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:48.800
they just got shot at,

19
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.740
they lost their friends and they are standing up and maybe they're not informed

20
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:53.580
about a lot of issues.

21
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.310
Maybe they don't know what a semi-automatic or an AR 15 is.

22
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:57.930
Maybe they don't know those, those details,

23
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.020
but they know that no one's doing and people keep getting shot.

24
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.140
<v 0>Of bad. Cause they survived. Like, like they got lucky.</v>

25
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.960
<v 1>They're not bad. They just weren't on the right place.</v>

26
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.480
<v 2>But here's the thing. No, one's talking about that Maryland one.</v>

27
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.530
And we don't talk about.

28
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.310
<v 1>Yes, but you know, because again, conflict tell the story.</v>

29
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.410
So more or less in Maryland, uh, there was,

30
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.900
there was a school shooting or a kid came into school with a gun,

31
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:21.330
but they had an armed security guard. He took them out. Nobody does.

32
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.940
<v 2>Military training guy got rid of him quick.</v>

33
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.440
And that's what NRA advocates are saying. Like, Hey,

34
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.970
this is a good thing. We should,

35
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.650
we should have someone who's an armed and ready responder at the

36
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:37.050
school to prevent this kind of from happening.

37
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.500
And there's a lot of veterans that would take that job happily.

38
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.490
And you would have your kids 100% safe and people are like, no,

39
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:46.680
that's not the solution. The solution is take the guns away.

40
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.640
<v 1>Um, I don't like the idea of armed security at school.</v>

41
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:52.440
I don't like the idea of metal detectors.

42
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.910
I don't like the idea of arming teachers,

43
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.210
but it's like to just dismiss that and be like, no gun controls.

44
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:00.720
The only reasonable measure I think is, is naive. But just to the point,

45
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:03.780
like you were saying before, I have no problem with people being like, Hey CNN,

46
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:07.140
shouldn't just be putting these kids on without having someone to rebut it or

47
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:08.580
they shouldn't be putting this on and just say,

48
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.230
but to actually go at the kid and be like, oh, this kid's, you know,

49
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:15.180
just milking this experience. Like yeah,

50
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.760
whatever any of us would do a thing like that.

51
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.230
<v 0>You know, I don't have a horse in the race. I don't really give a.</v>

52
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.020
I don't really shoot guns. And I know the only one I've shot guns.

53
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:27.060
It's just been really fun. There's no part of me that, like,

54
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:31.170
I think I would swallow it a little more if people that like were really, uh,

55
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.050
you know, a big gun advocates, which is kind of admit that like, dude,

56
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:37.410
it's pretty awesome. We want to blow up. It's great. You know? Um,

57
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.440
but you get this other sort of thing where I just think that you should have

58
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:43.380
people that are really trained really responsible. Um,

59
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.860
and we should have specific measures in place, um, in order.

60
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.850
And I know we do have that,

61
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:51.240
but maybe we should look at it and push that line back even a little bit more

62
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.820
because yeah, you're right. Even in the example of the dude, you know,

63
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:55.200
taking out that kid in that school,

64
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.080
I don't necessarily have an issue with having an armed security guard at the

65
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:02.020
school to protect children, but I kind of have an issue with somebody who,

66
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.740
you know,

67
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.620
you don't know when his girlfriend broke up with him and when this dude went

68
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:09.160
bat. Right. So even when you have to give people psychological exams,

69
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:10.030
like when do they go crazy?

70
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.130
When is there a moment where somebody snaps and now they're crazy?

71
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.830
<v 1>Yeah. I actually, I I'm, I'm completely against, uh,</v>

72
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.240
gun control of just about any kind. I actually think when people,

73
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:22.030
a lot of times Republicans will go, it's not about gun control.

74
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:23.230
It's about mental health.

75
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.360
I think that's even more of a cop-out because you're like,

76
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:28.360
what the are you even saying by that? Like, what are you, you know,

77
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:30.400
there's lots of when you say mental health, it's like,

78
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.520
there's lots of people who suffer from like anxiety, depression,

79
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:35.860
like all these things that doesn't mean there are risks to others.

80
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.340
Like what are you actually going to say? Like I'm for unfettered gun rights,

81
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.150
but everyone has to have like a psychological exam.

82
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:46.150
And it's as if there's some way that we can predict who's going to shoot up a

83
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.540
school. And the truth of the matter is it's really tough.

84
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.220
<v 2>No, it definitely is. But what you're saying,</v>

85
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.240
isn't entirely correct because it is absolutely about mental health and you have

86
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:56.830
to be crazy to be a school shooter.

87
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.360
And most of these people are on some sort of psychiatric medicine.

88
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.310
There's a giant percentage of them.

89
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.340
So it is in fact a mental health issue because there aren't,

90
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.170
they're literally on most of them,

91
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.550
like the vast percentage of them are on mental health medication.

92
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.090
So the question is whether or not it's the mental health medication that's

93
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:20.110
causing them to do this or whether or not they were already crazy.

94
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:23.470
And that medication was just trying to treat this disease and they got ahold of

95
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.090
guns enough. The problem is the guns. Yes.

96
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.730
<v 1>So maybe I didn't say that like precisely enough.</v>

97
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.390
Cause I agree with everything you just said,

98
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.400
I'm just making the point that the idea that it's like, oh,

99
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:33.070
all we know is that there's this category of people who have mental health

100
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:36.430
issues and they shouldn't be allowed to get guns is way too broad. But you know,

101
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:40.000
I actually, I think again, like you, you mentioned earlier, it's like, dude,

102
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.400
they'll say these anyone who's real up nowadays.

103
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.510
Like as a lot of mental health issues a lot and is in school,

104
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.510
they're going to put them on trucks. They put anyone who's borderline on drugs.

105
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:52.240
So the really up kids are on like a cocktail of drugs.

106
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.860
And they'll admit with a lot of these,

107
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:58.480
like anti-depressants anti-psychotics that they can cause suicidal tendencies.

108
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.630
Some people will even say they cause homicidal tendencies.

109
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:04.180
So I think it's pretty reasonable.

110
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.090
That may be in some very small percentage of them.

111
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.870
They cause you to just want to go or they push you at least in the direction of

112
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:12.580
wanting to go, just shoot up a bunch of people.

113
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.680
<v 2>That's a relief relieve. You have the feeling of consequences. There's there,</v>

114
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.800
there they disassociate you from whatever you're experiencing.

115
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.460
That's that's one of the most disconcerting things about the idea that if

116
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:26.560
someone has homicidal thoughts,

117
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:30.190
but they're keeping them at bay and then they take some pill that saying, Hey,

118
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.200
it. Let's do this. Let's do this. You're not.

119
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.540
<v 0>Exercising. The whatever,</v>

120
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:38.560
the mental processes of not killing people on your own,

121
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.870
you need this thing to do it. And then you don't have your medication.

122
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:42.970
One day I heard you talk about this. The other day was kind of interesting.

123
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:45.640
I forget who was on, maybe it was Metzker or somebody,

124
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:46.900
but you were talking about people.

125
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.690
<v 1>That he was very calm, cool, and collected. So.</v>

126
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.600
<v 2>Relax on that episode, it was weird. The best, uh.</v>

127
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.630
<v 0>The best advertisement for caveman nitrile you could have possibly have.</v>

128
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.860
It will make you into a.

129
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.410
<v 2>The Maryland school shooter was killed by his own bullet.</v>

130
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.220
Not the school resource officer police said, oh,

131
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.130
he shot himself in the head when the guy was coming after him. Okay. But still.

132
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.540
<v 0>Kind of a similar moral of the story that maybe the guy behind his hand to meet</v>

133
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:12.230
him, shoot himself.

134
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.240
<v 2>And this, and this is definitely not the same story.</v>

135
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:17.150
The story was that this arm guy took him out. Yes.

136
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.870
<v 0>That's what, that's what I.</v>

137
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.490
<v 2>Heard as well. That's what I had heard.</v>

138
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.310
Like I had heard a deceptive version of it then,

139
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.140
because I heard that this guy engaged in a firefight with this kid and killed

140
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:28.130
him instantly. Yeah.

141
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.300
<v 0>I read like six different articles that said that. So yeah. Okay.</v>

142
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.500
So that maybe that's incorrect.

143
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.300
<v 2>There's too many things to pay attention to.</v>

144
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.760
<v 3>There's a shot hit the shooter's gun, which is in, uh, in his hand.</v>

145
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.510
<v 2>His shot hit the shooter's gun before, after the shooter shot himself.</v>

146
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.380
So he shot himself with a gun that got shot.

147
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.320
<v 3>This is the officers. The officer shot struck Rawlins gun,</v>

148
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:54.470
which was in the teens hand. The Sheriff's office said, nevertheless,

149
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.830
his quick action confronting Rollins, just three minutes after the teen shot,

150
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.320
two students has been credited with bringing the incident.

151
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.420
<v 2>To a quicker. So the guy did shoot. The kid.</v>

152
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.650
<v 0>Got killed.</v>

153
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.810
<v 2>Well. So he, he shot him. And then when the, after the guy shot him,</v>

154
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:10.920
he just shot himself while he still could praise.

155
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.490
<v 0>Shot him. Say that again.</v>

156
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.850
<v 3>It says the praise came even when it was unclear, which shot killed the teen.</v>

157
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.330
<v 2>And he definitely seems like he shot him. I mean, he was in the fire.</v>

158
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.060
He really wasn't a firefight with this guy. Yeah.

159
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.860
<v 0>All right, dude, I look, look,</v>

160
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.050
I think there's not a single answer to any of this.

161
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:29.930
I think it is definitely a mental health issue. I think you're not going to,

162
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.720
nobody's going to come up with a law. That's going to figure all this out.

163
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.050
I just, I don't live. I joked about it before,

164
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:40.310
but I kind of live my life in a sort of ignorance is bliss state with this type

165
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:43.700
of. I mean, I don't know. I,

166
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.570
I have to guess my kid's not going to be shot to death in a school one day,

167
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.320
knock on wood. Right. I know. And it's, and it's a horrible, horrible thing. Um,

168
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.131
but the reality is,

169
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:55.070
I don't know if these people that are so obsessed with everything and just

170
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:56.210
they're making it their lives.

171
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.270
I almost feel like they're kind of missing the point. Uh, you know, if I,

172
00:07:59.340 --> 00:07:59.931
my kid,

173
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:02.510
isn't going to be out at a rally holding a sign and I'm not spending my days

174
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:04.930
doing that with them. I'm spending my days creating memories with them and,

175
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:06.740
and just trying to spend my life in a good life.

176
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.470
And I'm not really politicizing anything with my five-year-old.

177
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:10.821
<v 2>Well, well,</v>

178
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:13.790
there's people that feel like they want to do something they want to change.

179
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.670
They don't want this to happen again. And if you lost your kid,

180
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.520
you'd probably feel that way too. I mean, there's, there's,

181
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:22.100
there's way too many of these things is way too many of them.

182
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.360
So we've got to figure out what it is.

183
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.050
I think the real issue resolved realize rather, um,

184
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.440
it lies here's one, one giant part of the problem.

185
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.110
Everybody's looking at the final piece of the puzzle,

186
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.810
the final piece of the puzzle, it all comes together. Is the school shooting.

187
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.830
What gets someone to that position?

188
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.340
How do they get to that? You got to go to step one,

189
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.700
not to step 10 of step 10 is a school shooting. You gotta,

190
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:50.420
you gotta figure out how do we get less people to go from step one, to step two?

191
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.630
How do we keep more people happy as young people?

192
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:55.410
How do we give more people support headed?

193
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:59.640
We give more people therapy or exercise or recreation or

194
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.940
friendship or community guidance or whatever the we're doing,

195
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.420
where we alienate people to the point where they literally want to go and shoot

196
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.070
everybody else. It's like the, the,

197
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.300
the physical equivalent of like flipping over a game when you're losing.

198
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.390
<v 1>I think, yeah. That's a great analogy by the way.</v>

199
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:19.050
I think that's exactly what it is. It's like, oh, this world is so bad for me.

200
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.630
Well, you make.

201
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.790
<v 2>It this for everybody. that nice teacher.</v>

202
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.440
<v 1>I've thought I completely agree with what you're saying.</v>

203
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:27.390
And I think maybe the silver lining in this,

204
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:29.160
like the best thing that could come out of this,

205
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:33.480
and it has nothing to do with a law is just that kids in high school will think

206
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:37.290
twice before they're brutally ostracizing some other kid, because you're like,

207
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:40.770
Hey, watch out. That kid might be the one who wants to murder a little guy.

208
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.800
<v 0>Oh, that's the only thing, dude. People, kids think they're invincible.</v>

209
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:46.110
They're not thinking about that. I remember when I, you know,

210
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.920
Columbine was so such a big news story when I was, I was in high school,

211
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:53.490
I believe at the time. Um, I was sure, yeah, it was your birthday actually.

212
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.330
<v 1>And my birthday that year, it's real up.</v>

213
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.660
<v 0>Uh, dude, it was, it was such a big deal.</v>

214
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:05.130
It w I had never seen anything like that before. Um, this is before 9 11,

215
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.280
9 11 was the next big, big thing. But the, you know,

216
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.190
it happens so often now that because of the internet,

217
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.060
I almost feel like people are also desensitized to like how crazy it was because

218
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:16.560
Columbine dude,

219
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:20.070
it was bizarre watching the images on the news of the people running out of that

220
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:21.240
school. It was like haunting.

221
00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:23.880
And I remember watching it and my mom made this point and shoot,

222
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:25.410
my mom's a drug addict lunatic,

223
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:28.260
but she had these weird little moments in her life where she said some crazy.

224
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.510
And she was like, yeah, she's like, you know what? Yeah,

225
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.870
maybe they shouldn't have with those kids just in a weird way. And I was like,

226
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.140
oh, I'm really like defending these. Like, but she just kinda,

227
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.480
it wasn't defending the act of people getting killed,

228
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.750
but it was sort of looking at the root with, which is what you're saying. And,

229
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:44.550
and she, you know, she's kind of made that point.

230
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.830
It kind of always stuck with me. Well.

231
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.480
<v 1>Even more than like, which I get the point,</v>

232
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.920
but even more than other kids bullying them,

233
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:52.440
the truth is if you want to get at the root, you want to be like, Hey,

234
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.730
parents love your kids and give them a really good childhood. But it's like,

235
00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:58.410
how do you actually make that happen?

236
00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.400
<v 2>There's a natural,</v>

237
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.490
natural inclination that animals have to pick on the weaker ones.

238
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.350
It's a terrible natural inclination.

239
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.830
The human beings have to avoid because chickens do it. I have chickens,

240
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:11.520
my chickens with the smaller chickens and the less aggressive chickens,

241
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:14.940
they them up. They have a pecking order. You know, I've seen it with dogs.

242
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.150
One dog that comes to alpha, the pack takes over dominates.

243
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:20.790
The other dogs is a natural thing. It's natural,

244
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:25.200
it's natural and every single animal community. And it's natural with people,

245
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.870
but we're smart. And we understand the consequences of that.

246
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:31.260
And you've got to give those kids a reason to not do that, you know,

247
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:32.880
but there's also the problem with like,

248
00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:35.280
if you're going to school with LeBron James, okay.

249
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:40.260
Like standing next to this giant super athlete, you like kind of.

250
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.840
Genetic roll. The dice that I get, this mother got all ACEs. He's got five ACEs,

251
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:49.650
like seven feet tall. He weighs 300 pounds. He moves like a Panther.
