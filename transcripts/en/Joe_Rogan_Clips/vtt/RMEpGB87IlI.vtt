00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.880
Do you know anything about what's going on in the Pacific Northwest,

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.260
where there's a pot of orcas that exists primarily on Chinook salmon and then.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.110
<v 1>So that's the, so in fact it's important. It's,</v>

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.550
I'm glad you mentioned that because just, uh, yesterday and today, um,

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.510
a bunch of different protections are being announced for the Southern resident

7
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:24.900
killer whales, which are, uh, in the Salish sea.

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.070
So it's going to impede sort of vessel, uh, you know, they're,

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.930
they're really focusing on doing what they can what's happening.

10
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.350
There is they've got this snake river dam system that needs to be what happens

11
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:36.990
is they put the system in and the Chinook are just dying.

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.120
They can't get through the flow has gone. So.

13
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.200
<v 0>They put the system in a long.</v>

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.280
<v 1>Time, a long time ago. So it's,</v>

15
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.650
it's virtually over time has been decimating these populations.

16
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:44.461
No one really knew why,

17
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.430
but we're at the point now that we know that these orchids exclusively Chinook

18
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.890
and there's just not enough. And whereas they used to be massive ones.

19
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:53.030
Now they've got these tilt little tiny ones. And, you know, there was, uh,

20
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.770
th the, the plate of the Southern resident killer whales is really,

21
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.330
I'm glad that it, it, it's got getting global attention. Um,

22
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.690
I'm sure you're familiar with the mother who lost its calf and mourned for an

23
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:07.350
excess of like 40 days and carried around on her head and the type of vigil.

24
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:10.260
I mean, this was a, this captivated, the world,

25
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.480
and you can't look at an animal capable of such a suffering, uh,

26
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
without being acutely aware of the damage you're doing,

27
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.360
when you separate them from their family and natural investment.

28
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.800
<v 0>Let me explain the difference.</v>

29
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.780
When bears see their Cubs dead, they eat them. Yeah,

30
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.820
that's a difference. Yeah, this is,

31
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.060
you're talking about something that's insanely emotional.

32
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.650
It's a different kind of animal.

33
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.460
<v 1>And that's the thing that we're learning is the most notable aspect of these</v>

34
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:42.450
animals is their social, emotional intelligence capacity.

35
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.550
I'm afraid of what it is,

36
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:48.330
the depth of which we're going to find out that they're capable of, uh, of bond.

37
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.193
Because.

38
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.950
<v 0>Particularly if there's ever some sort of a way of translating communication,</v>

39
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.900
if they figure out a way of breaking down,

40
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.400
those sounds and expressions into something that we can decipher.

41
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.560
We right now, they don't, I don't think they know much. I've been.

42
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.480
<v 1>Underwater with orcas and dolphins, and I've heard them, uh, you know,</v>

43
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.600
I've heard, forget, I can't even tell you the sounds. I mean,

44
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.640
they've got a wide array of sounds, but, you know,

45
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.540
I could, you know, to, to, to, to the best of my abilities,

46
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.080
I could tell you when an animal was excited, based on their sounds,

47
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:22.914
they were making like, when,

48
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.940
when our Orca Neosha was pushing me underwater to do a rocket ride,

49
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:30.030
which is when you jump off into the air and you do this big majestic jump,

50
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.980
you knew it was going to be a good one.

51
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:35.610
When she let out this squawk at the bottom of the pool before pumping her tail

52
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.390
and launch, you just knew it, man, this, she was on, she was on fire.

53
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:41.610
And then it was other times you just, you just knew she wasn't into it.

54
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.590
And I could just, I could know, by the sounds,

55
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.290
you can really determine underwater sound alone.

56
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.080
You could really get to know your animal again. I was there 12 years. I mean,

57
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:50.670
I really got to experience a lot of things.

58
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.680
Other people can never really truly understand,

59
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.760
which is really why it's important.

60
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:56.310
That really important that I'm able to speak to these things because, uh,

61
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.130
I mean, even when it comes to the, the legislation that is passing, I mean,

62
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.500
I've had my name mentioned in the house of commons. I mean,

63
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.380
this is a national stage. I've had it mentioned in the Senate. I mean,

64
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.390
People care about what is coming up just yet, just a few days ago. And, uh,

65
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.890
Niagara MP, um, actually this would be a great video. If you could,

66
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.540
if you could pull it up, it'll be on my Twitter.

67
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:22.210
It's one of the things I retweeted with the MP, the local MP heat,

68
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.960
he bashes Marine land. I mean, that is a thing of absolute beauty.

69
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.320
I'm glad that I'm able to talk and explain to people what it is that my

70
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:34.300
experience has shown me and the things that I know,

71
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.200
because if people know they'll do better.

72
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.540
<v 0>Problem with the videos, if we play that video gets claimed, oh.</v>

73
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.490
<v 1>Really? It's a hosted commons, a video it's public.</v>

74
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.130
<v 0>And government thing. Those usually are okay, but it's all good.</v>

75
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:50.200
I don't know if it's from a, is it from a newsletter.

76
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.640
<v 1>But you know what, uh, the, the, the group that put it up because they, okay.</v>

77
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:56.680
Sorry about that. Okay. If you go to my Twitter and you check it,

78
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.420
it's something to Marvel is beautiful.

79
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.570
<v 0>We've had a load of problems, uh, Niagara region one.</v>

80
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.170
<v 1>I can assure you this animal justice will have no problem with you doing this.</v>

81
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:09.004
I'm good friends with.

82
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.740
<v 0>Can we celeb Chuck? Well, we'll just tell people how to get to it,</v>

83
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.700
but just put that back up. So I could read that, sorry. Um, it says, um,

84
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.960
Marine land, an unfortunate place with horrible conditions. Okay.

85
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.650
<v 1>Yeah, he's a, I mean, this is a member of parliament. This is, uh, on the, on,</v>

86
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.350
you know, this is the, this is the big stage right here. And he's finally,

87
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.860
and it took a long time for people, anyone in, in, in the, in,

88
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.730
in public policy to ever weighed into this subject.

89
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.870
Now we got people outright saying like this place as a whole, I mean, wow, what,

90
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.580
what, how far we've come in the last six and a half years.

91
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.540
<v 0>Changing my friend, various changing. Whether people like it or not.</v>

92
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.710
And this is one that I think it's,

93
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.500
it's unavoidable this discussion and this resolution, this, this has to be,

94
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.310
we have to come to grips with what that is. It's just,

95
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.440
it's just all kinds of wrong, man. It's all kinds of wrong. And, um,

96
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.970
the fact that they're still suing you after all these floods.

97
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.240
<v 1>As if they think it's working as if it's serving them any purpose, I'm here.</v>

98
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:13.060
I am again on the JRE. Like, are you kidding me, dude?

99
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:15.010
You don't even know the favor. You're doing me.

100
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.990
You don't even know what you've done. Come on. What, like,

101
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.930
uh, what, what, what are you, what do you want to accomplish?

102
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.150
What have you failed in accomplishing and what do you think you're going to

103
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:26.710
accomplish by like continuing? I mean,

104
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:29.740
Jamie is the virtual Def definition of insanity.

105
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.140
<v 0>Good move. Jamie, who was it? That was on the podcast who was explaining the,</v>

106
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.450
um, the processes in place of reintroduction into the wild,

107
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.120
or they were going to have stages and nets and stuff like that.

108
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.340
And these big outdoor areas where they can transmit dolphins and orcas to

109
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.160
who was that? Do you remember too many guns?

110
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.100
<v 1>No conversation. It's not me. Wasn't you? We talked,</v>

111
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.260
we spoke of the whale sanctuary project. I mean, that would be the, I mean,

112
00:05:57.261 --> 00:05:59.570
that's essentially the, the basis of it. And the goal.

113
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.280
<v 0>Was that maybe it was you,</v>

114
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.090
was it discussing how there's places where they're going to have like

115
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:06.290
intermediate steps? Yep.

116
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.400
<v 1>So maybe, maybe you guys, uh, expanded on it with someone else,</v>

117
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:13.610
but know that this is the basis of this project is. And, uh, I mean,

118
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:16.220
the good news is, uh, the whale sanctuary project. I mean,

119
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:18.470
this thing is going to happen. It is the future they're there,

120
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.450
they're there they're well into the process of finding a site, uh,

121
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.660
considerations are being made for a Washington state's, uh,

122
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.740
site out of Vancouver site.

123
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:30.080
But it appears as though they're settled on maybe Nova Scotia,

124
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:33.560
the community there at large is looking to work with them. That's a wonderful,

125
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.250
that's wonderful news. And I'll tell you something, Joe,

126
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.110
once this law gets Royal, Ascension becomes law.

127
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.910
What happens is Marine land is not able to export the animals unless the

128
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:49.820
minister of the DFO, the department of fisheries and oceans,

129
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.380
concurs that it's in the animals' best interests. Well,

130
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.660
if such a site exists and Marine land is keen on getting rid of their animals,

131
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.280
we'll have a place for them. I told you last time I was here,

132
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:06.770
that my dream is to save whales.

133
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.650
This might happen. Additionally,

134
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:17.420
if there's a real concerted effort of real effort to rescue those animals in

135
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:20.240
Russia, I may very well be a part of that team.

136
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.690
So we're six and a half years ago, I was talking about,

137
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.520
I was speaking of a crazy dream where there was no blueprint.

138
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.840
There was no foundation. I just sort of threw myself into the universe and said,

139
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.700
I'm just going to hang my hat on a dream. I'm watching in real time,

140
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.710
as it's materializing, that's a hell of a perspective. Humbling.

141
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.553
<v 0>That is amazing.</v>

142
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.300
This thing that we were talking about with the Pacific Northwest, um, there are,

143
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.200
it's the resident population that has an issue because they only need each and

144
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.640
Oak salmon, but then there isn't there a,

145
00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.690
another pod.

146
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.420
<v 1>Comes through there's transients and they're thriving because they eat</v>

147
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:03.820
everything. The transients are there. They're giving birth.

148
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:06.490
They're doing quite well. The Marine animals, they eat Marine animals.

149
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.430
It's correct. While I was the host and stuff, when I was there,

150
00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:13.240
the guy that was with us literally said, can you smell that? I'm like, no,

151
00:08:13.241 --> 00:08:16.030
what is that? Smell that sort of oily weird.

152
00:08:16.031 --> 00:08:20.230
She's like a seal is getting eaten somewhere. Next thing we know,

153
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.380
we saw the activity, you know, the dorsals and everything and yeah, sure.

154
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.010
There's.

155
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.840
<v 0>A part of a certain smell. She.</v>

156
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.570
<v 1>Could smell that, uh, that the seal was being eaten.</v>

157
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.890
<v 0>Can't they teach these smart whales to eat what their friends are eating.</v>

158
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.300
Why do they have to be rude? He wouldn't. It's like they won't eat Chinese food.

159
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.120
Chinese food. You're starving to death. No, I want a burger.

160
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.801
<v 1>It's a rare occasion,</v>

161
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:44.950
but there's something called a super pod where it's actually a congregation of

162
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:48.850
all the different, uh, uh, families of orcas into this,

163
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.590
into this event where they all take,

164
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:52.500
they congregate and it's a big social event.

165
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.970
And there's a conference that happens every two years,

166
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.770
Washington state called super pod, which is organized by a good friend of mine,

167
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.540
Jeff venture. It's a, it's an amazing event.

168
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.310
I look forward to being there again and speaking,

169
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:04.740
I got to get to another place for me to speak and,

170
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.580
and roam about with experts and whatnot and learned a great deal of things. But,

171
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.230
um, I was,

172
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.320
we were on the cusp of that almost happening because the boats are radioing to

173
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:14.910
each other, like, okay, well, we've got a family going, this,

174
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.080
we've got a family going. This is like, wait a sec.

175
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.960
There's three families going to the same, same direction. It's like,

176
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:22.050
there's gonna be a crossing of paths.

177
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:25.350
And this is where the boaters get real excited either at the prospect of,

178
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:28.560
of a super pot of sorts or conflict, or.

179
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.550
<v 0>They have conflict.</v>

180
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.590
<v 1>They fight. It could be. But I mean, for the most part, it's verbal.</v>

181
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:35.790
They just tell you like, stay away from me. You,

182
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.140
I imagine their messages are quite clear and you've got a 15,000 pound bull male

183
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:43.440
Orca giving you the bird. Yeah. You're going to listen. Yeah.

184
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.960
<v 0>Especially at transit holds, man. Oh yeah.</v>

185
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.330
When you see their mouths wide open and see their teeth, you're like,

186
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.440
what the are you? Why,

187
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.590
why don't they start eating mammals?

188
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:59.460
And I wonder if anybody's ever studied the difference in the behavior between

189
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:03.390
the transient pods that eat the Marine mammals versus the behavior,

190
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.480
the ones that only exist on salmon, like maybe they have a different,

191
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.140
maybe they're like, you know, like avatar, like there's different,

192
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.670
different kinds of people up there.

193
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.260
<v 1>My go-to source is Ingrid Visser. She is a top.</v>

194
00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:19.170
She's the woman in New Zealand that swims with orcas rescue because I mean,

195
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:22.300
she is a top, the, uh, the, the, really the,

196
00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:25.890
the global spectrum of wild orcas, uh, uh, scientists,

197
00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.270
she'd be the one to talk to you about that. I mean,

198
00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:29.490
you want to talk about a fascinating person to talk to holy,

199
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.620
the wealth of knowledge she has. And she is a,

200
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.580
she's a very passionate advocate and I'm very proud to have done some very,

201
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.563
very.

202
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.400
<v 0>Good work with her. So I'd love to talk.</v>

203
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.260
<v 1>To her, want to have her on the show?</v>

204
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.160
<v 0>Yeah. I would love to talk to her. I'm so curious about those things. She would.</v>

205
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.993
<v 1>Blow your mind.</v>

206
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.970
<v 0>Well, if there was a difference, if at all, and behavior.</v>

207
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.650
<v 1>If you were to invite her on the podcast,</v>

208
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:51.720
she would get on the next flight from New Zealand and come here,

209
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:54.000
I can assure you that there's ever any interest in.

210
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.700
<v 0>Being home.</v>

211
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.490
<v 1>You tell you what I think. I think she may have actually told the universe.</v>

212
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.630
Maybe she told me that. Yeah.

213
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.830
<v 0>Uh, they're amazing animals. I've always said that. And this is coming from a</v>

214
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.690
self-admitted big foot dork. I'm a big foot door.

215
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.380
I really wished big foot was a real thing. But if big foot was real thing,

216
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:17.820
it wouldn't be nearly as cool as an Orca. No. Like if, if we found some big,

217
00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:21.300
stupid stinky, Abe has been hiding from people forever and be like, wow,

218
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:25.140
that's cool. But it isn't much cooler than a Chimp or a gorilla. What?

219
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:28.980
Just because it's bigger. No. What an Orca is, is really cool.

220
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.130
That is a super intelligent, super cow that eats sharp.

221
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.540
<v 1>Stealth killing machine. That'll eat that.</v>

222
00:11:34.541 --> 00:11:36.510
That has great whites turn tuck and tail and running.

223
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.760
<v 0>Up a great white shark. Like it has no business, no business being in the ocean.</v>

224
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.410
<v 1>They're the perfect weapon in their world. I mean,</v>

225
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:46.230
there's nothing that touches them. They're literally at zero risk.

226
00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:47.160
They have no predators. I mean,

227
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:49.920
they're just too strong and too smart and coordinated.

228
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.200
They do their kills as teams. I mean,

229
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.090
you're literally up against an army out there. Try to be a 500 pound seal.

230
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.230
And that would be a big seal.

231
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.740
<v 0>Army of 13,000 pound tiller whales.</v>

232
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.520
<v 1>Sort of enjoy playing with you a little bit before you die. I mean,</v>

233
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:05.710
it's all interpreters play, but more often than not,

234
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:09.070
it's training the young ones on how to kill and stuff. It can be a brutal thing.

235
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:09.580
I mean,

236
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.730
I don't love watching it personally because they know I've worked with seals as

237
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:15.130
well. You know? I mean, it's, I'd take team.

238
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:15.993
<v 0>Orca all day.</v>

239
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.360
<v 1>You're not getting, you're not getting great odds,</v>

240
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.840
but put the host on it and you'll, you'll get some returns. Every time.

241
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.980
<v 0>Videos I ever saw was an Orca with a beach seal,</v>

242
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.440
the seal he had bitten it and tossed it through the air.

243
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:31.750
And the seal had made its way to the shore.

244
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.190
And it was actually on the land just with a little bit of water and the Orca

245
00:12:36.191 --> 00:12:41.050
beached itself grabbed the whole a seal and just start smashing it

246
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:42.040
in the water there.

247
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:46.690
And you see the water just flood red with blood and then it hops back and

248
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:51.160
wiggles itself back into water and swims away like, holy. Crazy.

249
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.270
Holy. These things were beached themselves.

250
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.280
<v 1>I think it's 15,000 pounds.</v>

251
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.850
<v 0>Now. Do they ever get stuck?</v>

252
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.210
<v 1>Yeah, they do. They do in New Zealand. In fact, that's where Ingrid's work is,</v>

253
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.810
uh, is really special that she's, uh, dude, this is a crazy story.

254
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:11.620
I have a friend that I grew up with, uh, Matt Harrison, he went on to the,

255
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.000
to be, um, real involved in the army. He's like decades into the army.

256
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:18.310
Now he was on a training mission in New Zealand.

257
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.730
They were doing this training on a beach and didn't they get called to go

258
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.100
perform an Orca rescue. He's just like, oh, what?

259
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.140
So now he's running and now they've got shovels.

260
00:13:26.141 --> 00:13:28.900
They're trying to figure this thing out. And now Ingrid shows up as the,

261
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:29.260
you know,

262
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.170
she's the person to call and now there's a photograph I'm waking up in the

263
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:35.470
morning to a photograph of Ingrid at this end of an Orca. And my friend,

264
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.900
Matt Harris from the same place as me, a little town of,

265
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.380
well at the other end of the Orca. And I'm like, you gotta be kidding me.

266
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.520
And I got to reunite the two of them back in, in Niagara falls in the summer.

267
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.590
Cause Ingrid had come down again and uh, oh my God,

268
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.340
these are blessings that I couldn't have even ever imagined.

269
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:54.370
And yet here he was. And he'd be the first to tell you when he came back,

270
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.760
it changed his world. It changed him. Never again. Marineland done.

271
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.590
Whereas before it might've been, you know,

272
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:02.650
it wasn't necessarily case he was part of this rescue. He's changed, man. Like,

273
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:04.390
he's just, I mean, now he's fascinated with work as like,

274
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.310
you can imagine he he's, he got the bug now.
