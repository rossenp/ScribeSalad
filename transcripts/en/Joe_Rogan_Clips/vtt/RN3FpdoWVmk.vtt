00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. To me, you know,</v>

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.520
one of the uplifting features of being

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.560
rooted in the arts and music is that no matter how ugly

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.800
and vicious and hateful things are it never

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.950
suffocates the human spirit. Hmm.

6
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.750
Somebody gonna tell a joke and you laugh somebody it's their sing a song and

7
00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:27.750
touch your soul. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah.

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
And it's almost a way of saying, uh, I love you.

9
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.590
Not in a sentimental Hollywood stereotypical way,

10
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.260
but you know that song by Stevie one of these three words. Oh Lord,

11
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.700
you got that me. We can't play. Oh, you can't play. Oh, I thought he go,

12
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.780
we'll get right. Cause that was a video that you put up there before. Yeah.

13
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:56.780
But that video was Gary Johnson singing in a concert that you did. Yeah.

14
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.260
Yeah. That's we can get away with that. Just listen to Stevie man.

15
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.930
Cuz he's talking about how an aching heart can be

16
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.890
kindled to smile and open and

17
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.730
connect in a world,

18
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.370
overwhelmed by hatred and distrust. That shot,

19
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:18.610
that shot through all of us and we all contribute to it.

20
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.970
Mmhmm &lt;affirmative&gt; we all contribute to it. You see? I mean,

21
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.560
one of the reasons why, even when I talk about, you know, brother Trump as a,

22
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.160
uh, the gang, I call him a kinda do we have created a fascist, uh,

23
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.000
Frankenstein and he's the creation of the worst of America in the way in which

24
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.000
Martin king represents the best that they are, both America's apple pie,

25
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.710
but any critique of anybody ought to begin with yourself

26
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.550
ought to begin with who we are.

27
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:50.310
Cause we all got gangsster elements inside of us. Yeah.

28
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.670
No way around us. He, no, I've never met. I met him one time,

29
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.670
I think at the end of Anita baker concert in the casinos, in uh,

30
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.820
Atlantic city, way back in the eightie. Wow. And it was interesting.

31
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:06.060
He was there with Mike Tyson I think.

32
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.260
And it was interesting cuz it was a chocolate affair. You know what I mean?

33
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.060
He Don a vanilla brother there. Right. And you know,

34
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:15.980
one of the first things that come across to the brother is that he just so glad

35
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:19.660
to be there hanging out with the black brothers. Cool. And so funny,

36
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:24.250
you could just tell he just squares, rectangle, sit back.

37
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.490
&lt;laugh&gt; you go listen to your beach boys, man. We got Jay's brown brother.

38
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.170
We got we Brian Wilson. We love you. But we got JB man. And, and,

39
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.490
but it, and it is, but,

40
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:38.490
and it's a cultural dynamic mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because he was the richest one

41
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.770
in the room though. Right.

42
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.680
And Mike Tyson got a lot of money when Don king got sold that money too. But uh,

43
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.000
uh, but it was a different kind of dynamic.

44
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.680
And so it's a context in which you embrace, you know, we,

45
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.520
we embrace them because that's the best of black culture. Right?

46
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:56.640
We embrace everybody. Right. You know what I mean?

47
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.680
Donald Trump's mother shows up from Scotland in 1930

48
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.160
black people been here, nine generation.

49
00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:07.920
We ain't gonna say go back where you come from, come on in here, sister,

50
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.360
be part of this democratic experiment.

51
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.840
We on the other side of chocolate side of town, but we welcome you,

52
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.400
but don't say nothing about our brown brothers and sisters coming in from

53
00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:21.710
Mexico. We &lt;affirmative&gt; because if anybody's definitive about what is America,

54
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.070
it's gonna be red in black people because they're the ones who undergo the

55
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.790
monstrous crimes against humanity, the genocide,

56
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:34.790
the stolen land on the one hand and the stolen peoples and the

57
00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:38.390
human on the other. Those are the pillars, the worst pillars of the country.

58
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.220
Then you've got democratic visions coming, not just from Thomas Jefferson,

59
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.860
but they're coming from the slaves like Frederick Douglas. Mmhmm.

60
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.000
See what I mean?

61
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.940
<v 1>The border crisis is a very interesting one, right? Because it's, it, it,</v>

62
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:55.140
it represents the, the fear of people. Yeah.

63
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.540
From the downtrodden countries where they,

64
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:01.370
they don't have opportunity trying to get into this country. Yes.

65
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.530
But then it also represents the fear of, of criminals,

66
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.570
of drug dealers and gangsters and gang members make cartel members

67
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.730
making their way across and, and victimizing our citizens. And both things are.

68
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.290
<v 0>Human. Both things are real, too human.</v>

69
00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:19.770
But if you tell the lies and make it as if the latter represent the whole right.

70
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:22.320
And that's what Trump specializes in. Right.

71
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.760
<v 1>Did you see the video of Pence when he was down there at the detention centers</v>

72
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.880
and just, just looking away? No humanity, just very disturbing. And.

73
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.880
<v 0>It's so, you know,</v>

74
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:37.080
it's so sad because here's a brother who speaks his whole personal

75
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.670
identity on Christianity being a Chris. Yes. Yes. And you say,

76
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.590
I felt the same way yourself, like brother Michael. I mean,

77
00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:46.470
as a fellow Christian,

78
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.430
I'm not trying to call and question your Christian faith or nothing.

79
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.030
I don't have authority to do that.

80
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.790
But the Bible says in part by the

81
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.630
works, you shall know them.

82
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.580
The works of love exemplify. You see, and you know,

83
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:08.420
nowadays you've got com commodmodified Christianity and a commodmodified culture

84
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.540
of a declining empire and you get Christian evangelicals 91%

85
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:17.100
or so prorump 79%. See, say,

86
00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:21.100
he's doing the best possible job. And you say to yourself, wow,

87
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:25.610
Chris tianity seems to have lost meaning of the cross

88
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.970
and has become so accommodated to the empire.

89
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.850
And it was the Roman empire who put Jesus to death, right?

90
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.090
It was Roman empire. You had some Neo colonial elites who cooperated,

91
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.840
but it was a Roman empire who puts Jesus to death.

92
00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:47.480
It was the greatest empire of its day. Very much like the Persian empire,

93
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.320
the largest greatest empire of its day with Cyrus to great.

94
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.480
Now you got the Roman empire putting Jesus to death.

95
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.840
And here Jesus is sent there by the crowd, by the mob.

96
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.920
And you say to brother Michael pinnce,

97
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.600
so you gonna accommodate yourself to Donald Trump.

98
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.520
You're gonna accommodate yourself to policies that are so inhumane in

99
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.830
bbaric just to retain your position and try to

100
00:06:20.831 --> 00:06:23.310
then rationalize it as a Christian.

101
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.870
We need some music and some comedy to try to get in contact with his humanity to

102
00:06:30.871 --> 00:06:33.790
change him. But most importantly, you just need a social movement. You know,

103
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:36.230
you need to get him outta office. You need some accountability.

104
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.380
<v 1>But with Pat's to just, just seeing him in reaction to those,</v>

105
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.540
people's just a failure of perspective, just.

106
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.340
<v 0>Cold, distant, and.</v>

107
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.140
<v 1>Callous. Well,</v>

108
00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:50.220
the narrative is that they broke the law and that they're imposing upon our

109
00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:54.580
great nation. And you know, this is it's crimes of opportunity.

110
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.770
They're just trying to, they're trying to find opportunity. &lt;affirmative&gt;,

111
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.410
they're trying to they're coming over here because they want a better life to

112
00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:02.730
not have sympathy for that.

113
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.170
<v 0>And, and, and other than indigenous peoples and, uh, and, and,</v>

114
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.690
and my own African peoples, that is the history of the country. Yeah.

115
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.170
The open and bring into the country.

116
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.960
Those who are eager of energy, willing to work and sacrifice,

117
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.880
and the unbelievable contribution of, uh,

118
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.320
of voluntary immigrants to the making of American American,

119
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.440
not a nation of immigrants.

120
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.000
I don't like that language cuz it overlooks indigenous peoples and right.

121
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.240
Involuntary immigrants like black people and, and, and slavery,

122
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.870
America's original sin.

123
00:07:39.871 --> 00:07:44.150
That's another neoliberal lie that you hear all the time on the corporate media,

124
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.070
as if indigenous people suffering has to be rendered invisible, right.

125
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.150
To highlight black people.

126
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.470
<v 1>What's one of the least discussed injustices of this nation. Right? Absolutely.</v>

127
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.790
And then their current situation with their, in,

128
00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.700
in these reservations with extreme alcoholism of drugddiction social.

129
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.140
<v 0>Misery, they still got their rich music and poetry and resistance, but the,</v>

130
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.900
the social conditions are just, but this, they, they,

131
00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:13.700
they are the casualties yes. Of a settler colonial enterprise.

132
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.660
And we rather act as if they don't exist. Right. I mean we,

133
00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:21.610
black people became central because our labor on our imagination and

134
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:24.570
culture became central. And we had a ballbaric civil war,

135
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:28.690
750,000 people dead each life precious. Uh,

136
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.610
and that has been the central event and the shaping of America.

137
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.530
So when people talk about race,

138
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:37.890
they go straight to blackness as if indigenous peoples in redness

139
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.890
is not integral.

140
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.680
It's just that they've been bridged so invisible and the vicious attack has been

141
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:44.853
so immense.

142
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.400
<v 1>What's so complicated too, that they have their own rules on the reservations.</v>

143
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.240
They're allowed to have gambling. They can have all sorts of they,

144
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.840
they have their own sovereignty in a certain way.

145
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.720
That's true on the reservations. It's very odd. Oh no.

146
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.480
<v 0>It's true. And I was blessed to be there in standing rock. Um,</v>

147
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.480
on a couple of Decembers ago, it was one of the, uh, marvelous moments in,

148
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.840
in my life to stand there with the, um, the group there.

149
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.080
It was a multiracial group.

150
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.830
People came from all around the world and I am inclined from Canada. Uh,

151
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.790
for the most part, it was a matter of the indigenous peoples coming together,

152
00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:23.550
memories of wounded knee in 1890, over 400 people.

153
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.310
<v 1>Could you remind people what this, what.</v>

154
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.191
<v 0>Standing rock was about,</v>

155
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.350
but standing rock was a struggle over that pipeline pipeline. Yeah, absolutely.

156
00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:33.470
Trying to put pressure on the Obama administration to ensure that a pipeline was

157
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.470
not built,

158
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:39.180
that would to violate the sacred lands and many of the sacred

159
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.820
memories of indigenous peoples.

160
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.660
And it was magnificent because you had the coming together of indigenous nations

161
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.060
because part of the problem,

162
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:51.500
this is true for all oppress people is fighting among them themselves.

163
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.330
And the difficulty of coming together is the first time you had the coming

164
00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.650
together, a significant number of indigenous people's nations unified

165
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.650
against the greedy corporate elites who were trying to

166
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.850
promote this pipeline through Canada all the way down to the Southern section of

167
00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:14.890
the United States. And it was just how that off, well, we first,

168
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.240
we got an announce, right? When we were there, it was freezing too.

169
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.160
It was December.

170
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.120
<v 1>And they were hosing people down too. Oh Lord Jess.</v>

171
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.760
They were hosing people down wet weting them down while this was all going on.

172
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.080
And.

173
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.280
<v 0>It was about minus mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; 15 or whatever it was,</v>

174
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.960
it was freezing up there, you know? And, uh, uh, but no,

175
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.910
we got an announcement from the Obama administration for, um,

176
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.870
suspension of it, cuz they had planned to do it too. I mean, you know,

177
00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:43.350
Obama administration can be very, uh,

178
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.150
accommodating the wall street interests and corporate lead interests and so

179
00:10:47.151 --> 00:10:49.070
forth. Uh, even given the,

180
00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:52.830
the image and spectacle of a black president being a progressive and what have

181
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:56.870
you much more progressive than Trump that that's not saying too much. Right.

182
00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.140
&lt;affirmative&gt; but uh, uh, but we got a suspension and uh,

183
00:11:01.141 --> 00:11:04.540
and the struggle continues really, but it was, it, it, and it,

184
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.660
it sent tremendous ripples through, uh,

185
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.740
the cultures of indigenous peoples and,

186
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.980
and their nations in terms of coming together in terms of, and the fact that.

187
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.460
<v 1>It was successful. Absolutely.</v>

188
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.580
<v 0>And, and there was at least a relative victory. Yeah.</v>

189
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.250
All these victories of relative, but very relative victory.

190
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.050
But it was beautiful just to see again, you know, you know,

191
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.890
you can't downplay the role of joy though, brother.

192
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.730
This is so very important. The joy in struggle,

193
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.330
the joy in organizing the joy in fighting for justice,

194
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.770
the joy in the nightclubs,

195
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.360
the joy in the is a Moss or temples or synagogues.

196
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.360
Joy is something that we need to come back to.

197
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.920
That's one of the great secrets of the human conditions.

198
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.400
What are the sources of joy? What are the conditions for the possibility of joy?

199
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.520
We've been, been obsessed with pleasure for the last a hundred years or so.

200
00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.640
Uh, and there's nothing wrong with, with pleasure,

201
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.360
but pleasure is not the same thing as joy at all.

202
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.000
When you look at the sparkling eyes of your precious daughter,

203
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.600
that's not pleasure. That's joy. Hmm. You and your wife,

204
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:16.350
that's de deep joy. You see that's what endures,

205
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.910
you could be broke as the 10 commandments financially,

206
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.470
but that memory will bring you joy.

207
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:33.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>
