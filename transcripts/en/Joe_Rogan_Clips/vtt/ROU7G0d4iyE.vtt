00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's important. You know,</v>

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.910
I can't help talking about the death penalty when we talk about shorty Clemente,

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:13.530
because in this country, a lot of people still believe in death penalty.

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.330
And I don't. Um,

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.620
and what I say to people who believe in the death penalty is I respect your

6
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.454
view,

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.320
but what percentage of innocent people are you okay with executing? Right?

8
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:28.410
Because the system is fundamentally flawed.

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.520
And even if the system was reformed in all the ways that we could sit here and

10
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.470
think of, right, and I have some ideas on that,

11
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.790
there's still going to be errors. There's always going to be there,

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.030
always gonna be errors made.

13
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.530
And so you have to accept that they're going to be mistakes.

14
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:47.580
We know that like in Florida where Josh represents James daily, and again,

15
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:51.510
we did a podcast episode about his case as well. Um,

16
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.980
James is either going to be the hundredth guy executed by the state of Florida

17
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.530
or the 30th guy exonerated from.

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.580
<v 1>Death row. Clemente was the 29th that I'm representing who should be the 30th.</v>

19
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.150
So.

20
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.330
<v 0>They're not even if all the people they executed were guilty.</v>

21
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:07.980
And we know they weren't. Right.

22
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:11.220
We know certain people like Jesse to Pharaoh who was absolutely innocent

23
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:14.970
executed by the state of Florida and that gruesome execution where the electric

24
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.150
chair quote, unquote malfunction and his head caught on fire.

25
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.250
And they had to electrocute him three times. But even if they got those right,

26
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.020
they aren't even batting 700. Right. And then in, in Louisiana, you know,

27
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.940
to your point before Joe, um,

28
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.150
a guy named John Thompson rest in peace was a good friend of mine.

29
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.050
He came within a month of being executed by the state of Louisiana.

30
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.540
When an attorney, uh,

31
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.610
investigator staring into a microscope and saw the DNA evidence to prove that he

32
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.490
was not guilty of this murder. And he was ultimately exonerated.

33
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.760
And he wrote an opinion piece the New York times where he said,

34
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.770
I don't understand why the prosecutor who prosecuted because he proved that they

35
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:59.130
knew he was innocent before they prosecuted him. Right. He knew it.

36
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.630
And it was absolutely proven. That was not in question. So he said,

37
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:06.810
I don't understand why that prosecutor is not being charged with attempted

38
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:09.510
murder. They tried to kill me and they knew I was innocent.

39
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:11.300
And I've proven that, but, and what.

40
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.390
<v 2>Happens to the prosecutor? Nothing, nothing, nothing. This is,</v>

41
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.310
I've been saying this for a long time.

42
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.970
That there's a real problem with human beings when it comes to anything where

43
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:24.680
there's a game and the problem with policing and prosecuting

44
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:26.240
people and convicting people.

45
00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:30.200
And it's a game and meaning that there's winners and losers. And when,

46
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:31.880
when there's winners and losers, people cheat.

47
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.930
There's a lot of people with poor character and they just want to win.

48
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.200
And they get caught up in this game. I mean, you can call it a game.

49
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.450
You can call it a pursuit, whatever you want to call it. There's a,

50
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:45.230
there's an end that you want to achieve if you're successful. And if you,

51
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.600
if you don't achieve that end, you're unsuccessful.

52
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.430
So when people are trying to achieve this end, they will do all kinds of things.

53
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.280
And it's just inherently a part of human beings that are weak.

54
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.910
People have weak character, people that are morally flawed. They,

55
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.760
things like that. They'll they'll,

56
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.870
they they'll know they're wrong and they do it anyway. They,

57
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.140
they know that someone is innocent and they pursue it anyway,

58
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:13.060
because they want that. W it's a real problem with people. I've seen it with,

59
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.720
we've all seen him playing games with people, kids do it, you know,

60
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:19.840
adults do it. Like when you see a grown adult cheating at cards,

61
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.090
or just a game of cards, it's a, it's an embarrassing thing. Like who are you?

62
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.270
You really hit it on the head so much. But listen.

63
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.330
<v 1>It is so even in the prosecutor and Clemente's case, and,</v>

64
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:38.700
and this is not, this is not some one-off circumstance, Joe,

65
00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:42.450
you could not have articulated it better. I mean, it is.

66
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.710
You ever been in an argument with someone and it's like,

67
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.460
with my wife, sometimes she'll be like, no, you left the keys here.

68
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.980
And I'll be like, no, I know I gave them back to you.

69
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.280
And then as you're in the argument, you remember, you know what, she's right.

70
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.940
I actually, right. But then you have a, you have a decision to make,

71
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.870
am I going to be the big person and say, I up, or am I going to,

72
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.580
am I going to continue down this course? Right. Unfortunately, you know,

73
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:13.320
and I think, I think Joe like hit on the fundamental psych psychology.

74
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.800
The psychology is almost like you're right. It's binary.

75
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.670
It's either win or lose. And I was begging, I mean, you know,

76
00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:24.510
I'm an emotional dude. I'm mushy. And I'm,

77
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.960
I had to weep to this prosecutor in Clemente's case,

78
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.630
I had the real murderer on the stand.

79
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.070
And I got my first question to her was how many times have you threatened to

80
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:38.790
murder someone? Watch how dug in they get? She said, never.

81
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.720
I had a dash cam video of her saying to a cop,

82
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.650
blasting her head against the partition. I'm going to murder you, you.

83
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.950
So I played the video for, and I said, what about that?

84
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.750
She said, oh, I didn't listen. I didn't watch. So that was you.

85
00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:01.350
That was your voice. Right. And you know,

86
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.210
I got her and then she says, well, I black out. I say things and do things.

87
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:10.110
And I black out them, block them out. I finally got her to admit, I said,

88
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.340
isn't it true that you may have murdered your mother and your grandmother and

89
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.790
blocked it out. She said, yes. And I,

90
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.440
I had to sit in a room with this prosecutor and I don't know if it was just

91
00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:27.030
like, you know, like an angry cry, cause I'm angry that he won't just say,

92
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:29.190
I up here. We up.

93
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.130
And we got the wrong person and I'm weeping to him saying,

94
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.570
can't you just admit that you made a mistake and, and you're right. It is that,

95
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.540
that I have seen it so many times with prosecutors.

96
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.320
It's all about getting the w and they just want to make that they're wrong.

97
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:47.700
And I think that there's something deeper about human psychology working there,

98
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.940
where the powers that be won't admit. I mean, I hate to say,

99
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.520
but Kamala Harris was no different here in California. I mean,

100
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.340
she defended, you know, wrongful convictions. Why?

101
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.260
I mean, this isn't like made up,

102
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.160
there's like a huge investigative piece in the New York times about it.

103
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.240
It's not something that's germane to Florida. It's in California,

104
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:15.470
it's in New York and God forbid you're in the south, you know?

105
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.680
And it's, it's a real problem. And I don't know how.

106
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.440
<v 2>To say it. Well,</v>

107
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.050
it's not like they're going to completely overhaul the system and stop the

108
00:06:23.051 --> 00:06:27.760
whole, the, the way it's set up now with a judge and prosecutors and attorneys,

109
00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:30.250
and it's there. They're not going to change it. I mean,

110
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.600
if the system is in place, there's too many cases, right?

111
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.100
There's constantly there.

112
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:42.100
They're constantly hearing new cases to completely overhaul and change this

113
00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.830
method of, of, of policing and convicting people.

114
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.920
It would require a massive undertaking and.

115
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.271
<v 1>That's, well,</v>

116
00:06:48.271 --> 00:06:51.520
we're so appreciative that you give us this forum because there are so many

117
00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:54.250
amazing people that, you know,

118
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.970
are that it really literally takes being in,

119
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.010
in the bowels, if you will,

120
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:04.510
of the system and getting it beneath your fingernails and standing up and

121
00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:05.710
speaking truth to power.

122
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.600
<v 2>That'd be terrifying to be there too.</v>

123
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:12.070
To know that someone is willing to convict someone that they know is innocent

124
00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:13.540
because they want to win. And there's.

125
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.710
<v 0>More, there's so many factors that go into wrongful convictions, Joe,</v>

126
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.920
we see them again and again, tunnel vision is one, right? They lock in on you.

127
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:22.000
They decide you're the guy.

128
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:24.880
And then more new evidence comes in and says he did it right.

129
00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:26.920
They don't want to hear it. Right. They, they, they just,

130
00:07:26.921 --> 00:07:31.060
it's a psychological thing. Um, it's also blind ambition. Um,

131
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.600
and there are so many factors that I think some of them are preventable.

132
00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:36.910
And when, when we set out to do these podcasts,

133
00:07:36.911 --> 00:07:38.020
whether it's the wrongful conviction,

134
00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:41.290
one or junk science that Josh is the host of just came out or even the false

135
00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:42.820
confession series that we did,

136
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.460
our goal is to educate the public because your listeners are

137
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.070
going to you and me, everyone, I'm Jamie over here,

138
00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:54.310
the engineer's going to end up on, uh, on a jury at some point, right?

139
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.340
And I mean, maybe having you maybe holding somebody's life in your hands,

140
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.310
and it's important for you to understand that the people that you hope that are

141
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.130
going to be telling you the truth that you respect because they're authority

142
00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:09.700
figures, right? I grew up respecting uniforms and everything else.

143
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:10.690
And I still do.

144
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.130
But the fact is they may not be telling the truth.

145
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.530
And the just because somebody says, they're an expert,

146
00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:19.270
that's what Josh talks about on his podcast.

147
00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:20.680
Doesn't mean they're really an expert.

148
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.620
They may be talking about things that are actually junk science.

149
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.430
And furthermore, they're allowed to lie in the interrogation room.

150
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:29.740
And this is something. If we get nothing else across today,

151
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.670
I always tell people when I go to talks and on my show,

152
00:08:33.671 --> 00:08:38.320
I talk about the fact that if you get picked up and brought in for questioning

153
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.290
and you know, people who are innocent waive their Miranda rights,

154
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.300
85% of people wave their Miranda rights. Anyway,

155
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.770
people who were innocent almost always do,

156
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:47.320
because they don't think they have anything to hide. They think I'll just go in.

157
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.900
I'll tell them what, you know, like I wasn't there.

158
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:52.360
I was with my mom or whatever it was and I'd go home.

159
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.730
And they may not say that you're a suspect at all. Let me say,

160
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.590
we just want to ask you a few questions. So the answer is,

161
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.570
if that happens to you,

162
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.850
the only thing you should say is this is my I'm Joe Rogan.

163
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.970
And I want a lawyer or whatever your name is. Whoever's listening.

164
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.390
Those are the only words you should say, because they're not your friends.

165
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.710
And you can get talked in that interrogation room. Crazy happens.

166
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:21.180
They don't always beat people up. They don't need to, they can use coercive,

167
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:24.900
psychological tactics that can get people to confess to crimes that they didn't

168
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:29.360
commit. And once you start talking and you're in that little airless room,

169
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.880
you've seen it on TV, right? And they start the good cop bad cop,

170
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:33.870
and they intimidate you.

171
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:36.000
And they threaten you with the death penalty and they're allowed.

172
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.340
<v 2>To lie. Why are they allowed to lie?</v>

173
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.700
<v 0>That's a great question, Joel. I mean, other Western countries, they're not,</v>

174
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:44.400
but here they are. So they can sit there and especially, and you know,

175
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:48.480
the people that are most likely to falsely confess our people, adolescents,

176
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.550
right? Anyone whose brain is not fully formed.

177
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.690
And we know that your brain is not fully formed two to 25 and military veterans,

178
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.590
interestingly enough.

179
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:58.230
And they're disproportionately affected by this because they're used to obeying

180
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:00.630
authority figures, right? And following orders.

181
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.290
And so the Norfolk four classic case of that four,

182
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.880
four guys confessed to a crime. They didn't commit. Um, and none of them did it.

183
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.810
And the.

184
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.060
<v 1>Central park five is another good example, right? Those.</v>

185
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.180
<v 0>Were just kids. They were just young teenage kids. And you know, they,</v>

186
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:17.850
they can sit there and they can threaten you with the death and they can sit

187
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:20.820
there and go, Joe, listen, we got your buddy in the next room.

188
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.550
He's not even there. And he says, he saw you do it.

189
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:27.330
We got your fingerprints on the, on the knife. Joe, what are you talking about?

190
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.210
The best thing for you is to cut back. And.

191
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.990
<v 1>Joe asks, you asked the, the critical question, which is,</v>

192
00:10:32.991 --> 00:10:37.820
why are they allowed to do it? Because there's not a law, no one has the balls.

193
00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:42.080
All these blowhard politicians have the balls to introduce law. Cause you know,

194
00:10:42.081 --> 00:10:45.830
they're afraid to off the police union because they'll lose that vote. Right.

195
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.370
To introduce legislation with the police unions should be the ones who are

196
00:10:49.371 --> 00:10:53.870
clamoring. Right. That introduce legislation now. Right? Introduce legislation,

197
00:10:53.871 --> 00:10:58.070
right? Especially now introduce legislation that makes it a crime, right.

198
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.570
To lie to a suspect. Think about the mind, that's going on here.

199
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.310
And remember the psychology is, we're going to deprive you of sleep.

200
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.940
We're going to deprive you of food. We're going to scare the living out of you.

201
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.720
And we're going to lie to you. We're going to lie to you and make you,

202
00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:18.830
you ever see that Chris rock bit where he's like cop pulled me over and after a

203
00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:23.510
while, I'm like, maybe I did do it. It's like, that is going on.

204
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.910
And it's like, you know, you're like

205
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.320
maybe I did something and didn't remember it.

206
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.560
That's what they start getting you to believe. Because if they're telling me,

207
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.080
they're saying, Joe, listen, we have,

208
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.700
how the do you explain how your DNA is on the

209
00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:43.670
victim? How do you explain that? And you're thinking to yourself,

210
00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:48.020
I can't explain that AI didn't do it, but maybe I don't. I don't know.

211
00:11:48.021 --> 00:11:52.250
Maybe I did something and don't remember it. And then there's, there's this,

212
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.700
which is, you'll hear from a lot of people that are victims of coercive.

213
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.070
Interrogations is, um,

214
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.440
I figured I would just tell them what they wanted to hear,

215
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.850
get out of the room and then sorted out. Right.

216
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.510
<v 0>Right. And they, and they'll say to you, listen, you're just a kid. No,</v>

217
00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:12.540
one's going to believe that you committed this gruesome murder. Right.

218
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:15.810
You just got to my partner's crazy. I dunno what he's going to do to you.

219
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.760
But while he's out of the room, let me tell you kid,

220
00:12:17.761 --> 00:12:21.720
the best thing for you to do is just sign the piece of paper. And you know,

221
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.550
we'll sort this out later, you'll be fine.

222
00:12:23.551 --> 00:12:26.460
But now you've just signed your own death warrant because juries can't

223
00:12:26.461 --> 00:12:29.520
understand. When you ask people, would you ever confess to a crime?

224
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.610
You didn't commit the first a hundred people. You see, they all say no, no, no,

225
00:12:32.611 --> 00:12:34.590
no. I'm, I'm smart. I would never do that.

226
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:39.390
But the thing is they don't realize 25% of the

227
00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:42.240
DNA exonerations, approximately 25%, uh,

228
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.260
involve false confessions. So just process that, right?

229
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.070
That's how many people confess because they're good at it. And some of them are,

230
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.370
some of them are great at it. Some of them may be mentally challenged, right?

231
00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:56.400
The cops, it's also a game. It's a game to get you to gain.

232
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.190
<v 2>The same kind of game. It's a game to get you to confess. And it.</v>

233
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:04.080
<v 0>Goes on. Even after the conviction has been overturned, liken Clemente's case,</v>

234
00:13:04.081 --> 00:13:05.520
like in my own adopted daughter,

235
00:13:05.521 --> 00:13:09.900
Nora Jackson's case where the Tennessee Supreme court unanimously overturned her

236
00:13:09.901 --> 00:13:14.310
conviction for murdering her own mother and in their, in their ruling,

237
00:13:14.311 --> 00:13:19.290
they excoriated the prosecutors for having played so loose with the rules,

238
00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:23.190
right. To say the least. And yet they came back in and said, listen,

239
00:13:23.191 --> 00:13:25.230
we're going to try you again, unless you take,

240
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.070
unless you take a plea and most people say to me, well,

241
00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:31.200
what would the kid try you again for the same thing,

242
00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:34.920
but they can because the higher court, when they overturn your conviction,

243
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.880
the indictments they'll stay as original. And most prosecutors will say, wow,

244
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.240
you know what? It's a long time ago and we've been proven wrong. And you know,

245
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.020
th th we were going to let it go. But if they really are vindictive,

246
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.110
they may say, you know what? I want to protect this, this conviction.

247
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.000
And let's not forget that every time we convict an innocent

248
00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:58.110
person, the real, the real perpetrator remains free.

249
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.660
And that even if you're someone who may be, you know,

250
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.160
pretty hard line hardcore on, on, you know, law and order, whatever, you know,

251
00:14:04.161 --> 00:14:07.560
a lot of your listeners come from different walks of life, different viewpoints,

252
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.450
but everybody can agree that we want the person, especially these vicious,

253
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.570
violent crimes, these brutal crimes, we,

254
00:14:14.571 --> 00:14:18.270
we should all want the real perpetrator off the street and not for the

255
00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:23.230
convenient target to just get, you know, you know, manhandled and,

256
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:25.680
and, and, and, and brutalized by the system.

257
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.180
And then that other perpetrator oftentimes goes on to commit more terrible

258
00:14:30.181 --> 00:14:32.640
crimes and creates more innocent victims. Okay.
