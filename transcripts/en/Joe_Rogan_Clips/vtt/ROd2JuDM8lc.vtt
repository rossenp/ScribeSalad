00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.480
<v 2>Was it disappointing like being on Congress in Congress and,</v>

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.580
and seeing that kind of behavior,

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.260
like if you have this ideal of what a representative of our

5
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:15.000
democracy is supposed to be,

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.040
and then seeing people that are petty and that are sneaky and

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.940
doing little.

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.650
<v 0>Um, this was my first impression getting elected, uh,</v>

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.330
got elected 2012, got there and sworn in, in January of 2013.

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.650
And, uh, I remember, um, calling home,

11
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:37.830
I think I was talking to my family, my parents or somebody. And I was like,

12
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.970
this place is like high school, even on the house for that.

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.350
That's the only time we're all together.

14
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:47.670
Usually for votes when you've got everybody all 435 members there and you see

15
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:50.970
the little cliques gathering in their designated corners,

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.110
like the cafeteria tables and, uh, you know,

17
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:56.760
one click is kind of, you know,

18
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.490
giving the mean girls side-eye to the other click and like, oh, if you're,

19
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.060
you're hanging out on that side of the room with those people,

20
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:07.650
what's wrong with you, man. It's it's, I mean, it's,

21
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.461
it's funny,

22
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:13.110
but it's so terrible when you understand that this is the power

23
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:17.160
base for decision-making in our country. And you'd like,

24
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.420
how is this even possible?

25
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:23.340
It's possible because so often people will vote for a

26
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:28.320
candidate because like they have a really cool ad on TV or like yeah. That,

27
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.370
that person, you know,

28
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.990
is a good looking guy or a good looking girl or they talk good. They talk nice.

29
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.010
Sounds smart. Yeah. All right. Check. Rather than like, all right,

30
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.480
what are your capabilities? What are your qualifications? Like?

31
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.550
What kind of judgment will you exercise in making decisions that affect

32
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.080
literally every single aspect of our lives as Americans in this

33
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:52.914
country?

34
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.210
And so it's terrible that we have,

35
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.100
um, this kind of makeup in our, in our government,

36
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.500
but also like we,

37
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:07.710
as voters have to do a much the powers in our hands,

38
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.250
ultimately in how we're making decisions, uh,

39
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.300
in choosing who gets to work for us and not forgetting that,

40
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.020
not forgetting that those people who work in the United States Capitol,

41
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.810
they work for us when it comes right down to it.

42
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:23.400
And so we have the power to hire and fire.

43
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.590
<v 1>I think that people have developed such a sophisticated</v>

44
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.570
way of manipulating folks that the thing

45
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:37.530
about running for office, uh, particularly running for president it's,

46
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.120
it's one of the weirdest things where the most important

47
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:47.040
job ever. Yeah. You don't have to be qualified. You just have to be chosen.

48
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.580
So you don't have to have any experience in government.

49
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.480
You don't even really have to know how government works.

50
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.740
All you have to do is get enough people that are willing to give you a and

51
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:04.210
you can have the nuclear football, like not saying Trump, I'm not saying him,

52
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:08.740
but if someone comes along some ridiculously popular

53
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:11.770
person that knows absolutely nothing about government,

54
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.490
but they're like Justin Bieber, he wants to be president.

55
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.140
I love that guy.

56
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.060
Like that is not outside of the realm of possibility. All you,

57
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.980
if you, if, if you have some incredibly charismatic person and you,

58
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.690
you like them over Marco Rubio or whoever the it is Ted Cruz. And you're like,

59
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.920
right, well, that guy sucks. This guy can sing his off. Let's go with him. Like,

60
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.150
but you're literally giving someone the power to run the greatest army.

61
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:42.070
The world's ever known. The, the,

62
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.750
the most insanely technologically advanced

63
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.230
civilization on earth. And the one with the most weapons,

64
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.010
you're going to let a person who wins a popularity contest.

65
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.230
They can run this. Yeah, man.

66
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.010
<v 0>I mean, I, I lived through this. I literally just lived through this,</v>

67
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.670
but what's the alternative, well, people, first of all,

68
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:08.280
need to kind of have the veil lifted on, on,

69
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.910
on what this is and how both political parties play into this.

70
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:17.080
And the media plays into this. You know, I saw from,

71
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.190
from the very day that I announced my candidacy for president, you know,

72
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:24.520
I ran for president on, uh, out of concern of,

73
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:27.520
of some very real issues that our country is facing,

74
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:31.180
wanting to bring voice to those issues and actually do something about it. Uh,

75
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.590
the, the, the rise of, of north Korea's nuclear capabilities, for example,

76
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.480
and how we in Hawaii lived through the reality of that threat.

77
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.920
When we got that, that missile alert that came through that caused, you know,

78
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.620
families to go and like tell people what the real quick.

79
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.390
So this was January, 2019, uh,

80
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.370
early one Saturday morning,

81
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.190
the civil defense alert system on our state sends out a text message to every

82
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:05.150
cell phone in the state blared warnings on the radios, uh, the,

83
00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:08.440
the sirens on television saying, uh,

84
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.550
missile incoming to Hawaii, uh,

85
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.990
this is not a drill take shelter. This is not a drill.

86
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.050
And so the response to that was like, holy,

87
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.630
this could be the end.

88
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.190
An incoming missile to Hawaii from North Korea would literally mean the

89
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:33.100
destruction, not only of Hawaii, but the,

90
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:36.190
the aftermath and everything else would, would imp have a much,

91
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:39.940
much bigger impact. So that's how people responded, you know,

92
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.630
grabbing their little kids and running in, like, where do you take shelter?

93
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:47.790
Like going into the bathtub and hunkering down. There was a, uh, a,

94
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.940
father's a video of a father who got his like little eight year old daughter and

95
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.100
lowered her down a manhole and was, was,

96
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.200
I think he said something in the video. Like if we survive this,

97
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.380
try to come find me. And there,

98
00:06:05.381 --> 00:06:10.130
there are countless other stories of, of, I heard from,

99
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:15.080
from a father who he had one child who was in downtown Honolulu.

100
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.600
The other was on the west side of Oahu, which is a good 45 minute drive.

101
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.610
And he was physically in the middle. And, and in those moments,

102
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.500
he was sitting there knowing he had minutes to live,

103
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.510
trying to decide which child he was going to go and drive to and spend those

104
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.420
last minutes of life with

105
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.520
the seriousness of this is something that has

106
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.420
and continues to be lost on the leaders of our country.

107
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.260
And this was one of the main reasons that I ran for president so that I could do

108
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:58.820
something to make sure that no other American,

109
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:03.680
no other family went through what we went through in Hawaii. On that day,

110
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.740
I announced my candidacy for president so that we can talk about these very

111
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:13.580
serious issues. And on day one immediately,

112
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.530
literally that very day within minutes, mainstream media starts attacking.

113
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.160
That's when the whole Russian asset thing began,

114
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.130
these seeds were planted to say, oh, she's some kind of suspicious candidate.

115
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:25.964
You better watch out.

116
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.130
The smears started the building of this caricature of

117
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.370
me as something that has nothing to do with who I am, my experience,

118
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:38.810
my background, my capabilities, what I'm advocating for. Nope.

119
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.540
The media didn't want to talk about that. The, the,

120
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:46.160
the other candidates didn't want to talk about it going on the debate stage.

121
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.910
Okay, I'm going to,

122
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.720
this is a national stage to be able to raise these very serious issues about

123
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.430
the, the, the nuclear threat that our country faces,

124
00:07:55.431 --> 00:08:00.410
this new cold war and what we need to do to walk back away from the brink

125
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:03.290
of nuclear catastrophe. Nobody wants to talk about it.

126
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:07.460
They want to go towards the superficial attacks. They want to go towards the,

127
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:08.970
he said, versus she said,

128
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.830
and ultimately the things that will cause ratings to go up,

129
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.540
and that will further this, this popularity contest that you're talking about,

130
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:22.010
which ultimately all of this is the ultimate disservice

131
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.300
to voters,

132
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.490
because it takes away their ability to make this informed decision

133
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.450
about who should hold the nuclear football and what experience they bring,

134
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:34.910
what kind of judgment they would bring,

135
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:39.320
what kind of foresight they bring to this most powerful and important

136
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.750
job and responsibility.
