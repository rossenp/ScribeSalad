00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You saw this trader Joe's story.</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.400
You were telling me earlier while to trader Joe's. It's called trader Joe's.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.010
Right? Which is not racist, I guess. But apparently they,

4
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:14.420
they have Mexican products that they were calling trader Jose's and

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.490
some bored person in their basement decided to create a petition that got signed

6
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:23.300
by some 2,400 other board people about why it shouldn't be called trader Jose's

7
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:26.480
because that's racist. So apparently it's cultural appropriation.

8
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:28.070
If you're trader Joe's and you make a burrito,

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.410
but if you call a trader Jose's then that's,

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.030
I think they called it exoticizing Mexican people. Yeah.

11
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:38.180
It's making them exotic and other, so trader Joe's pulled it down.

12
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:40.250
Trader Joe's is gonna, is gonna knock. You use this anymore.

13
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.100
17 year old called out a 17 year old.

14
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.510
<v 1>Called out trader Joe's. Now the chain is dropping offensive. Labeling.</v>

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.240
<v 0>Jose, like how many Hispanics were,</v>

16
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.950
were picketing outside trader Joe's being odd.

17
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.390
Now that I saw that trader Jose beer.

18
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.940
<v 1>Right? Alyssa I'm Italian. Do you think Papa Gino's? Is that really? You know,</v>

19
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.350
I mean, is that really a, an Italian who made that company? Like how many,

20
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:01.190
how many different,

21
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.340
like different pizza companies and all these not

22
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.580
by Italian.

23
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.641
<v 0>Got it.</v>

24
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:10.040
I'd love to see the racial breakdown of the people who signed this petition.

25
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.480
I would bet 90% of them are white. 90%, right? White.

26
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.860
<v 1>Live in the suburbs. Hate their parents. Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.930
<v 2>What did you say? What was the word they use for.</v>

28
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.160
<v 1>It? Exoticized exoticized said, oh my God. That is so adorable.</v>

29
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.180
Exoticizing. I was talking to you about, um, Rick Bayless.

30
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.440
Who's a famous chef of Mexican cuisine who is a white man

31
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.190
who adores Mexican food. I mean, I love the guy.

32
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.920
I love listening to his videos. I love Mexican food.

33
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:39.500
So watching this guy's videos, it's like,

34
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.320
I love someone who's really into something. You know, I just,

35
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.670
I get a kick out of even there's a guy I used to watch on PBS that would make

36
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.500
furniture with, um, ancient tools. Like you'd use like,

37
00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:55.670
like ancient, like, um, uh, different old time.

38
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.770
He saw us and chisels and,

39
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.490
and he would make these wooden chairs and tables and furniture.

40
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.670
This is called the Amish, right? I mean, but he kind of looked like that,

41
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.880
but he was, he was really dressed like an old timey guy.

42
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.600
And he had this old timey shop and he would make this stuff and I loved watching

43
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:15.200
him and I don't give a about his furniture. I don't.

44
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.770
But what I cared about was the fact that this guy was really passionate about

45
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.470
his thing. And it was very attractive to me. And I feel the same way.

46
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:26.000
And I watched this guy, Rick Bayless talk about Mexican cuisine. He loves it.

47
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.900
He takes regular trips to Mexico and learns how to cook these dishes in the

48
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:32.840
traditional way, and then talks about it with this great passion.

49
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.290
But the guy just got all over. They were just like,

50
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.720
you're culturally appropriating. You shouldn't be doing this.

51
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.420
<v 0>Man. Let me just say this generally cultural appropriations,</v>

52
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.530
a bunch of horseshit in the region.

53
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:44.960
It's a bunch of horseshit is because you know what? The best in life,

54
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.080
all the things that are good from every everybody else's culture.

55
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.950
Like the reason people live in major cities is to go to all the different

56
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:53.960
restaurants from all of the different cultures.

57
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.770
Cultural I'm so confused as to why cultural appropriation is bad.

58
00:02:57.771 --> 00:03:00.490
Cultural appropriation is the greatest that has ever happened to planet earth.

59
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.120
We were all siloed off into our own little cultures.

60
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.700
You know how much things would suck. They're just terrible. So this kind of,

61
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.800
yeah, this kind of stuff is just crazy, but it's nuts.

62
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.590
<v 1>Look, I grew up teaching TaeKwonDo, which is a Korean martial art.</v>

63
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.720
I learned to count in Korean. I had to speak all the techniques in Korean.

64
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.090
<v 0>Koreans. It's clearly, I mean, that's clearly the problem.</v>

65
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.030
<v 2>Culturally appropriate the out of my child. Yeah, exactly.</v>

66
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.170
<v 0>This is all. This is all crazy. And there's no, there's no apparent end to it.</v>

67
00:03:28.171 --> 00:03:29.340
Like there's no limiting principle.

68
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.380
<v 1>There's no limit, no limit. I read a column.</v>

69
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.490
<v 0>This morning by somebody.</v>

70
00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:35.340
I think it was in the Washington post saying that we should just keep changing

71
00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:37.440
the name of everything. Like literally forever.

72
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.690
We should just keep changing the name of everything. She said, you know,

73
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.330
there was this town. And I think I found a non-offensive name for the town.

74
00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:44.730
But if I found something else that was offensive, like three years from now,

75
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:46.770
we should change the name of the town. Just that. Okay.

76
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:50.280
So we are living in 1984, right? Your Orwell talked about renaming. Everything.

77
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.390
<v 1>People will find a way. They'll find a way to be mad.</v>

78
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.570
<v 0>Here's my, here's my controversial statement. Okay. If you,</v>

79
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.650
my controversial statement is if you have to go this far to find things to be

80
00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:03.810
offended over, there's not that much to be offended over.

81
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.200
If you have to go so far that you have to be offended by trader Jose's,

82
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.360
you got nothing going on in your life.

83
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.450
There's a dramatic demand for being offended and acting like a victim.

84
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.830
And they're just like,

85
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:16.920
there are actual victims in this country and internationally that are seriously

86
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:19.560
actual victims, but we don't focus on any of those folks. Right.

87
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:23.790
We focus instead on like the dumbest bull crap you ever heard about,

88
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:27.030
about renaming libraries and listen, I'm fine with it. You want to move?

89
00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:29.130
You want to take a Confederate statue and put it museum fine.

90
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.040
And those guys were jerks. They're they're terrible. People fine, go, go for it.

91
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.270
But like you're talking about,

92
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.810
we're going to fix the world by renaming Washington, DC,

93
00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.060
because Washington was bad. It's like, what did you do late?

94
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.080
Did you go to Washington then?

95
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.480
Like I understand we don't put up statutes to people for all the bad crap.

96
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.300
They did. Martin Luther king had a real bad record with ladies. Okay.

97
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:47.670
We don't put up statues to Martin Luther king because we were saying he was

98
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:50.610
great with, with women. I think everybody was bad with women back then.

99
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.370
<v 3>Everyone's bad period. Human being suck.</v>

100
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.950
<v 0>Okay. So either get rid of all the statutes or recognize the human beings,</v>

101
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.080
obviously for sure there are gradations of suck. But.

102
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.050
<v 1>Remember back when they were tearing down those civil war statues and,</v>

103
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.340
and Trump in all of his wisdoms, like, what are they going to do next?

104
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.490
What about Lincoln? What about a, they're going to take down George Washington.

105
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:10.920
And everybody's like, oh, he's so crazy. Meanwhile,

106
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:13.500
that's exactly what they were doing. That was what they were doing.

107
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.470
What I mean in Chicago? Well that actually,

108
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:19.170
that was actually Christopher Columbus who was legitimately a bad guy.

109
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.790
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, yes. Yeah. Also everyone was bad.</v>

110
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.000
Like literally all the people were like enslavement, brutal,

111
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.780
brutal treatment of people, fairly commonplace. So do you think.

112
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.350
<v 1>There's an argument to be said that maybe we shouldn't celebrate those bad</v>

113
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:34.981
people anymore,

114
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:37.830
that we know what they are now that we know what they really were.

115
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.420
<v 0>I think we should just talk about the bad people.</v>

116
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.490
Like I don't think we're the only good people in history. I think.

117
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.400
<v 1>You should have a statue of Gangas Kahn.</v>

118
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.580
<v 0>I don't know what a gang has come to you. That was good. That had good results.</v>

119
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.150
Well.

120
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.100
<v 1>He opened up trade to China. Okay. If you want to.</v>

121
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.130
<v 0>Put up a trade to try and a statute for Ganga Scouts, the trade Federation,</v>

122
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:56.100
10% of the population. Yeah. True enough.

123
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.740
And what impregnated the other 10% or something it's.

124
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 1>Literally raped his way through.</v>

125
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.120
<v 0>The point of a Christopher Columbus statue is not all the bad things he did to</v>

126
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:05.661
the Arawaks.

127
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.240
The point of a Christopher Columbus statue is we are glad that Western

128
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:09.800
civilization came to the Western hemisphere.

129
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:12.320
I kind of agree with that principle. I think it is a good thing.

130
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:14.570
The Western civilization came to the Western hemisphere and yes,

131
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.920
there was a lot of brutality and yes,

132
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.870
there's a lot of cruelty and we should talk about all those things.

133
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.890
But this notion that the only cruelty that has ever existed in human history

134
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:23.630
came at the behest of Western civilization,

135
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.560
that everything was a resilient paradise before Christopher Columbus came that

136
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:31.310
Christopher Columbus doesn't deserve a statue in specific that we should, that,

137
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.670
that like either make the argument that everybody was a product of their time.

138
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:38.330
And therefore no one deserves a statue or recognize that when there's a statue

139
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.080
of Christopher Columbus,

140
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.500
we are not honoring how he treated the Arawaks no one ever thought that we put

141
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.710
up a statute of Christopher Columbus because he was really sweet to the natives

142
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:48.820
on the other end of that. Right. That nobody's. So is the purpose.

143
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.510
<v 1>Of a statue, like when you have a Christopher Columbus statue, like,</v>

144
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:56.170
what is the purpose of that statue? We not, we all know who he is.

145
00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:57.160
We all know what he did.

146
00:06:57.161 --> 00:07:02.080
Why do we have an enormous bronze version of him in the middle of a park.

147
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.370
<v 0>Probably to say that Western civilization arriving here was a good thing, right?</v>

148
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.280
Or to have the conversation. I mean, that's, that's.

149
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.740
<v 1>It's a monument to a historical event. Right?</v>

150
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.040
<v 0>Right. Or listen, Columbia university is named after Columbus. Right?</v>

151
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.840
The idea of America as Columbia. Right.

152
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:19.540
Which was an alternative name for America was after Columbus.

153
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.130
Cause he was a discoverer. Well, that's a weird one.

154
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.220
<v 1>Uh we're we're named after America Vespucci who,</v>

155
00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:27.760
nobody knows who the that guy is. He's been lost in the time. He's totally.

156
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.090
<v 0>Right. But there is this idea that has settled in that. We,</v>

157
00:07:31.091 --> 00:07:34.540
and it's really of high irritation to me that we are now the only good people

158
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:37.870
who have ever lived. Everyone who came before us was just a horrible person.

159
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.680
And we are the only good humans who have ever like isn't the world lucky to have

160
00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:44.470
us. We're the only people who've ever lived where completely sinless.

161
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:47.590
And we can look from our perch at the top of mortality at everyone who came

162
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:51.220
before us and say that those people were all garbage compared to us. Now,

163
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.810
there were people who were garbage compared to us,

164
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.290
but I really don't think that Washington was among the people who you can say

165
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:57.490
was garbage compared to you. Like,

166
00:07:57.491 --> 00:08:01.030
I don't think that you living in 1770 are a better person than George

167
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:01.031
Washington.

168
00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:03.580
I think you stand the top of the legacy that George Washington helped built.
