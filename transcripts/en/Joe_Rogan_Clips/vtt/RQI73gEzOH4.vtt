00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 2>Gordon is</v>

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.640
undeniably the best pound for pound jujitsu player on earth,

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.280
not just the best, but pretty pretty.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.440
It's a pretty good statement to say that you're the best ever.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.000
And you're only 25. Yeah, that's crazy.

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.710
How the does that happen? Uh.

8
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.310
<v 1>So, uh, I'm gonna go ahead and give, give credit to John. I mean, uh,</v>

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.910
I think that without him, I maybe would've been successful. I would've been, uh,

10
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.150
I would've been, you know,

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.630
maybe the best in the world at some point in my career,

12
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.750
but I don't think that without John, uh, I would be where I am right now.

13
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.820
And I don't think that I would've in this good, uh, in, in this amount of time,

14
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.420
you know, I've only, I've been train 10 years. I've been competing com uh,

15
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:49.700
professionally for five years. And, uh, I think that, you know,

16
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.460
a big part of the reason why I am, where I am is cuz cuz of John's.

17
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.580
<v 0>Coaching. Yeah. And we're,</v>

18
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.420
we're talking about John Donaher for people who don't know who is a,

19
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.810
a literal genius and a mastermind in jujitsu and a true mad

20
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.090
scientist and watching him coach you guys is very fascinating because he's so

21
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:10.570
serious and stoic and Gordon, Ryan pass over the left leg, Gordon,

22
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.210
Ryan post, like the way he talks. Like it's really interesting.

23
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:16.570
He says your full name too. It's it's real. It's.

24
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.130
<v 1>Very interesting. Gordon Ryan, Gary to and Craig Jones. Yeah. It's always,</v>

25
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.330
it's always the full, the full name.

26
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.320
<v 0>Yeah. Why, what is he's that's an odd duck. He.</v>

27
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.600
<v 1>Does it to address us. Um,</v>

28
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:27.480
because a lot of times like you've got like Nikki for example,

29
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.560
like there's a lot of guys named Nick, so he makes sure he makes sure that,

30
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:33.880
you know, he is talking to you when he says Nikki Ryan, Nick, rod, Craig Jones,

31
00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:35.600
Gordon, Ryan. So you know that,

32
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.600
you know that when you hear your name being called your first and last name,

33
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:41.920
you know that, okay, this person is addressing you in a room of, you know, five,

34
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:42.754
10,000 people.

35
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.510
<v 0>He's such an unusual human being.</v>

36
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.030
There is not a single person on the planet earth like John Donna,

37
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.590
her one of the most brilliant guys I've ever met obsessed with jujitsu.

38
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.790
Mostly like that's, if you, you got a pie chart of his brain, it would be like,

39
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.630
he's like 20% room for other. 80% of his brain is jujitsu. Yeah.

40
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.300
<v 1>I mean, it's a not, it's not even just jujitsu,</v>

41
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:06.820
it's just martial arts in general. Mm. Like, I mean,

42
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.940
people who know John on a personal level and have trained with John know that

43
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:15.180
John knows just much just as much about MMA he does or even more about MMA than

44
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:16.740
he does about jujitsu. Um,

45
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.220
he's been coaching MMA with George and with Chris Wideman for longer than he's

46
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:22.540
been coaching jujitsu. I mean,

47
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.890
he's only been coaching professional jujitsu athletes for five years. Uh,

48
00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:31.050
and I've watched him personally teach judo privates to judo,

49
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:33.130
Olympians watch, uh, teach him, have him.

50
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.050
I watched him teach wrestling privates to wrestling world team members,

51
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:39.490
wrestling, Olympians. Um, you know, he knows a,

52
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.610
just as much about the other martial arts as he does about jujitsu. It's crazy.

53
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.680
<v 0>Yeah. And never walks around without a rash guard on which is, that's also.</v>

54
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.520
<v 1>Correct. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

55
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.880
<v 0>Which is the honest thing.</v>

56
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.400
<v 1>I I've seen him one time ever with a RA with a, with a t-shirt on, because uh,</v>

57
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.480
we went to long island to train with Chris, uh, Chris WMAN one time and uh,

58
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.000
he forgot his change of rash guards.

59
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.200
So he had his street rash guard on and he didn't have a second rash guard to

60
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.040
change into. And Chris didn't have a rash guard for him.

61
00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:09.880
So they gave him like this pink Flamingo t-shirt that he ended up,

62
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:12.560
we did a whole session with Chris Weiman it was right before he was gonna fight

63
00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:15.800
Luke Rockhold the second time, which ended up never happening. But, uh,

64
00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:19.350
we did this whole session with John with like this pink TRO gold t-shirt on.

65
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.630
And then he changed out the t-shirt to get back into a street rash guard and

66
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:25.990
leave to go home. Like it was just like, I'm just like, okay, this is happening.

67
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.150
I posted it. Everyone was freaking out about it.

68
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.190
<v 0>Is how crazy is it that he has a street rash guard? Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.270
<v 1>He's got his, he's got street rash guards. He's got, uh, training, rash guards.</v>

70
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:39.260
And he's got like his nighttime, like dinner date rash was like,

71
00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:41.540
he's got like a, like a date rash guard. He's got a dinner rash.

72
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.780
Like he's got it all. He's got it all sorted out.

73
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.820
<v 0>So if he goes out on a date with a woman, he wears a rash guard. Oh.</v>

74
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.740
<v 1>Yeah. He's got like, he's got like this really nice, like under arm,</v>

75
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.860
like this gray under arm or sweatshirt that he, or, um,

76
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.300
rash guard that he puts on. And like, you know,

77
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:57.140
like when John comes out in one of his fancy rash guards, you're like, okay,

78
00:03:57.141 --> 00:04:01.410
he's not around now. &lt;laugh&gt; like, this guy is like, he got, you're like,

79
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.850
all right, this guy means business tonight. &lt;laugh&gt; but you.

80
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.850
<v 0>Has anybody ever asked him what the is.</v>

81
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.810
<v 1>Going on? Yeah, I mean, so he just,</v>

82
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.050
he just likes to wear rash guards because of the fact that they dry fast. Um,

83
00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:14.530
the fact that they're cool, they keep you cool. They keep you warm.

84
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.930
They get wet. They dry fast. Um, and they're just tight fitting.

85
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.880
He likes tight fitting clothes. Um, so he just, he just prefers to wear them.

86
00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:24.360
He thinks they're more efficient than t-shirts are.

87
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.240
<v 0>It's just so odd. But that's part of John Doner always has a Fanny pack respect.</v>

88
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.800
I respect to Fanny pack. Yeah. I mean.

89
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.280
<v 1>One of the great mysteries of the world is what he has inside that Fanny pack.</v>

90
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.920
It's kind of thick. It is. He's a large Fanny.

91
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.320
He's got a lot of stuff inside there.

92
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.630
<v 0>He's uh, it's just,</v>

93
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.350
it's so fascinating to watch what he's done in coaching this Don,

94
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.550
her Des squad and create like he's unquestionably the greatest Jisu coach on

95
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:56.190
earth. And this is also widely regarded,

96
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:59.950
like the way you are widely regarded as the best pound for pound grappler.

97
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.380
He's widely regard the best jujitsu coach and it's it's um,

98
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.500
it's really interesting to see that you guys just have been

99
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:13.340
dominating the grappling scene and to watch all this play out and to see

100
00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:16.540
people study you guys, but still not be able to catch up.

101
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.883
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

102
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.650
what most people do is they just see like a general outline of what we do,

103
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:25.730
but no one, no one looks at what the specifics of what we're doing. They say,

104
00:05:25.731 --> 00:05:27.050
oh, you know, Gordon's a good Lu locker.

105
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.650
Let me try to do Lu locks or Gordon's trapping hands from the back.

106
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:32.930
Let me try to do that. But they don't see the very specific details.

107
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.050
And the specific details are,

108
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:37.050
what's gonna be the difference between finishing a high level guy and having a

109
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:38.530
high level guy escapee. Um,

110
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.440
so whatever does is they just see the general idea and have the general of what

111
00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:44.800
we're doing. And they try to just copy that. Uh,

112
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.760
but when you just try to copy the best guys,

113
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.600
if you just try to copy everyone else,

114
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:51.040
you get the same results as everybody else,

115
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.880
you have to go further than what the best guys are doing and you have to

116
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.400
innovate. And you know, I get,

117
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.800
I look at the other best guys in the world and I say, what are they doing?

118
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.120
You know, that works against the other high level guys.

119
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.400
And how can I make that better?

120
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.160
Not just let me try to arbitrarily copy what they're trying to do.

121
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.600
<v 0>Now. What is missing in, like,</v>

122
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.080
if you take the rest of the people that are in the top 10, like,

123
00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:11.440
what are they doing differently?

124
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.000
<v 1>What everyone does in jujitsu is they try to do the least amount of work</v>

125
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.390
possible to win a Juto match, right?

126
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.390
So they try to jump past your guard. They score in advantage,

127
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.910
they score a couple points. And then for the next seven minutes they do nothing.

128
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.430
Whereas what we try to do is we try to take the hardest route to a victory and

129
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.470
we try to submit the guy. So what do you see as a complete,

130
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.630
there's just a complete different minds, a,

131
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.700
a completely different mindset between what the rest of the guys are doing and

132
00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:41.940
what we're trying to do. We're trying to go out and we're not,

133
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.580
we're not satisfied unless we hit a submission. And in my case,

134
00:06:44.581 --> 00:06:47.180
sometimes they call the submission and I'm trying to, you know,

135
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.460
go out and hit a specific submission. Um, but you know,

136
00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:54.580
they're happy just going out and having a match with this 10 minutes in the

137
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:54.860
feet,

138
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.250
they just hang on each other's collar ties and then they win a rest and they run

139
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.690
around beating their chest. Like they just, they, they, they did something. Um,

140
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.570
so just the mindset and the mindset for winning in competition is completely

141
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:06.404
different.
