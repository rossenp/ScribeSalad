00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.240
<v 1>You know, there were a period of, uh, periods of time in, in our history where,</v>

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.360
um, people would steal our religious objects and our sacred items.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.560
They still do. Um, and Lud our graves. Um,

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.760
there there's an,

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.870
a law called the native American graves protect and repatriation act that

7
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.510
was meant to repatriate those stolen items and those stolen ancestors

8
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.790
back to tribes so that we could help with our cultural revitalization

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.550
as well as put our ancestors back to rest. Um, uh,

10
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.700
there are still at least 200 ancestors

11
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.140
in boxes in museums. Jesus, that's just in the us 200,000.

12
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.820
<v 2>In museums.</v>

13
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.820
<v 1>In the us, just in the us. So, um,</v>

14
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.820
our ancestors and our cultural items and religious OB objects have also been

15
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:59.460
taken all around the world. Uh.

16
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.100
<v 2>Imagine if it was French people,</v>

17
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.010
it was 200,000 French people in boxes in museums, in the us.

18
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.970
<v 1>And France is one of the, the worst. So there was just a case, uh, recently,</v>

19
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.890
um, uh, French loved to auction our sacred objects for some reason.

20
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.570
Um, there was a, uh,

21
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.280
a sacred shield of the Pueblo of Acima, um,

22
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.120
in about 2016, that was, uh, being sold at auction in,

23
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.040
in France. And, uh, the, the tribe,

24
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.440
the Pueblo fought and even went to court in France to try to, uh,

25
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.550
stop that auction and get that item back because there was evidence that it had

26
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:49.150
been stolen in contemporary times. Um, and, uh,

27
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.670
uh, France said you don't have standing, um, in our courts.

28
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.150
Um, so even though Theyre considered sovereign or a pseudo sovereign nation

29
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.540
here in the United States, we didn't have standing in,

30
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.220
in the French court and couldn't protect that item this way. So, um,

31
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.820
we had to use other means of negotiation and arm twisting.

32
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.060
Um, that item has finally been repatriated, but it took,

33
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.980
it took about four years to, for that to.

34
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.860
<v 2>Happen. So it's finally been brought back.</v>

35
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.810
<v 1>Yeah. It's but that's, that's just one case. This happens. Where is it now? Um,</v>

36
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.250
it's back, it's back home at the AIMA Pueblo.

37
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.490
<v 2>And did, did they happen it on display.</v>

38
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.410
<v 1>Or is it, no, this is a sacred object. These, it can't be on display, right?</v>

39
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.610
The, these are items that are used for religious purposes. They're, they're,

40
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.800
they're protected, sacred items. Um, uh,

41
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.880
the association, we were fighting with the metropolitan museum of art, uh,

42
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.480
last year and the year before, because they were displaying, um,

43
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.080
items from a private collection that were sacred. Um,

44
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.800
one item was even a funeralry object was an item that, um,

45
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.480
is never supposed to be seen because it's buried with the ancestor.

46
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.440
Um, and it was on display, uh,

47
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.400
and without any kind of consultation with the tribes affected, uh,

48
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.030
it it's horrendous the way we still look at Indian

49
00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:27.950
people and, um, and our cultures and our practices today.

50
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.070
Uh, we're still being called hens. There was an article, um, uh, uh,

51
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.110
I think just last week there was a, a,

52
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.420
a religious man saying that we're hens because we &lt;affirmative&gt;, we, um,

53
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.380
the Sage that I gave you because we burned Sage, um,

54
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.740
as one of our, uh, medicinal and, and spiritual practices.

55
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.780
<v 2>That was the reason why they were calling you hens.</v>

56
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.340
<v 1>Yeah. And this was just in an article last week from a, um,</v>

57
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.340
from a Christian group. Oh, well, yeah.

58
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.330
<v 2>Well, I a Hehn too to them. We're all hens.</v>

59
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.810
<v 1>Yes. What's interesting. In these states like Indiana and Ohio, um,</v>

60
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.530
where indigenous peoples have just been, um, uh, uh,

61
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.210
removed wholeheartedly is that tons of archeologists

62
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.050
and other, um, uh, people that like to loot, um,

63
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.080
they have taken so many things out of the ground. Um, there was a,

64
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.400
uh, case that the FBI actually got a hold of in Indiana,

65
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.360
uh, gentleman by the name of Don Miller who had a huge

66
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.440
ranch house and farm.

67
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.510
And it was just full of native America can artifacts,

68
00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:45.910
including human remains. And there were even, um, uh, uh,

69
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:49.710
items from other countries that he had had looed and taken.

70
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.310
And the FBI actually investigated that. And, and, um,

71
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.030
because the man was like 90 years old, they didn't prosecute him,

72
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:02.740
but they were able to, um, uh, take back those items.

73
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.860
And through that N native American graves protection and repatriation act,

74
00:05:06.861 --> 00:05:10.540
they've been consulting with tribes to repatriate those items back,

75
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.060
but that looting and collecting in, in areas like Indiana and Ohio and other.

76
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.820
<v 2>Jimmyme actually has it up on the screen here. Oh yeah.</v>

77
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.420
Fbions 2000 human bones among antiquty sees from man's.

78
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.210
So where did this gentleman get all this stuff? Um,

79
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.570
his collection was native American, including the bone,

80
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.370
Tim carpenter of the FBI told media outlets. Yeah. There,

81
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.090
the half it report Miller reportedly admitted he'd conducted illegal digging

82
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:38.770
expeditions, but he never faced criminal charges before his death in 2015.

83
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.350
Right.

84
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.960
So this guy was just digging stuff up and just showing a around his house mm-hmm

85
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.400
&lt;affirmative&gt; and there, there were rules against this.

86
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.720
<v 1>Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.</v>

87
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.320
<v 2>And if so, if, if it's on land that say, if he own, like,</v>

88
00:05:51.321 --> 00:05:54.440
what if he owns a ranch? How does that work? Like if.

89
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.320
<v 1>You're so it's, it's dependent and a lot of the things that, that he had,</v>

90
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.960
it wasn't clear where he had got it from, he didn't even know or remember,

91
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.640
or keep any records of where he, he got a lot of the items. Um,

92
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.720
uh, so our laws are really screwy with this too.

93
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.440
So federal and tribal lands are protected.

94
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.360
So public lands parks, uh,

95
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.190
and tribal lands are protected lands. You can't go and dig in,

96
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.190
in federal or tribal lands without a permit, um, among other things.

97
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.670
Uh, but, uh, just in state, private, private lands, um,

98
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.710
it's really dependent on what the state laws are. And, and it's,

99
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.940
it's really inconsistent whether those, um,

100
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.940
whether looting is protected or not. Hmm.

101
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.153
<v 2>And</v>

102
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.300
so that's where it's interesting because there's a lot of gigantic ranches in

103
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:51.580
Texas that are privately owned that were originally native American hunting

104
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.180
grounds. They've there's ones that, uh,

105
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.890
a friend of mine is hunted on that they have these pic graphs.

106
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:00.450
You go inside these caves mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, and this is on private land.

107
00:07:00.451 --> 00:07:04.170
Someone owns this, you go inside these caves and these ancient artwork, mm-hmm,

108
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.490
&lt;affirmative&gt; all over the walls of the cave. Um, and signs of fire, like,

109
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.890
you know, sit on the ceiling of the cave, where they lit camp fires.

110
00:07:11.891 --> 00:07:15.290
Like this should probably be some sort of a historical site.

111
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.840
<v 1>Right. And it's, it's usually ly not protected. And, and, um,</v>

112
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.600
people get real angry when, um,

113
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.520
Indians try to get involved in, in, uh,

114
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.000
where there may be developments, um,

115
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.320
that ha will have an effect on, uh, burial side,

116
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.480
a sacred side or other, other type of site, um, uh, people really get angry,

117
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.670
angry. Mm. Um, and it, it, so it's really hard for tribes to,

118
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.670
um, work, to protect these areas, work,

119
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.430
to learn about what the areas are even about. There's been so much, um,

120
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.390
amateur archeology, um,

121
00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.340
and this whole country was founded on amateur archeology. Let's dig up. Well,

122
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.420
look at what we found in this grave. You know, everyone was looking for,

123
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.700
for gold and other special things.

124
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.300
And oftentimes they just took whatever was in the grave and, and, and created,

125
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.540
um, the antiquties art market, uh, which still is,

126
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.100
is all over the world today. So, uh,

127
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.490
the is constantly looking at,

128
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.490
at auctions and trying to return items that,

129
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.170
that private collectors have obtained. Improperly. We just got a,

130
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.850
a human vertebra removed from a, a us auction, uh,

131
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.890
just a couple of weeks ago. Um, Jesus, they were selling it because, uh,

132
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.680
they said, um, it had an arrow, uh, point still in,

133
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.120
uh, you know, so that, that has, uh, value in, in, in some markets.

134
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.633
Um, and this.

135
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.320
<v 2>They had done DNA on this to prove that it was.</v>

136
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.960
<v 1>No, it was, they were selling.</v>

137
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.880
<v 2>It as a, a native American vertebra. It was from a, a collector in, in,</v>

138
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.640
in Massachusetts. Well, how, how could they prove that it wasn't just a,

139
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.240
a settler that was killed by an.

140
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.520
<v 1>Arrow. Right. Um, I don't know. And that's the thing about,</v>

141
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.520
that's the thing about, um, trying to work with auctions and private collectors?

142
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.750
Is they off then don't wanna work with us of course,

143
00:09:16.751 --> 00:09:21.550
because they're trying to make money. Um, so oftentimes, um, items,

144
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:25.670
whether they're, um, religious objects or human remains, um,

145
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.710
they have a story or what's called a provenance associated with them that is

146
00:09:30.711 --> 00:09:33.990
often made up to drive the price of the items.

147
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.140
So whether that it was a legitimate, a vertebra of native American,

148
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.940
we don't know cuz we can't get that collector to talk to.

149
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.660
<v 2>Us. So the collector's under no obligation by law to talk to you.</v>

150
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.380
<v 1>No, that's why we try to send the FBI and our friend Tim carpenter would, um,</v>

151
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.440
to them.

152
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.860
<v 2>So how would they determine, I mean, wouldn't,</v>

153
00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:58.970
they have to do it DNA analysis of the bones and try to figure out where,

154
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.730
who the person was.

155
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.110
<v 1>Uh, well,</v>

156
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:06.970
the DNA analysis isn't necessarily gonna tell you where it came

157
00:10:06.971 --> 00:10:09.930
from. It could tell you that it was native American. Would.

158
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.250
<v 2>They even be able to get that out of bones?</v>

159
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.610
<v 1>I don't know. I know, and I'm not a scientist, but you know, there was a,</v>

160
00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:20.480
there was case, um, uh, really not that long ago, um,

161
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.480
called the Kennewick man case. I don't know if maybe you heard of it. Um,

162
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.080
but it was a, um, an ancestor was uncovered in,

163
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.760
in the state of Washington. Uh, and he was old, old, old, old,

164
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.310
and, uh, the university's involved, uh, in the army Corps who, who,

165
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.910
um, had a possession of it, uh,

166
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.150
were gonna repatriate it to appropriate tribes.

167
00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:50.110
And what ended up happening is is that, you know, academia stepped up and said,

168
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.350
Hey, wait, this isn't native American. We think he's something else. Um,

169
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:59.420
and for years native Americans fought to get that ancestor,

170
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.740
the ancient one, uh, back. And finally, um,

171
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.820
after a court case, uh,

172
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.340
that deemed the item wasn't that the ancestor wasn't native American,

173
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.220
um, uh, DNA test was done. And it,

174
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.130
it was indeed native American and the ancestor was finally

175
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.370
repatriated. Um, uh.

176
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.930
<v 2>Can I ask you how that works? Yeah. So listen,</v>

177
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.210
there's you said there's 500 recognized tribes,

178
00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:32.290
many more that are unrecognized mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; who, who would that go.

179
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.530
<v 1>To? Right. So, um.</v>

180
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.920
<v 2>Like say if you won and it's brought back and given to native Americans</v>

181
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.720
to who and to where.

182
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.720
<v 1>Right. So, so, so, um, let's look at the best case scenario. And in,</v>

183
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.000
in, uh, a lot of museums have maintained records, um,

184
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.560
that may have human remains and associated funeralry objects and have enough

185
00:11:55.590 --> 00:12:00.080
information to know where that came from, what side it was, uh,

186
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:05.080
located at, what county, what state, um, and we know, um,

187
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.760
from tribal histories, as well as, as federal, uh, us, uh,

188
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.790
documentation that, that, that area was likely affiliated with, with,

189
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.070
you know, this tribe or that tribe, or maybe, uh, several tribes.

190
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.550
And so consultation occurs under that law, um,

191
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.990
about those ancestral remains in funeral area objects, and it's determined, um,

192
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.990
where those items should go back. Um,

193
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.780
in the case scenario where there's not any information,

194
00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.060
um, uh, oftentimes evidence of, of well,

195
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.060
who were the collectors that were giving to that institution, um,

196
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:49.540
what has been the history of the institution and where has it obtained different

197
00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:53.260
collections? And through that, uh, you know, uh,

198
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.650
it's deduced, um, who may be affiliated with, uh, with those,

199
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.530
those items or the, the ancestors. So it can be a pretty long drawn out process.

200
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.290
Um, but what's interesting about it is, is,

201
00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:13.210
is museums and other institutions fought this law for a long time. Um,

202
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.680
uh, they said, well, you know, all of our collections will, you know,

203
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:19.960
we won't be able to fulfill our purposes, a,

204
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.640
a museum or an academic institution to study these things. It's like, well,

205
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:29.640
hell you haven't studied it in a hundred years. Um, they haven't. Yeah, no,

206
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.000
most, most of these, uh, when,

207
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.310
when people work to consult with museums,

208
00:13:35.311 --> 00:13:39.310
most of these items are in boxes and often, um,

209
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.310
poorly managed and maintained.

210
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.070
<v 2>So they're just sitting somewhere in storage. Right, right.</v>

211
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:49.110
So the museum owns it and they're kind of hoarding it. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.

212
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.030
Yeah. So this Canwick man, can you, um, pull up some information about that?

213
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.590
Great story about it right now? Um.

214
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.660
<v 1>&lt;Affirmative&gt; yeah. Great. Because I'm forgetting my dates.</v>

215
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.180
<v 2>When that happens. Yeah. I'm very curious what the dates would be now. Um,</v>

216
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.540
when we're talking about native Americans, um, do you, uh,

217
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:10.620
agree with the idea? Okay. Let's see here, Kennewick man finally is free.

218
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.780
<v 1>Oh, they did so much study on it.</v>

219
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.370
<v 2>Skeleton ever found in north America 90 he's a handsome fellow.</v>

220
00:14:17.371 --> 00:14:19.610
Let me see that picture &lt;laugh&gt; looks normal.

221
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.050
Imagine he just ran into that guy at seven 11. Like what's up bro. Looks like a,

222
00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:28.970
he's like, Hey, a modern American, a modern human say, um,

223
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.970
that's the bones, various bones. Oh, wow. His rib bones. So what is,

224
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.570
does it give, give us a date on his, uh,

225
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:41.400
what they have car go to that picture of the teeth again? That's crazy.

226
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.360
<v 1>So, so just let me tell you that, um,</v>

227
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:49.320
looking at human remains for many, um, uh, tribal peoples is,

228
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.200
is difficult. It's like looking at, um, a naked body. I mean, it's,

229
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.880
it's, um, the essence of someone that, um, you know,

230
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.360
we shouldn't be seeing, oh.

231
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.360
<v 2>So you shouldn't be seeing even these images that.</v>

232
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.440
<v 1>That should have been in the ground that should've gone and disappeared.</v>

233
00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:12.270
It had a journey, it got interrupted and, and, um, you know,

234
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:17.710
it, some tribes and cultures believe that that's harmful to interact,

235
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.510
um, or, or look at, um,

236
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:26.510
or just a little bit humiliating it's exposed. Right.

237
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.910
It, it, so, um.

238
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.340
<v 2>So seeing them on display and mean is particularlyfensiveve.</v>

239
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:37.300
<v 1>Oh God. Yeah. And, and, and I, and at least in the United States,</v>

240
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.660
you won't find that in any kind of public museum,

241
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.420
now you might in some kind of private institution or private collection, um.

242
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:50.140
<v 2>What you do with mummies, right? You, you, but with native American people,</v>

243
00:15:50.141 --> 00:15:53.410
they've decided that that's a fence to the culture. So they've removed it.

244
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:54.090
Is that what you're saying? Well.

245
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.290
<v 1>That's also happening, uh, you're finding another, uh,</v>

246
00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.810
in other countries who, uh, in Egypt, for example, and,

247
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.330
and in other cultures that, um, they're trying to get those,

248
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.770
um, back too. Imagine.

249
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.640
<v 2>If there's a museum where you can go and look at Ronald Ray Reagan's head.</v>

250
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.040
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; right. Some people would probably enjoy that for, for sure. I'd go.</v>

251
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.480
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt;. But, but it is one of those things where it's like, oh, okay,</v>

252
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.760
I gotta get it. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right.

253
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.560
So if you have the bones of sitting bowl on display in some sort of a,

254
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.600
you know, Plexiglas case in museum and people are like, oh, wow, that's cool.

255
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.830
Okay. Would that be cool if that was Ronald Reagan, you know,

256
00:16:35.831 --> 00:16:38.350
would that be cool? If that was someone from our, you know,

257
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.430
our lifetime mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that died with had Janice Joplin's head,

258
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.670
you know, in a box somewhere and you can go stare at it. Wouldn't that weird?

259
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.310
You out? Yes. Or how about Amy? Whouse how about someone who, who died? Yeah.

260
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.510
See what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:16:49.511 --> 00:16:51.790
Someone who died really recently&lt;affirmative&gt; it'd be like,

262
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.620
what are you doing well? And that's, maybe we need to look at it that.

263
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.381
<v 1>Way. Yeah. Well,</v>

264
00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:59.380
and that's the thing is that we don't seem to look at native people in that way.

265
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.900
Right. We don't seem to, to, to go, oh, that's not okay. Oh,

266
00:17:02.901 --> 00:17:04.540
it's not okay to outlaw their religion.

267
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.940
How would I feel if someone did that to me? Right, right. It it's,

268
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.140
it's a double standard, or I don't know what you call it, but it's just racism.

269
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.490
<v 2>Yeah. In a way. Yeah. Racism's the right word.</v>
