00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.960
<v 1>I guess I'm talking about it. I'm not supposed to, but we're looking at, um, uh,</v>

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.520
military government organizations that are typically in the shadows, right?

4
00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.240
We're not releasing any sources and methods.

5
00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:16.120
We're not disclosing in classified secrets,

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.040
but we're talking about elements and units, operational activity, um,

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.030
that, uh,

8
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.830
before now I've pretty much been in the shadows and some incredible people.

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.470
That's one of the best parts about this thing.

10
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:29.830
It's been going out there and meeting some of these guys that are doing some of

11
00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:33.270
this high speed. And it's, it's pretty amazing. And.

12
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.030
<v 0>When, when they do release things like long, long after,</v>

13
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:41.220
like I was reading something, uh, I forget what the case was out,

14
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:42.660
but it was something about how the,

15
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.220
the files won't be released under the freedom of information act until 2080.

16
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.820
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; how do you, yeah, I know. What do they,

17
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.100
how do they make that dis like,

18
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.660
that was the thing with the Kennedy assassination, right? And.

19
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.340
<v 1>Sometimes they roll it over and it's not even then. Right.</v>

20
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.380
So sometimes they extend that, um, other times they don't, and,

21
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.370
and so's some information comes to light periodically. Um,

22
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.570
and so this does look at the, this, this show will be looking at some historic,

23
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.250
but a lot of current things that are going on and, and where the money goes,

24
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:11.491
right?

25
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:13.970
What are we spending our money on when it comes to this high speed operations

26
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:17.570
that the special forces and others are, are involved in? Um, so it'll be,

27
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:21.970
it'll be very good. I was, I was lucky to be able to work with, again, you know,

28
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.800
know some really great people on the production side,

29
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.680
but just also going out there and meeting some of these cats. They're just the,

30
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.680
the, the that they do is, is, is even after being around a while, as I have,

31
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.840
um, it just amazes me, well, it's.

32
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.400
<v 0>Gotta be constantly accelerating too. Right. There's,</v>

33
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:42.000
they're constantly coming up with new and spectacular things that nobody knows

34
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.590
about yeah. Until they employ them.

35
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.470
<v 1>Right. Exactly. And sometimes that, that, that stays on the shelf. Right.</v>

36
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:49.790
You know, you, it was like the, the running joke at the agency at the,

37
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.310
at the CIA was, you know, we have a fantastic S and T group,

38
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.350
a science and technology group, and they're the ones responsible like Q uh,

39
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:57.590
from, from bond, right. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

40
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:00.590
they're the ones responsible for developing all the gear, uh,

41
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:04.580
responding to specific operational, how are we gonna do this particular thing?

42
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:07.420
Well, let's develop a piece of kit. That's gonna allow us to do it. Um,

43
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:09.620
but the running joke is always that, you know,

44
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.740
they'll develop it and they'll show it to you before an operation,

45
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.900
but then they'll put it back on the shelf,

46
00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:15.460
cuz they don't want that getting out there. Right.

47
00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:18.580
And people finding out that they've got it. So they'll give you like a, a, a,

48
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.540
a 20 year old piece of kit to use instead.

49
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.130
And you'll be walking around with like a phone, the size of a brick, um,

50
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.850
knowing that they've got something high speed on the shelf. Well.

51
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.130
<v 0>That's what everybody always thinks.</v>

52
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:32.090
Like when you talk to the average Joe on the street about technology and the

53
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:33.290
government, that was like, dude,

54
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.850
the stuff they have that they probably don't tell us about how much of that is

55
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:37.684
real. Yeah.

56
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.090
<v 1>Um, it's, it's pretty real. Have you.</v>

57
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.760
<v 0>Seen some stuff that made you go, holy. Yes. They can that, yes.</v>

58
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.480
Really? Yeah. And how much can you tell us? Um.

59
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.360
<v 1>Well, you know what, one thing that they're doing and, and there's, I,</v>

60
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:54.160
this is actually something I wanted to talk about, uh, today, uh,

61
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.000
because it's gonna affect everybody. It's not just, it's something that,

62
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.120
that is gonna affect people in the military or else in the intelligence

63
00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:01.240
community. Uh,

64
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:04.600
but one of the things that they've been working on is imagine you've gotta,

65
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.920
you gotta rock up on a, on a target and you're, but you're, before you do that,

66
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.880
before you, you get the customers on site and you're gonna, you know,

67
00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:16.000
hopefully obtain some high value, uh, targets there at that location before you.

68
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.990
<v 0>Do it, you're talking like euphemisms. Oh, I'm sorry. Before you.</v>

69
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.270
<v 1>Gonna milk people. Yeah. Before, before you get, go in blow terrorists.</v>

70
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.750
<v 0>Into another.</v>

71
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.230
<v 1>Dimension. Well, sometimes, you know, you okay. Actually I was gonna say,</v>

72
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:28.350
sometimes you want to actually capture them and get their intelligence.

73
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.510
We've gone past that. Right.

74
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:33.590
Because the years where we were getting our kicked for holding on to people in

75
00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:36.230
detention facilities, um, you know, what that did that,

76
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.740
that pretty much convinced everybody, uh, that was involved than this to just,

77
00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:42.460
just whack 'em right? Because then you don't have to deal with the aftermath.

78
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:43.300
You don't have to worry about,

79
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.740
are you gonna get in trouble for interrogating somebody? Right. Exactly.

80
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.820
So that actually increasingly ality of operations,

81
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:52.540
you started painting targets and just blowing the out of there rather than

82
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:54.940
trying to grab the target and get their Intel.

83
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.060
That's a problem because in the pipeline dries up for the Intel. But, uh,

84
00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:01.130
anyway, imagine you got this, you got this site,

85
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.970
the first thing you gotta do is determine if your Target's there, right.

86
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.970
And it's not like that, you know, the Tom Clancy movies where, you know,

87
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:09.930
you're looking through walls and all this, it's it, you know, that,

88
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:12.210
that technology night vision devices and, and,

89
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.810
and that ability and low light conditions to, uh,

90
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.480
to monitor and to identify specific, uh, individuals, um,

91
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.640
has always been a problem.

92
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.520
They've made great strides on it to the point now where in no light conditions,

93
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.560
right. With the, with the right stack database,

94
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:33.280
with the right information and that database meaning the right, uh, amount of,

95
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:35.280
of information about individuals, right? You just,

96
00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:39.760
you constantly populating this database with new faces or with new photographs

97
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:43.350
of individuals that you're going after. Um, with enough of that,

98
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:44.184
to sift through,

99
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.190
they're getting to the point now with no light conditions that they can, uh,

100
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.510
identify, uh,

101
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.710
positively the targets in that room or the targets in that facility or in that

102
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.750
building, whatever it might be. And that's incredible.

103
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.470
<v 0>I'd rather they can identify people by their heart rate. Hmm.</v>

104
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.500
<v 1>With, with, well, not just their heart rate, but I mean, other other bio data,</v>

105
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:05.580
right. I mean, are there other.

106
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.260
<v 0>But they can literally with video somehow or another,</v>

107
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.340
they can zoom in on you with some scanner and

108
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.380
recognize that this is a particular individual because their heart rate. Yeah.

109
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:18.780
This is, there was an article that was written about it.

110
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.210
And I know that there's a company. Do you know what hex is?

111
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.090
H E C S it's um, it's a company that's been used, uh,

112
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.490
pretty extensively by, uh, scuba diving community. Um,

113
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.410
and now, uh, by the hunting community as well,

114
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.570
because it blocks the electrical signal,

115
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.890
H E C S it blocks the electrical signal that your body gives off. Okay.

116
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.040
<v 1>Yeah. That makes.</v>

117
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.280
<v 0>Sense. And I think they're doing work with the military as well,</v>

118
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.240
to develop suits that will somehow stop someone from being able to

119
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.520
recognize your particular heart.

120
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.640
<v 1>Rate. Right. And it does a lot of work on,</v>

121
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.800
on what they call the sort of the universal soldier. Yeah.

122
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.880
<v 0>There Pentagon as a laser that I identify people from a distance by the,</v>

123
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.520
by heartbeat.

124
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.040
<v 1>Yeah. It helps laser. It helps if you have other, uh, data points. Right.</v>

125
00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:09.360
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; if you, but, um, this is all part of to some degree what,

126
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.640
you know, they refer to as the universal soldier, right. The, the,

127
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.080
the fighter of tomorrow and.

128
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.990
<v 0>John Klon van dam. Yeah. You, you.</v>

129
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.230
<v 1>Got. That's right. Yeah. I who doesn't remember Sean, although he's doing,</v>

130
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.710
he's doing like chip commercials now, is he, um, sure.

131
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.630
You haven't seen him at theirs or whatever, dude. It.

132
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.470
<v 0>Is the splits.</v>

133
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.710
<v 1>Yeah. Um, well props. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;,</v>

134
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.310
I don't know when that becomes useful though. Really the splits. I mean,

135
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.790
I've never actually, you know,

136
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.780
felt that that was something I needed to accomplish in any given moment from an

137
00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:40.110
operational.

138
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.580
<v 0>She's doing karate movies where you have to do the sports. Yeah. Its true.</v>

139
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:42.900
It's very.

140
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.060
<v 1>Important. It's true. But so the, the universal soldier thing where you, you,</v>

141
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.260
you, your, um, you know, it's an exoskeleton,

142
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.140
it's a soft suit. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's all the data that you can acquire,

143
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.260
um, for that war fighter.

144
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.130
How do create the perfect environment on that individual,

145
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.890
as he's moving through an environment to, to, you know, be a more efficient,

146
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:07.690
effective, lethal, uh, fighter and you know, things like that,

147
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.210
identifying target, whether it's with a laser, uh,

148
00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:13.290
whether it's with low light or no light conditions where you can,

149
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.970
as you're rocking up on the target, you can do that. All these things, you know,

150
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.080
uh, the ability to, uh, to carry more gear, right. Uh, hump it, another extra,

151
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.240
you know, 10 kilometers, whatever it might be. Um, it's,

152
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.120
it's pretty incredible what they're doing and it's, it's a joint.

153
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.960
It's not just the military they're working with, uh, you know,

154
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.040
companies like hex or they're working with, uh, with the commercial sector, um,

155
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.790
and academics too. But anyway, I of disappearing down a rabbit hole,

156
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.890
uh.

157
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.830
<v 0>The, these like the, the idea of like this universal soldier thing,</v>

158
00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:46.630
have you been paying attention to this Elon Musk, uh,

159
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.030
Neurolink thing that he's coming out with yeah.

160
00:07:49.031 --> 00:07:53.310
Where they're gonna somehow or another insert fibers into your brain and then

161
00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:55.950
have a Bluetooth enabled device that you wear.

162
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:01.020
That's gonna allow you to somehow other interface with data at

163
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.260
a much higher bandwidth. I don't know what the any of those words mean.

164
00:08:04.261 --> 00:08:05.420
I just said, but that was good.

165
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.300
<v 1>Though. It was good. It sounded like you, you understood it. That's my trick.</v>

166
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.020
&lt;laugh&gt; so repeat words. Yeah. I, you know, there, there comes a point. Um,

167
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.980
if you're talking about, I mean, that's, that's going into a different area,

168
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:19.340
that's going into civilian applications and.

169
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.570
<v 0>But I see the military application would be great for that too.</v>

170
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.170
Everyone could synchronize data. You could give them navigation in their head.

171
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.330
Like if there's some sort of augmented reality where you could literally see the

172
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:33.130
targets in front of you, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; like they, if you had a map,

173
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.850
say like the, if the Pentagon really does have this laser beam,

174
00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:38.570
they could identify specific individuals mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you have a map

175
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:43.000
of a building that's in your head and they can identify the very

176
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.040
location, the absolute perfect location of each individual person in that room.

177
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:48.481
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

178
00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:51.440
And you could see that as you are running into this building,

179
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.040
you're seeing like a 3d grid in front of you. And, you know, I mean, you could,

180
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.760
could shoot 'em right through.

181
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.800
<v 1>A wall. Right. And there's, but there's, there, there does become a problem.</v>

182
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.400
Then there becomes a problem of, of information overload.

183
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.800
And when you get into that situation, right.

184
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:07.400
Everything starts to close down a little bit. Right. And, and sure.

185
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.400
And so you've gotta start pushing some of that away. And, and,

186
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.080
and now what you end up doing is you get the offsite, you know,

187
00:09:14.081 --> 00:09:17.870
coming and center, uh, relaying some of that information as needed.

188
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.750
But that guy that's about to, to breach that door, you know,

189
00:09:20.751 --> 00:09:23.990
he doesn't want right. A lot of data points anymore. Now having said that,

190
00:09:23.991 --> 00:09:25.190
knowing where, you know,

191
00:09:25.191 --> 00:09:27.030
knowing where the hostiles are on the other side of that door,

192
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:30.230
that is key information. That's not rocket science, but so there, there,

193
00:09:30.231 --> 00:09:31.390
but there's a lot that's going on.

194
00:09:31.391 --> 00:09:34.390
There's also the ability to monitor health of the individual, you know,

195
00:09:34.391 --> 00:09:36.660
soldiers, there are out there, uh, through the, the,

196
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.660
the gear that they would then be wearing. Um, it's, it's an, it's an incredible,

197
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.140
uh, effort that has been going on. And, and so to answer your point,

198
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.780
a long rambling answer, uh, yeah. I've seen some things that are pretty amazing.

199
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.740
You can't talk about though. No, no. Some of this, uh, some of this, uh,

200
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.340
actually will, will get into with the new show that's coming up sometime in,

201
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.250
I don't have a real estate. And again, I'm prescribed from talking about,

202
00:09:58.251 --> 00:10:00.690
so I won't do that because, so some of the, I pay attention.

203
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.370
<v 0>Some of the things that you saw you'll be able to talk about. Yes.</v>

204
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.130
So how does the government do that? They just decide, well, listen,

205
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.290
it's not a bad thing. If you tell people about this.

206
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.490
<v 1>That's yeah. I mean, well, I think there's, there's an element of some of,</v>

207
00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:18.400
it's not what you would refer to as it's just not readily available public

208
00:10:18.401 --> 00:10:22.000
information and it's not out there in the domain because people aren't aware of

209
00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:25.040
it or searching for it. Um, some of it does, I think you're right.

210
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.640
Some of it is look, the military wants to say at times,

211
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.520
look what we're able to do. We're doing this.

212
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.280
And oftentimes it's because it's in a, sort of a, uh, private, public, uh,

213
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.070
cooperation. And so that encourages other, uh,

214
00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:43.230
companies with innovative technologies to step forward and, and get involved in,

215
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:46.830
in some of this. Um, and I guess that opens up all sorts of other, you know,

216
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:47.830
some people are out there saying, well,

217
00:10:47.831 --> 00:10:50.030
they shouldn't be working with the military. Well, you know, that.
