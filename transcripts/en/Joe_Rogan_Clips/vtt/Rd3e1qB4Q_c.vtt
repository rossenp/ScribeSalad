00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 1>Experience. What about, uh, psychology? Do you have, uh,</v>

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.640
a mental trainer or anybody who's like a sports psychologist?

4
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.720
<v 0>Well, that's the, the fun thing I started off with, um,</v>

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.920
the guy I was telling you about, of, of your Lima he's, uh,

6
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.800
also kickboxing world champion in different different weight divisions.

7
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.150
I was training with him and he took me with his training,

8
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.670
took me to his training and I was working with him in his prime.

9
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.710
And without him knowing he was teaching me so much about

10
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:37.950
mental training, because he,

11
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.220
I was training with him and he was never giving up and the moment,

12
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.460
and I just showed something like he gave even extra,

13
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.740
even more gas. So when you.

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.740
<v 1>Started slowing down yeah.</v>

15
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.020
<v 0>And he was even pushing the pace even more.</v>

16
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.660
And that's what I was seeing in his fights. And I was just studying him.

17
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.660
And from that,

18
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.570
I learned so much and I respected him still so much so thankful for that. So,

19
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:07.730
and he's still my, my mental coach with that. So he's in my corner.

20
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.490
And every time when he says something, I just think about,

21
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.370
I don't want to disappoint this man,

22
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:15.890
because he knows what's how important this is.

23
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.290
And I think from the start last year or something,

24
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.400
I was really like little bit skeptical about

25
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.240
talking to people like, like a psychologist or something. I was like,

26
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.840
I don't know, talk about personal stuff. You know,

27
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:37.960
that's pretty deep with somebody you don't know is, I don't know.

28
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.750
Does maybe in my mind just doesn't add up, you know, it doesn't feel good. It,

29
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.110
uh, but still, uh, I got in this situation that I had to, or yeah,

30
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.270
I just, I just had to, and I went there and it actually felt pretty good.

31
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.350
&lt;laugh&gt; so from that moment on, just kept on doing it. Just talk about,

32
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.950
just talk about stuff, you know, it's just, you like,

33
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.500
like no other know what,

34
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.020
how many things happen of what, everything that happens in your life.

35
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.860
And you just gotta process all that stuff.

36
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.820
But sometimes you just so many things happen in your life that you just can't

37
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:18.100
process and you put 'em.

38
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.740
<v 1>Away and you talk about it and they're with you in the back of your head.</v>

39
00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:21.410
Exactly.

40
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.570
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. And then when you just have the time and,</v>

41
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.530
or take the time to talk about that stuff, you just,

42
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.170
it just feels a lot better. It feels like a, like a bag of, of bricks on your,

43
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.890
on your back. You just fall, fall off. Yeah. It feels good. So.

44
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.530
<v 1>I think of it the same way you were talking about physical therapy that like,</v>

45
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.010
if you have little injuries, nagging injuries, you get a,

46
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.400
it massaged out and everything loosens up. I think of it the same way.

47
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.760
If you're not taking a good account of what's going on in your mind,

48
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.880
you can develop like little mental injuries. Yeah, exactly.

49
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.560
<v 0>But for me, and maybe a lot of people had maybe not nowadays,</v>

50
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.120
but like from back in the days people still had like,

51
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.480
when you're talking through a psychology, you crazy, you're.

52
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.680
<v 1>Not right. Right, right.</v>

53
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.360
<v 0>Yeah. That's what, that's how people in Holland, like yeah.</v>

54
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.880
<v 1>Approached it well for here for a long time here for fighters,</v>

55
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:19.550
it was the same thing. Like most fighters didn't need eat a psychologist.

56
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.590
That's not for winners. Winners know how to win. You just don't be a.

57
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.350
You go out there and fight. Yeah. But that's nonsense.

58
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.670
Like you there's no in professional fighting. No. You know,

59
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.030
but there is edge. You can get an edge, you can get an advantage,

60
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.910
whether you get that advantage from getting massage or cryotherapy or,

61
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.660
or from a sports psychologist there's advantages to be had. Yeah.

62
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.420
<v 0>So, but I think that's what my, uh,</v>

63
00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:48.220
what I got from my dad is just being tough,

64
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.780
being tough and being hard on yourself. Mm. In whatever situation you are in,

65
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.300
just be tough on yourself. And just because that's what he was,

66
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.490
he was tough on his self. I, and so that's what I got from him.

67
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.850
And, but now I just think like, okay,

68
00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:08.810
just do tweak everything up and just get mentally imbalance.

69
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:13.210
And especially when he passed away, like almost two years ago, it's just,

70
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.170
yeah, it was tough. Was tough. Especially when the,

71
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.280
the relationship we had wasn't like was on and off on and

72
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:25.880
off. And when it was on, it was like a lot of discussion and it just just hurts.

73
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.480
And then things happen in your life.

74
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.840
And you just try to process everything and give it a,

75
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.360
a certain spot. But it's just hard sometimes.

76
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.470
And you just need somebody outside of your comfort zone to talk about that.

77
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.030
Right. And yeah, that, that really,

78
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.190
that really worked and helped for me. So I'm, I'm very thankful for that.

79
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.630
And just, you know, I think I always, I approach things,

80
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.830
just everything in life happens for a reason, whatever,

81
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.660
positive or negative. And sometimes you, you know,

82
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.740
what happens and why it happened.

83
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.220
And sometimes you probably know it after like a few years,

84
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.140
and maybe you never know it, but in my, my opinion,

85
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.020
everything in life positive or negative happens for a reason.

86
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.540
And you just, yeah, it's on you. How well, whether you.

87
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.020
<v 1>Put that or doesn't,</v>

88
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.050
you decide that it does that it happens for a reason and you can find benefit

89
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.250
in good or bad things. Then it does happen for a reason.

90
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.090
But you make that distinction that it's going to be for your benefit, that you,

91
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.010
it can help you in the long run.

92
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.010
That's the difference between a person who takes things that

93
00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:44.120
happen adversity in life and eyes that the world is against them. Yeah. Oh,

94
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.240
I'm oh, I can't catch a break.

95
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:48.920
The world's me over those people wind up becoming losers. Yeah.

96
00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:51.280
Versus someone who says, you know what? We're gonna be fine.

97
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:53.640
This is gonna make me better. Yeah. It's gonna make me stronger.

98
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.600
This is gonna make me understand. I'm I'm,

99
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:57.240
even though I'm more vulnerable right now,

100
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.240
this is gonna make me understand myself better.

101
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:01.600
It's gonna ultimately make me better at everything I do.

102
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.000
If you decide that then they do, then things do happen for a reason. Exactly.

103
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.520
And.

104
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.280
<v 0>That's, and that's one of the reasons I love watching your podcast,</v>

105
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.840
because that's what you bring.

106
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.710
And especially what I think for people to it,

107
00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:19.790
maybe sometimes struggle with certain things, or like,

108
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.350
just explain in a situation where you think like,

109
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.630
what the did I do to life that constantly ever been just backfires on me?

110
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.830
It's I always think like,

111
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.710
you are responsible for the choices that you make in your life and nobody

112
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.110
else. You're also.

113
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.860
<v 1>Responsible for how, how you accept or how you focus on your life. Exactly.</v>

114
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.380
How you think about things and how you, how you process it.

115
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.180
You're responsible for it. Yeah.

116
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.580
<v 0>So, and those, those are things like are so important to me.</v>

117
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.700
And that's why that, and that's what I mean with,

118
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.450
I try to surround myself with people that and boost my flame.

119
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.410
Mm. And just look at my phone and it's like, go through it. Like,

120
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.690
who did I text? Or who did I call? Like, you know,

121
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.890
those people need to boost my flame.

122
00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:11.930
They need to be important in yeah.

123
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.290
One way or the other doesn't doesn't mean that they have to, to, to, uh,

124
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.560
be important in business or in work, or it can be in every,

125
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.120
in love or in family or whatever. It need to be important in some kind of way.

126
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.080
I just need to have positivity around me because I've seen so many

127
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.800
negative things from my family side that it's like,

128
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.880
it doesn't work drains. You, it drains you. And I believe like it's like karma,

129
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.510
if you, you are negative,

130
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.390
you will attract more negative things.

131
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.190
If you're positive or positive things will come your way. Um,

132
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:50.990
100%, I.

133
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.310
<v 1>Believe that as well. Do you, um, have, uh,</v>

134
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.550
a visualization plan when you go into a fight?

135
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.660
Like say like this re my out with Barari. Yeah. Do you,

136
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.940
are you gonna sit down and visualize certain scenarios?

137
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.060
Do you tr train your,

138
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.820
your thought process to go over scenarios or to have a game plan in your

139
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:14.900
mind? The way execute the fight the way you would like to imagine it? Of course.

140
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.020
<v 0>Of course. I think every fighter does. And before.</v>

141
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.330
<v 1>This is something you set aside, like, do you meditate,</v>

142
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.490
set aside time to do that? Or you just do that all the time? No, it just.

143
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.833
<v 0>Just happens.</v>

144
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.610
<v 1>You're just doing it all the time. Yeah. You're.</v>

145
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.810
<v 0>In the car, you know, whatever. It just, yeah.</v>

146
00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:33.810
It just happens when you on the treadmill or whatever. It just,

147
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.730
it just happens when you, you think about what's going,

148
00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:42.640
what's going to been in the upcoming months.

149
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.920
You just know that, okay, this is gonna be next level. Okay.

150
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:50.320
But how are we going to approach this fight? What is going to happen?

151
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.600
What might happen if he does this? I do that. Okay. But this could happen.

152
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.120
And that could happen. And in my mind, before going into the fight,

153
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.040
I fought it already like a thousand times, or maybe even more,

154
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.600
cuz you're thinking about this,

155
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:10.040
this person and this fight for so long and for like three or four months,

156
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.920
that's, that's a long time. So that happens. And

157
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.270
what, and what, what always feel like what's fun to people to,

158
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.190
to realize is that my confident level during

159
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.750
a period of like three, four months into a fight goes like

160
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.190
up and down, up and down people like,

161
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.500
how is that PO you are the best of what you do.

162
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.740
You're smacking the at everybody in, in, in the, in,

163
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.660
in training and in camp. And how does does that? I don't know,

164
00:09:43.661 --> 00:09:47.540
but that is what happens. I think that happens to everybody.

165
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.020
So you just accept the process, you just accept the process, but it's such,

166
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.210
it's such a frustrating process that when you are, when you are here,

167
00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.290
just gotta to get back up there again.

168
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.330
But you know that it's part of the process,

169
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.530
cuz I've been doing this for my whole life. So I know it's part of the process,

170
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.530
but still it's frustrating. So, and that's what, for example,

171
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.393
such a,

172
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:17.040
a mental coach and a psychologist can help you with to cope with that

173
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.320
at that moment so that you don't stay here.

174
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.200
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you do climb back up again,

175
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.360
but it's it's and then you say where, but where does that come from?

176
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.960
Can come from anywhere, you know, from your body being tired, like,

177
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.840
Hey, why can't I cope with this training?

178
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.390
Or why is this training getting or during sparring,

179
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:44.230
why did I get get hit five times with the right hand and didn't block

180
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.670
or react, whatever.

181
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.590
So it can come from anywhere and then the monotony of training as well, right?

182
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.190
Yeah. Yeah.
