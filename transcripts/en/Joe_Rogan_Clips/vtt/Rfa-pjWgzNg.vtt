00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I used to work at this tech company and like,</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.450
we had a lot of Chinese people that were,

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.820
it was a computational biochemistry research lab.

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.120
So of course we had a lot of Chinese people that worked there because they were

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.370
very smart and qualified.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.520
And that's my favorite thing is like, when you're like, you're racist,

7
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.840
I just said, you are smart.

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.740
<v 1>You guys were amazing. Well.</v>

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.650
<v 0>Then people they get there, like not all Chinese people are doing well.</v>

10
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:31.140
And I'm like, yeah, I'm sure there's Chinese people that aren't doing well,

11
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:32.880
but you know, their parents never talk about them.

12
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.580
<v 1>Well, there's a lot of Chinese people.</v>

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.000
When you say not all Chinese people are doing well, there's a billion them.

14
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.520
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, there's plenty that aren't doing well,</v>

15
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.920
but the ones that are doing well are doing really.

16
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.920
<v 1>Wow. Yeah. You're concentrating on the glass is half empty.</v>

17
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.380
I mean really billion people.

18
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.860
<v 0>The Chinese people that worked at this tech company,</v>

19
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.750
if they were Chinese nationals,

20
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:57.360
they were only allowed to have access to certain parts.

21
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.990
Like there were certain parts they had to keep separate from them and they

22
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.310
couldn't know about, did they come.

23
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.600
<v 1>Over and stare at your computer?</v>

24
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.053
<v 0>I had one guy.</v>

25
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.210
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

26
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.150
<v 0>Me. I'm just like, I'm just recruiting new people to work here.</v>

27
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:13.590
You're not going to get anything from me.

28
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:17.610
I don't understand what we're doing here. But the one guy who worked there,

29
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:19.710
he came over, didn't know any English.

30
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.910
And he learned English by watching Seinfeld. So I kid you not,

31
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.000
he had this Seinfeld cadence that he spoke with.

32
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.960
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

33
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.520
<v 0>And he'd enter rooms a little bit like Kramer. No, I sweat.</v>

34
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.370
Not the full thing, but every time he'd come into the office, he'd be like,

35
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:39.204
whoa.

36
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.830
<v 1>Oh really? Wow. That's weird.</v>

37
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.020
I wonder if there's an equivalent show in China,

38
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.840
where if you went over there and tried to learn Mandarin from a television show,

39
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:49.920
like, what would you concentrate on?

40
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.660
<v 0>I got a way to hold it here. I'm going to get two radios.</v>

41
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.613
[inaudible].

42
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.010
<v 1>Chopsticks is racist. No it's racial. You.</v>

43
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.240
There's a difference in racial and racist. I enjoy chopsticks.

44
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.310
It's a great way to eat salad by the way.

45
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.070
<v 2>I think people are often used to the burry,</v>

46
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:14.790
my heart at wounded knee narrative of native Americans, which is as victims.

47
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.070
And there's no question that they were victims of a westward rolling empire and

48
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:24.390
378 broken treaties. And we can just go on. We know what that narrative is like,

49
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.700
but the narrative that I told was an era of power, dominance of power, uh,

50
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.810
which came with brutality too. And I think it surprised it was a fact.

51
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.040
It was a fact that, that if you go back in time, these Indy,

52
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.150
these native American tribes that eventually got crushed as the Comanches did

53
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.720
and put on a reservation somewhere and had their livelihood taken away from

54
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:49.890
them. Um, but you know, it really, anyway,

55
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.840
it's a, it's a, it's a huge deal. Um, and,

56
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.660
and a narrative that I think to me,

57
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:02.110
that doesn't take into the enormous power and dominance and

58
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:06.400
behavior of, of command she's is just missing half the half the narrative.

59
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.190
<v 1>Well, it's so fascinating because it's essentially,</v>

60
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.960
they were living like stone age people and they were doing it very

61
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:15.100
recently. There were,

62
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.110
they were doing it like in terms of the way Europe is you could go and

63
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:25.000
see buildings in Italy that were built long before any of this

64
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:28.330
stuff happened long before the settlers started encountering them.

65
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:30.860
And they were living like this and this sort of, I mean,

66
00:03:30.861 --> 00:03:33.700
it's very romantic the way they live,

67
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:38.470
just chasing the Buffalo and killing them and then eating only

68
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:42.880
Buffalo meat and then doing very little farming, picking some berries and nuts.

69
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:47.530
And that's about it. I mean, it was just eating meat and rating and killing.

70
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.180
<v 2>If they were, they were hunter gatherers, they were nomadic hunter gatherers,</v>

71
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.980
which is what they were and what the horse allowed them to do was to,

72
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.150
which is what they had been before the horse allowed them to do that only just

73
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:03.770
really, really, really well. In other words, they would,

74
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.240
they weren't in a position of becoming agricultural Indians.

75
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:09.550
The horse gave them this ability to, and as you said,

76
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.980
that they got everything from the Buffalo clothing and, and lodging and,

77
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:16.930
and tools and saddles and bridles and food. I mean,

78
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:18.250
everything came from the Buffalo.

79
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.660
So the horse just enabled them to do this on an incredibly sophisticated level.

80
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.853
That was.

81
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.500
<v 3>Uh, Zanzibar. Well.</v>

82
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.600
<v 1>I think what kind of meat is on that?</v>

83
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.630
<v 3>Uh. I don't know something. I ain't even eat.</v>

84
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.580
I told you I don't eat McDonald's man. Like I don't trust me.

85
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.260
And matter of fact, me and Andrew, one time we went to, uh, we did the hip,

86
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.610
not the hip hop awards, the MTV awards over in Europe.

87
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.770
And while we was over there, the crew and everything,

88
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.140
and I w I traveled the line and I'm like, they was like, man,

89
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:53.020
we finna go get something to eat. And I'm like, I ain't eating that. Like, nah,

90
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.070
come on, let's go get somebody. I was like, man, you gonna up. Go over there.

91
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.730
Everybody. The whole crew had to go to the hospital. I was the only one.

92
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.010
They ain't go really? Yeah, because I don't eat that.

93
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.320
They all got food pours and trying to eat Andrew too. I'm not sure.

94
00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:12.370
He said he didn't, but I swear. I told him to, he said he didn't get it,

95
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:15.790
but he might've listened to me that time. But, but for the most part,

96
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:19.060
I just don't eat. When I go out to country, I eat that I'm used to a fruit,

97
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.350
rice, chicken. And McDonald's.

98
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.690
<v 1>McDonald's you ever see one of those, uh,</v>

99
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.200
cheeseburgers or they put it on a shelf for a year and they film it for a year

100
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:32.080
to see if it deteriorates here late. It looks like it just got put there.

101
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.930
<v 3>That's a good thing though. Right.</v>

102
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.970
That's like space food like that space food.

103
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:44.680
Like if the space food is good for all astronauts, they gotta be good for us.

104
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.550
Like we be hating on McDonald's way too much. Like nobody's really,

105
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.590
really died on, on paper. I mean, McDonald's they have from Jack,

106
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.010
they died from eating a lot. You eat anything a lot.

107
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.910
You going that SPP fishing and fat as.

108
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.790
<v 1>True. But I think someone's died for me. Cola.</v>

109
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.520
I think that was a bird that was Jack in the box. So right.

110
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:05.810
They had a Nikolai outbreak.

111
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.040
<v 3>That could be an everything that could be at any restaurant, any place that,</v>

112
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.070
that that you just showed on there. I'm pretty sure it's eco and that,

113
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.240
they just, they bother you immune to it. Yeah. That's one thing I did learn too,

114
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:19.700
from traveling at the end of the day, you can eat anything.

115
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.650
You just can't eat a lot of it.

116
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.660
<v 4>If you look at endurance as well, the adaptations and the mitochondria is well,</v>

117
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.010
the, you can get some acute adaptation. So very short term like, oh, you know,

118
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.330
bigger, whatever guns in six weeks or faster 400 meters, six weeks. Yes,

119
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:38.240
you can do that. But these adaptations are transient.

120
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.900
So it takes time for things to really get got solidified.

121
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.670
And also,

122
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.560
if you're more patient with your progression as while you're going to

123
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:52.700
find that your gains are much more stable, if you take some time off,

124
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.680
which is important for anybody, you travel, you get sick. Uh,

125
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.180
some other thing happens.

126
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.810
So if you've been training in a manner where you're not forcing yourself,

127
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.430
in fact, this is one of the very important points in,

128
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.900
uh, that Soviet coaches would make that do not force that uptaken D uh,

129
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.580
David rigor rigor is probably the greatest weightlifter of all times. So he is,

130
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.270
um,

131
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.040
over 60 a world records in several weight classes and just unbelievable athlete.

132
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.710
So he just made a point that do not force the strength

133
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:35.570
development, do not force mass development. That's another problem. You start,

134
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.370
it's possible to build muscle fast,

135
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.720
but it's not given necessarily very quality muscle. So yes, take your time. And,

136
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.760
and this is interesting enough, Joel, this is what old timers understood.

137
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.610
I'm a fan of, uh, books by all-time strong men.

138
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.750
Not all of them, of course, but some of them are just remarkable.

139
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.040
Earl Leaderman. He was an American strong man and educator.

140
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.930
He wrote a book back in 1925 called the seekers of strength.

141
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.633
And it's an awesome book.

142
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.250
She read this book and if you follow the directions in this book from

143
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:17.000
1925, you will get far superior results.

144
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.580
And for most pop fitness and strength programs,

145
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.740
because people who had some sense, some common sense, they're able to,

146
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.750
again, observe what's going on. They're not driven by some slogan. Oh,

147
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:30.500
one more rep.

148
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.670
<v 1>Yeah. You know, a lot of people thought that was all fake until, uh,</v>

149
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:40.070
Alex Jones and John Ronson was with him right at

150
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:44.750
the yes. Uh, I don't know who was with an actually yes.

151
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.650
I'm pretty sure Google that. Make sure I'm right. I'm pretty sure it was Ronson.

152
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.860
I'm pretty sure Ronson was. I know it was, he was talking about it.

153
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.440
We talked about it on the podcast about, you know,

154
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:57.210
like that they couldn't believe what they found.

155
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.530
So this is place Bohemian Grove. And the idea was that, uh,

156
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.800
there all the elites would go there and they would engage in these occult

157
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:08.250
rituals. This is in America. Yeah. Yeah. It's in California.

158
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.870
It's like Northern California. And so you hear about this and you're like, what?

159
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.880
Like if you heard about that, like, Hey,

160
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:18.930
there's a place former presidents go top,

161
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.980
top ranking generals and heads of state and bankers,

162
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.420
famous artists. They go to this place and they, they do a cult rituals.

163
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.830
They perform a cult rituals.

164
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:34.290
<v 5>Part four of the secret rulers of the world directed by Jon Ronson. He travels.</v>

165
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.380
<v 1>With Alex Jones, uh, Netflix.</v>

166
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:38.843
<v 5>Uh, I don't know where he could find.</v>

167
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.330
<v 1>It was on. You can definitely see it on YouTube.</v>

168
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.370
You can definitely see the interaction. So Alex films,

169
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.060
these people worshiping Molik the,

170
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.710
our God and doing this thing,

171
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.850
he completely sneaks in just acts like he's belongs there. Just let him in.

172
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.990
They have a gate guarded gate, just, Hey, Hey, how you doing? Uh,

173
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.060
he looks like a Republican. They let him throw up.

174
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.340
He is there filming them. They have an effigy,

175
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.450
like a bunch of straw and.

176
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.690
That's supposed to represent a person that you're sacrificing to Moloch.

177
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.440
They all got, they were dressed in these crazy hoods. They put the effigy down.

178
00:10:13.441 --> 00:10:17.010
They say they have those loudspeakers and they have this crazy speech they give

179
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.260
it's so weird. But these are like legitimate, wealthy, famous people.

180
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.040
Politicians. These people are like heads of banks and.

181
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.210
And then they go in there and they're dressing up. This is real, right?

182
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:33.300
Like this isn't like, you hear things like that. Like, well, that's nonsense,

183
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:36.300
right? That's nonsense. That doesn't really happen. There's not a real,

184
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:37.980
like Bilderberg meeting.

185
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.130
They don't really get together and pretend they're burning hookers.

186
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.650
They really do. They really do. Yeah. And so that he films this and like,

187
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.470
it's one of the first things that got me thinking about conspiracies,

188
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.540
as much as you can think that Alex is a wacky guy and he's certainly, uh,

189
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.750
eccentric and he's not always right. You know,

190
00:10:57.751 --> 00:11:01.440
and that's part of the problem when you're being lied to left and right by so

191
00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:05.520
many different things, you can get real off on, on things.

192
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:09.150
And he did, right. He's gotten, you know, he's, you know,

193
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:12.990
it's been beaten into the ground, but the,

194
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.850
the fact is that there are a certain amount of these things out there like that.

195
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.960
And if it wasn't for Alex releasing that video,

196
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.880
I think most people would think that's nonsense. But when you see that video,

197
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:31.740
you have to go, okay, what is this? What is going on?

198
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.730
Are they really dressing up? Is this really an, a cult ritual? What is this.
