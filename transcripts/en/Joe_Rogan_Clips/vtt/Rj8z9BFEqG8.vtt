<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.480
<v 1>Experience. Flying to Jeffrey Epstein's ranch in, uh, Albuquerque.</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.480
You know, he has, do he have a ranch there? Not only does he have a ranch there,

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.120
but he's got a mile away. He actually owns a Western world.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.200
Like it's like Westworld. Yeah.

6
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.000
<v 0>And dude 60 elite, the.</v>

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.720
<v 1>Leads, the elites. That's where they hang out.</v>

8
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.710
Jeff Jeffrey Epstein's Western town in Albuquerque in.

9
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.710
<v 0>Albuquerque. 60 minutes had a piece about saw how the, uh,</v>

10
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.350
the, the suicide is fake. 60 minutes. Did you, did you see in his like little,

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.030
uh, cell there's like 10 different fricking jump outfits. Jumpsuits. Yeah,

12
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.380
we went, there's a, there's a cord. There's a pen. Yeah. It's nuts.

13
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.860
And his brother's the one who hired this outside lawyer. And the lawyer's like,

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.940
I know it, it, it looks like I'm here to be like, oh no, he didn't.

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.780
I'm telling you look at all this stuff. Like here's the, well,

16
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.220
the Michael Badden guy, that guy from the HBO autopsy series me,

17
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.100
that guy has done thousands of autopsies. And he's a real expert. He's like,

18
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:03.090
I've never seen anyone who was who themselves with injuries like

19
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:05.130
this, especially where the Mark's at. Did.

20
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.210
<v 1>You, who, who knows if, if that's all just a distraction to like, uh,</v>

21
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.010
get people arguing, make it so obvious that it was O it wasn't a suicide.

22
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.290
It's so obvious. Let's release it, make it so obvious. Meanwhile,

23
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.290
he's still alive and everyone's trying to figure out how he died and,

24
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.600
and all they care about is that he's dead. You think? I think he's.

25
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.320
<v 0>Anything 3d chess son. No. And he's one step ahead of that way. So good. You.</v>

26
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.000
<v 1>Why would they have, why would caus pushing a triangle on their first?</v>

27
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.520
There's virtually a media blackout on it for the longest time,

28
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:40.560
but they gotta talk about something cuz the longer the mainstream media doesn't

29
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:43.990
talk about it. The more obvious it looks and it's waking everybody up,

30
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.550
you know how many people who are super anti conspiracy, theorists,

31
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:49.190
they're all into Epstein. Now.

32
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.150
It's like when nine 11 happened that woke up a lot of people,

33
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.110
nine 11 woke people up. A lot of people say, well it started with nine 11.

34
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.391
A lot of gonna,

35
00:01:56.391 --> 00:01:59.350
people are gonna say it started with Jeffrey Epstein cuz it's so obvious.

36
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.910
Epstein. Even my dad obvious.

37
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.940
<v 0>What are we doing? Like Michael Shermer, Michael,</v>

38
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.500
Shermer's calling it a conspiracy.

39
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.340
<v 1>Everybody. People that hate conspiracy thes are all into it. They're all. Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:14.460
Michael Shermer. I'm so balls deep. And uh,

41
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:17.220
there's a guy on YouTube who every day he puts out.

42
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.140
All he does is he he's written books on gangsters and all that.

43
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.610
Every day he puts out a Epstein video and update and he just goes deeper into

44
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.090
what's deeper and deeper. His name is Sean Atwood.

45
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.170
What's the update every day though, dude, it would take me two hours to,

46
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.210
to go into it's really all about GI lane. Maxwell's father.

47
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.810
He was the one who was originally doing what Epstein was doing. Epstein took.

48
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.000
So Epstein started banging GI lane. She takes him, am she goes, you know what?

49
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.440
You're gonna take over the family business. The family business is,

50
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.040
is not just blackmailing the elite. That's part of it. But the man,

51
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.000
a big part of it, a big part of that dude, it, her father,

52
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.360
he's the one Robert Maxwell. That guy was a dude. He worked. He &lt;laugh&gt;.

53
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.920
I love this. I don't know. Like I'm afraid to talk about this, dude. Sean,

54
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.200
listen, listen to Sean Atwood. Okay. Well.

55
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.000
<v 0>We have people go to that guy's page.</v>

56
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.680
<v 1>It's incredible. It's.</v>

57
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.880
<v 0>It is. It's the cover. I conspiracy.</v>

58
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.830
It's the first conspiracy in modern times a where everyone is like no way.

59
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.030
Ah, JFK he's so D no, no JFK.

60
00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:26.350
There's still people to this day that think that Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK.

61
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.430
A lot of 'em including people that have written like good. What is that? Um,

62
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.110
what's that guy's name wrote case closed, uh, William, whatever.

63
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.710
Uh, uh,

64
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:40.780
there's there's been a lot of credible of people that think that Oswell acted

65
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:43.740
alone. I don't think so. That's so crazy. I don't think so. That's ridiculous.

66
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.060
<v 1>That's that's like Epstein again, but this one,</v>

67
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.540
the first Epstein they have one all the time. No, one's.

68
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.580
<v 0>Defending it. Yeah, no one. No one's saying no one's coming out. Defend it.</v>

69
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.580
The government's just silent.

70
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.140
<v 1>I think, I think there's a good chance that he's alive. I think, I think it's,</v>

71
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.130
that's crazy that that's where I think they're I don't mean everybody. Oh,

72
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:01.970
it wasn't a suicide.

73
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.610
<v 0>I'd wanted him to be alive. Cause it'll make this even more fun.</v>

74
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.610
If we're in Europe and you're like.

75
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.690
<v 1>Anythings possible. It's already crazy as. The amount of deception that we're,</v>

76
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.170
that that's shoved down our throats. It's obvious. Now it's all out in the open.

77
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.050
So any plausible theory you can't laugh at dude. He's what I.

78
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.400
<v 0>You could easily be alive. He's you could right? Bandages Oliver,</v>

79
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.000
hiss face watching TV, the hospital. Exactly.

80
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.400
<v 1>Full facial.</v>

81
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.840
<v 0>Facial reconstruction surgery.</v>

82
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.920
<v 1>It was the worst face. Yeah. Why did they need to show 9,000 jumpsuits and?</v>

83
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.160
Like they're making it Get in there, dude. It's so obvious. It's obvious.

84
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.960
It's too obvious. I'm with Eddie.

85
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.310
<v 0>It's the most obvious one of all time. Look at all those jumps.</v>

86
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.303
<v 1>Like, come on, man.</v>

87
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.150
<v 0>How about, how about 2020 showed his dead body on.</v>

88
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.230
<v 1>TV and the craziest thing? The craziest thing besides all that,</v>

89
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.590
the craziest thing is like where's the video footage. Oh, the cameras weren't.

90
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.703
Oh no, no, no. Did you see.

91
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.830
<v 0>Thats the craziest ever yout. See the new video footage,</v>

92
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.260
the new video footage was accidentally erased. That's insane. First.

93
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.540
<v 1>The first video they doing.</v>

94
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.900
<v 0>That on purpose video from Jeffrey Lee Epstein's suicides attempt is gone.</v>

95
00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:10.660
Jail officials, inadvertently preserved footage from wrong floor.

96
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.060
&lt;laugh&gt; Hey government, if you're gonna kill someone do batters out.

97
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.493
<v 1>We got.</v>

98
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.340
<v 0>Now if you suicide.</v>

99
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.540
<v 1>Attack, if you were part of this, this, um, this, um,</v>

100
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.380
network of like elite people, right? Like he's definitely,

101
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.930
he definitely has a of power, right? Yeah. Wouldn't you, wouldn't there be like,

102
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.210
uh wouldn't you think it would be a good idea to all get together and say,

103
00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:31.090
listen, every now and then some dude's gonna,

104
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.050
we're gonna have to sacrifice one of you guys and just fake your death.

105
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:36.530
And then you're gonna have to go to one of the islands in Japan or one of the,

106
00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:39.690
they probably have so many spots set up. Wouldn't it be smart.

107
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.170
Go set up some spots in,

108
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.000
in like the gr east islands or somewhere like off north, the coast of Norway,

109
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:48.320
Greenland, Greenland could, who knows? What's in Greenland.

110
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.040
They could have all these cities for,

111
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.280
for like all these people that like they die, but you never see their bodies.

112
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.000
They could just say, you know, they,

113
00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:58.840
people used to fake their deaths all the time, back in the thirties, forties.

114
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.320
<v 0>But that was, he used to their internet.</v>

115
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.400
No way easier to just kill Epstein Wayer way. Especially, especially when.

116
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.360
<v 1>He is. You don't think he has, you don't think he has a, a kill switch.</v>

117
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.400
You don't think that dude did. I think he probably does. You know, dude, man,

118
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.120
I wish I could tell you.

119
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.640
<v 0>That's why I just saying max, I alive. You, you can't tell us.</v>

120
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.270
<v 1>Wish you could. It's dark, dude. This the stuff like darks.</v>

121
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.310
I'll tell you guys about this out, but okay. Sean Atwood, that, that guy, holy.

122
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.630
He's he's he's dug in so deep, like so deep, like the neighbor, the,

123
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.070
the property that's right next to the one in, in Manhattan that, uh,

124
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.030
Les Wexner gave him for $0.

125
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.030
<v 0>Hey man, that's a nice person. It's a good friend. Gives you a 70 million.</v>

126
00:06:36.031 --> 00:06:36.910
You know what? That people.

127
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.053
<v 1>People always jump on that.</v>

128
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.980
But that's not that crazy because back in the eighties,

129
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.860
apparently for like Sean at would saying, that's not that crazy.

130
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.540
Cuz people used to do that all the time to save on taxes so that ain't a big

131
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:52.420
deal. Maybe, uh, Epstein did pay him whatever was worth, you know, uh,

132
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.420
they would often do that. Just say it's his zero. It's not the craziest thing.

133
00:06:56.421 --> 00:07:01.330
It's not the craziest thing, but the, the property next to that man.

134
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.490
And the history of that, I wish we could go over that, man. It's crazy.

135
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.010
Epstein has been involved in intelligence for a very long time, very long time,

136
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.810
a long, like as long as the Iran Contra, uh, scandal.

137
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.640
Remember that &lt;affirmative&gt; a lot of drugs coming in, helping.

138
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.640
It's like all this illegal black ops Georges was the main El Patran,

139
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.960
uh, Epstein was in was one of the workers that he was in. So he was his.

140
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.640
<v 0>Girls in hiding. Right. Eddie, because they said she was a CI informant.</v>

141
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.440
Shes like the main Maxwell. Yes.

142
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.750
<v 1>She was the main one. Yeah. She Epstein into the operation. Her,</v>

143
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.150
her father was the Epstein took over for her father, Robert Maxwell.

144
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.230
That's what's going on. She's more powerful than.

145
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.990
<v 0>Epstein and they can't find her now.</v>

146
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.950
<v 1>They don't touch her. They're not gonna touch her. You don't think.</v>

147
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.070
<v 0>She has a kill switch. I guarantee she's in touch with people.</v>

148
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.273
It'll only make sense.

149
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.780
<v 1>The, her father was the master of blackmail people. What he did.</v>

150
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:00.700
Yeah. Just.

151
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.580
<v 0>Just gimme an idea what that place was next door.</v>

152
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.300
<v 1>It's just, when you go through the owners,</v>

153
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.140

00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:17.300
The internet is like, uh, backfiring and uh, it's boomerang.

156
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.290
And back at the people, it was the internet intended to control us and uh,

157
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.570
surveil us. And.

158
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.610
<v 0>Now what's happening. It wasn't,</v>

159
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.050
the internet was intended for scientists to share information at universities.

160
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.450
It was invent universities. That's.

161
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.363

163
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.890

00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:51.360
It's always about the new world order. It's always about the,

168
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.680
the easiest way to control us. That's all. So, okay.

169
00:08:55.681 --> 00:09:00.360
There's this give there's this software need this let's Robert Maxwell get deep.
