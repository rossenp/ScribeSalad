00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.200
<v 2>So when did you get interested in the subject of</v>

3
00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:08.100
UFO's.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.460
<v 0>That happened at a surprisingly early age?</v>

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:16.380
I was seven years old at a boarding school and the principal of the

6
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:21.240
school, a friend of his had photographed, uh, video, uh,

7
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.170
an old, real,

8
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:27.120
a real Kodak movie camera had taken a movie home movie of a video of a

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.680
UFO flying in beautiful blue skies,

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.970
Cumulus clouds,

11
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.710
huge golden disc that comes into the picture at bags,

12
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.930
goes into a cloud and it disappears into this sort of wispy cloud in a way that

13
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:46.260
would be very, very hard, I think, to, to fake somehow,

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.060
particularly in those days with no computer generated imagery and it comes out

15
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:54.090
the other side and then sort of goes off over the horizon.

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.730
And I was stunned and flabbergasted myself and all

17
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:03.960
the other kids ran outside that night and we're looking at the stars and it

18
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:07.890
just, uh, uh, sparked my curiosity, a lifelong curiosity.

19
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.810
<v 1>So once you got into government and once you were, I mean,</v>

20
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:16.680
you were there, you're basically there, you had to start asking questions. Like,

21
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.330
did you wait a while? Like how long did you ask for, Hey, what do you guys know?

22
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.340
<v 0>Oh yeah. Uh, well, uh, for a long time I waited, um,</v>

23
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.690
very rarely. I looked for openings always for opportunities. So, uh,

24
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630
for example, you know, the stigma is,

25
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:37.380
is so great that you're reluctant obviously to, uh, to raise that issue.

26
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.670
Couple times there were some national opportunities. So, uh,

27
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.290
one of my colleagues on the intelligence committee was going to Hawaii for some

28
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:49.050
oversight, uh, trips meetings.

29
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.460
And he went to the Maui, uh, space, optical tracking facility.

30
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.730
And I said to him, why are you're there? Why don't you just check and see,

31
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.440
do they ever see anything weird? They can't explain it so forth. So he did. And,

32
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.810
uh, Pete called me up and said, Hey, you wouldn't believe this.

33
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:08.070
I've got this videotape here and it's shows these weird things.

34
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.270
And so, uh, I talked to the air force people, they sent the tape to us.

35
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.250
It turns out, it was told to in classified. Um, I showed it to Senator Cohen,

36
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.020
uh, and some others. And it ended up on, uh,

37
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.460
on national TV, uh, actually, but, but didn't generate,

38
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.370
uh, in any further response,

39
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:32.280
everybody just kind of threw their hands up in the air and said, well, you know,

40
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:34.920
that's interesting, but, uh, we don't know what to do with it.

41
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.480
It was a Ted Koppel's Nightline show that this tape was played on.

42
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.650
It showed sort of five objects moving parallel to the ground,

43
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.210
possibly in there in the atmosphere because they're burning,

44
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:52.620
they're interacting with something, uh, you know, was plasma coming off of them,

45
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.920
uh, which would presumably be happening in space,

46
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.020
but they seem to be too slowly meteorites.

47
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.130
So it was mystifying it difficult to explain, never did get an answer. Um,

48
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.800
occasionally something like that would happen by and large.

49
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.660
The issue almost never arose.

50
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.200
<v 1>The, the,</v>

51
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.120
the issue is a weird issue because if you bring it up in the wrong company

52
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.940
or at the wrong time, you could be dismissed as a loon.

53
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.220
Did you feel that when you were there, like,

54
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.500
as a person who had a budding interest in

55
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.440
unidentified flying objects and what have you,

56
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.450
did you feel like this is a politically risky thing to discuss,

57
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.450
especially to discuss like in serious terms? Like,

58
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.030
do you believe in these things, like, what are they,

59
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.820
what do we know is what was that an issue?

60
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.440
<v 0>Absolutely. Um, I concealed my interest in the topic, uh,</v>

61
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.450
for years and very carefully and confided to a few trustworthy

62
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:56.350
friends at a few heart to heart talks with a couple individuals.

63
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.370
When I found a fellow traveler who was interested in this topic,

64
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:04.540
but by and large, uh, absolutely, uh,

65
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.970
wanted to conceal that and, and not reveal that.

66
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.440
<v 1>Oh, Clinton. No, no. He would be the guy that I would go to.</v>

67
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.730
<v 0>There's a request that came to me once that I think was from president</v>

68
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:19.564
Clinton.

69
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.310
And it was one of the astronauts claimed to have

70
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.680
seen, um, a UFO out at Edwards air force base. And it was videotaped,

71
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:30.514
he said,

72
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.800
and he described this in his memoir and wanted the president to get

73
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:37.120
hold of the tape of the video.

74
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.610
And secretary Cohen came back to the Pentagon from a meeting and a

75
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:46.390
message came down to me to go, to try find this tape. And, uh,

76
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.800
unfortunately there was a, I got, got nowhere with that.

77
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:54.220
The air force was adamant that there was no such tape.

78
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:58.330
There was no such information, anything they had on UFO's had been destroyed.

79
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.180
Um, so I had one of these situations is very common in this area,

80
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:07.720
which is you have just two, apparently credible sources,

81
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.170
but utterly conflicting irreconcilable information,

82
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.810
which seems to happen often in this field.

83
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.090
<v 1>Now being as you were in government and very close to</v>

84
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.190
literally the machine that runs the world. W what,

85
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.270
what's the general perception when people are discussing these,

86
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:31.900
these things in, in Washington, what is,

87
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.930
what's the general perception of what's going on with these things?

88
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.450
<v 0>Well, I'm happy to say that it's changed.</v>

89
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:40.060
That perception has changed considerably in the last few years.

90
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:41.950
People feel like they have permission to talk about it.

91
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.120
When do you think this happened?

92
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.130
This happened after the New York times article and subsequent press, uh,

93
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.630
beginning of 2017, December, 2017. And, um,

94
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.840
that sort of gave people permission to talk about this.

95
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:59.600
And I've actually had Pentagon friends who said, you know, this is kind of cool.

96
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.970
We don't have to go in the closet to talk about this anymore.

97
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.450
<v 1>You think kept it in the closet before, like when did the stigma start?</v>

98
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:08.870
And you think this was like intentionally sort of set up this way.

99
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.820
<v 0>It was, uh,</v>

100
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.170
it was the Robertson panel commission 1953.

101
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.160
And they concluded during the cold war days that this was, uh,

102
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.950
a potential threat to national security because UFO reports might overwhelm our,

103
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.260
our air defense and communication system and that the Soviets might spook

104
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:32.480
the public and somehow manipulate this issue.

105
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.550
So they actually advocated in writing that this issue be debunked

106
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.590
and discredited and the government, uh, went ahead and did so,

107
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.890
um, extremely successfully, unfortunately.

108
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.230
<v 1>And this all started with the project blue book, correct?</v>

109
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.310
<v 0>Correct. It was.</v>

110
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.270
<v 1>So, uh, what was the gentleman's name that was running project blue book again?</v>

111
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.860
<v 0>Um, well, there were different people. [inaudible] Allen Hynek.</v>

112
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.310
<v 1>And hi, Nick went on to become a believer.</v>

113
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:06.050
So he started debunking and was told essentially the way he

114
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:09.410
reported it was that he was told to kind of debunk every single case,

115
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.130
everything he could find, whether a swamp gas or, you know,

116
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.120
a ball lightning find some way to explain this away.

117
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.210
But then once he left project blue book,

118
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.480
he started openly discussing these cases and he started discussing his own

119
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:24.314
belief.

120
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.611
<v 0>That's correct.</v>

121
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:30.350
And he felt badly burned as well because he was trying to carry

122
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:34.880
out his mandate that the air force had given him, as you may recall,

123
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:35.661
in one instance,

124
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:39.680
he went to Michigan and famously declared that the people of Michigan were

125
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.460
misconstruing swamp gas for, for flying objects.

126
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.050
And so Gerald Ford,

127
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.250
who was represented that district got incensed as did the local population.

128
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:53.060
And Congress took a fleeting interest in the topic. And, uh,

129
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.140
Dr. Hynek was very embarrassed. Um, and understandably,

130
00:07:57.141 --> 00:08:01.910
so it was really, uh, quite insulting to these, to these people who had, uh,

131
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.630
had very clear sightings of these objects. So, um,

132
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.870
he did eventually, um, change his view publicly and was very critical of,

133
00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:11.990
of project blue book.
