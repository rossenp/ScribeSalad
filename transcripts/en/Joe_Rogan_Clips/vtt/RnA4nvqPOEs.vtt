00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.570
<v 1>Experience is not okay.</v>

3
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:07.950
I did the last movie Chris Farley ever did was dirty work. So I'm in the mood.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.690
And after right after dirty work, right before he passed away, uh,

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.810
he hosted Saturday night live. So norm was still doing weekend updates.

6
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:18.390
So norm called me up and said, listen, Farley's out of control.

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.150
Will Coke come to the party after the show? Cause I got,

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.270
you gotta help me watch him. Like that's how bad he was. I had to help one.

9
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.710
I had to help watch them. Okay. So this is, this is how fast norm is. Now.

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.390
This is a Testament to Norm's witness.

11
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.470
So I'm at the party and norm was talking to somebody and I say,

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.120
I'm watching Chris I'm on Coke. I'm coked up. So, so,

13
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:43.800
so I see Farley disappeared into a bathroom with auntie Dick. Oh,

14
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.250
okay. Him and Andy going to a bathroom. They come out five minutes later,

15
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:51.270
like giggling Norman comes over to me and goes, what's going on with Chris?

16
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:55.140
I go bad nose, bro. He goes, what? I go, he went into a bathroom with Andy Dick.

17
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.561
I said,

18
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:59.520
there's only two reasons a man goes into a bathroom with anti-tech and neither

19
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:03.420
one of them's good. And norm looked to me without missing a beat. He said, holy.

20
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.680
I hope he's high.

21
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.290
Holy. I hope he's high.

22
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.120
[inaudible] good news.

23
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.440
<v 0>Oh, Chris Farley showed up on the set of news radio one day to visit Andy.</v>

24
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.100
And he said he had the complexion of wet cardboard.

25
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.430
I've never seen a man look more unhealthy.

26
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.290
<v 1>To a strip club with him and Toronto.</v>

27
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.270
He shot the we'll get the rod there had chicks hanging. I mean,

28
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:40.890
he was just like, oh.

29
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.593
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

30
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.820
she took a picture of him foam coming out of his mouth, laying on the ground.

31
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.200
You.

32
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.450
<v 1>Knew what I was going to end. That's the people you're around.</v>

33
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.330
<v 0>Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. It's like, yeah.</v>

34
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.220
<v 3>I met Quentin. I was at a film festival in sieges, Spain.</v>

35
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.720
It's a science fiction, fantasy film festival as a guest. And um,

36
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.840
I, I was there. I that's where I met Peter Jackson. We actually,

37
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.550
he had sat next to me in a screening and we became friends and, and uh,

38
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.330
he had his movie brain dead. Have you ever seen that? Oh, it's really good.

39
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.070
It's really fun. It's really gory, but funny gory, um, and really clever.

40
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.220
Um, but anyway, when did he make that? Well,

41
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.890
this was like in the nineties or something, I guess I, uh,

42
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.050
I'm real bad with dates, you know, but anyways, we were sitting and talking and,

43
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:33.450
and Freddy Francis who was a director and a director of photography for it,

44
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.900
did a lot of hammer movies and Stuart Freeborn was there and we're sitting in

45
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.330
this thing and there was this big kind of goofy kid walking around, you know?

46
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.000
And, and I thought he was just like a fan. So I said,

47
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.580
come on over and sit down with us. You know, when we started talking and go,

48
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:45.870
what are you doing here? And you know,

49
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.470
he was obviously like an American and he goes, I have a film here, you know,

50
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:53.640
and it was reservoir dogs. And we went to see it.

51
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.200
And I actually left in the scene where they're torturing the cop. It's funny.

52
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:03.100
People think I gory gory stuff, you know, cause I've done it in films,

53
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.840
but real stuff. And if it's really intensely done on a film like that was,

54
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.510
I mean, I thought he was gonna let this guy out light this guy in fire.

55
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.350
That he's where he's got the cop in a chair at one point I just said, I can't,

56
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.240
I don't want to see this. So I left. And so did west crave and yeah.

57
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.160
And we went, uh, and he got so jazzed by that, you know,

58
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.540
get out of the west crave and couldn't take my movie and Rick baker couldn't

59
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.770
take my movie so cool.

60
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.790
<v 4>That's awesome. But I met this prostitute in lake Tahoe.</v>

61
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.600
She was, she had come to my show and she was like, you know, in Nevada, it's,

62
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.300
it's all legal. And so she, I go,

63
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:48.160
what's the weirdest client that you ever had. And she goes, well,

64
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.240
I don't know if you're ready for this,

65
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:54.010
but I met this guy and he lived in Colorado and he had been in,

66
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.870
in Nevada, liked her, said, she said, she's up for anything,

67
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.860
sends a jet to take her to Colorado. Oh Jesus.

68
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.080
They go to Denver to some five-star hotel,

69
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.590
come up to the suite presidential suite and they come in and she's like,

70
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:12.520
I have no idea what this is about. And he goes, now this is going to be weird,

71
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.470
but it's not going to hurt you. Just go with it. I think.

72
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.303
<v 0>I know where this.</v>

73
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.370
<v 4>Room service shows up. Guy's got a tray,</v>

74
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.360
he's got four plates of hamburger, meat, uncooked,

75
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.130
just hamburger, meat tips, the guy leaves. And he says,

76
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.490
what I want you to do is take this meat.

77
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.540
I'm going to get naked and you're going to take handfuls of it and shove it up

78
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:38.374
my.

79
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.580
<v 0>I didn't think it was.</v>

80
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.470
<v 4>Going there. Five pounds of hamburger meat.</v>

81
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.140
He just stood there and she kept stuffing it up. Stuffing out, no erection,

82
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:51.700
no sex, no touching her. And then back on the jet,

83
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.680
back to Nevada.

84
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.110
<v 0>So he's a wealthy guy. He.</v>

85
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.660
<v 4>Paid her a ton of money. Oh my.</v>

86
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.560
<v 0>I'm surprised. But I'm not surprised. Like if you said, would you bet your life,</v>

87
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.510
that there's a guy out there that sent a private jet to get a prostitute and

88
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:15.220
take her to a nice restaurant and then paid her to stuff, hamburger,

89
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:19.420
meat up his. If you're wrong, you die. Yeah. I go, yeah. Pick it up.

90
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.560
<v 4>Right. Right. A million monkeys typing, you know?</v>

91
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.420
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm, I'm surprised, but I'm not stunned. Right.</v>

92
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.180
I'm not like no way. I don't believe that. Yeah. I believe it.

93
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.500
<v 4>Well, and the F the funny thing is like, I don't get the sense.</v>

94
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:41.680
This guy is on a chat room talking to other guys that stuff,

95
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:43.870
ground beef up their. This is his thing.

96
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.850
<v 0>That's his, that's a personal thing.</v>

97
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.680
<v 4>He's got so much money that his mind just goes to places and</v>

98
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.240
he can indulge it. He can just go. Yeah, I'll try that.

99
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.650
And the biggest problem is actually even.

100
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.370
<v 5>The fentanyl itself, it's the fentanyl precursors.</v>

101
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.830
And do you know what those are? The chemicals.

102
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.990
<v 0>That are used to make fentanyl. Exactly.</v>

103
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.740
<v 5>Yeah. And so that was sort of the main investigation in my book.</v>

104
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.990
Like almost like, um,

105
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.400
80 pages of the book are dedicated to this one company. Um,

106
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.870
they're called Yuan.

107
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.180
Chung is Chinese company that makes more fentanyl precursors

108
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.010
than any company in the world. You know, they, um, they they're legit.

109
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.360
And not only that,

110
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.100
they sell them to the Mexican cartels and they're totally, um,

111
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.560
sanctioned, not only sanctioned by the Chinese government,

112
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.900
but they get tax breaks from the Chinese government. They get, um, subsidies,

113
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.370
they get their land subsidized, their staff training, things like that.

114
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.000
And that was sorta the most jaw dropping, uh,

115
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.560
revelation that I had was that the Chinese government is not only failing to

116
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:57.800
crack down, but they're encouraging this industry.

117
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.650
<v 0>Wow. They're encouraging the industry. That's insane. So it's just the, the,</v>

118
00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:04.880
the, the idea is, look, it's making a lot of money.

119
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.710
Let's just keep making money.

120
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.930
<v 5>Yeah. It's um,</v>

121
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.400
a lot of people ask me if they think this is a blatant conspiracy

122
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.590
to,

123
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.550
to try to like inflict harm upon the U S a subversive form of

124
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:23.900
warfare. And so I think it didn't start out that way.

125
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.520
I think that these,

126
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.470
these benefits were given so that China could increase its exports could

127
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:34.430
grow its economy, particularly when it comes to chemical exports.

128
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.110
So that's why these tax credits started they're called value added tax

129
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:39.944
rebates.

130
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.840
And so what that means is any chemical that you

131
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:48.560
use to, to, um, any, uh,

132
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:51.890
ingredients you use to make a chemical for exports,

133
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.530
you can write off the costs of those,

134
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.410
of those ingredients when you export it.

135
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.770
So basically it's like a 16% tax rebate.

136
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.600
And so they originally did that just to try to like improve their economy,

137
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.130
improve their exports. But what's crazy to me now is that, um,

138
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.570
last year in the middle of the trade war, this was, um,

139
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.810
at the height of when you heard about the trade war every day, you know,

140
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.470
Trump was raising tariffs and doing this and that right at the height of that,

141
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:25.520
China increased the tax rebate for fentanyl from

142
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:29.870
9% to 10%. So it was almost like a,

143
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.000
seems like a thumb in the eye. And like for fentanyl it's,

144
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.013
I don't know.

145
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.870
<v 0>It's definitely seems like a big you. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

146
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.990
<v 6>But then the, in the New York state democratic party,</v>

147
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:43.610
there's always been all kinds of issues.

148
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.960
So I bet I met with a whole bunch of really smart people about running for New

149
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.390
York 17, which is the district that I live in.

150
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.060
Like the day after I lost my gig at Sirius,

151
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.590
the woman had been representing that district for 33 years,

152
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:59.130
announced that she was retiring. And I was like, well, I got,

153
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.660
I got nothing going on.

154
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.920
And I've always thought about running for office and let me, you know,

155
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:05.754
seriously consider it.

156
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.330
I reached out to a whole bunch of people from all different walks of life,

157
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.440
congressmen that were in office that had been out of office, uh,

158
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.410
campaign coordinators. I talked to Chris Cuomo.

159
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.580
I talked to a whole bunch of people,

160
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:21.930
but there's one person told me that if you wanna, if you wanna win,

161
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.610
w w regardless of your party affiliation, uh, you have to,

162
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.140
there's a certain, uh,

163
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.310
special interest group that you had to promise you wouldn't interfere with and

164
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.020
make sure they got an envelope of cash. And I'm like, well, I'm not doing that.

165
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.100
I will tell everybody. And everywhere I go about that, what is it I can't,

166
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:43.140
because I don't have a second source. So I wouldn't say it,

167
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.630
but when I'm trying to get one, it's.

168
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.890
<v 0>True. What does it rhyme with?</v>

169
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.050
<v 6>Uh, the special interest group, because everybody will know,</v>

170
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.740
everybody will know, and it's, it's, it's dangerous. But the point is,

171
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.933
the point is.

172
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.100
<v 0>What's the opposite of that special interest group.</v>

173
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.350
<v 6>Uh, maybe the private sector.</v>

174
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.980
<v 0>Right. But what would it be like? What, what would be,</v>

175
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.500
what would be the thing that they're opposed to.

176
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.460
<v 6>What would it be that they're posted you interfering with you interfering with</v>

177
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:17.160
the way that they run their show.

178
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.050
<v 0>But I'm saying like what, what group that we know would be opposed to that.</v>

179
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.010
<v 6>I could, I could tell you, it could be a religious group, a private sector,</v>

180
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.830
a union, or a company, you know, a corporate interest.

181
00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:31.590
It could be any one of those, the point, the point. Now,

182
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.730
the point is that all of those types of organizations,

183
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.410
pressure that you have to, I'm an honest guy. I can't,

184
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:44.520
I can't lie. I've never said anything into a microphone that I don't believe.

185
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.390
And that's been both to my detriment and to my benefit, I think I'm authentic.

186
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.820
So when I was talking about running for office, my brother's like, you gotta,

187
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.190
you can't, you can't lie. You can't be dishonest to people.

188
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.730
How are you going to do that? You'll have to sell out at least a little bit.

189
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.890
That was the other thing. And then I realized, I'm not sure that this district,

190
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.350
or, you know, the country is ready for someone like me.
