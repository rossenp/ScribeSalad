00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.290
<v 1>Experience. It's so interesting when you play people,</v>

3
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:07.500
clips of Obama talking about the importance of securing the border.

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.380
<v 0>I like to play those clips. They sounds just like.</v>

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.670
<v 1>Trump play the statistics of how many people they sent back and telling people</v>

6
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:17.520
to not come over with their children, they'll be separated from their children.

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.391
It's a,

8
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:22.200
it's one of those things where people like don't like that they don't like to

9
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:27.060
see that it really is deeply disturbing to them that Obama campaigned on this

10
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:28.680
idea of protecting our border.

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.350
<v 0>Because we all used to agree on it. You know, it.</v>

12
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.870
<v 1>It came a racial issue with Trump.</v>

13
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.740
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, he's definitely said some things where you can yeah, yeah.</v>

14
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.603
For sure.

15
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.130
<v 1>Was raping side's murder.</v>

16
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.150
<v 0>And not going to defend, not going to defend Trump's rhetoric on the,</v>

17
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:48.750
on your show or on any show. Um, that contributed to it. Sure.

18
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.180
But again, it was a pretty unemotional person.

19
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:53.100
I tend to look at what is the policy, right.

20
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:57.030
And so I have tried my hardest to move the debate towards when it comes to

21
00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.460
immigration towards a, a matter of sustainability,

22
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.460
a matter of sovereignty and a matter of rule of law. Like,

23
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.020
do we have standards are doing not, you know,

24
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:08.670
do we believe in this idea of a managed border or do we not? And you know,

25
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.563
in the end yeah.

26
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.930
And Trump has made the Democrats so crazy that they've moved radically to the

27
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:13.764
left.

28
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.040
And it's interesting to watch people always say like both sides have gotten so

29
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:19.410
extreme. I always find that interesting.

30
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:22.500
And I say this there's two ways to manage, to, to measure extremism.

31
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.890
One is our voting record. Like how often do you really vote with the other side?

32
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:27.960
And you can measure that pretty carefully actually. And you look,

33
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.680
you've probably seen a YouTube video maybe where you watch all over time,

34
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:33.090
all the red dots and the blue dots,

35
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:35.100
and they sort of mingled together and their voting records.

36
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:37.140
And then they slowly over time moved to the sides.

37
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.210
So both sides are responsible for that.

38
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.260
Like a lack of lack of actual compromise, a lack of deal-making where we say,

39
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:45.630
okay, I'll vote for your stuff. You vote for my stuff that,

40
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.320
that doesn't happen anymore. Uh, and there's reasons for that we could get into,

41
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:53.910
but there's another way to measure extremism and it's the actual policy changes.

42
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.320
And so that we can observe that. And I think, I think, and in that respect,

43
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.010
I don't think the right and conservatives have really changed our policies,

44
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:03.390
or I don't think we've gotten more extreme.

45
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.140
I think the left has gotten vastly more extreme and that they've changed their

46
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:11.040
policies radically, uh, Medicare for all open borders. I mean,

47
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.680
effectively open borders. They don't like to use the word,

48
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:15.240
but when you're saying decriminalize it,

49
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:17.820
when you're saying no infrastructure at all on the border,

50
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.450
when you're saying no more ice detention beds, you're,

51
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:22.890
you're effectively saying open borders because you don't want to enforce it and

52
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:26.430
you don't want to stop it. So I don't, I don't know what else to call it. Um,

53
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.490
you know, and those are just some example, the green new deal. I mean,

54
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.400
socialism is a good word now. So like, I think there's,

55
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.970
I think that on that long, that measure, uh,

56
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.480
only one side has really moved to an extreme as far as policy policy positions

57
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:42.030
go. And to your point, you look at Barack Obama and he's,

58
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:44.610
he's not the only one you can look at Chuck Schumer's old comments on this

59
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:47.790
stuff. I mean, it's, you, Trump could have written those statements for them.

60
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.580
Yeah. And, um, what can.

61
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.320
<v 1>The, the real issue is not people coming over here, uh, seeking work,</v>

62
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:57.810
good people that just want to do better for the live.

63
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.650
The real issue is drugs and crime.

64
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.750
What can be done to mitigate the effect of the Mexican drug cartels?

65
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.310
Because that seems to be our biggest worry.

66
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.010
Our biggest worry is that cartels and cartel violence.

67
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.840
<v 0>Well, no, our, well, our biggest word, that is a worry, but,</v>

68
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.160
but there's a reason, again,

69
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.860
I go back to the matter of sustainability and sovereignty in terms of the.

70
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.693
<v 1>Amount of people that.</v>

71
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.420
<v 0>I, I don't, I don't, I never, I actually never,</v>

72
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.830
when I talk about the immigration issue,

73
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.870
I actually never talk about the drugs and the crime,

74
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.280
because I don't want to label these good people as criminals, drug dealers.

75
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.840
You know, that that's the wrong,

76
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.090
that's the wrong and most investment sorority are,

77
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.510
but that just because you're a good person and you want nice things doesn't mean

78
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:39.940
you get to move to the front of the line. I remember immigration policies.

79
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.840
<v 1>So an important point to note for people that don't know,</v>

80
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.340
it's kind of a shocking statistic.

81
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.920
We let in more legal immigrants in any other country.

82
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.950
<v 0>Yeah. Over a million a year. Um, I think become citizens and,</v>

83
00:03:52.951 --> 00:03:57.490
and much more than that granted visas. So, and, and there's a,

84
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:01.150
there's a perfectly reasonable debate to have about how many work visa should we

85
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:03.010
have? Should we increase it or should we decrease it.

86
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.820
<v 1>But how does someone get over here and how do we know they don't have a history</v>

87
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:07.654
of violent crime?

88
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.070
<v 0>Like, and I, you know,</v>

89
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:11.890
I advocate for a merit based system with the president proposed,

90
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.440
I think is absolutely right. We, we,

91
00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:16.600
we have the opportunity to choose the best people from the world to come here.

92
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.820
And if you're a refugee, we have a system for that.

93
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:22.000
And if you're an actual asylum seeker, we have a system for that.

94
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.200
But what we should be a totally opposed to is this idea that just because you

95
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:28.000
made it to walk across the border,

96
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.360
that all of a sudden you get to cut to the front of the line and that's exactly

97
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:33.970
what's happening right now. Um, because of the loopholes we have,

98
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.620
if you bring a child with you,

99
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:38.320
our laws are written so that we basically can't enforce it.

100
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.880
We cannot enforce these laws. Um, and this is for a couple of reasons,

101
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:45.400
one of the Flores settlement, you might've heard that a lot.

102
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.020
What it means is you can't detain a child past 20 days.

103
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.480
So if a family comes across or it's usually,

104
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:53.770
it's usually just a part of a family,

105
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.240
cause what they actually do is they split up,

106
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.500
they split their own families up because they don't want to deport one of the

107
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:02.680
parents. Does that make sense? Okay. So the Flores settlement says, you have to,

108
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.120
you can't detain children,

109
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:07.330
which effectively means we can never adjudicate these claims in time.

110
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.910
Whether it's an illegal crossing issue,

111
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.560
like a criminal act of 1320 us code 13, 25, illegal crossing,

112
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.230
or just they're claiming asylum. Either one, we can't,

113
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.610
we can't adjudicate it in time.

114
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.400
So what ends up happening is a catch and release. When they say, okay,

115
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:22.300
show up for a court date,

116
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.050
then what incentive do they have to show up for that court date? You know?

117
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:29.470
And they just don't. So Anne we're talking, you know, jeez,

118
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:32.290
in the earlier part of this year, we had over a hundred thousand a month.

119
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.890
And so it gets to a question of sustainability. Let's say all,

120
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:38.320
let's say all a hundred thousand people are perfectly good people,

121
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.020
but it's sustainable. It's a sustainability question.

122
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:42.580
And it's also a fairness question.

123
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.310
Like why do they get to cut in front of the legal immigrants?

124
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.200
Why do they get so much more priority over all of the other people who want

125
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.170
to be in our country around the world? I mean,

126
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:55.570
they don't have that opportunity to just walk across the border. So it's just,

127
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:57.380
it's just complete. It's utterly unsustainable.

128
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:01.070
And if we value a sense of sovereignty and rule of law, but I think we should,

129
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.800
we value the idea of having a managed system. Then,

130
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.560
then we have to put a stop to that and then have a good conversation about,

131
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:08.000
well maybe we need more workers. Okay,

132
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.050
well then let's increase worker visas if that's.

133
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.671
<v 1>True. Well,</v>

134
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:14.030
I think we show sympathy about on them because they're poor people that are

135
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:15.770
trying to do better for their life.

136
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.090
Whereas we look at people that are coming over from Canada and if we had a

137
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:23.450
hundred thousand people from Canada illegally immigrating into our country,

138
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:26.270
every year we would go, Hey, Fox, get back over where you are.

139
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.250
Like you guys have a great country already.

140
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:31.010
You don't have the problem of a lack of opportunity in Canada,

141
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:32.660
the way people do in Mexico.

142
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:37.480
There's a giant disparity between north America in terms of like the

143
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:42.350
United States of America and Mexico, the economic possibilities, the,

144
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:44.990
the sharp drug violence.

145
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.880
<v 0>Laws are laws have to be written blind to those subjective terminology. Sure.</v>

146
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.700
You know, and that's, that's really important because otherwise, why have them,

147
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.910
like, why, why even have a system at all? If you just, if you,

148
00:06:54.911 --> 00:06:56.960
if it's enforced based on feelings, the.

149
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.130
<v 1>Case scenario would be Mexico becomes like Canada, right?</v>

150
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.720
Wouldn't that be the best case scenario, Mexico.

151
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.440
<v 0>Thinking they're not the one ones that are actually, we're having an issue,</v>

152
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:09.680
you know, it's, it's vastly central Americans. So again,

153
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.270
this stems from loopholes in our laws. Okay. So, uh, cause in Mexican, too,

154
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:16.610
because there are actually border us, right?

155
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.300
Our laws work where we can actually just put them right back for the most part,

156
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.080
a single adults to weaken our system works okay. With that.

157
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.870
The problem is if you bring a child and so every,

158
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:30.440
so everybody tends to bring a child in what this also causes is human

159
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:33.680
trafficking. A lot of these children don't belong to these parents. Okay.

160
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:36.920
So now we have to look at DNA testing to try and to try and Fort this and that

161
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:37.820
is what's happening now.

162
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:41.390
And we find that good amount of kids don't belong to these parents. So.

163
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.280
<v 1>They bring over a kid in order for them to.</v>

164
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.830
<v 0>Stay. And what will happen is then they'll recycle that kid.</v>

165
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.330
So border patrol often sees the same kid coming through with different adults in

166
00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:51.860
and out. And it's, it's terrible.

167
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.190
<v 1>And what other kinds, I mean, if it's not Mexico, what are the,</v>

168
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:55.780
the main countries where these people are coming.

169
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.530
<v 0>Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador.</v>

170
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.240
<v 1>And again,</v>

171
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.010
it seems like the only way that anyone could really truly fix that is

172
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.850
if those countries could rise up to the level of Canada.

173
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.490
So they could be commensurate with the United States.

174
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.720
<v 0>The left says we need to do, and I don't disagree with it at all. Uh,</v>

175
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.390
the problem with what the left is suggesting is that's the only thing we need to

176
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:21.170
do. And that's just not true. We also have to enforce our actual laws, but then,

177
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.670
but it's, but it is a bipartisan, I think, agreement that we,

178
00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:28.010
we want to develop the countries closest to us. Uh, I'm on a column,

179
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:32.030
a co-sponsor on a bill that does just that it's a bipartisan bill. Um,

180
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.780
and I think it encourages a more creative look at development in central

181
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:39.110
America. Uh, the Bush Institute is talks about this a lot.

182
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:40.430
And I think it's a really good idea,

183
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:44.960
which is basically economic empowerment through, through digital infrastructure.

184
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.880
So here in America, I mean,

185
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.980
we made a lot of money just based on the gig economy.

186
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.640
Every individual can empower themselves and, and work towards that.

187
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.020
And that's really cool. Uh,

188
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.640
they don't have that opportunity down there and it's a lack of digital

189
00:08:56.641 --> 00:09:00.360
infrastructure, whether it's broadband or whatever. Um,

190
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:03.240
so working towards investing in the right things, as opposed to just, Hey,

191
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:04.950
here's some aid that, that your,

192
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.280
your corrupt politicians can line their pockets with and we can feel good about

193
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.470
ourselves and pat ourselves on the back and think like we're doing good for

194
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:13.110
other countries, but we're really not again, feel good or do good.

195
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.960
So it was a good question to ask. And so I think, I think we're,

196
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.120
I think we're working towards the solutions in Congress.
