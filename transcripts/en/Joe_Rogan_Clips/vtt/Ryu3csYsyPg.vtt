00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 1>Like you've heard the they're doing in LA.</v>

3
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:07.740
We were talking about before the show today that LA they're gonna allow outdoor

4
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.540
dining, but you can't have a TV on

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.290
What the does that mean? Who are you?

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.470
Who the are you to tell people they can't have a TV on? Like,

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.680
what do they have a Jamie? Is there an explanation for.

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.180
<v 0>Why? Why does that matter?</v>

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.610
<v 1>Because it doesn't matter. They're criminals.</v>

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.830
These people think they can just tell you what to do.

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.810
LA county says no TVs for outdoor diners at local restaurants. What.

12
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.980
<v 0>Why?</v>

13
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.640
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.530
Why does it say why this provision is effective until

15
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:44.100
further notice? They didn't have to tell you. They don't have to tell you.

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.833
These.

17
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.280
<v 0>Creeps. I mean, I mean, it's, like I said before, it's like,</v>

18
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.210
at least you, don't got to worry about them broadcast and the Corona virus,

19
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:55.390
sporting events, like we talked about.

20
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.120
<v 1>Yeah. This is what it says.</v>

21
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:01.980
It says the broadcast performing to patrons in an effort to keep restaurants

22
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:05.700
from becoming overcrowded for sporting events, such as the upcoming super bowl.

23
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.840
First of all, there's no evidence that this virus spreads outside. None.

24
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:13.320
Zero zilch is that you can't find any evidence. There's no studies.

25
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.760
If you look at all the, like,

26
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:18.480
when they have a pie chart of how the virus spreads,

27
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.530
it spreads and supermarkets, it spreads a little bit and you know,

28
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:26.700
various indoor businesses. And you know, there's a very small percentage.

29
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:29.670
You show in restaurants that it's mostly people working in the kitchen that are

30
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:32.310
catching it. You know, they're in tight quarters, working together all the time.

31
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.680
There's no evidence that it spreads outside none.

32
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.010
So this idea about them being overcrowded, there's no evidence.

33
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.510
<v 0>Here's the thing, because I remember before LA shut down,</v>

34
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:47.120
I remember saddle ranch was like pat and stuff and,

35
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.410
but it was outside, but they were like packed. And I was like,

36
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.550
that looks unhealthy to light. That looked like that.

37
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:55.940
Like they're outside, but they're still close together.

38
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.840
<v 1>We couldn't do shows right down the.</v>

39
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.230
<v 0>Street.</v>

40
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.830
And you know why it's because they were about to start doing shows again.

41
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.360
But then somebody caught the health department on the comedy store and then that

42
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.500
shut it down. Why? Because I think it was like a troll.

43
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.410
It was like a troll or somebody who didn't like,

44
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.070
with the comedy store like that. Like, but that's what happened, but what were.

45
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.080
<v 1>They saying? Like what could they say? They got shut.</v>

46
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.950
<v 0>Down. They just said that. Um, all I remember is that they said that it was a,</v>

47
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.550
um, that it was like a health problem and stuff like that. And so they,

48
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.040
so they shut it down. But right when we were about,

49
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.170
they was gonna start letting us perform in a parking lot,

50
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.460
like bring back the best of the comedy store in the parking lot. And um,

51
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.560
I guess somebody got it shut down.

52
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.060
<v 1>That doesn't make.</v>

53
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.080
<v 0>Any sense. That's up.</v>

54
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:43.380
So w did you ever see when we have to perform in the window? Yeah,

55
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.220
I did see that. Yeah, that was that that didn't make any sense. It was hard.

56
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.500
<v 1>No connection, no.</v>

57
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.730
<v 0>Connection with people.</v>

58
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.370
And I tried to beat the window so many times I can never do it.

59
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.180
I saw that I saw about nail beat the window. I was like, ah, he beat the.

60
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.090
<v 1>Window. The window Danelle can be Bulletproof glass.</v>

61
