00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 3>Well, he's a criminal, he's a democratic Trump. He's a criminal. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.480
Who's not funny. Um, and should be in jail. Um, how about that? Huh?

4
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.240
He's threatens calling and threatening people telling them not to journalists.

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.000
Yeah. Calling a threatening people. He's calling other people going, Hey man,

6
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.200
politicians, you know, we're, you know, we don't, we, we act a certain way.

7
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:21.790
I don't know, know what the quote is. Jamie you'll find it.

8
00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:26.070
But he said something to the guy like mafia. Yeah. Well the, the filmar, um, uh,

9
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.350
crystal and Sager covered it today on their, uh, their show. And it's, uh, on,

10
00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:34.190
there's a clip on, on their Instagram page, uh, showing the,

11
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.550
the guy and he's explaining what they said and what Cuomo said to him.

12
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.340
But he basically said, I will destroy you. Yeah. Which is like, they,

13
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.420
they were that's lovely.

14
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.060
<v 0>They said, is that nice? Yeah. They, they said accurately, they're like,</v>

15
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:48.460
this is cartoonish. Yeah. It's cartoon. And they all get caught.

16
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.900
They said thing with Ted Cruz on a plane or this guy doing that, like,

17
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:51.421
you all get caught.

18
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:54.700
It's no longer like the sixties when they could just with impunity,

19
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.860
do whatever they wanted. Well, he's a 70 year old guy,

20
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.900
part of them doing this his whole life. Of course. Yeah.

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.370
But like you get caught now and then they look terrible. Yeah.

22
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.250
When they get caught. Well, that's the least of it. What? He looks terrible.

23
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.370
The reason why he doesn't want them to say things. Yeah.

24
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.610
Is because they lied about the COVID numbers in nursing homes,

25
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.450
the COVID deaths in nursing homes,

26
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:19.370
which are directly attributable to his policies killed. It's crazy.

27
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.440
Literally they lied about 50% percent. Wow. They,

28
00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:27.640
they lied at a 50%. Right. So yeah, whatever the. The number was,

29
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.160
it was 50% off the real number. Wow.

30
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.240
Which is thousands of deaths. So it was a brush shot. Thousands.

31
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.720
Thousands of people died that died. Just think of a pile.

32
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.200
Think of like a show that you and I would do at a nice theater. Sure.

33
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.910
I think of those people just backed up dead. Yeah.

34
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.150
Because of the decision of a politician. Can they get, is, is, is it a, is it a,

35
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.670
because I know that they're trying to recall Newsom.

36
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.230
They're trying to recall him too. They're trying to recall him too. Yeah.

37
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.630
They're, they're gathering the momentum to try to recall him right now. Yeah.

38
00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:59.750
But on top of that, there's also, I don't know if this is true,

39
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.500
but I was reading about the potential FBI. There's a criminal investigation.

40
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.100
Well, there should be. Yeah. Well, his,

41
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.700
one of his aide leaked the fact that they were worried that these numbers were

42
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:14.020
gonna get out and that it was gonna help the Trump administration. So they,

43
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.460
yeah, this is all again, crazy political. It's all crazy. But also I'm a moron.

44
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.900
I don't really know what the I'm talking about. Let's just be really clear.

45
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.450
I'm listening to people like crystal and saga that from the hill from rising.

46
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.130
I actually know what they're talking about and I'm reiterating what they're

47
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.410
saying. Just, just say to that. Well,

48
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:31.570
I know what I'm talking about and Cuomo should go to jail.

49
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.890
What kind here it is us attorney,

50
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.770
FBI investigating Cuomo's handling of nursing home de okay. Now though,

51
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:42.450
this is on NBC. Whenever something gets on NBC, you know,

52
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.680
they're, right? Because is a Democrat, right. When they're covering this on NBC,

53
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.600
they're throwing him on the, the bus. Not only that,

54
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:53.520
they've also barred his brother from ever interviewing him on CNN. Well,

55
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:54.161
yeah, that's, I mean,

56
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.400
that's a dog and pony show the idea that he could even interview his own brother

57
00:02:57.401 --> 00:03:01.480
and toss him softball questions. And Jake Tapper wants to interview him.

58
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.400
I believe is Jake Tapper. I think who's a credible journalist. Right.

59
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.413
And they're like, uh,

60
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.160
he doesn't wanna talk to Jake Tapper because Jake Tapper is gonna hold his feet

61
00:03:10.161 --> 00:03:12.840
to the fire or whoever it is. Remember in the beginning, Cuomo was the star.

62
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.920
Yes. Like Chelsea handler's like, I wanna Cuomo. Like they were all,

63
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.510
he was the star. Imagine he said that Wasnt being him. She said, yeah,

64
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.310
&lt;laugh&gt; with a threat. That's your reward. That's a threat. Uh, but the,

65
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.790
how would she do it too? She'd be on top. Yeah. And she'd punch him. Yeah.

66
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.710
As soon as she came, she'd punch him right in the nose. &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;

67
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.230
he was the star. Everybody loved him in the beginning. And they were like,

68
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.340
he's handling it brilliantly. I thought, so you, I thought so. Yeah,

69
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.300
this is what I thought. I thought he he's calm. And he, he looks like a leader.

70
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.340
I mean, this is like, you know,

71
00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:51.420
you see a man who is handling things in a very calm manner. And,

72
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.700
but as time went on, he started to crack. Right? Yeah.

73
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.380
And you see this with people that respond to pressure and criticism,

74
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.610
it changes their character. And this is what I'm talking about with my friend,

75
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.210
right. Is brilliant guy. Who's dealing with, uh,

76
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.930
social media pressure that just you taking too much criticism.

77
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.530
And it starts to change your perspective, which starts to change your behavior,

78
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.650
which becomes ultimately very detrimental. And you see it with Cuomo.

79
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.770
When he starts saying one of the things that he said about like lockdowns,

80
00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:21.120
he's like, you know, have you done didn't wanna gain weight?

81
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.920
You shouldn't ate the cheesecake. Right? You didn't listen. You didn't listen.

82
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.240
You didn't wear your mask. You didn't social distance. That's not what it is.

83
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:30.440
You idiot. Right. That's not what it is. Right.

84
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:35.000
What it is is this virus is very complicated and it's confusing because it was

85
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:38.480
made in a lab. Probably right. Again, I'm a moron, but yeah,

86
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.990
people that I know that are smart, think it was made in a right.

87
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.390
And they think that what happens is when you enforce lockdowns,

88
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.150
you force people inside and you force people to be right on top of each other

89
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.030
and they breathe each other's air. And that's how people get sick. Right.

90
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.990
And it's more likely that they're gonna get sick that way than if you let them

91
00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.310
do things and just go out in public and just go around and

92
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:01.580
go places and min. Well,

93
00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:04.380
this was also a guy that when New York was descending into a,

94
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.460
a crime infested hell case, he said, I'll everybody come back.

95
00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:10.100
I'll cook for you. I'll cook for you. I'll cook for you. I'll make your sauce.

96
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.380
You make there's people in New York right now,

97
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.300
beating each other with metal bats in the street.

98
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.020
I saw that video to death and the Blasio has people doing a dance routine.

99
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.370
Almost telling people don't make them Sunday sauce. It's a little,

100
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.010
how about that? It's a little disturbing video. I sent you that, right? Yeah.

101
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:29.490
It's absurd. How about how it's crazy. It's one of the crazy,

102
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.890
one of the things rare, rare times I post on Twitter. Yeah.

103
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.810
Rare times I post on Twitter. I posted that and I said, how the is this real?

104
00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:37.770
How is this real? How's this real thing. Yeah.

105
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.010
It's literally a Cohen brother sketch. It's a,

106
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:45.280
it's a scene in the big Lebowski. Yeah. It's absurdist beyond belief. Yeah.

107
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.120
Please play that. Yeah. He has a dance. We're we're gonna bring back culture.

108
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.520
We're gonna bring back the arts.

109
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.640
This is what you say when you've never created a business. Yeah.

110
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.520
This is the kinda that you do. And they're not even good. Play this,

111
00:05:56.521 --> 00:05:59.280
play this I need. They they're horrible. No, but it's not just,

112
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.520

We're gonna really bring back the heart and soul New York city.

115
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.880
We need our arts and culture back and we need people to see it and feel it to

116
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:08.880
participate in it.

117
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.760
To know that that essence of New York city has not been defeated by the

118
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:16.950
coronavirus, but we'll come back strong into that's.

119
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.710

123

124
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:36.430
