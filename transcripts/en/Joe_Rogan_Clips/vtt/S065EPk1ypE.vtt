1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.840
<v 0>I wanna talk to you about activists,</v>

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.480
cuz it's something that you brought up earlier saying that you, you, you know,

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.760
you find them unappealing,

4
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.680
like I wanna know what you think the motivation of,

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.960
uh, a lot of these like particularly radical left-wing activists that wanna shut

6
00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:21.470
down lectures and scream people down and you know, and these, uh, auditoriums,

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.030
what do you think the motivation of these people is? And what do you,

8
00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:27.390
what do you think is the root of it?

9
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.430
<v 1>Well, I think that it's a quick root to moral virtue. You know,</v>

10
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.270
like it's actually really hard to put yourself together and you have to do that

11
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:40.830
in ways that you can't Trump. It, you know,

12
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.980
because most of the things that are wrong with you are kind of low.

13
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.740
What would you call it? Second rate and embarrassing.

14
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.460
You're all your stupid little habits and your proclivity to procrastinate and

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.540
all the things that you're minorly ashamed of.

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.900
And then you have to work on those slowly because you're the probability that

17
00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:01.380
you're gonna be able to fix them quickly is low.

18
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.650
And you can't really brag about it because it's so embarrassing just to admit

19
00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:06.850
that they exist to begin with it.

20
00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:11.810
You can hardly brag about it and it's sort of painstaking private work and you,

21
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.290
you, you, you don't get a lot of social.

22
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.850
You don't get a lot of quick social status for it.

23
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:19.890
It it's effortful embarrassing, humbling, and difficult.

24
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.000
And then you can do thing like being activist and you get all that public

25
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.320
acclaim for being on the good side with no effort whatsoever.

26
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.560
And so it's a plus.

27
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.440
<v 0>Do you think that there's any motivation at all to try to make the world a</v>

28
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:36.280
better place? Yes.

29
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.680
<v 1>I think there's some.</v>

30
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.320
<v 0>You think that's, that's part of it. Sure. Well,</v>

31
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.510
you think it's flavored by this desire to broadcast your

32
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:45.344
virtue?

33
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.230
<v 1>Yes. Because it's very difficult to make the world a better place. You know,</v>

34
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.190
that's the thing is no, I mean,

35
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.590
young people have a messianic impulse.

36
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:58.150
That's another thing that was documented by PJ that, that there's a stage,

37
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.350
you know, and laid adolescents where you wanna make the world a better place.

38
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.340
And I would say that's probably part of the impulse to, you know,

39
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.300
establish a permanent relationship and have a family and, and,

40
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.060
and take care of people, you know, and, and,

41
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:14.820
and to take on some of the burden of life. It's,

42
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.980
it's the psychological precursor to that.

43
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.420
And it's reasonable for smart young people to be concerned about

44
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.050
broader philoso issues if they tilt in that direction as well.

45
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.490
But it's all too easy for that to be pathologized into

46
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.690
resentment for,

47
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.250
for those who seem to have more unfairly and also to take the easy route

48
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.930
out. And there aren't easy route,

49
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.930
there are only difficult route to doing useful things.

50
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.160
And it's better just to do that. And then,

51
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.920
so I think that there's some impulse to, you know,

52
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:56.360
there's some wish that things could be less unfair and that fewer people could

53
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:57.140
suffer,

54
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.480
but it's kind of a low level virtue that that reflects of compassion.

55
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.960
You know, I, I'm not saying it's it's without merit because it's the,

56
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.960
that compassion is the basis for the ability to take care of,

57
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.560
of people who are ill and, and, and infants and.

58
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.040
<v 0>Feel this low level. Like where is that? It's not.</v>

59
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.160
<v 1>Thought through things are complicated. It's hard to,</v>

60
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.830
it's hard to make complicated systems work better, and it's really easy to.

61
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.663
<v 0>Make them work worse.</v>

62
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.070
What about activists that want to shut down certain speakers?

63
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.910
Like someone who's, uh, in my opinion, uh, fairly innocuous,

64
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.310
uh, in, in terms of the, the ne like here's one Christina Hoff summers. I just,

65
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.540
I don't see a good argument for shutting her down. She's so polite.

66
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.780
She's a feminist she's well read. Yeah. She's a, a really nice person. It just.

67
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.900
<v 1>Yeah, Janice FKO is like that too. In the Canada.</v>

68
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.420
<v 0>Same sort of person doesn't make sense that people would shout her down yet.</v>

69
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:54.260
They do. Oh yeah. They, they shout her down. They say horrible things about her.

70
00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:56.700
They mischaracterize her in a,

71
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.850
a really brutal way that it,

72
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.010
it completely invalidates their argument or their opposition to her,

73
00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:06.850
to anyone that's paying attention to what she said, oh.

74
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.970
<v 1>Well, a lot of it who she is,</v>

75
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.890
a lot of it is a lot of it is also just immature acting out. Yes. You know,

76
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:13.650
and there's an arrogance time it's tolerated.

77
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.250
<v 0>In some sort of very strange way. Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.960
<v 1>Yeah. It is. It is. It is. Well, yeah, it, it's,</v>

79
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.800
it's part of our doubt, I suppose,

80
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:26.680
about authority and about its and our,

81
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.880
our willingness to assume that all authority is contaminated by power.

82
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.520
<v 0>It's like it sanctioned heckling too. Yeah. It's almost like, like you,</v>

83
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.920
if you're doing a play, you know, or a musical or you're singing a song,

84
00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:39.560
someone just decides to start screaming out. Well that person's an,

85
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.190
but you're a espousing an opinion. Yeah.

86
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.590
And that person decides to scream out and they,

87
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:47.230
they do so under the guise of moral virtue. Yeah.

88
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.350
<v 1>Yeah. Well unrated, undeserved access to power. Yes.</v>

89
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.311
You know,

90
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:56.270
and it's no wonder that the radical leftists in particular concentrate on power,

91
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:58.590
everything's about power. Well then it's okay.

92
00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:02.540
If they use power as part of their means of expression, it's like, well,

93
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.700
you're just playing power games. It's perfectly reasonable,

94
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:08.900
even appropriate for me to play power games because, you know, I'm,

95
00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:12.340
I oppressed compared to you, if everything's power, then everybody gets to yell.

96
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.620
Right. And there's no,

97
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.540
one of the things I realized about about recently as well is that there

98
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:23.250
isn't a debate about free speech, exact not the way that we think about it,

99
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:26.890
you know, you know, because the there's the classical defensive free speech.

100
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.170
So the classical defensive free speech is that it's better for both of us.

101
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.130
If we're able to exchange our opinions because I have the opportunity to learn

102
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:39.610
from you and you have the opportunity to learn from me and you have the

103
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:43.080
opportunity to learn from your own mistakes and, and social feedback.

104
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.960
And so do I and negotiation beats war. Okay.

105
00:05:47.961 --> 00:05:52.640
So that's kind of the classical now, but that's predicated on some assumptions.

106
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.040
And those are, you are an autonomous being.

107
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.320
You're capable of formulating an opinion that that's actually unique to you.

108
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.960
And that in dialogue,

109
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.400
we can mutually modify each other's unique opinions in a way that produces

110
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.880
a mutually harmonious and beneficial outcome. That's all the predicate. Well,

111
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.880
the, the people who are opposed to free speech, you see,

112
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.390
it's not that they trying to shut down people whose opinions are different than

113
00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:20.224
theirs. Exactly.

114
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.550
It's that they're opposed to the idea that free speech exists.

115
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.870
It's a way deeper problem because at the bottom of the postmodernist mess

116
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.630
is the following assumption. Is that well there's no,

117
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.700
there's no one way of in you're in interacting with the world.

118
00:06:38.701 --> 00:06:40.340
That's preferable to any other way.

119
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.980
And so what people do is organize themselves into hierarchies of power and then

120
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.980
struggle for dominance within the hierarchies.

121
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.220
And then the hierarchies struggle between each other.

122
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.820
So it's a landscape of waring hierarchies. That's all it is.

123
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.340
And you think that you're a person and that you have an opinion, but you're not.

124
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.930
You're just the mouthpiece of your privileged hierarchy.

125
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.770
And so am I. And so, and it's incommensurate.

126
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:09.290
If we're from different hierarchies, there, isn't a, you talking to a,

127
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:10.610
me that could come to an agreement.

128
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.370
There's just you acting as a mouthpiece for your power and me acting as a

129
00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:18.680
mouthpiece for my power. And so since I'm part of my group and wanna win,

130
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:22.080
because it's all about power, then why the hell would I ever want you to talk?

131
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.280
It's not like I have anything to learn from you.

132
00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:26.040
Or even that learning is possible. Or,

133
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.280
or even that there are two people having a discussion.

134
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.880
There's nothing but the mouthpiece of power,

135
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.000
there's two mouth pieces of power worrying. And so that,

136
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:40.870
why should I listen to you? I'll just shut you down cuz then I win. Mm.

137
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:41.870
And so this,

138
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:46.790
this free speech debate isn't about who sh whose opinion should be

139
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:51.070
allowed within, you know, an overarching framework where free speech is,

140
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.363
is a real thing.

141
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.110
It's a debate about whether there's such a thing as free speech at all. The,

142
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.140
the radical postmodernist types deny even that there's such a thing as an

143
00:08:01.141 --> 00:08:04.060
autonomous individual in any way, you're just the,

144
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.100
you're just the nexus of economic forces, economic and social forces.

145
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.540
You're entirely socially constructed. There's no, you,

146
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.180
these are deep criticisms. Like I've,

147
00:08:15.181 --> 00:08:17.580
I've made this case before that the postmodern types,

148
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.810
although they have to ally them cells with the Marxist for,

149
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.530
for reasons that we don't have to go into,

150
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.570
they are going after things that are so fundamental. You can't believe it.

151
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.370
They don't. There is no autonomous individual in the postmodern world.

152
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.171
That's a,

153
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:36.690
that's a modernist or an enlightenment viewpoint that's or a Christian viewpoint

154
00:08:36.691 --> 00:08:38.090
or a Judeo-Christian viewpoint,

155
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.680
or maybe an Abraham real religion viewpoint who the hell knows it might be that,

156
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.640
that, that deep you're the nexus of sociological forces.

157
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.720
There's no integrated self. You don't have ideas or opinions.

158
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.640
And there's no dialogue between us that doesn't exist.

159
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.840
There's your group, your identity, your struggle for power.

160
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.280
And that's all, this is your interpretation of it. No,

161
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:04.680
is this so you have a spouse. No, no, this is,

162
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:07.120
this is the fundamental essence of postmodernism,

163
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:11.400
especially it's especially true in the format espoused by DDA.

164
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.000
And Fuco Fuco, everything's about power.

165
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.390
Every everything's about power and Deda was definitely,

166
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.470
that's why he criticized the idea of logo.

167
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.550
Centrism logos is that ability of the individual to engage in dialogue

168
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.550
lo root for dialogue is logos or logic. That's all criticized.

169
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:32.790
That's all gone. The identity politics players, the serious,

170
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.790
the people who are serious about this philoso,

171
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.660
they don't believe in the idea of the autonomous individual that's gone.

172
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.330
So it's not like they're playing a game within, you know, you think, well,

173
00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:48.810
this is a game. We're all playing a game where we agree on some things. And,

174
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:52.210
and we're just disagreeing about the details. It's like, oh no, no, no, no.

175
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.490
You don't wanna make that mistake. This, this critique is way,

176
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.840
way deeper than that,

177
00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.400
which is why Deda was opposed to the idea of logo centrism.

178
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.760
He didn't believe in the idea of an autonomous individual that didn't exist.

179
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.640
That's just a fiction set up by those who have used the idea of the autonomous

180
00:10:10.641 --> 00:10:15.320
individual to advance their power maneuvering within the

181
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.950
confines of the colonialist, the colonialist west.
