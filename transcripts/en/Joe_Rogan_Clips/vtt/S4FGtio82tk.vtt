00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. Exactly. Boy, it sounds good. Doesn't it? God,</v>

2
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.440
I wanna believe so hard.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.720
<v 1>Well, I, uh, I hope you do because there's gonna be,</v>

4
00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:12.280
there's gonna be a lot of stuff on that. Well, I.

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.080
<v 0>Wanna know what you've seen though. So you've seen this piece of metal.</v>

6
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.960
What else have you seen?

7
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.200
<v 1>I've seen, uh, many, many documents on the,</v>

8
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.750
of these things and, um, I've seen, uh,

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.550
a lot of the science associated with what the technology is and what it does.

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.790
Like, uh, I could show you if I fold up pieces of paper and stuff,

11
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:38.110
what's going on with it, but basically, uh, you know, these craft,

12
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.860
you know, when you, when you tr they in a straight line,

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.060
but they're folding space time, like in.

14
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.943
<v 0>Event horizon,</v>

15
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.940
where they explain it by folding a piece of paper and punching a pencil through

16
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:49.660
it. Do you ever see that movie? Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like that.

17
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.180
<v 1>Movie, but it's more like, um, you know, here I can draw it for you here.</v>

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.380
Not that this is a, it's kind of like when you have two points, um,

19
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.770
you know, we're used to traveling in a direction like that.

20
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.170
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and so when we look up, we see a plane that goes straight,

21
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.970
right. But these, these UFOs, uh, fold space,

22
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.810
time like this. Uh, and so it looks like to them,

23
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.570
they're going in a straight line. So if you're in the ship,

24
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.930
you see that mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. But if you're on the ground, you see that.

25
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.160
Oh, okay. That's why you see them blink off. And on a lot of those videos,

26
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.600
they're on, they looks like they're jumping. It's just because of this.

27
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.040
So folding space.

28
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.880
<v 0>Time, some way of interfacing with space itself,</v>

29
00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:37.160
that's very different than our idea of traveling in a linear way.

30
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:38.680
From point a to point B space.

31
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.240
<v 1>The fabric, they call it the fabric of space time,</v>

32
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:43.430
because it's like a fabric gets malleable.

33
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.710
<v 0>Now let me ask you this. How often into a conversation,</v>

34
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:50.110
do people look at you and think you are crazy when you start talking about this

35
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.110
and how the time? Yeah. All the time. Right.

36
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.510
But do you ever get to the point where you're like,

37
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.310
I don't wanna talk about this? No, because.

38
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.270
<v 1>It's, it's you, I always tell you don't know what I know. You know?</v>

39
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:00.750
And there's a lot. I, no, no, no. I mean.

40
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.990
<v 0>Like, do you ever get to the point where you're like, I can't do this anymore?</v>

41
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.580
No people think I'm crazy.

42
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.540
<v 1>No, because I'm involved on the most important I've ever been in my life.</v>

43
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.100
<v 0>Do you think this is like the most important thing that you've ever done in your</v>

44
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:11.500
life? Oh.

45
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.540
<v 1>Yeah. Like I, I have meetings with senators coming up, like, do you, oh. Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.820
What senators? I can't tell you.

47
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.060
<v 0>Is all this. I can't tell you stuff. I.</v>

48
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.893
<v 1>Know because this is some.</v>

49
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.180
<v 0>Tricky is. When is all this gonna come out? Like, it seems like this is like,</v>

50
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.770
uh, ENT eminent, rather disclosure type. Right.

51
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.570
<v 1>Watch what my company does. That's what I'll.</v>

52
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.450
<v 0>Say. So what is your company like? What do you, what are you trying to do? Well.</v>

53
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.290
<v 1>We create it. So if you look at the people involved, uh,</v>

54
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.810
we have senior high. When you get to the senior levels of government,

55
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:41.530
you're either called an SES or SIS, senior intelligence service,

56
00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:45.000
senior executive service, or you're bra, but either way,

57
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:49.120
the civilians have the same kind of ranking charter that, that the bras does.

58
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:53.280
So a SES three SAS three, three would be the same thing as a three star general.

59
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.560
So I that's that's who these people are around me.

60
00:02:56.561 --> 00:03:00.000
So I had the head of the skunk works engineering. Um, I got, you know,

61
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.080
SIS two star from the clandestine directorate of operations. I have a guy,

62
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.880
uh, under secretary of intelligence for the Senate intelligence committee.

63
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.280
<v 0>And was these guys are retired. The quasi retired, quasi retired qua. Well,</v>

64
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:16.840
they all, they all left. They are, are current public life.

65
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.910
They now are of what you're doing the.

66
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.790
<v 1>Way they are current consultants to the interna, uh, the intelligence community.</v>

67
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.230
Okay. That's uh.

68
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.390
<v 0>Probably the most and involved in this project with clearance.</v>

69
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.990
<v 1>They, they all have their top secret S Ts S C I clearances. Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.350
I'm the only one that does it on my entire team. I'm the only one that does it.

71
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.460
Actually, Lou, that just came out. I hire him away. So he was head of all.

72
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.620
Uh, God, I can't. He was in charge of all classified,

73
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.180
uh, operations for secretary of defense, Matt. So he was,

74
00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:54.860
what's called a GS 15, right underneath the one, two and three stars.

75
00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.370
He ran the advanced aerial thought program and it still continuing to this day

76
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.250
and he's with us now. So.

77
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.610
<v 0>The advanced aerial threat program under the United States government is</v>

78
00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:07.130
essentially a UFO.

79
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.890
That's one of the many information gathering and assessment assessment of.

80
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.383
<v 1>All of the,</v>

81
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.130
of what those machines are doing that gives off all these types of

82
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.600
effects that people are witnessing.

83
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.120
But there's also a very large group of people that have had within government

84
00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:30.160
that have had close contact, like hundreds, and it's connected to my group.

85
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.760
And there's just more coming in that way. So that,

86
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:37.360
that program is trying to figure out what those technologies did

87
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.510
to those people and how those technologies work.

88
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.150
Even though, and it's more satellite, it's more about tasking, you know,

89
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.630
our assets like satellites and other things,

90
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.270
to be able to find these things better. But, um,

91
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.830
this is different than the secret machines book,

92
00:04:55.831 --> 00:04:57.830
which is more of another thing.

93
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.290
<v 0>Together.</v>

94
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.940
So is there communication between the United States government in alien life

95
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.823
forms?

96
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.420
<v 1>I, I personally, I mean, I don't know any of this stuff, uh,</v>

97
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.860
cuz I'm not invited to those types of meetings, but I personally, uh,

98
00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:10.340
wouldn't doubt.

99
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.660
<v 0>It. Yeah. You wouldn't doubt it,</v>

100
00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:15.060
but they've never alluded to it or discussed it with you in any way.

101
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.020
<v 1>Not the, not this.</v>

102
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.260
<v 0>Group of people. No. Is there any speculation as to what they're doing?</v>

103
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.333
<v 1>Resource extraction.</v>

104
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.410
<v 0>Resource extraction, like our like minerals empire.</v>

105
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.810
<v 1>I tell people the, no, I, I think it's geez. I think it's tacos.</v>

106
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.890
&lt;laugh&gt; they're here water. I think, you know,

107
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:34.170
they're here for the same reason I am, but uh, um,

108
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.130
I tell people like a good way to look at this is like,

109
00:05:37.131 --> 00:05:42.010
look at Syria and Syria's and chaos because the United States and Russia are how

110
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.680
having a proxy war there. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; now look at the earth.

111
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.760
It's the exact same thing. Different races are coming here. And uh,

112
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.600
and they're trying to win and against there's than.

113
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.440
<v 0>One. Yeah.</v>

114
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.360
<v 1>Yeah. Many different ones universe we're talking about.</v>

115
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.780
<v 0>I don't,</v>

116
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.120
but there's a bunch of different creatures and they all have the same sort of

117
00:05:58.121 --> 00:05:58.720
technology. Yeah.

118
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.680
<v 1>And some are very human. Some are looked just like you and I really, absolutely.</v>

119
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.543
Yeah.

120
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.860
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

121
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.160
Now is there any sort of speculation as to why life forms from other planets,

122
00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:11.720
other galaxies, other solar systems, different kind of gravity,

123
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:16.080
different environments would create life form that's exactly similar to us or

124
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.570
are,

125
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.510
are they imitating what we look like in order to infiltrate our world and hang

126
00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:22.470
with us? I think.

127
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.310
<v 1>Probably all of unknowingly. I think all the above. I mean, look,</v>

128
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.150
if you look at, if you look at like Syria,

129
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.310
are you just gonna say it's only Russia and America there? No,

130
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:33.390
China's probably there. France is probably there. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

131
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.790
you know, um, I, I personally think the little,

132
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.260
the little aliens with the big black eyes, those are Androids,

133
00:06:40.261 --> 00:06:42.700
they're biological robots. They're just programmed.

134
00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:44.620
There's no different than us cloning sheep.

135
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.780
They just clone a being that can travel through space. Cuz.

136
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.020
<v 0>Space is or some sort of an artificial intelligence thing that doesn't have a</v>

137
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:52.300
life form. Right? Yeah.

138
00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:56.180
I've heard that idea before and it kind of kind of makes sense a little bit,

139
00:06:56.181 --> 00:07:00.770
right? I mean, if, if you are a living thing and you're traveling through space,

140
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:05.210
obviously you have biological limitations in terms of the need for oxygen and

141
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.250
gravitational interactions and all these different things that, well,

142
00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:10.084
one of the scary.

143
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.970
<v 1>Hallmarks of those ones, the,</v>

144
00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:14.090
the rumor is it in the back of their head as a transmitter.

145
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.890
So you gotta wonder where it's sending it, but at the same time, you know,

146
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.080
I can tell you that when you look at the Bible, uh,

147
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.560
the angels and the demons of the Bible would be the humans and the Androids that

148
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.120
I just told you about. So.

149
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.880
<v 0>You think the grays of the Androids, right?</v>

150
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.800
And so you think they're like some sort of devil? No. I just.

151
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.000
<v 1>Think that that's how we characterized it because they come in control your</v>

152
00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:37.600
thoughts, control your body. Take you, take us.

153
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.630
<v 0>In the middle of the night. Yeah, yeah. Demons, you know? Um,</v>

154
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.510
so do you think these things are traveling from where do we have any idea?

155
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.270
There's.

156
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.270
<v 1>Things that have been put out there, but I've never asked. Why.</v>

there's a very advanced group that left after a catastrophe and hung around in a

small outpost here and, and throughout time would push civilization forward.

And that's who the Greek gods were. Whoa. Yep.

171
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.850
And that's why it's very interesting.

172
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:37.130

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.800

<v 1>Wreck Roswell. I beam you'll see it. And uh,</v>

178
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.760
and it's got these Greek markings as far. And the witnesses that were there did,

179
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.160
um, did, uh, what do they call it? Uh, where they go on, uh,

180
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.400
on oath. Tell so that actual I beam showing the word

181
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.720
&lt;inaudible&gt;, which means freedom in ancient Greek.

182
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.110
So where is that from? Jamie? Let me tell you when know, I don't know.

183
00:09:15.111 --> 00:09:17.910
It popped up when it, when, well I'm gonna tell you something else.

184
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.950
So I went and met, um,

185
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.830
a former director of CIA and NSA. He was director of both.

186
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.710
I won't tell you his name and right when I sat down and told him about my book,

187
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.510
pull that picture up again, look those little hands.

188
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.270
And right when I sat down and told him about my, you gotta, this is a big deal.

189
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.500
I'm so I'm sitting with this guy. He was like,

190
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.860
not that long ago was director of CIA. And he went on to be director of NSA.

191
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.220
Okay. Okay. Well I think we can find his name maybe, but, uh,

192
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.260
right when I sat down and told him about the book,

193
00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:50.180
you know what he says to me what he goes,

194
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.780
I didn't read much science fiction as a kid,

195
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:55.300
but I read a lot about Greek mythology and looked me in the eye. I said, well,

196
00:09:55.301 --> 00:09:59.810
you're gonna, I love the last page of my book, then he's all am I? And uh, um,

197
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.690
when my book was about ready to go to pressing,

198
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.210
I had a very important person call me up. He says,

199
00:10:05.211 --> 00:10:09.170
can you stop that pressing and maybe insert something about Greek mythology?

200
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.090
And I said, I sure can.

201
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.330
So what something you gotta realize is for example,

202
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.160
the sixth against defense contractor in the world,

203
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.480
at least there used to be six is a company called science applications,

204
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:25.120
international corporation S AIC, their headquarters are actually in San Diego.

205
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.400
And in the front of the building, you have a, um,

206
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.320
an ABL coming out of a fake lake and two, um,

207
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.280
Atlantian on Thrones. And they're both holding pyramids.

208
00:10:36.281 --> 00:10:39.990
And one says the past and one says the future it's in their eight foot tall

209
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.590
statues. It's nuts. By the way, in S AIC,

210
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.190
they just, they went over. Toledos Michael Hayden,

211
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:51.110
former director of NSA in the CIA. What about it? No, that's not him,

212
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.030
but I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna tell you if you try and find out,

213
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.900

214
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.900
