00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.600
<v 1>Experience. Ranch, Hawk, wasps they're.</v>

3
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.240
<v 0>They're big that Mayer sent me.</v>

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.240
<v 1>So this is one of the, there's a guy who made a scale, right?</v>

5
00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:14.080
And he got stung by all the different insects. And this is I think, five,

6
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.480
there's also a five plus they're very hard to get you to sting them.

7
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:20.400
There's a guy who online goes through and gets the all stung,

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.030
but the reason they're so dangerous or, or so venous,

9
00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:28.590
what they do is they sting the tarantula, lay their eggs inside the tarantula,

10
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.190
and then tarantula is eaten alive by the offspring for weeks. Right.

11
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.430
And then when this was discovered, this kind of stuff in the middle ages,

12
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:39.430
they were like, this is a big theological dilemma because God,

13
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.790
why would God make this happen?

14
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.900
<v 0>&lt;Affirmative&gt; yeah. Why would God do.</v>

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.660
<v 1>That? Nature is, I mean, I could go down this rabbit hole for hours,</v>

16
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.553
please do.

17
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.740
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, have you've seen that gigantic flower that they found that smells.</v>

18
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.180
<v 1>So one of the, uh,</v>

19
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.060
one of the cousins to that flower is called something in Fanta CIDA.

20
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.090
So the insane thing about that flower, rap's the largest flower in the world.

21
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.050
It only lasts two weeks. Yeah. But the plant it's a parasite. Right?

22
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.850
So the plant that it comes from has no stems, roots or leaves. Yeah.

23
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.530
So you can't keep it on display cuz it is entirely inside another, uh,

24
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:16.490
species of vine.

25
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.690
<v 0>Yeah. It's completely parasitic, right? Yeah. Just,</v>

26
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:20.450
it just sits there and it's huge. Look.

27
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.760
<v 1>At that thing. Yeah. And they smell it. They smell, they call corpse flowers.</v>

28
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.760
Cuz they smell like a rot flesh too. Oh weird.

29
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.000
And they don't know why it's so big.

30
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.960
<v 0>Guess to trap rats. That's what I.</v>

31
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.640
<v 1>Would imagine. No, it does. It's it's not carnivorous.</v>

32
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:33.040
It's the flower get sneaky.

33
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.840
<v 0>Yeah. They're adapting bro. That's what its &lt;laugh&gt; they get ready to eat.</v>

34
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:41.000
People look how big they are. They're gorgeous. They're beautiful. Oh wow.

35
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:44.310
Look at that one where the guy's got hand on it before it blooms. Yeah.

36
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.630
So that's what it looks like sitting on the ground and then it pops open.

37
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.190
That's some avatar right.

38
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.070
<v 1>There. So I have something from the island of ATRA, which is in archipelago,</v>

39
00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:58.790
near the coast of Yemen called Dandra D U V a L I N

40
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.620
D R a and their flowers look and smell like meat.

41
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.180
Whoa, because you wanna attract flies and the hotter it gets in the house,

42
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.500
the more the flower smells. Ooh. It's really cool when you get it to bloom.

43
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.260
So it's actually.

44
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.860
<v 0>Heat activated just like rotten food would be. Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.700
<v 1>Whoa, its a trick. The flies cuz flies are gonna be attracted. There it is.</v>

46
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.700
That is bananas there. Number seven. That one just right there. Jamie,

47
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.850
you see that in this, this second, the third one on the left there that's it.

48
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.290
You can look at the texture. Wow. And it even has hairs to replicate a wound.

49
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.250
<v 0>It looks like a blown out but hole. Yeah. But from an alien.</v>

50
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.490
Oh there is a little, little.in.

51
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.930
<v 1>There. Oh there is a butt hole that smells like.</v>

52
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.480
If you look up white Sloan white S L O a N E a,

53
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.280
it smells like an and has hairs that R in the wind. Oh geez.

54
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.120
And it's it to replicate an to um, oh, sorry. What was that again? Uh,

55
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.160
w H I T E S L O a N E a white Sloany I named after

56
00:02:59.161 --> 00:03:02.920
white and Sloan is from Somalia. Oh my yeah. Look at those flowers.

57
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.160
<v 0>Oh God. How weird? Just the,</v>

58
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.120
the sheer variety. And that smells like a, about hole and has hair on it.

59
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.840
<v 1>Yeah. And the hair moves. My friend calls it God's mistakes.</v>

60
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.470
<v 0>But with the sheer variety of nature is so weird. Isn't it great. I mean,</v>

61
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.430
we're just, I mean,

62
00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:26.710
that's not unusual if an not unusual and every animal has an.

63
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.430
Why is it unusual to have a plant that looks like an and.

64
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.110
<v 1>We have the expression. You, you attract more flies with how you InVigor,</v>

65
00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:34.990
but it's, it's almost like, like a pig to. A fly to.

66
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.430
You're gonna have flowers that smell like. Yes. And there's a lot of them.

67
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:42.660
There's a whole family of them and they're gorgeous. Yeah. They smell.

68
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.060
And when they pop open, they fart.

69
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:48.660
It's like a fart cuz it's contained and then it pops open. Oh.

70
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.900
<v 0>So like the gas has come out of it when it pops open. Yeah. It releases a dose.</v>

71
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.540
Yeah.

72
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.260
<v 1>Look up. Uh, the biggest one, sta S T a P E L I a.</v>

73
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.490
<v 0>Are there any plants that have the same effect on people that</v>

74
00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:05.250
like, um, you know that one, well not, it's not even a plant actually.

75
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:08.170
It's a fungus. So there's one branch of the Corti.

76
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:11.610
He mushroom that infects ants and gets I'll explode. Explode. Yeah.

77
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.130
So that they spray the spores everywhere. They die. It grows inside of them.

78
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.970
Then literally explodes out into the air. So the spores will infect other ants.

79
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.680
So when ants find out that one of their members has been infected,

80
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.800
they'll take that ant way out of the community.

81
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.360
Like way they'll take 'em on a walk. Yeah. Cuz they know somehow or another,

82
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:32.680
that this thing's gonna blow up on all their family.

83
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.361
<v 1>They took,</v>

84
00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:37.120
they had down footage of this and literally like the mushroom grows out of the

85
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.600
T's head and then it pops out.

86
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.630
It's there's a lot of things that they're learning now about nature controlling

87
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.110
the minds of other beings,

88
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:49.070
which is really a recent kind of discovery and really like.

89
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.070
<v 0>Fox news. &lt;laugh&gt; right.</v>

90
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.750
<v 1>Yeah. Fox news. Am I right? &lt;laugh&gt; that's more like phone news.</v>

91
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.620
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; am I right? You, yeah. That,</v>

92
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.860
that sort of um, parasitic relationship. We,

93
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.620
one of my favorite ones ever was the, um,

94
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.820
the grasshopper that gets infected by this aquatic worm,

95
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.100
the aquatic worm gets it to commit suicide so that it can give birth to this

96
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.840
worm.

97
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.980
It literally gets into the wiring of the Grasshopper's brain and convinces it to

98
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:18.820
jump into a puddle.

99
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.010
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; what about the Laos that eats fish's tongue. Oh yeah.</v>

100
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.570
And then becomes a functional tongue and.

101
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.850
<v 0>Becomes the tongue. Yeah.</v>

102
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.130
<v 1>So there's, there's a lot of this, this kind of crazy stuff. I,</v>

103
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.010
my understanding is the majority of species are actually paralytic. Really?

104
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.530
Yeah. There's cuz it's so much easier to be a parasite. You latch on,

105
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.730
you're getting nutrition.

106
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.690
You don't gotta do anything and you don't have to hunt.

107
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.010
You don't have to graze and you're just set you.

108
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.200
<v 0>Well, that's also just obviously parasitic, if you wanna think about it,</v>

109
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.640
most organisms are semi parasitic in that we need other organisms in order to

110
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:54.400
survive. You know like if you're a farmer, I don't wanna say you're a parasite.

111
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:56.200
If you're a beef farmer, there's a headline.

112
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.120
<v 1>Beef farmers are parasites says Joe Rogan.</v>

113
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.200
<v 0>2020 Is gonna be kinda living off that organism.</v>

114
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.000
<v 1>Well, right. Yeah. And,</v>

115
00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:07.200
but the other thing is if every species has several parasites,

116
00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:09.120
then how many we have lice and oh yeah. Mights.

117
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.160
It makes sense that the majority are gonna be parasite.

118
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.600
<v 0>Even at the micro level, you get down to our gut. Oh yeah. All the,</v>

119
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.830
the different bacteria that's on your skin in, I mean we're filled with.

120
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.790
<v 1>Stuff. Yeah. It's, it's really fascinating how clever,</v>

121
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.470
uh, many of these organisms are. Yeah.

122
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.350
<v 0>It's a trip. It's a weird thing to be a person. My friend &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

123
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.510
<v 1>I wouldn't know. No, I'm kidding. Yeah. Yeah. I agree.</v>

124
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.700
It's it's but it's just also weird how we're finding out things that are crazier

125
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.100
and crazier.

126
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:42.460
Like right now they're doing a lot of deep sea exploration and the things at the

127
00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:46.380
bottom of the ocean are just like, what is this? You saw that deep Staria thing.

128
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.140
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the, the jellyfish that looks like a lava lamp. Yes.

129
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.113
So it's just like.

130
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.380
<v 0>What is this? Yeah. Pull.</v>

131
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.260
<v 1>Pull up that thing. Yeah. Deep Staria.</v>

132
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.740
<v 0>Yeah. There's a, that's a,</v>

133
00:06:55.741 --> 00:06:58.210
that's one of the more amazing things about the bottom. The ocean, right.

134
00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:00.010
Is a bioluminescence. We see these. Oh yeah.

135
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.050
These creatures that have a light source, they give off.

136
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.050
<v 1>Lights. Well, there's also,</v>

137
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.770
dragonfish use a red light source because red doesn't show off show up for

138
00:07:08.771 --> 00:07:12.050
others so they can see with it. But no one else can it's like night vision. Oh,

139
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.770
oh yeah. This is the one that's so crazy. You saw this. Yeah.

140
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.480
This is just amazing. Oh, it's so cool. And that's so pretty.

141
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.360
And what's amazing is how they're freaking out. The scientists are watching it.

142
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:25.840
They're like, what is going on? Oh, I love this thing. Look at that thing.

143
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.720
And it's also has a parasite on it or a symbiotic relationship.

144
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:29.800
There's a Copa pod living.

145
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.680
<v 0>Inside resident. Isopod yeah. Is that what that is? Yeah. Look.</v>

146
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.240
<v 1>How pretty that is now this thing has never seen light for millions of years.</v>

147
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.790
It's the bottom, the sea. So the fact that it knows how to react is,

148
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.270
or is having a reaction is, is, uh, um, uh, pretty.

149
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.550
<v 0>Cool. Just the fact that that's a real thing that exists.</v>

150
00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:50.030
If we found that on a planet somewhere, we would freak out.

151
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:53.390
This is the overlord. This is the over mind of the planet.

152
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.270
And it's in a gelatinous form and it communicates to you with vibrations.

153
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.780
<v 1>This is why, um, my autism wouldn't let me watch star Trek as a kid. Oh.</v>

154
00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:05.140
Because I knew about all this stuff and then I'm watching star Trek and they're

155
00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:07.940
going to another planet. It's like a guy with a blue face and I'm just like,

156
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.820
this makes, this is stupid. It's just a guy. It's just a guy.

157
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:12.060
Whereas look at earth, look at.

158
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.660
<v 0>This. Right. Look at an octopus. Yeah. Look at the,</v>

159
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.900
you seeing the video of the octopus taking out the Seagul. Oh yeah. What about.

160
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.733
<v 1>The blanket octopus.</v>

161
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.410
<v 0>Interest thing though? Is they saved an Eagle.</v>

162
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.490
An octopus took out an Eagle in Vancouver Eagle, an Eagle. Yes.

163
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.490
An Eagle and the fishermen pulled it ashore and removed the octopus from

164
00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:34.970
the noble Eagle, but a sea Eagle. They were like, yeah, sorry. That's a wrap.

165
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:35.250
Well.

166
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.930
<v 1>They're nasty. They're thieves. Well, they are.</v>

167
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:37.850
<v 0>Thieves. But I think that, ah.</v>

168
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.823
<v 1>And they smell.</v>

169
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:39.930
<v 0>Eagles are thieves too.</v>

170
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.040
We're talking about a company that has raised organic chickens that lost

171
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.800
2.2 million in chickens to Eagles. &lt;laugh&gt; wow.

172
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:51.880
They killed 160,000 Eagles or excuse me,

173
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.080
the Eagles killed 160,000 chickens. Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. So here it is.

174
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.760
The octopus caught a bald Eagle Eagle.

175
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.280
<v 1>Why does that octopus hate America?</v>

176
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.040
<v 0>Well, he doesn't he's in Canada. Huh?</v>

177
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.680
Bald Eagles live in Canada to their expats.

178
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.960
They go over there to party and to have sex with underage Eagles.

179
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:09.760
They were draft Dodgers. Yeah. For sure. Bald Eagle.

180
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.880
There's no rules up there in that wild land to the north. But look at that.

181
00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:17.710
They decided to save the thing. Isn't that weird? Oh my God. Wow.

182
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.750
If you're gonna save it, I think you should eat the octopus too. Cause you win.

183
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.950
Yeah. The Chara made the octopus could have been as large as 4.5 feet. Good.

184
00:09:24.951 --> 00:09:27.510
Everybody gets to eat. Yeah. That's thats a lot. Don't let it go.

185
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.310
Don't let it go. There's plenty of them. Things Jack, that get lunch and.

186
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.910
<v 1>It's only got a year long lifespan anyway. Does it? Oh yeah.</v>

187
00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:34.790
You know the octopus lifecycle.

188
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.340
<v 0>That big. Yeah. Yeah. He only lives a year. Yeah.</v>

189
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.220
Oh I definitely would've eaten it then. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. With zero remorse. Zero.

190
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.220
I would've been zero remorseful. If I found it only lived a year, I'm like,

191
00:09:45.221 --> 00:09:46.660
look at him. He's gotta be 11 and a half months.

192
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.980
<v 1>And they, they don't really feel pain. They can cannibalize themselves.</v>

193
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.500
<v 0>Well they let their arms go. When the female octopus tries to eat them. Yeah.</v>

194
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:55.970
Yeah. Female octopus is, this is one of my favorite parts out the,

195
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.823
the animal kingdom.

196
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.330
They pretend sometimes that they wanna have sex with a male octopus.

197
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:01.850
Then they just Jack 'em and eat 'em.

198
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.490
<v 1>What about the cuddle fish? Where they pretend to be females so they can, oh.</v>

199
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.610
<v 0>Get laid. Yeah. They're like beta males that are male feminists. Yeah.</v>

200
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.690
They pretend to be something that they they're female.

201
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.370
They pretend to be female. And then they.

202
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.450
<v 1>The females. Females.</v>

203
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:14.770
<v 0>Not looking.</v>

204
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.360
They have female mannerisms and characteristics just like these beta males.

205
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.120
And they sneak up next to 'em as an ally. It's like give their.

206
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.720
<v 1>Rocks off. It's like every Washington post reporter in.</v>

207
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.800
<v 0>In mal form. You said that not.</v>

208
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.600
<v 1>Me. Well, you're the one who said that farmers.</v>

209
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.560
<v 0>Are parasites, but you do have a, a, you have an excuse cuz you claimed autism,</v>

210
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.240
which is a good move &lt;laugh&gt;
