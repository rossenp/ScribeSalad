00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So she tells her story about getting sent home and,</v>

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.690
you know, eventually getting the ACLU to represent her and, um, you know,

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:12.000
becoming what he is, which is this kind of great,

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.150
this great symbol and also voice for free speech.

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.360
And the students take it in and they say, look, you know, Ms. Tinker,

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.100
you were fighting the good fight, right? You were fighting the war in Vietnam,

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.790
this Milo Yiannopoulos clown,

8
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:31.440
like this Ann Coulter jokester like this Ben Shapiro hoaxer

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.820
they just hurt people. Why should we allow them to speak?

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.980
And she had a very, I think, important and pointed response. She said, listen,

11
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.870
at my middle school,

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.570
there were kids who had fathers and brothers and uncles, they were fighting.

13
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:51.120
And some of them died in Southeast Asia.

14
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.610
You don't think they were hurt by the snot-nosed kid

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.260
wearing this symbol,

16
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:02.520
saying that their loved one was risking their life for a lie.

17
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.910
Like you don't think that hurt them. Like, if that's what you think, like,

18
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:08.760
you're not thinking like, of course it hurt them.

19
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.050
So once that becomes like your, you know, your barometer,

20
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:17.430
your measure of what's going to be allowed as speech, forget Mary Beth tinker,

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.440
you know, um, forget anything because words do hurt. Right.

22
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.270
That in part was the point, right? That was the point of the symbol. Right?

23
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.591
Um, again,

24
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:32.070
I'm not saying that Mary Beth intended to hurt anybody because I can assure you

25
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:36.510
that he didn't. But what I'm saying is it effectively hurt people, right?

26
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.560
Because speech, especially challenging speech does. And the students like take,

27
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.190
they took this in and they said, look, you know, free speech.

28
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.760
It's just about who has power and who doesn't, you know,

29
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.290
and the people with power,

30
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.560
they love to talk about free speech because they've got power.

31
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.330
And Mary Beth tinker is like, hold on, wait a minute. I was a 13 year old girl.

32
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.810
Speech was the only power I have.

33
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.280
And that's really our point here, right? Is that, you know,

34
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.750
when you store to restrict it in whatever way, formally and informally,

35
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.630
right. Even with the best of intentions,

36
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.060
it's people without power, ultimately that are going to suffer. You know,

37
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.050
it's people at the bottom they're going to get hurt. Right. Um,

38
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.910
because they need speak more than anybody else before the 1960

39
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:30.630
students had no speech rights that th that the courts of the constitution was

40
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.120
willing to recognize. So, you know,

41
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.540
if a student said something in school that the teacher didn't like,

42
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.360
they could just send them home, you know? Um,

43
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.160
and it's because of Mary Beth tinker and the other kids who protested that

44
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.930
now it's not like that. Right.

45
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:49.110
And of course we can debate the degree to which this should be allowed.

46
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:53.580
And should you be able to wear a Confederate flag on your t-shirt or, you know,

47
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:57.000
an anti-abortion symbol, and these are all important things to talk about.

48
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.770
But even the reason we're talking about them is because Beth thinker,

49
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:00.910
who was 13,

50
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.590
who had no power other than her speech stood up for her speech,

51
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.150
even though yes, it hurt people, right. Because speech does that.

52
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.480
Um, uh, but at the end of the day, you know,

53
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:17.320
that's really the message that I want our young people to get. Right.

54
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.390
Is that the real reason?

55
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:23.740
I think we need to hold on to free speech is we live

56
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.280
in an unequal society. Like all societies are,

57
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.270
and we live in a society with all sorts of unfairness,

58
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.110
all sorts of injustice, like all societies have. All right.

59
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.640
And if you want to do anything about that, you gotta let everyone talk.

60
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.130
That's the only way,

61
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.230
the only way to make anything better to write anything wrong to

62
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:51.490
write any role is to maintain our free speech.
