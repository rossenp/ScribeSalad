00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.230
<v 2>I can start releasing from my archives. Even like pastoral hands performances.</v>

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.910
You could hear Jeff Scott laughing in the corner and stuff. Jeff's so sad. Yeah.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.080
I miss him. I miss him.

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.020
<v 0>Too. I miss him so much. That made me so sad. And.</v>

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.460
<v 1>It hit me coming by surprise because you don't realize you've been,</v>

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.240
this is,

8
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.170
this person has been a part of your life for so long because you just seem like

9
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:26.520
you're doing a set at the comedy store.

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.530
<v 0>I have a different situation because I've been with Jeff since 94, 94, 95,</v>

11
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.080
I think he came around and then, you know, we were,

12
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.860
I hadn't seen him for so long. And then, um,

13
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.090
when I came back to the store and in 2014,

14
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:47.010
he was like one of the first people I saw. And, uh,

15
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.170
he had, he was just always there,

16
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.970
man. He was, he was always a sweet guy, always hugging everybody.

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.500
When I found out he died. One of the first things I felt like is like,

18
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.290
I don't think he would have died if it wasn't for this pandemic.

19
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.013
I felt like.

20
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.640
<v 1>I think it hit a lot of us that way.</v>

21
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.820
<v 0>Too, he was such a part of the store. He was the,</v>

22
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.100
one of the biggest parts as to, without being a comic,

23
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.800
without being a guy who actually got on stage,

24
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.630
he was one of the biggest parts of the store.

25
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.160
And that felt like 10 months of him having no

26
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:30.240
connection. You know, that was everything. He was there every night, man. Yeah.

27
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.240
I hugged that guy. Every time I saw him.

28
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.950
<v 1>He, he was like a performer without being a performer.</v>

29
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.600
Like obviously he did the piano,

30
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.890
but he had such great comedy instincts having done performing in his past and

31
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:48.150
such. Cause you've been the clubs before and they're sound guys and they're.

32
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.170
<v 0>Like, yeah, they're.</v>

33
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.040
<v 1>Not really, they're not, but this guy, he was like jazz man. Like, yeah.</v>

34
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.970
<v 0>He was, he was a.</v>

35
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.200
<v 1>Performer. He was a performer.</v>

36
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.450
There've been times when I was doing Lance or whatever.

37
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.130
And he would just like turn on a certain song and it was never disruptive.

38
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:03.780
It was always additive.

39
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.350
And to think about not having that,

40
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.190
when we go back and for it to happen during all of this,

41
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.540
to where you can't even like properly process, what, what, there was a zoom,

42
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:19.560
there was a zoom room where people could pop in and kind of like talk about Jeff

43
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:22.890
and have all these Jess stories. And like I had to hop in there and it was,

44
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.070
it was so many people. There's so many great comics, big comics too.

45
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.050
Like the zoom room was like a hundred people. Just, it was,

46
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.970
it was great to at least have that.

47
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.840
So it sucked to have something that seismic happen in a vacuum.

48
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.480
<v 0>It was a ritual that I would do not a ritual,</v>

49
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:42.990
just like a thing that I would always do pull into the parking lot,

50
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.220
say hi to everybody,

51
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:47.220
hug all the people that I saw and go to the back smoking area.

52
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:52.050
And I'd always find Jeff Scott getting high. Always I get high with him.

53
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.650
I give him a big hug and I go, how much, how many more people for I go on?

54
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.270
And he'd be like, well, you know,

55
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.670
Jeff Ross is on stage now you've got like two more people and then you, I go,

56
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:03.790
okay. And then, then I would go. He was like, he was,

57
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.720
he was a part of the foundation. He was, he was,

58
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.940
he was so important, man, when he was gone, I was like, oh Mike, no,

59
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.400
he heard as much as Brody. It hurt. And it hurt as much as anybody.

60
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.040
<v 1>And it creeps up on you.</v>

61
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:23.680
You don't realize every set that I've done at the comedy store. He's,

62
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.630
he's been a part of. And what I loved about Jeff is he,

63
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.040
he was willing to play and play is such a big part.

64
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:33.701
Somebody stand up,

65
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:37.390
you could be so self serious and think that you're changing the world.

66
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.750
And there is that, but sometimes it's fun to just have fun.

67
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.610
And I would get these harebrained ideas of like, oh, here's a music cue.

68
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.480
Let's do this.

69
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.670
And he would be chomping at the bit because most comics just play up, play off.

70
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.560
Right. But if I'm like,

71
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:55.990
I need him to play some piano or I need them to play this song.

72
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.950
He kind of lit up cause it was like a mini musical or something. Right. And,

73
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:05.440
and like seeing his spark because a lot of times I'll go to a city and I'm like,

74
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:08.260
I have these sound cues and you can see them kind of like roll their eyes or

75
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:12.130
like, uh, it's more work. But Jeff was more than down.

76
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.450
And he was embedded in the DNA of the comedy store. He was different. How long?

77
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:18.160
20 years? 25 years more.

78
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.040
<v 0>Yeah. I think he was 26 years when he died.</v>

79
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.370
<v 1>And he's the unofficial archivist of,</v>

80
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.650
of the comedy store because that place is notorious for no cameras, no filming.

81
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.500
But sometimes he would have his flip cam from.

82
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.710
<v 0>Will remember everything. Yeah. He had an amazing.</v>

83
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.460
<v 1>Memory,</v>

84
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.660
but he has this amazing catalog of magical moments at that place that now I

85
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:44.500
think the store is working with the family and stuff to try to retrieve,

86
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.590
especially in a pandemic. Have you noticed like the comedy stores,

87
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.000
Instagram what's unfortunate is that I love that place.

88
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.780
You love that place. It's such a magic, but it's, it's this black box.

89
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.210
No one knows the magic that happened there.

90
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.750
<v 0>We know. And we know that the fans know the people,</v>

91
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:05.350
that there was a lot of people that would go there. Get there, get that band.

92
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.390
I ain't get it off. Over that top band too.

93
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.360
You got another band can all the clothes off. They had two bands on,

94
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:12.220
I don't understand the double band thing.

95
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.960
He is the people that would go there a lot.

96
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.310
They knew that was one of the beautiful things is like I ran into this dude,

97
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.980
um, before, uh,

98
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.760
everything locked down and he was talking to me about a very specific bit.

99
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.870
And he was like, I just love how that is changed. You know,

100
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:36.190
you started out this way and then I could see that you saw that there was like a

101
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:40.150
problem with it that way. And then you snuck it in the back door on another way.

102
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:41.980
And then it started to pop. I love those fans.

103
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.100
<v 1>The hardcore ones kind of like can see the process.</v>

104
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.010
<v 0>Like guys who love jazz, who don't play any musical instruments.</v>

105
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.820
Most people are.

106
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.350
<v 1>Like that, but I've noticed there's, there's two store fans.</v>

107
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.740
There's two audiences. There's a physical audience.

108
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.760
The people who go there in LA and like, like that guy can see the nuance.

109
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.190
And then there's the online audience.

110
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:08.150
You don't realize how big the store is just sort of culturally and throughout

111
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:11.000
the country, they can't go to the store every day. So they don't know.

112
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.960
And it's almost like the online version is,

113
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.670
is their version of the store.
