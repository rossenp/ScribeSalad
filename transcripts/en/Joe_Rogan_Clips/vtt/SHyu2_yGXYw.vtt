00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.080
<v 3>You're just used to things that are less comfortable than most,</v>

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.720
I think perhaps cozy in your perspective, you know, but I get it. Yeah.

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.560
Yeah. But this, uh, ice hotel, my friend who stayed,

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.080
I can't remember who told me they stayed in it.

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.880
They did it one night just to say they did it. They were at their kids too. Uh.

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.750
<v 1>Sounds like David bla.</v>

8
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.310
<v 0>Then I think blame classic. You're right. I think you, I know David. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.510
He's great. Yeah, dude.

10
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.310
<v 2>Yeah. He, he, for him and ice hotels, like a normal thing,</v>

11
00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:32.990
he's like he probably just lay there on the ice the whole time, just to,

12
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.350
just to see if he just.

13
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.230
<v 0>To see if he could, he's a strange person, right.</v>

14
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.550
&lt;laugh&gt; strange and powerful at the same time. Like a very unusual human being.

15
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.420
<v 2>Dude. I, uh, I met with him years ago now because he was,</v>

16
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.420
did you see his like real or magic documentary? No, it's really good.

17
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.220
I would totally encourage you to watch it,

18
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:53.460
but basically it's all these like sort of magic tricks except they aren't

19
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.460
actually tricks. They're just like I'm allowed to curse, right? Yeah. Yeah.

20
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.300
That's they're like these up things that he does that people assume must be

21
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:03.090
magic, but aren't like, he puts an ice pick through his hand bunch, bunch. I.

22
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.010
<v 0>Put an ice pick through his.</v>

23
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.730
<v 2>Arm. Oh, whether you go, that's like the same kind of like he made me. Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:08.150
exactly.

25
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.930
<v 0>I'm like, come on, man. What are we doing here?</v>

26
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.290
<v 2>Exactly. That. No, exactly. And you're like, you're like, you hope it's a trick,</v>

27
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.370
but it's yeah, exactly. Look at you dude. Exactly. Dude.

28
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:20.290
He bought me an iPhone randomly. He, uh, it was one of those classic things. He,

29
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.480
uh, I forget he, yeah. So I, in New York for the thing for real magic, cuz uh,

30
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:29.000
he was talking about maybe doing a climbing thing and I was totally into

31
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.840
teaching him how to climb the outside of a building basical.

32
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.520
Cause it was one of those things that people would assume there's a trick to it.

33
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:33.841
But it's,

34
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:36.560
in some ways it's actually easier just to learn how to do it well enough that

35
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.360
you can just do it rather than do a trick. You know what I mean? Like mm-hmm,

36
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.360
&lt;affirmative&gt; because that's kind of the whole thing with the ice.

37
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.190
As people assume there must be a trick to it,

38
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.190
but you actually just do this crazy thing. You just learn how to do it. Right.

39
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.990
Right. And so, so I went climbing with him a few times and he like, you know,

40
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.390
gave me a tour around town and we chat and stuff. I don't know.

41
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:57.230
I was totally into his whole scene. I was like such mind over matter, you know,

42
00:01:57.231 --> 00:01:57.970
I was like, wow. He,

43
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.310
he has got a strong mind for just like making himself do things that other

44
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:04.460
people would are impossible slash.

45
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.900
<v 0>Yeah. It's just too unpleasant. Mostly his mind,</v>

46
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:10.180
mostly the ability to deal with uncomfortable feelings. Yeah.

47
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.220
Like the ice picked through the arm, dude.

48
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.300
Like we had a stop cuz I hit a nerve and then we did it again.

49
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.340
So it hit a nerve. And then there was one point in time where after we did it,

50
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:24.850
he was concerned that maybe blood was Ling up in a weird way.

51
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.050
So he had our medic look at it. So he, he, we stopped twice. Right.

52
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.050
We stopped once and I put it back in again and then we go all the way

53
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:37.130
through and then after it came out, we had to stop again.

54
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.450
And then one of our guys had to look at it cuz it was just bleeding in a weird

55
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.480
way. It was worried. That was creating a hematoma could be.

56
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.120
<v 2>Oh, like, come on, man. Uh, if you ever watch the, the show, you know,</v>

57
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.880
real or magic, whatever mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's, it's really good.

58
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:55.200
But in one of 'em like he puts the ice pick through his hand and,

59
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.520
and then he pulls it out and he's like, look, see, it's fine. And it's like,

60
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:00.120
and it looks totally fine. Like it's not bleeding,

61
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.360
you know it's cuz your hand is so elastic or whatever mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

62
00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:04.640
But I asked him about it, you know, I was like, oh what's the deal with that?

63
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.200
Cause you pull out, you know, it's like, is it a trick? And he's like, no,

64
00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:09.160
you pull it out. And as long as you're holding your hand above your heart,

65
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.600
it doesn't bleed for a little bit. He's like, then when you put your hand down,

66
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:13.640
obviously it bleeds. Cause you have to hold through your hand. I was like,

67
00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:17.080
oh Jesus. Like I was like, that's not a much of a trick. That's that's.

68
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.380
<v 0>Messed up.</v>

69
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.870
But one of the things that he showed us was there was a guy that was famous back

70
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.390
in the day for putting swords through his body.

71
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.990
The guy would run like the whole way.

72
00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:29.990
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the whole way through like a organs really narrow sword.

73
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.230
Yeah. A small, but they got progressively larger as he more, he.

74
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.870
<v 2>Got progressively debtor &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

75
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.940
<v 0>Is that how he died? Do you remember Jamie? I, I.</v>

76
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.420
<v 1>Feel like that's how it ended up going. He got.</v>

77
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.940
<v 0>Yes. He.</v>

78
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.140
<v 2>Got cocky I think. Or he,</v>

79
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.700
he sneezed halfway through and just like lacerated eventually.

80
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.620
<v 0>Made his way to like a broad sword size.</v>

81
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.700
&lt;laugh&gt; it was really weird to see though,

82
00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:57.380
because there's video of this guy and there's photos video. Is there video?

83
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.220
I got video over here's yeah.

84
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:03.930
This I slid like right through his organs. Oh geez. Yeah.

85
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.910
<v 2>So look at this.</v>

86
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.743
<v 0>Oh geez.</v>

87
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.610
I mean they just puncture his lung with a sword.

88
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.610
I mean, this is not a.

89
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.040
<v 2>Trick.</v>

90
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.210
This is when you watch action movies and people get shot or stabbed a bunch of

91
00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:19.450
times and you're like, that's so unrealistic. He'd be like,

92
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.120
when you watch on WIC, you know, and he gets shot like 27 times.

93
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.280
Like apparently people can actually, uh,

94
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.960
take quite a beating and just keep going.

95
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.320
<v 0>Or they can get one look they're going right through this.</v>

96
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.960
Right through his eye. Yeah. Oh my Jesus. Right to his or,

97
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.640
and look how he just sat, sits there. I guess.

98
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.480
<v 2>Who's who's his doctor. Who's like good enough to poke a sword.</v>

99
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.430
<v 0>He's.</v>

100
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.750
<v 2>Not really a doctor. Well, but he must be a like, he'd be an incredible, uh,</v>

101
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.350
maybe he works in a deli, you know like a really, really good Jamie.

102
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.863
<v 0>Say what? He uses</v>

103
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.710
47 now what are the things on his forearms by the way? Oh,

104
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.630
so now he's going into an x-ray machine to make sure that,

105
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.510
so this guy had scars all over his body from the times that he did this

106
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.820
dude. Yeah. Yikes. That's a,

107
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.300
fairly thick blade.

108
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.740
Like definitely bigger than a pencil that the doctor's

109
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.100
examining. It looks good. And now he's going to eat except.

110
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.940
<v 2>It's all gonna fall out the.</v>

111
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.340
<v 0>Hole. Yeah. It's gonna S score it out. That's a hard looking man.</v>

112
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:22.010
Imagine having a conversation that dude,

113
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.130
I bet he had is a very weird way of looking at things, dude. &lt;laugh&gt;.

114
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.603
<v 1>You died at 36.</v>

115
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.890
<v 0>That guy looked, oh, well, there you go.</v>

116
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.370
He looked like he 50 already fill holes.

117
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.770
<v 2>I wonder. Know how painful that is. I mean, it's gotta be pretty painful.</v>

118
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:34.480
Painful.

119
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.490
<v 0>Yeah. You would assume. How could it not be? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

120
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.490
No piercing your ears painful.

121
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.930
<v 2>I've no priest murder too afraid. That's a.</v>

122
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.880
<v 0>You're too.</v>

123
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.720
<v 2>Afraid of this. You're here. Well, no, I just don't wanna hold in my ear. So.</v>

124
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.520
<v 0>Did he die from that? Jamie? I'm double checking on how he.</v>

125
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.760
<v 2>Died. Yeah. Uh,</v>

126
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.520
you need like a team of researchers and you're just like pulling up, uh, like,

127
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.480
yeah, checking fast.

128
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.400
<v 0>I know it's all Jamie one handed Googling.</v>

129
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.673
<v 1>Yeah. Like a wizard.</v>

130
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.560
He moved to Switzerland and was granted a license to perform without the ability

131
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.120
to speak to the public. I don't know. That sounds strange.

132
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.320
<v 0>A license to perform without the ability to, oh, maybe like if you performed,</v>

133
00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:11.480
you had to talk to people.

134
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.880
<v 1>Like they had mines back then though. No, maybe.</v>

135
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.440
<v 0>You had a break character. I know.</v>

136
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.350
<v 1>Mad at you, but that seems like, so maybe he couldn't say that he got,</v>

137
00:06:19.351 --> 00:06:22.750
he was like Al it hurts. And they're like, I don't know. Like

138
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.390
it's just so silly to even have.

139
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:26.510
<v 2>To, to be fair.</v>

140
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.310
The act is less inspiring if the guy screams in pain the whole time.

141
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.270
Cause then nobody wants to watch, right?

142
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.910
<v 0>Yeah. I mean the same guy doing the same thing, screaming like,</v>

143
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.503
like he's being tortured.

144
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.020
<v 2>That would be sad. I mean, it'd be the same for David Blaine.</v>

145
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:40.660
Like when you watch the David stuff, it's like,

146
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.900
if you were putting ice pick through his arm and he was just SCR,

147
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:44.820
like if he was just sobbing the whole time, you'd be like,

148
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.740
I don't wanna watch this. I.

149
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.580
<v 0>Wouldn't do it. It's a.</v>

150
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.620
<v 1>Stop. It says in 1948, he was alleged.</v>

151
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.940
He was instructed by voices to eat a steel needle.

152
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.690
And two days later it was surgically removed. I don't know. I,

153
00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.970
I think he got.

154
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.850
<v 2>Cocky. It's fair to say that he might have weird things going on. Yeah.</v>

155
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.350
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

156
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.490
He was probably trying to kill himself and couldn't believe he kept surviving.

157
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.290
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah, he was laying on a bed. They didn't think,</v>

158
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.570
I guess they didn't know he was dead.

159
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.370
And then they finally got a doctor to check him.

160
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.170
Turns out he'd already been dead for a day. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah,

161
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.160
it sounds a Jesus Christ.

162
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.280
<v 2>We, we need like three more, uh, research interns,</v>

163
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:24.760
like Googling his whole scene as fast they get. Cause they're like, wait,

164
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:26.040
none of that Meg said, he said, and this.

165
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.840
<v 0>Was because of swallowing a needle. Mm-hmm.</v>

166
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.480
<v 1>&lt;Affirmative&gt; said he had, he thought he had guardian angels.</v>

167
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:35.440
He said he was telepathic. He could heal people. Yeah.

168
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.710
<v 2>Yeah, no, he didn't heal himself very well. Maybe he did.</v>

169
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:43.150
That's how he survived. So when he's, you know, being impaled so many times, I.

170
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.030
<v 0>I guess you can just do it though. It can be done, you know,</v>

171
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.270
cuz they they're fairly small holes.

172
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.830
Although they do go through the length of your entire body.

173
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.750
<v 2>It's I mean, you just think you'd get infected with, I.</v>

174
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.670
<v 1>Think that's part of, part of what that video was, was improving the doctors.</v>

175
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.260
It wasn't all fake and that's because that's what it says.

176
00:08:02.261 --> 00:08:05.980
He proved to Zurich doctors that it wasn't his act wasn't based on fakey.

177
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:06.620
That's.

178
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.300
<v 0>Probably why don't I get so uncomfortable just talking about this I'm so I'm</v>

179
00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:11.134
breathing heavy.

180
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.460
<v 2>I'm like, woo. Maybe you need to practice a little bit.</v>

181
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.940
You have somebody start putting needles through like little parts of your arm,

182
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.700
you know, like just.

183
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.170
<v 0>There's just something and weird about people that are willingly hurting</v>

184
00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:23.570
themselves and causing themselves.

185
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.530
<v 2>Pain. No, I, I kind of agree with that. I do. I do find it slightly,</v>

186
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.850
but David very well adjusted, man. It seems very welled, very friendly,

187
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.130
you know, super guy.

188
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.090
<v 0>Like, and his car tricks are legitimately blowing.</v>

189
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.930
<v 2>Dude. So fun fact about his car tricks. I don't know if he'd be so he,</v>

190
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.400
he took me to lunch once and like did the whole thing in car tricks and I was

191
00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:46.560
totally, I, I love magic and I think it's cool. And you know, I like,

192
00:08:46.561 --> 00:08:48.560
obviously they're all tricks, but I was like, this is incredible.

193
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.360
The execution's incredible. I was totally into it. I was super impressed.

194
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.920
And then, uh, at the time I was,

195
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.320
I was dating this girl in New York really briefly. And um,

196
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.960
and a couple days later we all went to the climbing gym together.

197
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.040
Cause like I said, I was kind of encouraging him to like do some,

198
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.800
some climbing thing. And he,

199
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.680
then we went to lunch again and he basically did the same set of car tricks for

200
00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:11.560
this girl that I was dating, but having already climbed for like an hour or two.

201
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.910
And it was funny because his execution in the car tricks was noticeably worse

202
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.550
for me. Like, you know,

203
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:21.470
I could tell that he was like doing all his tricks worse once his arms were like

204
00:09:21.471 --> 00:09:23.030
totally wrecked from climbing for two hours,

205
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.390
like basically his fingers and his forearm are totally wrecked.

206
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.710
And that actually made me appreciate how difficult the tricks are even more.

207
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.190
Cause I was like, oh wow.

208
00:09:30.191 --> 00:09:33.430
Like if your fingertips are hurt and your muscles are wrecked and it's hard for

209
00:09:33.431 --> 00:09:36.780
you to hold your arms steady, then it's like very hard to fan the deck,

210
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.260
you know, evenly and to like pick cards properly.

211
00:09:39.261 --> 00:09:41.780
And it made me appreciate just how much skill is involved and what he was doing.

212
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.700
I was like, ah, dude, it was, it was pretty cool. You know,

213
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:47.420
basically to see somebody do something at their peak and then when they're also

214
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:49.820
totally wrecked and then to see kind of the overlap, you're like,

215
00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:52.620
oh this is actually quite hard. Like, what he's doing is, is, is a challenge.

216
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.380
You know, you.

217
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.540
<v 0>Know what it's like? He's like,</v>

218
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.170
he's the fine motor skills that we have for tying our own shoes.

219
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.170
Totally.

220
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.850
<v 2>But for a deck of cards. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

221
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.730
When he can just cut to the 27th card or whatever, you know, and he's like,

222
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.930
lemme just cut this deck. And he's like, oh there's card number 24.

223
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.890
And you're like really.

224
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.210
<v 0>Can do that. Yeah. When in practice so many times that he has that,</v>

225
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:15.290
you know that cuz there is that feeling that you have when you tie your shoe

226
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.320
where your hands just communicate. So fluidly,

227
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.040
you know like that's like what people strive for in jujitsu in jujitsu,

228
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:28.560
you strive like that's actually what my, uh, my coach, Eddie Bravo.

229
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.360
He uses that as, as an example, that when you tie your shoe,

230
00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:33.400
you don't think about tying your shoe.

231
00:10:33.401 --> 00:10:37.190
You just tie your shoe mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and in a certain situation you'll

232
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.590
flow into a technique, like a technique will happen and it'll it'll happen.

233
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.390
And cuz you, your, your repetitions you've hit this totally.

234
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:48.150
So many times it'll just be so fluid. And so for David, it's gotta be like that.

235
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:49.870
But with like the very tips of.

236
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.870
<v 2>His fingers, I know for somebody like me with, you know, very callous,</v>

237
00:10:53.871 --> 00:10:56.630
I can't even imagine feeling anything that way, like honestly, Dex of cars,

238
00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.500
I just crumple 'em all together. I'm just shoving. Like, is it shuffled?

239
00:11:00.501 --> 00:11:02.260
You know, like I can't even manipulate 'em that. Well.

240
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.860
<v 0>Yeah. I would imagine. Right? Like your hands have to be like super rough,</v>

241
00:11:05.861 --> 00:11:06.694
right?

242
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.700
<v 2>Yeah. Normally pretty rough. And then also just really callous on the tip.</v>

243
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.621
I mean often, you know,

244
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:13.740
I can pick up like hot things and like not really notice it quite the same way

245
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.340
or you know, things like that. Oh, of course. I mean,

246
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:19.050
if you're grabbing like grabbing fair course rock all the time,

247
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.650
it's like you have to wind up with really callous fingertips of course.

248
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.890
But so in something like manipulating the edge of a card, it's like,

249
00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:26.050
I can't even imagine feeling it.
