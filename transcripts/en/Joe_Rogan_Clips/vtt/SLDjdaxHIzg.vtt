00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.260
<v 2>So you start off with this first mile and then eventually work your way up to</v>

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:12.180
all these challenges. And then eventually you decide,

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.650
I am going to row across the Atlantic ocean by

5
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:17.484
myself.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.670
<v 1>Yeah. So, okay. So the row, um,</v>

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.360
I was on a bus, right.

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.250
And I was like talking to someone sitting next to me and we were talking about

9
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:33.720
endurance challenges and, um, I was, uh,

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.010
stubborn, no, at all 19 year old. So of course I was like, oh,

11
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:40.350
I've heard it all. I know people climb Mount Everest.

12
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:43.470
I know people sail around the world. I know about all these things.

13
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:47.430
And then he mentioned his friend rode across the Atlantic and

14
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.660
that was like, that just stopped me in my tracks.

15
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:56.010
Like what, like people can do that. Like I never,

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.990
it was so far beyond anything I ever imagined. And,

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.950
um, I think like with endurance,

18
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.140
what's so cool about endurance is like at a certain point everyone's body

19
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:11.190
hurts. Right?

20
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.350
So what makes endurance like a really cool experience is

21
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:20.880
seeing how the human will and how like determination and how a strong

22
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:24.270
mind, like you it's a requirement because everyone,

23
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:29.100
no matter how fast or slow you are, is going through that, that mental wall.

24
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.350
And so, um, yeah,

25
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.300
I found out about ocean rowing and I was really captivated, not only by,

26
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.670
um, that mental component, because like, if you do a marathon, you go home,

27
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:46.230
you take your shower, you, um, you have people cheering you on, but,

28
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.990
but ocean rolling, you're stripped raw of that. And,

29
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:53.430
and something about that was intriguing to me because it's like, okay,

30
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.470
how can you dig deep internally when you don't have the,

31
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.220
you know, the finish line, um, you know,

32
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.660
whatever a party and like the swag and the people and the

33
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.660
nice cozy bed. And I just kind of,

34
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.550
I liked that idea of like being so stripped raw that you have to dig

35
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.080
deeper than you ever would if you didn't have all those other externals.

36
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.170
So yeah, I found out about it on a bus.

37
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.060
I went home and went and Googled everything I could

38
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.440
about ocean rowing.

39
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.210
And it was at a time where I did my first ultra

40
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:38.190
marathon. So it was like a hundred kilometer run or 62 miles.

41
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.920
And it was, again, one of those moments where I was like,

42
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.880
I never thought I could do that. And my body proved otherwise.

43
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:49.320
So what are all the other things that I'm saying I can't do, but maybe I can.

44
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.240
So it was really that information at

45
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:58.680
that particular time where I was like really open to the idea of, wow,

46
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.390
maybe it is possible, but, um,

47
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.500
it was a matter of like researching everything. It wasn't like, oh,

48
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:10.120
I got to do this. It was, oh, I got to find out everything because I mean,

49
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.850
if someone told you, someone wrote across the Atlantic,

50
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:17.560
wouldn't the first thing be like, is that really true? Like, so, I mean,

51
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.490
that was the first place I look like. Are people legitimately doing that?

52
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.640
<v 0>How much time was it between you finding out about it and you actually.</v>

53
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.120
<v 1>Doing it two years? No.</v>

54
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.240
<v 0>No. What kind of training did you do?</v>

55
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.830
<v 1>Um, so like physical training,</v>

56
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.260
like compared to doing like,

57
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.690
I've trained for like iron mans and then train for adventures, like physical,

58
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.340
purely physical too.

59
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:49.960
Like these more adventure type things and like training for an iron man,

60
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:54.850
90% is like what you're doing in the gym for ocean rowing and

61
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:59.590
for like the more adventure type, um, athletic pursuits,

62
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.000
I would say that like 90% was like the logistics.

63
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.430
Like you could be the most fit person in the world,

64
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:09.610
but if you don't have a boat, what does it matter? Like,

65
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:13.810
so I spent most of my time just like sorting out through all the

66
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:18.280
logistics, the sponsorship, getting the gear training with the gear. But, um,

67
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.830
yeah, like my training priorities for rowing an ocean were,

68
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.020
um, injury prevention.

69
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:30.190
So I did a lot with like strengthening my core and my lower back.

70
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:34.330
And then on the weekends is when I would do like a six to eight hour row

71
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.040
training road just to get more,

72
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:39.460
to get used to the boat and the equipment more than anything else. But.

73
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.410
<v 0>On a lake lake.</v>

74
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.580
<v 1>Erie? Yeah.</v>

75
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.720
<v 0>Yeah. Now how fast do you go on this boat?</v>

76
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.930
<v 1>Uh, like maybe I would go like 30 miles a day. No.</v>

77
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.370
<v 0>No. How fast? Like.</v>

78
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.760
<v 1>Uh, three, two or three miles.</v>

79
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.160
<v 0>It was three miles per hour. So basically like the speed of walking.</v>

80
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.110
<v 1>Yeah. So, um,</v>

81
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.310
my boat was a 19 foot rowboat.

82
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.840
It was like 400 pounds, but once it was fully loaded,

83
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.910
it was a thousand pounds. So it did have like a sliding seat?

84
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.990
Yes. Okay. So, um, I,

85
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.400
I had a sliding seat,

86
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.440
so that meant that like my legs and my back were the main source of

87
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:30.550
like power. But, um, I think the best.

88
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.260
<v 0>Like you mean the sliding sleeve?</v>

89
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.920
<v 1>Exactly. So like, it helps you,</v>

90
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.600
it means that like the power was coming from the most powerful parts of my

91
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:45.160
body, not in my arms. So some people assume like, oh, it's just your upper body.

92
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:49.120
It's just your arms. But in fact it's more your legs and back. But.

93
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.870
<v 0>Um, so this thing's going two or three miles an hour. Correct.</v>

94
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:55.360
And how many miles is the Atlantic ocean? How many miles?

95
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.460
<v 1>Yeah, 3000. So, oh my God. Don't think about it.</v>

96
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.653
Don't even think of.

97
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.550
<v 0>Oh my God. That's so far,</v>

98
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.230
so far.

99
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.230
<v 1>It was the worst reaching the halfway point, just because.</v>

100
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.160
<v 0>Like how long did it take you the whole trip? 70 days? 70 days.</v>

101
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.670
That's not that bad when you think about it, how far are you?

102
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.120
<v 1>Yeah, I would say so. Yeah, I anticipated,</v>

103
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:25.160
it would be 70 or a hundred days.

104
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.120
<v 0>And so.</v>

105
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.070
<v 1>I had 30 days of extra food and so it was good.</v>

106
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.010
<v 0>Yeah. Yep. Was anybody monitoring you?</v>

107
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.080
<v 1>Uh, I had like a tracker,</v>

108
00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:40.820
so people could like look online and see where I was. Um,

109
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.030
but there wasn't like a follow boat or anything like that.

110
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.603
<v 0>Yeah. Those nights, like.</v>

111
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.860
<v 1>It was pretty amazing. Yeah. So of course the stars were amazing,</v>

112
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:56.390
like shooting stars and just like, yeah, breathtaking.

113
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.710
And then what surprised me? Like I thought it was like, wait, is this real?

114
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:03.470
Am I hallucinating? But the, the,

115
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.710
I think the most stunning part was actually looking in the water because they

116
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:11.490
had like, um, this type of glowing plankton. So it was like a phosphorescence.

117
00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:15.620
So sometimes I would see things glowing in the distance and then all around my

118
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.760
bow. Um, anytime my, or hit the water,

119
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:23.300
like I would see all of that. And yeah,

120
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.950
like I was so busy planning the trip and the logistics that I didn't

121
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:30.170
know, like what wildlife I'd see.

122
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:33.020
And so that was definitely like a pleasant surprise to.

123
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.940
<v 0>Yeah. It must have been really crazy. Yeah. Have you ever seen no. No.</v>

124
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:41.330
I've seen it on video so you can find video of it. Um, what is it called?

125
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.460
<v 1>It's bioluminescence,</v>

126
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.020
but there are like Puerto Rico is probably the closest place to here that has

127
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:50.930
really good bioluminescence to like.

128
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.940
<v 0>Yeah. So that it really looked like that bright blue.</v>

129
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.580
That's amazing. Very.

130
00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.713
<v 1>Trippy.</v>

131
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.490
<v 0>That's so wild. Yeah.</v>

132
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.750
<v 1>Yeah. So I could put my hand in the water and.</v>

133
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.300
<v 0>Take any photos or film. I.</v>

134
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.050
<v 1>Did have some, uh, film and, uh, yeah,</v>

135
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.820
sometimes I know, like you can't really take good.

136
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.720
I mean, yeah. I didn't have really good.

137
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.880
<v 0>Bioluminescence photos. Um, look at that. Sure.</v>

138
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:26.870
That's insane.

139
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.280
Now you said the stars stars were.

140
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.150
<v 1>Amazing. Yes.</v>

141
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.050
<v 0>Like how amazing, I mean, no pollute light pollution at all.</v>

142
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.110
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, I mean, it,</v>

143
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.640
in some ways it felt like I was just like living this national geographic

144
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:48.200
experience of like, you know, I had dolphins come right up to my boat. I had,

145
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.750
um, yeah, yeah. Like, uh, I think it was like the fourth way mark. I was like,

146
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:58.560
I want to celebrate, um, my way of celebrating was very limited.

147
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:01.560
It was like, oh, am I going to have two Snickers bars? Like,

148
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.730
there's not really anything other than what I had,

149
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:09.930
but this pot of dolphins surrounded my boat and we're doing like flips and

150
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:14.340
tricks and like right at that moment that I was reaching it. So yeah,

151
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:15.030
the,

152
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.650
the dolphins and sharks and birds,

153
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:20.790
and, um,

154
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.680
I even had like fish falling right underneath my boat. Like,

155
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.270
because barnacles would grow. It was like I on, on the side of my boat, I would,

156
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.550
um, scrub them off. But sometimes they would just keep following my boat.

157
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:38.040
So every time I, I named them ed Nettie,

158
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.990
but I had like three Dorado's that would keep falling and birds that came on

159
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:44.580
my boat and wow. Yeah.
