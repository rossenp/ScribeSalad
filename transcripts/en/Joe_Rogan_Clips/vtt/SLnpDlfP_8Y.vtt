00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.480
<v 1>Experience. And now check out Martin Luther king. All right.</v>

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.080
We had to fight,

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.920
fight for decades to have Martin Luther king day.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.400
There was a lot of resistance to that. Do you realize that?

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.453
And, and, and a,

7
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.390
a lot of the resistance was the fact that Martin Luther king

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.470
is the only American man in this country to

9
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:35.950
have a holiday all to himself. Really? And guess what?

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.173
He's black.

11
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.700
<v 0>What do you mean by a holiday? All to himself around Columbus day.</v>

12
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.860
<v 1>Columbus, not American. Oh.</v>

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.820
<v 0>That's right. Okay. Well, he kind of was when he became, no, he thought he,</v>

14
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.020
well, he did, first of all, Columbus didn't even land here. And he was like,

15
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:52.580
basically a serial killer. He was a.

16
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.900
<v 1>Serial killer. He was a rapist. Yeah. And a Piller and he didn't,</v>

17
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:57.420
he didn't discover a thing. What.

18
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.180
<v 0>Did, did they call an indigenous people's day now? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.010
<v 1>Now how, how do you discover over something when you get there?</v>

20
00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:06.690
People are already there. &lt;laugh&gt; come on. Be real.

21
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.290
<v 0>Well, not only that, like, why did it take until basically the later latter,</v>

22
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.370
half of the 20th century,

23
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.690
before people came to grips of the fact that he was an atrocious human being,

24
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.970
like when we were kids, when I was in I'm a little bit younger than you. I'm 52.

25
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.960
When I was in high, it was Columbus sail, the ocean blue,

26
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.480
the pin to the Santa Maria. Right? Nino Pento, Santa Maria. This was,

27
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.360
this was a guy who was an Explorer. He was going there for Spain. He was right.

28
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.360
And then when you get older and you, you read these missionaries,

29
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.000
it counts of the horrific crimes.

30
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.680
<v 1>And the, and we still.</v>

31
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.480
<v 0>Celebrate him. Yeah. Well, I mean,</v>

32
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:44.830
do we sort us out and we kind of are done celebrating him, right? No,

33
00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:45.470
we still have.

34
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.350
<v 1>Columbus day. It.</v>

35
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.190
<v 0>Should be college indigenous people's day now. No.</v>

36
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.230
<v 1>They, they call it that. Yeah. But we, we on the calendar,</v>

37
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.990
it still says Columbus day. Does it?

38
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.910
<v 0>Yeah. Not on the apple calendar. Really. That's cool. I.</v>

39
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.910
<v 1>Don't think so. Maybe Apple's.</v>

40
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.150
<v 0>Head of it time. I think it says indigenous people's day now. Okay. That's cool.</v>

41
00:02:01.151 --> 00:02:03.540
Maybe I'm wrong, but it, it.

42
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.420
<v 1>Should. Yeah. Now, um, so we used to have,</v>

43
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.460
um, two white guys who each had a holiday all to himself,

44
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.300
Americans who are those guys we used to have, uh, maybe before your time,

45
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.380
uh, during my time, George Washington day and Abraham Lincoln.

46
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.850
Really? What.

47
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.690
<v 0>Were those days? You didn't remember that? I.</v>

48
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.210
<v 1>Don't remember that. Yeah. And then, so we had too many holidays,</v>

49
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.090
so they combined those two days into one day called president's day. Oh.

50
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.970
<v 0>Okay. We, those were too many holidays. Enough productivity.</v>

51
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.170
<v 1>Exactly. So we, so yeah, so they took those away and combined them. So,</v>

52
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.450
so now the only

53
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.720
man who has a holiday to himself is a black man and they can't handle it,

54
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.680
Martha King. And now they,

55
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:57.560
we had to fight for decades to give this man a holiday when he gave his

56
00:02:57.561 --> 00:02:58.840
life to bring this country together.

57
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.520
Yet we give a holiday to Christopher Columbus, who,

58
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:08.120
as you pointed out was a murderer, a serial killer, a Piller a rapist.

59
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.760
Okay. Who didn't discover a thing. Right?

60
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.840
Martin Luther king never murdered pillaged and raped,

61
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.520
but yet we didn't wanna give him a holiday. You know?

62
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.430
So you know that I see inequity in this country and I'll tell you something

63
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:22.910
else. Um,

64
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.670
one now there are a lot of people who would disagree with me and that's okay.

65
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:29.310
Cause we we're Americans. We can disagree. You know, we're all,

66
00:03:29.311 --> 00:03:32.310
we're all individuals, but there are people who will agree with me also.

67
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.390
And I've been saying this now for 22 years,

68
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.660
one of the things that will help us to,

69
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.740
to advance into the 21st century. Cause we, we are behind the times,

70
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.653
um,

71
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.420
we need at this point to get rid of black history month.

72
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.140
Now I know people listening are gonna like freak out what what's this guy

73
00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:57.660
talking about? Blah, blah, blah. Let me explain. Right?

74
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.890
For the long as time we needed black history month,

75
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.490
um, black history was not being taught in our schools.

76
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.410
Now you remember when you pointed out a moment ago that, uh, when you were in,

77
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.890
uh, in school, you know, Columbus was a hero, looked up to him, et cetera.

78
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:18.730
And then you go to college and you learn. Otherwise, when I was in high school,

79
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.400
it was not in our textbooks that we had, uh,

80
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.160
internment camps with Japanese Americans.

81
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.200
I did not learn that until I got to college. I'm like, what are you kidding me?

82
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:32.920
Right. I didn't believe it. Now it's in the textbooks. Yeah.

83
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:37.000
That's what I'm saying. We're behind the times. Right? Okay. So anyway, um,

84
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.470
we didn't have black history, right? Yeah.

85
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:43.390
What we had was called American history.

86
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.470
It might as well have been called white history. Cause that's all it was. And,

87
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.750
and even in some cases,

88
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.350
whites were being given credit for things they did not invent.

89
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.190
And for places they did not discover. Um, but we knew we,

90
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:01.660
we were told at home things like that, but not in schools. So we had to fight,

91
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:05.100
fight, fight. And finally we got one week,

92
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.220
it was called Negro history week Carter,

93
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.300
G Woodson created that and schools had Negro history week, one week, a year,

94
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.660
we continued fighting harder and harder. Finally, we got one month.

95
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.900
Cause you know, nobody's gonna give us everything on one dime. Right.

96
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.500
They had do it out little by little.

97
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.930
So we got that one month shortest month of the year, right.

98
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.930
February 20 days. Okay. No coincidence. &lt;laugh&gt; but &lt;laugh&gt; but,

99
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.170
but we accepted it for two reasons. Uh,

100
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.930
it was the birth month of two of our heroes,

101
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.250
Frederick Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. All right.

102
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.600
So we so up to that

103
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.760
and then we stopped fighting and that was a mistake on our part.

104
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.880
We became complacent. Right?

105
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.120
And now it's my belief that black history month has become

106
00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.080
detrimental to, to us, to all of us white and black.

107
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.520
I'll tell you why. Yes. We needed it for a certain period of time.

108
00:06:03.521 --> 00:06:06.320
Cause we had nothing. Um, but here's the problem.

109
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.480
We only studied black history in February and each February

110
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.550
we studied the same half, a dozen people. Martin Luther king,

111
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.030
Rosa parks, Harriet Tubman, Brooker T Washington, George Washington, Carver,

112
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.390
and one or two other ones.

113
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.030
By the time we get through half a dozen up our month is over.

114
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:27.670
We did our black thing. Let's move on.

115
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.910
Right yet we study Benjamin Franklin, Eli, Whitney, Alexander, Graham,

116
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.350
bell, Thomas that F F Scott Fitzgerald, Francis,

117
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.700
Scott Key all year long.

118
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.660
We're constantly reinforcing what they did all year long.

119
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.540
We never forget who flew the kite and the lightning hit the key and we have

120
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.260
electricity. We all know it's Ben Franklin. All right. But yet, um,

121
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.300
if you ask some kid in June say, um,

122
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.170
who was, uh, Harriet Tubman. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember her. Yeah.

123
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.530
She was that lady who refused to give a receipt on the bus.

124
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.250
They got re confused with Rosa parks.

125
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.850
Cause there's been no reinforcement since February. And then next year,

126
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:14.210
next February, it's the same half a dozen people. All right.

127
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.930
So you're constantly, I'm not taking anything away from those people.

128
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.000
They were some of the greatest. All right.

129
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.120
But you're constantly reinforcing that there were only six or seven black people

130
00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:27.000
in this whole country ever did anything.

131
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.800
What about the guy who invented the traffic light?

132
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.640
What about the person who invented the irony board and so many other black

133
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.640
discoveries and inventions? Oh, well we didn't have time for that.

134
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.280
We only have one month. Yeah,

135
00:07:38.281 --> 00:07:41.310
but you got time to talk about Ben Franklin all year long. You know,

136
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.710
women's history month is March. We need to get rid of that too.

137
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.550
Take these things out of those months and put 'em where they belong under the

138
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.150
umbrella of American history and teach them all year long.

139
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.190
That way kids get accustomed to this and they learn and they have more respect

140
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.620
for each other. Look, I remember when I was a kid,

141
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.820
miss America beauty contest,

142
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.660
there were only two categories and it was all white women.

143
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.180
Black women were not allowed to join miss to compete in miss America.

144
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.980
All the judges were white males, two categories,

145
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.180
the evening gown evening wear. And the swimsuit that was it.

146
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.930
Women were objectified. There were sex objects. You know,

147
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:23.611
they didn't have talent.

148
00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:26.330
They didn't need to write an essay or show what else they can do.

149
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.370
They just looked at and judge on that.

150
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.890
So black women were deemed not beautiful enough to, um,

151
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.610
to compete in miss America.

152
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.560
Plus they didn't want any white man judging a black woman in a bathing suit or

153
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.553
whatever.

154
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.600
So black women began having low self-esteem cuz they were told they were not as

155
00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:49.200
beautiful as these other women. So what did we,

156
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.960
as black people do to elevate the esteem self-esteem of black girls,

157
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.520
we created the Ms. Black America beauty pageant to give them something to

158
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:03.960
aspire to. And that worked for a while. Finally, finally,

159
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.583
miss America,

160
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.840
the big one came to its sense and opened its doors. Wait was that?

161
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.560
I don't know the exact year. Um,

162
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.350
but I get guess was back in the seventies sometime, um,

163
00:09:18.351 --> 00:09:21.910
opened its doors to all American women,

164
00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:25.790
regardless of their ethnicity color or whatever, as long as they were American,

165
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:29.910
they could compete. And since that time we've had, we've had more than one.

166
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.151
Miss America.

167
00:09:31.151 --> 00:09:35.820
Who's been black starting with Vanessa Williams and then Debbie turned and I

168
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:39.100
think maybe one or two other ones since that time. So now,

169
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:44.260
because miss America has come into the time we can get

170
00:09:44.261 --> 00:09:47.140
rid of black, of, of Ms. Black America. We don't need it anymore. Right.

171
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.580
We got the main one. When are we gonna come to American history?

172
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.820
We need to get rid of black history month. We just,

173
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.770
we just the first black American president, what are we gonna do with Obama?

174
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.970
Are we gonna put him in, in the, in the, uh, February box?

175
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.490
Cause he's black only talk about him in February.

176
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.290
Don't talk about him in March or September cuz he's black history.

177
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.330
Put him in February. You know,

178
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.040
I don't I'm, I'm lost for words, man. It's crazy how we,

179
00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:18.760
how we do this.
