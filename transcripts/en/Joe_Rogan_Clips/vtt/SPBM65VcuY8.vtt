00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.540
<v 1>You're you're the wild man living in a van now. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You,</v>

3
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:08.460
you are that eccentric character.

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.780
You go from being a television and movie star to being a wild man.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.760
Traveling the land with your vagabond dog that you'd got from another country.

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.830
She's a rescue from The Bahamas.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.420
<v 0>Yeah. Charlie. Yeah. She's rescued from Bahamas. God adorable. By the way.</v>

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.900
I love her. She's beautiful.

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.740
<v 1>Surely you are this sixth century character now.</v>

10
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.701
<v 0>I guess.</v>

11
00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:32.780
So I feel like maybe I feel like in some ways what I'm doing right now is the

12
00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:35.630
most normal thing I've done in my life, but it is actually kind of crazy too.

13
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.730
<v 1>Crazy compared to people, but I think it fits you like a glove. I really do.</v>

14
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.750
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I like going out into the wilderness. I always have,</v>

15
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.280
and I've been out in this van that I just got, which is amazing.

16
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.100
And I'm going pretty hard with it. Yeah.

17
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.620
<v 1>Is this the first time you've been tested since you got tested?</v>

18
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.850
The last time on my show.

19
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.260
<v 0>I got tested one time between, uh, but that's, uh, another interesting story,</v>

20
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.410
but uh, let's hear it. Uh,

21
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.510
well my ex wife asked me to come on our talk show and I hadn't talked to her in

22
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:07.730
15 years. Oh, we drew drew. Yeah.

23
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:12.290
So and so was that a trap? It was nice.

24
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.770
It was nice, nervous. It was nice. It was nice. We had a good time. That's cool.

25
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.950
And uh, but I had to get tested to do the show and, uh,

26
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.740
but it was interesting cause you know, I mean, it was very sort of, uh,

27
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.180
interesting thing. Cause you know,

28
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.070
we hadn't talked in 15 years at all at all and uh, and then,

29
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.280
uh, you know, all of a sudden, uh, you know,

30
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.690
got a call from our city and we're coming to the new Chubb and her shows her new

31
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:35.660
shows really pretty wacky, you know, like she's,

32
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.870
she's getting really kind of electric. You put your hands out for wacky.

33
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.590
Oh yeah. She's definitely pushing it in a very sort of,

34
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.710
I mean I enjoying the show. It's very funny what she is doing. Very, very,

35
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.570
very over the top. Some of the things she does on there.

36
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.360
<v 1>That's representative hers of her as well.</v>

37
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.590
<v 0>It reminds me a lot of, of, of her. Why don't you do it as her? Yeah, for sure.</v>

38
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.330
Yeah. She really is like who she really is. I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.340
<v 1>Well, as you get older, your league,</v>

40
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:02.390
you tend to be able to figure out who you really are better. Like,

41
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.530
like with you,

42
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.980
like doing this van thing on the guy living down by the river and the van,

43
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.170
it makes sense to me when you told me you were going to do that,

44
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.110
I'm going to travel across the country and just drive around the van with my dog

45
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.480
and was like, dad, I could see you enjoying that.

46
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.830
<v 0>Yeah. You know, it's, it's, it's a whole world, man.</v>

47
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.010
It's a whole world that you didn't you that I didn't really even know about.

48
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:26.060
Like, I didn't know in Canada, it's called crown land here.

49
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:28.520
It's called BLM land Bureau of land management land.

50
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.550
I'm sure you know all about that from hunting and going out into the wilderness.

51
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.810
I didn't really know about Bureau of land management land and there's certain

52
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:38.870
apps that will show you all the fire roads,

53
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.610
all the remote places that you can go and do dispersed camping,

54
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.290
go boondocking. There.

55
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.490
<v 1>Does your van have off-road capabilities? Can you drive on rugged trails? Yeah,</v>

56
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.970
pretty good.

57
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.050
<v 0>I got like a, it's not, it's not an off-road vehicle. It's a, it's a,</v>

58
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.780
it's a Ram ProMaster, 2,500 it's you know,

59
00:02:56.781 --> 00:03:00.070
a delivery truck that they convert into. A lot of people are doing.

60
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.310
<v 1>That these days. My friend, Tim Poole did that. He got,</v>

61
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.140
I believe he got a Ram as well. Yeah. This was a Ram. Wasn't a Jamie.

62
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.760
I think it's a Ram as well. And he did the same thing, turned it into a bug out.

63
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:10.594
Van.

64
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.800
<v 0>Ram is wider than a, than a Mercedes sprinter van,</v>

65
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:17.310
which you see a lot of it's wider. So I can actually sleep full width wise.

66
00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:21.930
The beds would wide with wise at the back. But, but uh, you know,

67
00:03:21.931 --> 00:03:25.230
it was just kind of happened pretty randomly.

68
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.000
I saw this clip online and these guys in Arizona who convert the vans,

69
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.130
I called them up. They, they were on shark tank.

70
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.660
They're these guys there's called boho.

71
00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:35.100
This fans called Bahali really cool dude.

72
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.070
<v 1>Boho, but B O H O.</v>

73
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.270
<v 0>Yeah. And by the way, uh, they are like, they love this,</v>

74
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.950
that I'm here right now. They're your biggest fan.

75
00:03:43.951 --> 00:03:46.350
They look literally watch every episode of your show.

76
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.330
And so they're going to take a right now.

77
00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:51.270
They're probably really happy that I'm mentioning them on the show, but, um,

78
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.260
they, uh, they were on shark tank. They just, these two young guys,

79
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.170
they started this company where they bought Ram pro masters,

80
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.040
totally independent thing. And they do this great carpentry. Like they build,

81
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.320
build out the inside. It's all Cedar.

82
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.320
<v 1>Do you have, uh, images of your, your van online?</v>

83
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.390
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. That's the inside of the bin there. That's nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.780
And see, like I got my speakers set up and the thing that's,

85
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.230
that's kinda like quirky about this in the Mojave desert.

86
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.230
There's Charlie chillin. Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.120
<v 1>So when you say you have your studio,</v>

88
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:27.480
so you're doing your podcast from the road. Yeah, exactly.

89
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.810
And how will you doing it? Like whenever you feel like it,

90
00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:34.200
you just fire up the podcast when you've got something to say and.

91
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.000
<v 0>Yeah. Cause that thing looks killer in there. Yeah. Yeah. See.</v>

92
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.400
<v 1>Hello.</v>

93
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.260
You got a little kitchenette set up and how you cook it as there's a vent. Oh,

94
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:44.100
you got an awning.

95
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.220
<v 0>And I'm shooting these drone shots too, which are pretty fun. Um.</v>

96
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.890
<v 1>Rolling drones. Look at this. Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.860
<v 0>This isn't the Mojave check out. All those Joshua trees burned.</v>

98
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.080
Those are burned, Joshua trees. But um, so you know, it's,

99
00:04:58.081 --> 00:04:59.130
it's kinda like, you know,

100
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:02.670
I've always been into the techie kind of building out studio stuff. Right.

101
00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:05.790
So that's where, when I found out about these vans,

102
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.340
the thing that really kind of piqued my interest is the,

103
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.390
the battery and solar technology that exists now.

104
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:15.630
So there's two solar panels on the roof and in the back I've got these

105
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.530
batteries. Okay. They're, they're really, they're called Battleborn batteries.

106
00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:21.300
They're like really solid.

107
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.140
Like they use them in sailboats to go around the world basically.

108
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.580
And there's four of them and the solar panels are charging them constantly.

109
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.960
So I've built, I've got my computers, I've got my cameras,

110
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.230
I've got my drone, I'm charging batteries all the time.

111
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:40.440
I've got a refrigerator in there. So I, I, you know, I kind of, you know,

112
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.670
cold beer. Right. And, uh, and, uh, it's sweet.

113
00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:48.390
So I can go out into the middle of nowhere and, uh,

114
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.060
have virtually unlimited electronic capability and just stay there as long as

115
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:55.950
I want until I run out of food. Wow.

116
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.840
<v 1>And so those solar panels, how efficient are they like, uh, will they,</v>

117
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.070
they power your studio and all that stuff where you don't have to use your,

118
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.881
your engine.

119
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:09.080
You don't have to start up and use gas or you run a diesel in your van. No.

120
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.480
<v 0>Uh, that just,</v>

121
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.070
that just happened to be the way it went because that van was

122
00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:18.460
available. And I got that one, but how was the gas mileage? That's pretty good.

123
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.340
I'll tell you one thing though. I am always filling up.

124
00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:24.760
Like I never let it go below three quarters of a tank because just in case gets,

125
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.460
I never know where I'm going every day. That's the, like,

126
00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:30.970
I got some weird stories over the last six weeks where I've just been like,

127
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.270
not sure where I'm going to sleep and it's the sun's going down.

128
00:06:34.271 --> 00:06:36.370
And then I end up going down a crazy road.

129
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.650
And then the first night I got stuck in the Mojave desert

130
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.330
because I looked up on this app, dispersed fire road, I'm thinking, Oh,

131
00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:48.460
that's pretty cool. You know that I get there,

132
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:51.490
there's a sign that says tortoise's crossing careful.

133
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.700
I didn't start driving out into the desert. I'm 200 yards in,

134
00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:58.600
I get stuck because it's the soft sand gets stuck in the soft sand.

135
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.910
So I've been a little more careful, but,

136
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.050
but get out and you get stuck in the soft sand called AAA. Oh,

137
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.730
that was a hundred yards from the, from the, from the freeway.

138
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:14.560
It was gotten into it yet. It was so pathetic. It was hilarious actually,

139
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.300
because I've been planning for months, you know?

140
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.390
And then all of a sudden I'm like, I'm seeing the, you know, the free,

141
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:20.680
this was our stars.

142
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.720
<v 1>Before we get into your adventure. And I want to,</v>

143
00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:25.710
I want to get more into this van bill. Yeah.

144
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.780
So you started it out with just buying this van.

145
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.120
Is it a new van or did you buy it brand new? Yeah.

146
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.080
So you bought a brand new van and then you bring it to these boho guys and these

147
00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:39.020
guys w what do they do they ask you? What do you planning on doing?

148
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.870
You plan on using this as a studio?

149
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.910
Like your idea from the jump was to do your podcast on the road with

150
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:50.080
no, no plans other than your own whims. Right.

151
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.180
So when, when you do something like that,

152
00:07:52.181 --> 00:07:54.190
how do you know what you're going to need?

153
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.170
You didn't really have any experience in like off-roading or that kind of not

154
00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:01.990
really living out of a van. How did you know what you're going to need? Like,

155
00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:03.130
how did you research it?

156
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.350
<v 0>Hmm. Yeah. So, well, there's, there's a couple of categories of research.</v>

157
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.130
One was just building the studio itself. So I built the studio at home first.

158
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.250
That was just the, the, you know, nitty gritty technical stuff, you know?

159
00:08:15.251 --> 00:08:17.530
And what kind of microphones, what kind of, uh,

160
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.360
amps and preamps I'm going to use. And I have some apps that use tubes.

161
00:08:22.361 --> 00:08:25.030
I got rid of those because I figured the tubes had rattled out in the dirt road,

162
00:08:25.031 --> 00:08:28.240
so boring techie stuff. But, uh,

163
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.770
but as far as the survival and the food and the,

164
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.910
and all of that, and the van they'd been real great.

165
00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:41.260
Like I built my studio equipment into a row case,

166
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.770
and I know I knew that I thought, well, that could fit under the bed.

167
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.840
And then we sort of planted over,

168
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.930
there's a little door that opens and you can access it under the bed.

169
00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:53.560
And we've wired all the cables through the walls. And, uh,

170
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.280
it's pretty efficient. So, uh, so you had everything.

171
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.770
<v 1>You need to do a podcast down into one box.</v>

172
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.770
You can just pull that box out and then you're ready to roll.

173
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.880
<v 0>Actually, it's, it's actually permanently housed under the bed. So I just,</v>

174
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:09.110
I have a table that pulls out that table. I was sitting out there, um,

175
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:14.390
and just under there a little door opens microphones plugged in and away you go.

176
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.100
But the other side of it is like a lot of the video stuff too. Like the drone,

177
00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:20.270
the cameras, like I've,

178
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.170
I've got some new cameras that I'm kind of messing with that are exciting to me.

179
00:09:24.171 --> 00:09:28.660
And so, so I'm kind of out there. The thing that I was thinking, I was thinking,

180
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.010
and I get bored out here. Yeah. That's what I was going to ask.

181
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.520
I'm all alone or lonely. I'm not going to get bored or lonely.

182
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.890
And I haven't because I've populated the van with

183
00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:44.540
stuff to do. So when I get bored of the drone, then, uh, I'm making music too.

184
00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:45.380
So I've made a, uh,

185
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.060
it's a recording music studio to kind of music while I'm doing some sort of

186
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.810
different stuff. I've got my acoustic guitar. So I'm going to start doing some,

187
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.220
some, uh, country rap type of,

188
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.400
you're going to go on tour country rap. I call it crap. Joe,

189
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.570
it's continuing to go on tour. Maybe, maybe, yeah. As a singer.

190
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.500
Oh yeah, no, I could see that. No, I don't know. I don't know. I mean,

191
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:12.200
I probably maybe incorporate it into my standup or something like that.

192
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.620
<v 1>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

193
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.770
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

194
00:10:21.771 --> 00:10:24.200
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

195
00:10:24.201 --> 00:10:27.890
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

196
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.880
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

197
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.710
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.

198
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.120
<v 2>Okay.</v>
