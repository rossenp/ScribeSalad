00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.900
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Russell Simmons, he lives in like,</v>

2
00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:09.080
where does he live in like Bali or Indonesia or something like that.

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.180
He was doing, uh, an Instagram live and he's doing it.

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.760
Cross-legged with like, uh,

5
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.140
some crazy yoga Shaw over his knees and. And like,

6
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:23.630
it looked like an Ash rom and he's like, he's,

7
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.710
he's basically talking like a Yogi in an astroid, this guy,

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.560
the head of Def jam. Yeah. And he got one like really, really into yoga.

9
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.390
And now he lives in some country somewhere. And just does yoga.

10
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.850
Let's do an Instagram live talking to people like, like a, like a guru.

11
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.340
<v 1>Yeah. I ain't going to go.</v>

12
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.460
<v 2>That hard. I'm not either.</v>

13
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.770
<v 3>I'll do a, I'll do a yo I.</v>

14
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.850
<v 1>Mean, I kind of do my own version of yoga. Just that I've learned.</v>

15
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.890
Do you do a little yoga? I stretch all the time. Yeah. I have to. Cause I, I,

16
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.600
uh, you know, you just get to a certain age if you don't. I mean, you know,

17
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.070
I love stretching. Yeah. You kind of got to do all that. So anyway.

18
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
<v 4>Enough of that, you ever took a yoga class. Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.410
Like hot yoga you ever do that? I, I.

20
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.420
<v 1>Almost, I just felt like I couldn't breathe. Yeah. And I remember too, also,</v>

21
00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:24.080
like my back was up. That's why I went to the class and the,

22
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.640
like the position she started out with there was the twisting was happening too

23
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:32.630
quickly. So I kinda just went down to the mat and I was doing all the thing.

24
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.800
And the teacher got like all freaked out by it really she's like, come on,

25
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:38.240
you know, let's try to stay with the class.

26
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:40.580
You can't be like busting out all these different offices.

27
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.140
And I just started laughing where I was just thinking like,

28
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.680
this is all supposed to be about listening to your body. And you're literally,

29
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.410
you're like the oil man in here trying to control.

30
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.090
This is your own little economy. And just the fact that I you're walking around,

31
00:01:56.091 --> 00:02:00.350
like you got it all figured out, you got 99% of people here,

32
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:01.730
all doing what the you say?

33
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:06.290
And one guy goes down to his mat because his back is up and you

34
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:10.220
process it. Like I'm with your authority in a yoga class.

35
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.790
So with my broad brush, I said, hot yoga.

36
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.310
That's hilarious. Yeah.

37
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.450
<v 0>You just like everything else. You know, some of them you're going to enjoy.</v>

38
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.220
Some of them are going to be really good at it.

39
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:30.170
And some of them are going to know the out of you.

40
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.740
What annoys the out of me is when they start giving you motivational advice and

41
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.390
telling you how to live your life,

42
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.750
you've got to learn to let go of things like for me,

43
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.980
and then tell some personal story. And so yeah, what I got out of that and like,

44
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:47.630
Jesus Christ, can we move on here? I didn't come here to hear your first grade.

45
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.300
I used to go to this Munchery psychology, great.

46
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.080
<v 1>Class. It was a great class, but the dude he had,</v>

47
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.920
it was awesome. I like, I was after a while I would go,

48
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:00.400
I was just psychologically this guy down.

49
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.410
And something happened to him at a Gold's gym.

50
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.680
I don't know what happened to him.

51
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.750
Like he just was forever making fun of muscle heads.

52
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.250
And I was thinking, you know, cause I've had the hybrid thing going on.

53
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.860
Like I love, you know, I up my shoulder. I loved lifting weights.

54
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:22.330
I love going to the gym and all that. And I liked the energy in a gym,

55
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.730
you know, I liked it. And um, the old school ones, right.

56
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.820
When the guys used to walk around with the towels, tucked into their, you know,

57
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.270
that and he was forever on it.

58
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.560
And then another thing that he would do with, he would, uh,

59
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.290
also somehow steer it toward like a subtle comment about lovemaking and the way

60
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.850
to, and he was putting out like his vibe that he was good in bed.

61
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.120
<v 0>Oh, that's a yoga guy move. Oh, you know, and.</v>

62
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.070
<v 2>He had the little pony tail and. It was, no, it was like a will feral character.</v>

63
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.040
It was funny as this, like, this is like,

64
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.970
it was like a real lifelike feral.

65
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.240
<v 1>Like, uh, like just really just like,</v>

66
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:13.800
I know everything kind of vibe.

67
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.970
<v 2>It wasn't, he wasn't as bad as that, but it was just, yeah, it was funny though.</v>

68
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.050
And I used to sit there.

69
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.490
<v 1>Uh, yeah, this was like this dude in New York. I remember it was hilarious.</v>

70
00:04:23.491 --> 00:04:27.420
And what was hilarious was I was bad at yoga. If there's that,

71
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:29.640
you're not supposed to even say that if you're doing it, man, you just,

72
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:31.740
you know, wherever your body's at is where you're supposed to be. Right.

73
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.460
And I just remember when he would walk around the class and he would adjust

74
00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:39.090
people, he'd always skip me and then adjust some hot chick who.

75
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.450
<v 2>Was way more flexible. And it's just like, really I'm doing it right.</v>

76
00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:45.360
As I'm sitting over here, for some reason I never needed an adjustment.

77
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.300
And it was like the nineties.

78
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.240
<v 1>So you can get away with this.</v>

79
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.160
There was a lot of adjusting like this almost cupping, a and like, yeah,

80
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.260
on the hips and stuff. Yeah. Hey God bless him. He's like a pied Piper.

81
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.560
You got all these hot chicks in there and he'd get them all stretched out before

82
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:04.590
he bagged up. And it worked. So I couldn't hate on him for that,

83
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.550
but it was I to get through the class. Cause I've,

84
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.520
I've such add. I was just,

85
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.240
there was like a comedy show going on within it, like, you know,

86
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.810
like house and then like a couple buddies thought you got to go, you know,

87
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.790
we'll do like a, you know, like a bet when he's going to.

88
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.050
How many times he's going to on the gym? Um, what does he say?

89
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.660
Um, what would he say he would talk about,

90
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.070
he would talk about the muscle heads coming in there and they had no

91
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:38.790
flexibility and you know, and how, uh,

92
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.970
everything was all like overdeveloped, but you know,

93
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.440
he w we'd always been doing some up a pose or something and he goes,

94
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:50.310
this works on your, so as like what machine.

95
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.170
<v 4>In the gym.</v>

96
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.230
<v 1>You know, is there a, so as machine, you know, th I can't remember like,</v>

97
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.210
it was a long time ago. And, um, at first it me off.

98
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.400
It's just like, well, I like doing curls. What's wrong.

99
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.070
And then it just became funny to me, specific.

100
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.360
<v 0>Type of guy. That's like that.</v>

101
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.310
I went to a yoga guy once used to sing in classes. He wound up like,

102
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.520
see, want to bang in this lady that was there.

103
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.360
<v 2>Back in the day, he can't do it. Now. There was a lot of band back then.</v>

104
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.340
<v 0>This was like, uh, I guess this is late nineties, early two thousands maybe.</v>

105
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.090
And he would sing in class and it was so cheap.

106
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.090
It was so disingenuous. Oh,

107
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.590
yo like he would do these like yoga songs and I was like, you are so gross.

108
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.990
<v 5>I'm glad I wasn't.</v>

109
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.960
<v 2>The only one. No, but then miss for that.</v>

110
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.120
<v 1>There was, but there was some really, uh, good ones that I found.</v>

111
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.640
I found out some really good ones.
