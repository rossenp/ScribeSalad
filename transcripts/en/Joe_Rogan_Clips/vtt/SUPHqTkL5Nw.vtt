00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And now they're telling,</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.350
they're watching these they're these influencers, which is another thing,

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.951
you know,

4
00:00:07.951 --> 00:00:11.400
you have these trans influencers and they promise these girls that if they just

5
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:15.540
go on ti everything will get better. And the problem,

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.910
okay. So why do they a couple of reasons? So one is,

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.390
um, testosterone has certain good effects,

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.430
so it delivers a euphoria and it D it suppresses

9
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:32.310
anxiety and anxiety is one of their biggest problems.

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.690
So they go on it and they feel great and they can't wait to tell their friends.

11
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.140
It makes their period go away and it redistributes fat.

12
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.360
So now these girls feel like I just beat puberty. I feel amazing.

13
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.290
I want to tell everybody how great I feel. And they are brave.

14
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:53.760
All of a sudden they're braver and socially Boulder. The problem is of course,

15
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.720
what they don't like to talk about online is all the really dangerous stuff that

16
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:01.950
comes with testosterone too. Like it leads to heart, uh, infertility,

17
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.760
like risk of cardiovascular attack. You know, a heart attack,

18
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.050
risk of heart attack was way up, um, there's, uh, you know, body, hair,

19
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:14.550
facial hair don't really want that. So.

20
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.080
<v 1>I think facial hair for.</v>

21
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.000
<v 0>For now, but it's permanent. You know, a lot of this stairs permanent can be.</v>

22
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.910
So what.

23
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.120
<v 2>But what about when trans women, when a man transitions to a woman,</v>

24
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:26.900
don't they lose a lot of their.

25
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.240
<v 0>Body hair, so they lose some of it, but some of them are, I mean,</v>

26
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:30.170
everybody's different,

27
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.860
but some of them are stuck with a five o'clock shadow for life. How.

28
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.600
<v 2>Does a kid know whether they are someone who's being easily</v>

29
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:43.100
influenced and someone who is giving into this anxiety,

30
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.370
and you are a part of the way you're describing it,

31
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.200
a contagion amongst your friends versus someone who's genuinely trans,

32
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:53.870
like someone who genuinely is born in the wrong body.

33
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.530
<v 0>We have a hundred year diagnostic history of gender dysphoria.</v>

34
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.020
We know what it is. It's not guesswork.

35
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.990
We know that it has in this whole history.

36
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.780
It typically presents in early childhood ages.

37
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.400
Two to four is when we see it starting. And it was overwhelmingly boys,

38
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.970
little boys who say, no, mommy, I'm not a boy. I'm a girl. Call me a girl.

39
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.760
Only want to play with other girls. Only want to do, you know,

40
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.970
play with girl toys in the, sometimes they hate their sexual organ. I mean,

41
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:24.290
sometimes, you know, it's a severe persistent, insistent, consistent feeling.

42
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.080
Um, and then a lot of them would grow out of it.

43
00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:29.150
And some of them wouldn't and they would become what we used to call

44
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:33.800
transsexuals. Um, now we're seeing an explosion of young women,

45
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.430
you know,

46
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.180
suddenly deciding they're trans with their friends and they are doing it in

47
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:42.710
friend groups. They'll have a whole friend group of trans kids. They are,

48
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.840
you know, doing it after social media, emerging,

49
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:47.330
transgender adults never did it because of social media.

50
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.340
And it certainly never won them friends.

51
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.763
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

52
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.810
<v 2>Um, so what about women that were trans, like you say,</v>

53
00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:00.790
predominantly it's it's boys wanted to be girls, right.

54
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.520
But what about girls who wanted to be boys.

55
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.280
<v 0>That existed too? And that also typically began in early childhood. Um,</v>

56
00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:11.460
and most, most of these kids have left alone would outgrow it.

57
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.770
So D gender dysphoria is something that, you know, most, most kids,

58
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.700
if they, even if they experienced the real thing will outgrow and some won't.

59
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.510
<v 2>Yeah. I was reading an article about gender dysphoria.</v>

60
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.510
They were talking about it. First of all, even saying gender dysphoria,

61
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.010
I think is hate speech. Now.

62
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.480
<v 0>It's in the DSM. There's the whole DSM hate speech. Yes.</v>

63
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.440
<v 4>Okay. But do you know what I.</v>

64
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.590
<v 2>Mean? To me, like everything's hate speech. Um, cause people are gone.</v>

65
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.220
They've gone so wacky, but they were talking about, um, uh, there was, uh,

66
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.140
a study done on men who experienced gender

67
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:53.820
dysphoria at a young age and then transitioned to become gay and just

68
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.400
be just became gay, just were gay.

69
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.270
And they realized like this was just a part of their process and they're happy

70
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.540
as a gay man and they didn't transition.

71
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.550
<v 0>That's very typical. Most of these,</v>

72
00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:08.010
most of these kids would emerge as homosexual.

73
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.620
<v 2>That's the thing is this, like,</v>

74
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.960
if we're cool with people being trans and we are obviously we, I mean,

75
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.710
especially adults, Y w you know,

76
00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:21.840
w w why is it better?

77
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.310
Do we like this idea that if you just leave them alone, they become gay men?

78
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.380
Or would we, I mean,

79
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.640
how many of them would be trans if they were encouraged in that direction?

80
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.080
How many of them are they happier this way or that way? Like, there are very,

81
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.100
this is a very human problem. And by human problem, I mean,

82
00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:43.200
there's not really a good answer there,

83
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.790
human problems are slippery problems where it's like, you're developed, like,

84
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.120
particularly you're talking about young people. They're,

85
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.560
we're hijacking their development. You're, you're deciding, okay.

86
00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.050
If you made a decision, you know what you're gonna do forever. All right.

87
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.590
We're going to jump in now and we're going to stop your reproductive cycle.

88
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.460
We're going to jump in now and introduce hormones that were never in your body,

89
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.860
and we're going to, well, they're a little bit tiny, tiny amounts.

90
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:11.430
We're going to Jack it up to the roof, like Hulk Hogan. And you're, you're,

91
00:05:11.431 --> 00:05:12.870
you're going to be a different person now.

92
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.280
And I sh I hope you can make this decision at 17,

93
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.610
that will affect the rest of your life. I hope you're,

94
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.530
you're mentally capable of doing that. And that's a tall order. It's.

95
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.650
<v 0>A tall order, and there's no medical oversight right now. There's no matter.</v>

96
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.070
I mean,

97
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.480
we have no idea what longterm testosterone use does to a female's body at 10 to

98
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:36.720
40 times what her body would normally have. Okay. We don't know,

99
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.300
we can talk about the risks, but we don't know,

100
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.860
but it's not presented to people as a highly experimental medicine, which it is.

101
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.160
It's not reviewed by an institutional review board. They,

102
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.550
they make it sound like it's something you can just sign a waiver for and no big

103
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.870
deal. Why is that?

104
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.540
<v 2>Why is there no review? Why, why is there no oversight?</v>

105
00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:58.340
Why is this so free and loose? I mean, is it a sign?

106
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.110
Is it a good sign that we're like more progressive now, more open-minded.

107
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:04.730
And because of that,

108
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.750
things have gotten a little slippery in terms of what we celebrate and what we

109
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:13.040
should rationally step back and objectively analyze and say, Hey,

110
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:14.960
is this really the right way to handle this?

111
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.720
<v 0>I think one of the things that happened was in 2012 w</v>

112
00:06:19.721 --> 00:06:23.840
path, which is the transgender health, you know, uh,

113
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.490
organization, um, worldwide organization, um,

114
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.380
change to an informed consent model saying that people should be able to get

115
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.960
the drugs they want, or, you know,

116
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.950
claim to need on based on their own recognizance,

117
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:41.230
you sign a form you're aware of the risk, and then you get it.

118
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.640
And the problem was maybe they felt that there was too much gate-keeping as they

119
00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:48.790
call it or too much questioning. They felt, you know,

120
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:51.700
that there were people who weren't getting the medical care, they, they needed.

121
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.520
The problem was you had 18.

122
00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:59.290
And the age of medical consent varies by state in Oregon is 15. It varies.

123
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.040
And you hit that age. You can, you can get it. You walk out the door with.

124
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.500
<v 5>That 15. Yeah. That's crazy.</v>

125
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.790
<v 2>You don't even fully form personnel and you don't. Oh my God.</v>

126
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.260
We were talking before we got on the air, um, about, uh, children,

127
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.510
like really young children transitioning.

128
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.920
You were saying that most people who transitioned no,

129
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:28.390
when they're very young, um, that is a real,

130
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.380
uh, that's a hot button topic for people, children,

131
00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:35.290
and hormone blockers and children. I,

132
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.840
what I keep going to is if you are a woman and you, you know,

133
00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:41.674
you're a woman,

134
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.720
why do you need to get these hormones injected into your body? Why,

135
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.020
why can't you just be a woman? Oh, I'll call you a woman. Like, what,

136
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:53.620
w what are we doing with all these hormones? Like, why are we complete? Like,

137
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.420
imagine you're a person who says I need to

138
00:07:58.421 --> 00:08:00.400
transition to be a woman.

139
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.940
And I know that I need a chemical that I've never had in my body before.

140
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.220
And if I get that chemical injected, then I'm going to be happy.

141
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.980
And if I get surgery, then I'm going to be happy.

142
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:10.540
This is what I'm supposed to be. Right. So.

143
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.570
<v 0>The big problem with this is that you're making all the decisions that normally</v>

144
00:08:13.571 --> 00:08:17.710
a doctor would make. Right? And any other area of medicine,

145
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.850
a doctor makes that they say, hold on, I know you think you need, you know,

146
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.470
whatever an opioid, but just relax. Let's see what your, you know,

147
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.110
I mean, that's, you know, effectively what co you know,

148
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:30.790
what facilitated the opioid crisis.

149
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.100
Doctors just handing over the prescription pad.

150
00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:36.160
And we're seeing that right now with anybody who claims to have gender

151
00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:40.040
dysphoria, they get it. They, they self-diagnose. They say, no, no, no.

152
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.720
I know it's my problem. They don't have a mental health professional who says,

153
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.870
well, wait a second, hold on. You have very high anxiety, depression.

154
00:08:46.871 --> 00:08:48.820
You have a lot of other mental health stuff going on.

155
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.230
Let's deal with that first,

156
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.880
any therapist who dares to say that might violate one of the 19 conversion

157
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.640
laws we now have in 19 different states. There's 19. Can I think it's 19. Yeah.

158
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.900
Which bands converge so-called conversion therapy, even on gender identity,

159
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:06.630
which means that therapists could lose our license. If they say, hold on,

160
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:07.920
I know you want to transition.

161
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.930
I know you think your problem is gender dysphoria.

162
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.300
Let's talk about some of your other problems.

163
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.000
<v 2>Wow. So a therapist,</v>

164
00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:17.300
if you're a 15 year old kid and you come to a therapist and you say all my

165
00:09:17.301 --> 00:09:20.180
friends are going trans, and I think I'm trans too.

166
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.790
The doctor has to essentially go with you on this little path you're

167
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.300
on. Um.

168
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.880
<v 0>The doctors feel that they have to, I mean, the American,</v>

169
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.990
the number of association, American medical association, um, endocrine society,

170
00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:35.420
I mean, you name an American pediatric society. You know,

171
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.700
all these medical professional organizations,

172
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.190
most of them have adopted affirmative care,

173
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.360
which means their job is to affirm the patient's self-diagnosis with regard to

174
00:09:44.361 --> 00:09:48.440
this one issue. I mean, they're there, you know,

175
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.190
it's turning doctors into I don't life coaches, right? I mean,

176
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.510
they're how much time.

177
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.080
<v 2>Have we been doing this for how long was the time period when this really</v>

178
00:09:57.081 --> 00:09:58.640
started to escalate in the.

179
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.020
<v 0>Last decade, we've seen it fly across the west. I mean, it's in Canada,</v>

180
00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:06.800
UK, you know, Scandinavia, we're seeing numbers across the west.

181
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.330
All of a sudden it's teenage girls.

182
00:10:08.331 --> 00:10:11.690
It's the very same girls who spread every other, you know,

183
00:10:11.691 --> 00:10:14.180
contemporary history or every other hysteria.

184
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.670
<v 2>Boy, it makes you feel like there's a lot of lawsuits coming.</v>

185
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.840
<v 0>I wouldn't be surprised. I mean, these dogs,</v>

186
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.520
these girls are getting these things so easily and they're 15, they're 16 or 17.

187
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:29.450
They're 18.

188
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.370
<v 2>How many did you interview when you were doing this book?</v>

189
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.080
<v 0>Um, so I conducted almost 200 interviews. Um,</v>

190
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:40.970
so how many teenage girls or specifically? I actually don't know.

191
00:10:40.971 --> 00:10:43.610
I interviewed a lot, a lot of people and, uh,

192
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.840
and a bunch of adolescent girls as well, and 10 more than 20, more than 10,

193
00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:51.800
but I don't know. I have to have, uh, like spreadsheets for this. Um.

194
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.040
<v 2>Did you interview ones that were happy with the transition? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

195
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.760
<v 0>Um, you know, still very young, but I, you know, um,</v>

196
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.420
I interviewed influencers and I interviewed, um,

197
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.920
parents and I interviewed adolescent girls and some of these girls have,

198
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.270
you know, stayed with their transition and claim to be happy. Um,

199
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.780
maybe they are some of them, but the problem is, if you ask,

200
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.890
if you find out objective things about their lives, right.

201
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:22.310
Are you still in school or did you drop out or did you cut off your family or

202
00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:25.850
did you not, do you have friends? What's your social life? Like?

203
00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:29.930
What's your job? Do you have a regular job? Very often. The picture is,

204
00:11:29.931 --> 00:11:33.950
is a dark one. It's not a good one. Well, isn't.

205
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.950
<v 2>That just the case of a lot of people in general though. I mean,</v>

206
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:41.120
especially people that have the kind of problems that they have to begin with

207
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.120
and they make this gigantic decision, right? The question is,

208
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.480
did this decision of transitioning help or hurt?

209
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.280
And where would they be if they didn't,

210
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.370
you were talking about them before saying they were already in a dark place.

211
00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:56.590
They're already awkward teenagers, the kind of girls who cut themselves,

212
00:11:56.591 --> 00:12:00.400
kind of girls who were prone to anorexia witchcraft. This is you're,

213
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:03.250
you're dealing with someone that doesn't have a rosy future already.

214
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.530
<v 0>Right. But I think we used to call that an angst, teenage angst. I mean,</v>

215
00:12:07.531 --> 00:12:12.150
they got past it. The problem is, yeah, you're right. Not everyone,

216
00:12:12.151 --> 00:12:14.670
but now they're getting, they're getting prescriptions.

217
00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:18.120
They're changing the whole course of their lives so easily with no medical

218
00:12:18.121 --> 00:12:19.650
oversight. What kind of numbers.

219
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.530
<v 2>Are we talking about? Like how many people are doing this? Okay. Okay.</v>

220
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.990
<v 0>So the numbers are harder to track in the United States because we don't have</v>

221
00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:28.740
centralized medical care. Um, and here,

222
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.070
but here are the numbers that I can tell you. Okay. So gender dysphoria,

223
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:37.020
you used to afflict 0.01% of the population. So one in 10,000 people.

224
00:12:37.021 --> 00:12:39.570
So probably no one you went to high school with,

225
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.980
but today we already know that 2% of high school students are identifying as

226
00:12:43.981 --> 00:12:46.740
transgender and 2% of high school students.

227
00:12:46.741 --> 00:12:50.580
You're talking about 1.1 million teenage, you know,

228
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.080
high school kids in America.

229
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.930
<v 2>2%. And when did this happen? Yeah, really most of them are grown. Most.</v>

230
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.590
<v 0>Of them are girls really well. I mean the number,</v>

231
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.400
we can just look at the number of gender surgeries. Um, and we see that in 2060,

232
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.170
between 2016 and 2017,

233
00:13:07.171 --> 00:13:11.160
the number of gender surgeries for biological females quadrupled.

234
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.450
So we know they are the biggest and fastest growing population.

235
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.450
<v 3>Wow. Two.</v>

236
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.230
<v 2>That's a stunning number 2% you go from, oh,</v>

237
00:13:22.231 --> 00:13:25.020
0.1% of the whole population,

238
00:13:25.021 --> 00:13:27.690
the whole population to 2% high schoolers.

239
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.440
And the vast majority of them are teenage girls. Yeah. What, what,

240
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.680
what is the majority like we talked about 80%. Like what is the number?

241
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.300
<v 0>But most of them are teenagers for every indication. I mean, we know that,</v>

242
00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:41.400
you know, I can give you a bunch of other statistics.

243
00:13:41.401 --> 00:13:45.120
One of the reasons it's hard to know exactly how many aside from the fact that

244
00:13:45.121 --> 00:13:49.440
we don't have a centralized control of this is because you don't need a,

245
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.380
an actual diagnosis of gender dysphoria to get testosterone.

246
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.840
So you just go in and get it. You don't need the diagnosis in England where you,

247
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.990
where you have a centralized medical care and there you do need a diagnosis.

248
00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:05.820
They know that the numbers are for T for adolescent. Girls are up over 4000%.

249
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.800
<v 1>Holy. Yeah.</v>

250
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.040
<v 2>So you knew all this stuff before you wrote the book,</v>

251
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.120
this was all the numbers that.

252
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.570
<v 0>Came out in the course of writing it. Yeah. Some of.</v>

253
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.500
<v 2>That had to kind of affirm your idea that this was a real problem. I.</v>

254
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.800
<v 0>Mean, everywhere, I looked, it seemed to be a real problem. It wasn't,</v>

255
00:14:22.801 --> 00:14:24.630
and nobody wanted to talk about it, but it's real.

256
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.570
<v 2>Well, it's just because like, even when we're talking about it, I'm like, oh,</v>

257
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.690
here's a landmine. Oh, here's a landline. Like everything. We're saying, like,

258
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.200
if you talk at all about trans people, um,

259
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:39.060
you run the risk of people off and offending people and

260
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.400
staying out, you know, you're, you're, you're,

261
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.070
you're going into an area where it's,

262
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.960
unless you are 100% in support of their

263
00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:52.520
decision and their rights and you, you, you celebrate them.

264
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.110
You're going to get in real trouble.

265
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:54.611
<v 0>Right.</v>

266
00:14:54.611 --> 00:14:57.520
But that's why we have this problem because nobody will talk about it because

267
00:14:57.521 --> 00:14:59.260
parents will call me and say,

268
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.710
I I've been pro LGBTQ my whole life.

269
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.720
I just don't think this is right for my daughter.

270
00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.580
I can't even talk to my friends about it.

271
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.930
I'll get fired from a job if anybody finds this out. But my daughter's not,

272
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.840
she's got a lot of problems, but gender dysphoria is not one of them. Like,

273
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.820
I don't think this is right. And I don't think it's going to cure.

274
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.510
<v 2>It. And if you have to work and you're at work all day, you know,</v>

275
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.640
how much time do you have to even convince your daughter,

276
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.760
your daughter's with her wacky friends, eight hours a day.

277
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.460
<v 0>And she's on the internet. And the problem is her school.</v>

278
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:31.780
Her school's already filled out a form calling her Jimmy right. For a year.

279
00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:35.590
They don't even tell you, Ooh,
