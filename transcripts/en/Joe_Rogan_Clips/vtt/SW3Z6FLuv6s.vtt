00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.060
My training partners just beat the crap out of me for weeks on end.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.380
And I went through that and we asked Mike like, Mike,

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.700
what do you think about this? I use this normal feeling like this. Mike's like,

5
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:18.720
yeah, hell yeah, that's normal. And, uh, and it had a special way.

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:23.430
And in his voice, he say there was certain times where, you know, you,

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.340
you would come in the room in the practice and you'd watch me practice. And,

8
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.550
and you see my training partner just be to kick the out of me.

9
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.160
You would think he was the champion. You know,

10
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.910
you would think he was a champion that I was just a scrub in there giving him

11
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:40.050
some rounds, but then you take them out there and you put him in front of, uh,

12
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.600
under the lights put 17,000,

13
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.510
20,000 people around him and he can't do it.

14
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.040
And he just can't do it. That's what makes champions,

15
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.970
champions being able to deal and handle all the chaotic stuff that happens

16
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:58.650
before, after, and what's happening around them. And, and so I,

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.570
you know, that was just like, man, you know, he's so right, because some guys,

18
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.490
and I've watched several guys in the practice room of beef doing techniques.

19
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.790
It's like, how's that even possible, like hitting you with crazy stuff,

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.020
but then you put them in there,

21
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.290
put them under the lights and it looks like he's an amateur.

22
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.440
<v 1>That is one of the weird things about gyms.</v>

23
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.550
Is those guys who are gym killers. Yes. Inside the gym,

24
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:28.290
they are killers. And then for whatever reason, they can't do it, can't do it.

25
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.060
My thought is always like,

26
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.210
can't you teach those guys how to keep it together when it comes to a fight?

27
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:34.590
Or is that just something that's inside?

28
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.160
<v 0>It's something that's inside because I've seen guys that they know,</v>

29
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.490
like these guys put on clinics inside the practice room,

30
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.430
but then they get out there and they just find a way to lose.

31
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.610
They find a way to lose a can't deal with it. They can't handle the pressure.

32
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.130
They can handle everything that comes with it.

33
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:54.960
They just find a way to lose to where you're just like, how is that possible?

34
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.150
Even if the guy's nowhere near their level, they find a way to lose.

35
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.440
<v 1>It's crazy that you have had a bunch of fights where you don't remember</v>

36
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.600
most of the fight like that.

37
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.990
That's a thing that a lot of fighters don't necessarily talk about,

38
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.150
but it's a reality of heart.

39
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.400
<v 2>Yeah. The, my second favorite gray were, um, evil Vien was the referee.</v>

40
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.870
I remember, I think the fourth round mark, my coach mark was like, you know,

41
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:25.290
telling me we got one more round in my head. I'm like one more round.

42
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.590
What happened? Two, three, and four. I didn't remember at all. And also I,

43
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.610
when I dropped me, I, I rolled my ankle really bad, probably a grade two sprain.

44
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.180
And I remember in the fourth round coming too, and my ankle was hurting me.

45
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.460
I'm like, what happened? I have no idea what out my ankle.

46
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.880
And even got walking back, you know, I was just kinda, you know,

47
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.910
I don't know if sometimes you get rocked to get depressed. For some reason,

48
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.880
I noticed that even in the gym, when he get what I get rocked, they,

49
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:50.370
I got a little bit of depression going on for some reason.

50
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.640
<v 1>But what does it feel like when you say depression? Like my middle.</v>

51
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.050
<v 2>Bowl, you know, you're just down on yourself, you know? Um, I was emotional.</v>

52
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.270
I think it was crying. The gray fight in the, in the locker room. I think they,

53
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:03.640
they have camera back there and there's a video of me, like a second.

54
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.480
<v 1>Fight when you stopped him.</v>

55
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.690
<v 2>Not the second fight. Put the, the sec, all this. That was the second fight.</v>

56
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.500
Not the third fight.

57
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.570
<v 1>The third fight you stopped. That's what I sacrificed.</v>

58
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:15.100
You want the fights that you had with gray were so crazy.

59
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.320
They were, so he was so big.

60
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.903
<v 2>He's a big boy was.</v>

61
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.350
<v 1>So big for 55, you know? And you were a guy didn't cut any weight at all.</v>

62
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.430
<v 2>And I was, I literally would eat breakfast on Wayne Day. Wow.</v>

63
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.103
<v 1>That's crazy.</v>

64
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.730
Did you ever think back then about dropping down or were you just like, it,

65
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:34.564
I'm the champ.

66
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.900
<v 2>I was like, I'm a champ. Why should I go down? I mean, I'm winning,</v>

67
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.260
I'm beating these guys. Um, even the best satisfies, they were super close,

68
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:45.090
you know, it could have went either way and, um, but I just felt, you know,

69
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.290
all right, I'll go down now. I lost two in a row here.

70
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.620
W w what more can I gain from here? Let me go down to 45. And that's,

71
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:53.350
that's when I fought out though for the, uh, for the 45 pound belt.

72
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.640
<v 1>When you think about it, like if you had a chance to do it all over again,</v>

73
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.650
like if you had to engineer your career all over again,

74
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:02.230
would you do it exactly the same way? Would you fight a 55? Well,

75
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:04.630
you definitely would against BJ, right? Yeah.

76
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.770
<v 2>I can't. You can't go back and change those things. You know,</v>

77
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.700
it all worked out for me, you know, I, I got a world title. Um, I had a prim,

78
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:15.220
you know, I'm continuing to have a pretty good career. Uh,

79
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.070
there's always things you wish you could do differently. You know, you just,

80
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.900
I can't be that guy. That's going to say,

81
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:22.690
I wish I did this wish that things went the way they went.

82
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.800
<v 3>And then, you know, the fight went the way it did, came down to the fifth round,</v>

83
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.270
you know, um, that's where that fifth round came from was,

84
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.120
was free for them. You know, the,

85
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:39.280
the love that they gave me to get me even just to give me there, you know,

86
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:42.310
cause I was ready to break man. I was, I, I,

87
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.860
I was in pieces so many days, uh, in that camp, I, uh,

88
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.260
you know, it was, um,

89
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.260
it was just a roller coaster of emotions, but having them, you know,

90
00:04:56.261 --> 00:05:00.730
my father, my brothers behind me, that's where that strength came from. And, uh,

91
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.900
and everything we went through before the fight. But, um,

92
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.450
that's why I was so emotional in the cage. I mean,

93
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:11.500
you'd be emotional anyways for a title fight, but, um, you know,

94
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.190
it was, uh, it was something else just to,

95
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.350
just to get there, you know, and, and, and have that opportunity.

96
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.260
And you could really amount of UCLA. I mean, Maddie UCO, he

97
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.670
he's right there with his hands, like.

98
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.420
<v 1>Right there. Ooh. Did it bother you that, uh,</v>

99
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.710
he was, he had a lot of sour grapes after the fight gay guard did.

100
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.460
<v 3>It, did it, did he.</v>

101
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.100
<v 1>Didn't, uh, didn't really credit you for the fight.</v>

102
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.040
He was just saying mostly that you on steroids.

103
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.840
<v 3>Mom. Yeah. Paying her respects, giving him a hug.</v>

104
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.280
<v 1>I mean, I understand that felt bad cause he lost,</v>

105
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:02.480
but I felt like the way he handled it was uncharacteristic for him. He was.

106
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.170
<v 3>The treatment too. We were so respectful before, after the fight,</v>

107
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:09.530
I went up to him, you know, before they made the decision, I went up to him,

108
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:12.140
I shook his hand. I said, man, it was an honor, you know,

109
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:16.600
so much respect for you. Um, it was an honor to battle with you, you know,

110
00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:21.500
I think to thank you and we shook hands and hugged and, and uh,

111
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.410
you know, but then he didn't stay after they raised my hand,

112
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:28.730
he walked right out. We didn't shake hands again and then everything else. Yeah.

113
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.070
It really surprised me. Um, I,

114
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:33.950
I think it was just hard to fathom because you know,

115
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:37.580
this was my 10th fight he had already had over 50. He was a big,

116
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.220
he was a big favorite. Uh, I, I just don't think, um, you know, he, he,

117
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.660
they were very confident. They were very confident, um,

118
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.710
leading up to the fight and I don't think anyone imagined me to walk out of

119
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:52.544
there with that belt.

120
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.250
<v 4>Um, the plan was formed in 1865 at the end of the civil</v>

121
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:02.330
war. And it was formed by a, by six, uh, Confederate soldiers,

122
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.180
um, who were of Irish and Scottish descent. And what they did was they borrowed,

123
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.421
uh, the,

124
00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:14.420
the rituals or similar rituals and names and a mystery from the Scottish

125
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.250
Rite, the masons ran this and all that kind of. Exactly.

126
00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:23.900
Precisely dragons. Yep. Yep. Okay. So here's how the hierarchy works. All right.

127
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.880
So like I said, over the years,

128
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.980
central split apart into different splinter groups, a plan. So,

129
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.410
and they all arrivals with each other.

130
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.830
If you see a couple different plan groups out in public,

131
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.480
they will hold a unified front, but behind closed doors,

132
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.680
they don't like each other real. Yeah. You know, w w we're real clown, you know,

133
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.570
that, you know, there are, want to be plan competition. Another thing,

134
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.740
because they may have been in the same town at one time and something happened,

135
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.940
somebody embezzled some plan dues or didn't get promoted, you know, whatever.

136
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.350
So anyway,

137
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.810
if you have a chapter of your particular Klan group

138
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.130
in another state, or in multiple states,

139
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.960
you may then consider yourself or your group to be a national clan group.

140
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.080
Therefore you must have a national leader.

141
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.100
So oversees all the states in which you have a chapter of your particular group.

142
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.390
So, um, we call our national leader,

143
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:28.970
the president and clan terminology.

144
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.090
That person is known as the Imperial wizard. Anybody who was,

145
00:08:33.091 --> 00:08:37.640
who is prefixed with the word Imperial means that person is a national

146
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:41.480
officer wizard being the top. I, as an Imperial wizard,

147
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:45.440
be like a president and Imperial cliff will be like a vice-president.

148
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.350
And he had a secretary of treasury, his whole nine yards.

149
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.690
And then the next level down would be state, uh, the head of the state,

150
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.420
which we call the governor. That person is known as a grand dragon.

151
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.210
Anybody grand is on the state level.

152
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.070
They'd officer dragon being the top governor a grand playlists would be like a

153
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:09.200
Lieutenant governor and then secretary treasurer. And then within the state,

154
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.810
you have counties. The county leader is known as the great Titan,

155
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:18.120
anybody on the great level isn't as on the county level, um, within the county,

156
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.820
you have districts what they call Collabrance.

157
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.050
And we would call a district leader, a mayor, a Councilman alderman.

158
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.010
That individual is known as a, uh, as an exalted Cyclops.

159
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.150
<v 1>So exalted Cyclops. So if you want to dress them, you would say, sir,</v>

160
00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:40.410
exalted Cyclops. Yeah. Wow. That's hilarious.

161
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.870
<v 5>Uh, so who are you voting for now?</v>

162
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:44.523
<v 1>Ah, ah.</v>

163
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.940
<v 5>What a whirlwind you're in, huh? Strange.</v>

164
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.990
<v 1>Strange to watch it take place. Cause it's so it's so obvious what it is.</v>

165
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:56.550
It's a no they're using me to make him look bad that

166
00:09:56.551 --> 00:10:00.150
he supports me or that he used my endorsement. Right.

167
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:03.300
I had no idea they were going to do that. Either the Bernie Sanders people just,

168
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.600
and all I said is I'm probably going to vote for him. I said,

169
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:10.230
I like Tulsi Gabard I really love her. I love him. I love Andrew Yang.

170
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.130
Those are the people that I think like, here's, here's a really important point.

171
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.150
I'm a moron.

172
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.890
If you're basing who you're going to vote for on precedent for president based

173
00:10:19.891 --> 00:10:22.890
on mine. Right? Like what I, like, I know I'm not,

174
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.420
I'm not that balls deep into this stuff. It's not, it's not, I'm not the guy.

175
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.240
<v 5>Strange. And, and this is a little out of left field,</v>

176
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:32.250
but how much of this is based on your look,

177
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.610
if you aren't a muscular baldheaded white guy,

178
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.150
I don't know if this would be a, I bet this would be a different game.

179
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.390
<v 1>It's easy to paint me as a. Right. And also it's,</v>

180
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:47.070
what's really funny is the thing that I said in the video was exactly what they

181
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:50.910
did. I said, if you just take the worst aspects of someone,

182
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.690
take out everything else, magnify it. Right. And you know,

183
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:55.800
you could paint them out to be a real piece of. Of course.

184
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.450
<v 5>I have 10 texts today, but.</v>

185
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.340
<v 1>You said is that it's hard to do that with Bernie because he's really consistent</v>

186
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:03.390
guy. He's the real deal. He.

187
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.300
<v 5>Was out on the front lines in the sixties, the civil rights.</v>

188
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.950
<v 1>Right. Getting changed to people and getting arrested. Yeah, he was, um,</v>

189
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.830
that doesn't mean he's going to be a great president. I don't, I don't know.

190
00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:17.280
What's required to be a president. I really don't. And I don't understand.

191
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.700
What's required to make sure the economy functions correctly. And also,

192
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:24.540
I don't understand. What's required to make the military function correctly. No,

193
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.080
it's just guesswork. I mean, maybe we're better off with Trump.

194
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.630
Maybe we're better off with someone else. I don't know.
