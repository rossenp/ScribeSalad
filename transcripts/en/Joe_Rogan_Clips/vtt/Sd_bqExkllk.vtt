00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.990
It's way more fascinating when someone like you talks about it versus some

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.870
random kook. Yeah. That's,

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.160
that's what it makes me incredibly interested is the,

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.220
just your credibility in the fact that this is not,

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.280
you don't have a history of seeing wacky that other people don't see,

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.720
not just this once and, but it's on video and that there's other ones as well.

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.950
It's really strange.

9
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.970
I've seen people try to explain it away and what I don't like about when they

10
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.390
explain it away or attempt to explain it away is that they're trying really

11
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:36.750
hard. They're not going, who knows what this thing is.

12
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.850
They're not looking at it like cleanly.

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.540
They're looking at it like a quote unquote skeptic.

14
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.540
I don't like the idea of being a skeptic.

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.300
Not that I don't think you should be skeptical of certain things.

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.470
I certainly think you should be,

17
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:52.530
but there's a lot of people that brand themselves as skeptics.

18
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.250
And I think it's a lazy way to look at things I really do,

19
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.450
because I think you're just looking for the holes and things without looking at

20
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:02.670
it objectively. If you want it to be a scientist,

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.540
if you want it to be someone who is a, a fan of science,

22
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.240
then you have to look at it as a thing,

23
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.230
like look at this information and let's study this without any bias,

24
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.140
any preconceived notions. I don't think they're doing that.

25
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.921
They're looking at it.

26
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:21.690
And they're trying to find a way where they can justify that it's fake.

27
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.791
And they're,

28
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:26.610
they're just doing all sorts of mental gymnastics to try to make it fake,

29
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.780
that video that you show where that thing slips off to the left and takes off at

30
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.710
incredible rates of speed. That alone should freak people the out.

31
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.120
<v 1>Yeah. Well I think because people confuse all the time,</v>

32
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:40.280
like we took the video and it was another crew that took the video.

33
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:45.230
We watched it for five minutes with our eyeballs and there was four of us and we

34
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:47.780
all have the same story. We all saw the same stuff.

35
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.710
We all came back and looked at each other and scratched our head and said, WTF,

36
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.640
you know, I mean serious. What was that? Um, you know,

37
00:01:55.641 --> 00:02:00.260
and then what do you do? You, you move on. We never saw it again.

38
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.300
Um, I imagine they probably saw them on radar after that, but I think they're.

39
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.130
<v 0>Probably seeing them on radar all the time.</v>

40
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:10.520
They just don't bring it to the attention of the general public. Oh yeah.

41
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.170
<v 1>Because if you don't, you know, for,</v>

42
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:15.320
for a ship when they see something and you know, you know, what is that? Well,

43
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:17.030
you don't have any way to go out there and look at it.

44
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.090
<v 0>Right? Like when you were talking about how they were informing you,</v>

45
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:23.000
that they were seeing these things previous to your, uh,

46
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.950
your mission when you were doing this exercise and they let you

47
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:32.450
know that they're seeing these things, did you say, Hey, how frequent is this?

48
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.280
Is this something that happens all the time?

49
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.940
<v 1>Um, I didn't get into that. Ours was more of the moment of, you know,</v>

50
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:39.620
when he's telling us, Hey, for the last two weeks,

51
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:42.740
we've been tracking these things and we don't know what the they are.

52
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.190
<v 0>But you don't know whether or not it was just those two weeks or maybe it was a</v>

53
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:48.830
year ago. There was other similar situations or.

54
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.940
<v 1>So other situations that have happened out there. But I would say, you know,</v>

55
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:57.740
for this, I don't even know when you got to take it serious. We have a tendency.

56
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.420
If we don't know what it is, if we just ignore it, it'll go away. You know?

57
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:04.240
And I joke, you know, there was an incident years.

58
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.460
Sprint is probably not too far off the same timeframe,

59
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.630
but I think it was like the constellation was doing her workups before she got

60
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.210
to decommission and an Oscar class,

61
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:17.950
a Soviet Oscar class submarine surfaced behind her. Right.

62
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.730
And then it's now it's like, you know, go to battle stations, world war three,

63
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:22.450
how did this,

64
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.890
how did this foreign submarine get in our area and spend monitoring our workups?

65
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:29.050
That's a big deal, right? I said,

66
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.720
but now we go out and we have these things that are coming at will,

67
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.230
and there's nothing we can do about it. We don't know what they are.

68
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.850
We have confirmed sighting by two air crew, four of us,

69
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.080
two planes that said, look, this is not, this is not an airplane.

70
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:47.140
This is not a weather balloon. This is not a blip. It has performance.

71
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.490
Well beyond, you know,

72
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.640
in the airplanes that we were flying at the time were literally brand new,

73
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.520
super Hornets, right out of the Boeing factory. I mean, these, these,

74
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:59.170
these were brand new, uh, first block to series that came out and you go,

75
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.550
why wasn't something done? You know, it's like, oh, we don't know what it is.

76
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.270
I think it's good. Now, you know, the moves that have happened over the last,

77
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.600
you know, two years since the original article came out, that, you know,

78
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.480
they're there. Now there's a new reporting for the pilots.

79
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.090
The Navy's acknowledged, Hey, these things, we don't know what they were.

80
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.600
You know, they're, they're starting to take it serious because, you know,

81
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:22.810
I know there are other events that are not out, um,

82
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.900
recent events where people have been called in to go, Hey, I've seen this thing.

83
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.590
So the investigation process is still going on. You know, we don't,

84
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.670
we don't stop in the military. Doesn't stop. Even if you take funding away,

85
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.170
we don't stop. You know, we don't stop until we're told to stop. So,

86
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.980
you know, what's, what's going on. I, you know, you go, well, a tip ended,

87
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.140
you know, they spent four and a half million dollars a year on it.

88
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.650
I think it was four. And it's 22 million over the five years. So you go,

89
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.680
what are they doing since then? Well, I mean,

90
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.440
I'm pretty sure there's still people looking at this and there's still people

91
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:56.600
that are taking this serious. I will tell you that, uh,

92
00:04:56.601 --> 00:04:58.360
I won't get into specifics, but there are,

93
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.610
there are people inside the United States government that are taking this

94
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:05.110
serious. And I've been, I've went down to DC twice to talk to folks,

95
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.070
you know, behind closed doors to go. Cause they want to hear the story.

96
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.190
And I've got a lot of, you gotta be joking. I mean, this,

97
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.490
this seriously happened. And, and, and I'm like, yeah, it did happen.

98
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.840
And it is real, you know, what are you doing? So.

99
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.370
<v 0>What kind of people are you talking to.</v>

100
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.820
<v 1>High level government officials is what I'll say.</v>

101
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.970
And most of that is because that conversation is between me and them.

102
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:30.150
And I don't want people speculating, but you can say, um,

103
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.150
high-level government officials I have talked to, well.

104
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.540
<v 0>That was always the speculation about like,</v>

105
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.570
what would someone do if they became president? Well,

106
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:44.100
the first thing I would do is I would tell everybody about the UFO's I would ask

107
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.880
immediately what's going on? And I always thought about, I said,

108
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.450
how many people actually know what's going on? And how much of the information,

109
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.210
I mean, it's not like if they're dealing with something like this, like your,

110
00:05:56.211 --> 00:05:57.120
your experience,

111
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.090
it seems like what you described is what is known.

112
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.730
So it's this anomalous event with this thing

113
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.020
defies our current understanding of technology, and then it's gone.

114
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.680
And so what do you have? You don't have anything else other than that?

115
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:18.560
Like what other information does anybody have?

116
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.860
<v 1>Well, I would say, I would say this because I've talked to Bob, Bob Lozar yeah,</v>

117
00:06:23.861 --> 00:06:27.340
we did an event together and I'll leave it to everyone to,

118
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:31.750
if it's up to you to believe Bob, I'll say this Bob's a normal guy.

119
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.130
Bob's not crazy.

120
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.700
<v 0>This is not crazy at all at all. That was the weirdest thing about talking. But.</v>

121
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.150
<v 1>When you, when you look at it and go, cause I had asked Bob, I said,</v>

122
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.310
w what he describes in the technology that when he talks about his, his story,

123
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.630
I said, well, do you honestly think we could, you know, reverse engineer it?

124
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.790
I said, how long do you think it would take us?

125
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.510
And his response to me was another a hundred years. He goes,

126
00:06:55.511 --> 00:06:59.830
David was so far beyond, he goes the stuff that he says, he worked on.

127
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.250
He's like, you know, you, you, he was on your podcast. Cause I watched it,

128
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.820
you know, Hey, there was no wires. And cause I had asked him when he said,

129
00:07:06.821 --> 00:07:10.060
you first described the ship that he got to see. He said, I used to say,

130
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:12.790
you know, they built it. And then it was like wax and you'd heat it up. He goes,

131
00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:16.060
now I would say it was built with 3d printing because now with 3d printing we

132
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.070
can build things literally from the ground up. And it'd be,

133
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:22.000
it's basically built as one, not panels, no rivets. It's just made.

134
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.540
And um, so when you talk about that and you go, well,

135
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.820
it's still another a hundred years. So you go, well,

136
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.590
what if you had the technology? We still, if, if, if what Bob says is correct,

137
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:36.850
we still don't understand it. And how fast would it take us to understand that?

138
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.630
I mean, if it's, if it's driven by something that we don't even have on earth,

139
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.900
which is when he talks about that element, um,

140
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.640
we can't create it. You know, we can create it for a microsecond and then it,

141
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.020
you know, it, it decays and we call them at one 15. Yeah. So, you know,

142
00:07:53.021 --> 00:07:55.870
I think we're there. We're still a long ways off, you know,

143
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.500
I'll argue with the people that go, you know, are we really alone?

144
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.880
I was telling Jeremy, we used to go out on, on goggles in the middle of Pacific.

145
00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:07.120
There's no light pollution night vision goggles. So we can see, well,

146
00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:09.370
you go out at night and he'd, I'd be on like a tanker hopper.

147
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.470
So I'm just hanging out, not doing anything,

148
00:08:11.471 --> 00:08:13.930
drive around in circles with the autopilot on you just turn all the lights down

149
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:14.471
in the cockpit.

150
00:08:14.471 --> 00:08:17.380
So you have no night light pollution and just roll your head back and look up.

151
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.870
There's billions and billions and billions of stars out there. And you know,

152
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:26.890
I always look up cause I'm like, you know, are we alone? And I go,

153
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.520
I'd look up and go. Well, if we're the only ones around and that's,

154
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.970
and I'm looking at everything, I'm looking at some, it's a pretty sad place.

155
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.110
It's a pretty lonely universe. I asked my astrophysics, prof that once I said,

156
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.600
you believe in extra terrestrial life. And she's like, of course not.

157
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.870
And I said, well, there's billions and billions of planets. You think we're it?

158
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.690
I mean, just the, the probability of it is you'd go, oh,

159
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:51.220
there's probably something else out there. And I'm not crazy.

160
00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:55.320
I'm just opening up the possibility that we are not the only planet that has on

161
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:55.620
it.

162
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.480
<v 0>I think people don't like to seem silly. They don't like to be foolish.</v>

163
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.360
And I think when people start talking about anything,

164
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:05.130
that's not proven or anything,

165
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:07.920
that's connected to a bunch of loony people that are making up stories,

166
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:12.420
which UFO certainly are UFO's are connected to so many people that have made up

167
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:15.840
so many stories. What was that gentleman's name from sweat?

168
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:17.880
You would know that guy who was from another country,

169
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:22.170
Billy something or another Billy Meyer seems a hundred percent full of.

170
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.170
<v 2>Yeah. He is proven to have done tons of hoaxes with this, but here's the deal.</v>

171
00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:30.800
Sometimes I think people have a real experience and they're always like chasing

172
00:09:30.801 --> 00:09:34.670
that dragon and they get UFO disease and the brain goes Bismarck. Right.

173
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.810
I know that there are people that have had profound experiences and then they

174
00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:40.190
can't ever replicate them.

175
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.340
So then they just start going crazy and I don't blame them for it.

176
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.110
But you got someone like commander Fravor when he saw that AAV anomalous

177
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.560
aerospace vehicle, his reaction was, I want to fly it.

178
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.880
That's a pretty cool reaction. I'd like to fly it. Imagine I that thing.

179
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.870
<v 1>Well, that's what I told my buddy. He was my XO at the time Dell, I had got PAC.</v>

180
00:09:59.871 --> 00:10:02.600
After all this happened, he looks at me and we're just standing ready.

181
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:06.200
Or when he goes, Hey dude, I go and he goes, what, what do you think it is?

182
00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:08.870
I go, I have no idea, but it was pretty freaking impressive.

183
00:10:08.871 --> 00:10:12.800
And I'd like to fly it. Of course. And he goes, yeah, I go, I mean, it was,

184
00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:15.500
it was, you know, it's just like any pot.

185
00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:16.730
You always want to find the coolest thing.

186
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.360
<v 0>Yeah, of course you race car driver. You want to drive the fastest car.</v>

187
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.990
<v 1>That's it. Now you look at and go, well, that's some we don't have. Yeah. Th.</v>

188
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.570
<v 2>This idea that, you know, maybe we're not alone,</v>

189
00:10:26.571 --> 00:10:29.540
that some of these other stars have planets that are maybe technologically

190
00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:32.630
advanced. So the next thing people say, and you know,

191
00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:33.830
new areas are going to say, well,

192
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.380
they're not coming here because the distance is so vast.

193
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.500
Hold the up from the very beginning.

194
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.320
When Bob was our came forward and talked about field propulsion, gravity,

195
00:10:42.321 --> 00:10:46.070
propulsion distance becomes completely irrelevant.

196
00:10:46.071 --> 00:10:49.130
So if we believe the, and the radars, right, and commander,

197
00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:51.530
Fravor saw this thing, moving like a ping pong ball, glass of water,

198
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.640
it's gravity propelled.

199
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.150
That's why you can make those maneuvers without exploding. Okay.

200
00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.230
Then distance becomes completely irrelevant for travel.

201
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.850
You're literally warping time and space. You're falling into place.

202
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:05.481
<v 0>Well,</v>

203
00:11:05.481 --> 00:11:09.830
it's like the idea of showing someone a video on your phone long before video

204
00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:13.130
was ever invented people. Like, what are you talking about?

205
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:16.880
Like before photography was invented, which is shockingly recent, right?

206
00:11:16.881 --> 00:11:21.140
You got to draw pictures of things you saw just like those people that drew or

207
00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:21.950
painted that,

208
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.790
those images of those men in whatever those things were with Christ in the

209
00:11:25.791 --> 00:11:27.440
background. He,

210
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:32.300
the idea that we could understand what some insanely impressive technology

211
00:11:32.301 --> 00:11:35.390
from a planet that is nowhere near us could,

212
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.300
could manifest. That's great. It's nuts.

213
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.140
<v 2>Yeah. Bob, Bob art talks a lot about this. Remember he's a young guy, right?</v>

214
00:11:42.141 --> 00:11:44.990
In 1989, he gets shown something.

215
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.010
And all of a sudden he's trying to interpret it through 1989 technology.

216
00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:52.370
So he said, it looks like it was injection molded and cause that's what he had.

217
00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:55.660
And then I sent him this thing about nanotechnology and you know,

218
00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.040
working towards an atomic printer. He's like, dude, that makes a lot more sense.

219
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:04.210
So he has to view it through where he saw it in 1989. However, I will say this.

220
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.930
It is my knowledge that we understand exactly how these craft work.

221
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.820
Our one limiting factor is our material science. We can't replicate,

222
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:14.950
not the fuel source itself is another. And you say,

223
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.730
we know exactly how they work. It doesn't break our laws of physics.

224
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:21.520
This concept of amplification of gravity,

225
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:23.830
this concept of gravity propulsion.

226
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.930
We understand how things can move from point a to point B almost instantaneously

227
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.300
w our physics doesn't disallow it,

228
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:36.130
but our material science and the fuel to create that machine,

229
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.930
that we, we have machines from other places. So we have mean, well,

230
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:44.080
Bob Alizar, whether you believe him or not. Um,

231
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.580
there was a program I have other witnesses that I will be bringing forward about

232
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.000
S four, where he worked. We have, you.

233
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.700
<v 0>Have other witnesses that worked with alongside.</v>

234
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:54.010
<v 2>Bob. Oh,</v>

235
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.950
the corroborate Bob's account in that they

236
00:12:58.951 --> 00:13:02.340
saw him get on and off the red and whites, the Janet flights that come on,

237
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.390
somebody that went to papoose lake and was stopped by, by, uh,

238
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.970
non-military guards. At that time,

239
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.530
people that were aware of it site for and ITI exploitation

240
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.393
projects.

241
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.900
One is an Sr 71 pilot that I've been talking with for a couple of years.

242
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.300
These people are coming forward now. And it's like,

243
00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:24.960
I'm sick and tired of doing it. These little nitpicky things about Bob, okay.

244
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.130
There was a program there, there was a back engineering program.

245
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.230
They've admitted their materials.

246
00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:33.840
So this is like the metamaterials you heard about in the New York times.

247
00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:38.490
All that we have materials associated with UFO's that are interesting.

248
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.350
What is that? What are you talking about?

249
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.620
So this was something that was launched in the first New York times article,

250
00:13:43.621 --> 00:13:45.090
I believe in December of 2017,

251
00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:49.920
that there is studies being done right now on materials associated with

252
00:13:49.921 --> 00:13:50.880
UFO's right.

253
00:13:50.881 --> 00:13:55.320
So actual metals that have come off of you could say crashes.

254
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.251
<v 0>Who was that,</v>

255
00:13:56.251 --> 00:14:00.210
that explained that there was something that they were with Eric Weinstein that

256
00:14:00.211 --> 00:14:04.650
was explaining that there was someone who reportedly has something along.

257
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.990
<v 2>Those lines. Valet has 17 samples.</v>

258
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.330
<v 0>17 Samples. How does one guy get 17 samples?</v>

259
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.220
<v 2>He's Jack valet, right? So he is the first ever for the United States.</v>

260
00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:17.100
Military created a computer program for, you know,

261
00:14:17.101 --> 00:14:19.830
for the study of UFO's for project blue books. He's an old school guy.

262
00:14:19.831 --> 00:14:23.010
They modeled him after in the close encounters movie,

263
00:14:23.011 --> 00:14:24.870
it's modeled after jock valet, the French guy.

264
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.120
So he's kinda like been involved with this.

265
00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:29.760
He's had more access to government databases than any of us.

266
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:35.040
He went around and collected samples from known, you know, crashes,

267
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.670
or like when things will come off and what's the conclusion, well,

268
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:39.750
they're studying them right now.

269
00:14:39.751 --> 00:14:43.260
There was just something on Fox about they're studying some of these materials

270
00:14:43.261 --> 00:14:46.080
and what they will find, because I actually, the ones they're talking about,

271
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.920
I actually took to New Mexico and had five scientists study it. Um,

272
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.330
about five years, I got my hands on it, got to study it,

273
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:57.140
the famous parts they're talking about now it's layered.

274
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.800
And the way it's layered is what they're trying to see if it's anomalous Ella

275
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.340
mentally, or the way that they're, the elements are bound together.

276
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.630
And also the, the atomic level of, of layering is what's interesting.

277
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.730
We'll find out if it's explain.

278
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.770
<v 0>What you're talking about. What is this thing that you saw?</v>

279
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.070
<v 2>Okay, well, there is, there are a lot of different samples,</v>

280
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.240
but when you get a sample of something and you can hop into these samples, uh,

281
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.550
the ones that, that I looked at, um,

282
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.510
they ranged from about this size down there,

283
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.360
they range from the size of orange. Yeah.

284
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:32.990
Size of no orange to the size of a quarter. These are materials, right?

285
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:37.610
The materials from a crash. So that's the allegedly, or there's a known crash.

286
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.000
This is in the public domain rather than, you know, government controlled.

287
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.370
So what we were, what I was looking at,

288
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:47.270
or having the scientists look at is isotopically and Ella, mentally,

289
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.630
what are the elements that are in this? Are they engineered?

290
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.690
And what's the conclusion? Well, I, I'm not, uh,

291
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.060
I'm gonna leave it to the people that are doing it now who have much better

292
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:56.900
machines than I had.

293
00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.693
<v 0>Actually cliff notes.</v>

294
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.470
<v 2>Yeah. They, from what I understand, there's, um, uh,</v>

295
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.710
atomic layering, there, there are levels of it. Like we do with graphing.

296
00:16:06.711 --> 00:16:11.180
We laid down these layers that are, uh, basically oriented at a certain degree.

297
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:13.430
That's how you get a superconductor or something like that.

298
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:18.350
If you take a piece of graphing and you, and it's highly machined, so it's not,

299
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.560
doesn't deviate from that atomic layering, you can push it right through ice,

300
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:23.990
like hot knife through butter. It's the weirdest feeling in the world.

301
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.240
Cause you just take this piece of what feels like graphing.

302
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.570
And it goes right through butter because it's a superconductor and the heat from

303
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:33.740
your hand melts the ice. So that, that is a metamaterial. It doesn't occur.

304
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:38.720
Naturally humans created it and it has special properties because of the

305
00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:43.100
way it's atomically layered. So if these materials are from somewhere else,

306
00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.060
then we suspect that they're going to be highly machined,

307
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.160
that they're going to be created for special use.

308
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.960
So my whole point is our material science has not caught up with the

309
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:56.870
physics that we understand for these field propulsion systems.

310
00:16:56.871 --> 00:17:00.530
I'm just telling you believe me or not, but you'll hear more about it. That,

311
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.780
that our material science in 1989 and today is our limiting

312
00:17:05.781 --> 00:17:09.200
factor. And as our material, science gets better as humans.

313
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.800
We know how these things work. Now, the fuel source,

314
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:14.660
that's a whole nother conversation,

315
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:19.580
but as far as creating these machines, that's what we're trying to do.

316
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:20.720
That's why there is secrecy.

317
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:24.950
We're trying to exploit the technology because whoever exploits it first wins.

318
00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:27.170
It's a game changer. We don't want Russia to do it.

319
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.830
We don't want China to do it. If we had a non reactionary propulsion system,

320
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.880
the world would look different instantaneously. Okay.
