00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.010
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. But you know,</v>

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.870
we couldn't figure out how to put the different fighting sports together. Right.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.690
So w whose rules to use, right? I mean,

4
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:16.470
and so really the basis of the UFC was always, you know,

5
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:21.440
no rules became this huge thing, but it was also whose rules do you use?

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.440
I mean, how are you going to get a boxer against did jujitsu guy?

7
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.050
What are you going to use? You can't, there's no rules.

8
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.790
<v 1>You can use. Did anybody try to gouge eyes? Was that it was that legal in there?</v>

9
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.110
Well, you.

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.590
<v 0>Know, you know what I mean? I always would hear about these wing Chun masters.</v>

11
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.650
They had 50 ways to pop your eye out with their thumb.

12
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.220
And I kept calling them going, bring your thumbs and do it, man.

13
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:46.550
Don't talk about it, come and pop it. But he's I out, I want you to have done.

14
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:48.950
If a guy lost an eye, though, would you have done it?

15
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:53.900
Would we'd pick it up mean what would we do? You know,

16
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:57.980
come on. There's also, there's a, there's a reality to fighting that, you know,

17
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.760
better than most people on the planet, right? If you're defending yourself,

18
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.020
you're defending yourself, whether it's from a right hook, you know, right.

19
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:10.880
Cross, uh, an elbow, a knee, or having your eye guide gouged out,

20
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.280
you're blocking you're, you're aware, you know,

21
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.480
guy comes at you with his thumbs up to do the gouge you're you're in a defensive

22
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.040
posture. Well, it is interesting.

23
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.221
<v 1>Though,</v>

24
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:23.180
how many people are getting poked in the eyes now when it's illegal and how

25
00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:25.550
often it happens and what, you know,

26
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.360
the reality of how devastating the results are when guys get their corneas

27
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:32.510
scratched and they get a fingernail in the eye and they get a finger jab in the

28
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:34.520
eye. Even if it's accidental, man,

29
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:37.550
they scream and run away and eyes.

30
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.220
<v 0>Are sensitive. Is it any different than other sports? The same in football?</v>

31
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:43.820
If someone gets their hand inside the helmet, it's same in boxing, you know,

32
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:47.180
in the old days, guys used to do stuff to that glove. So bird ran versus.

33
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.110
<v 1>Davey, Maury thumbed him in the eye and the, well, he was kicking his anyway,</v>

34
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.100
but David Moore couldn't see out of his eye and then Roberto beat the out of

35
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:55.430
him.

36
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.770
<v 0>So, you know, the UFC didn't invent this.</v>

37
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.580
<v 1>No thumbing is a long time strategy in boxing.</v>

38
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:05.000
And they actually developed gloves that have the thumb pin down because of that,

39
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.260
because in the old days, the thumb would detach from, from the, uh, the glove.

40
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.440
And even when it's like stitched in a little bit,

41
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:15.380
you could still kind of get it in there. You can get it in there.

42
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:19.460
If you're just trying to poke a guy in the eye, which many people did do,

43
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.610
that's a definitely a dirty trick fight.

44
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.570
<v 0>Yeah. You know, uh, I, man Shamrock was who, who did he fight?</v>

45
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.630
This was like UFC three or four.

46
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.610
He said it was maybe one of the preliminary someone reached into his Speedos

47
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.010
and moved his cup out of the way. So he could knee him. And Ken was going,

48
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:43.220
dude, we're fighting. You know, if you want to, we can get together later.

49
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:45.350
But you know, for right now, hands out of my space.

50
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.850
<v 1>Well, there was a fight between Gary Goodridge and the Pedro in Brazil,</v>

51
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:53.870
a famous fight. It was like straight up valley Tuto, no gloves, no rules.

52
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.820
And Gary Goodrich reached into his pants and grabbed his balls and crushed them.

53
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.220
He was in Gary. Good.

54
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.500
Which was against that is the cockfight part we were talking.

55
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.350
It was kept pretty sure it was Gary Goodrich. It doesn't sound like his style,

56
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.970
but you know, back in the day. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he was an arm.

57
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.850
<v 0>Wrestling champs. So maybe he figured that was playing to his strength.</v>

58
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.710
He'll yank your Franklin.

59
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.550
<v 1>This was, I'm pretty sure it was Gary Goodrich. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.230
Gary Goodridge versus the Pedro.

61
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.360
This was way back in the day from 1997. And, uh,

62
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.160
he, uh, yeah, fish is great at that. And isn't back in the day. Yes,

63
00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:32.220
it is still back in the day. Not to you when you were.

64
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.970
<v 2>In, you were in the game for four years by then. Yeah. Dude.</v>

65
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.910
<v 1>Reached into his pants and crushed his balls. Do you know what? Uh.</v>

66
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.060
<v 0>Forrest Griffin said to me at the 20th anniversary, he goes, he goes, you know,</v>

67
00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:44.670
I love the early UFC. He goes, I would have entered earlier,

68
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:48.000
but I didn't want to wear those Speedos. I wanted to wear a man's pants.

69
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.090
<v 3>That sounds like something for us would say.</v>

70
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.380
<v 1>When you guys first created the UFC in 1993,</v>

71
00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:58.740
how long did it take from the initial idea to the first pay-per-view?

72
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.820
<v 0>You know what nobody's ever asked me that Joe, you know, uh,</v>

73
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.050
w art Davie called me to pitch me war of the worlds in

74
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.510
April of 93. And we were on in November, really? So,

75
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.590
and you know, and you need three months lead time for pay-per-view. So,

76
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.230
you know, it was like, it was a go, wow.

77
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.380
<v 1>So you guys realized right away what a great idea this is going to be.</v>

78
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.420
<v 0>Oh, it was. I realized that on an arts call, you know, how can you not,</v>

79
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.310
you, same with you. You saw it, you loved it. You know, I heard about it. I,

80
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.910
I really did see it as alive, you know, a real life mortal combat.

81
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:39.870
That is really what I saw when I imagined what it would look like, you know?

82
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.710
And I thought, who would not watch that I'm watching it. It's my show.

83
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.280
I probably would pay myself to watch it. I mean, it's just,

84
00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:48.330
how can you not watch.

85
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.600
<v 1>That? I got a board, uh, like I said, in 94,</v>

86
00:04:51.601 --> 00:04:56.280
I found the video of a UFC two and I don't think UFC one was even available on

87
00:04:56.281 --> 00:04:58.350
video. Right? Wasn't there some sort of no dispute?

88
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.980
<v 0>No, no, it wasn't a dispute, but, um, Don gold, you know,</v>

89
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.110
should we all know and love, and it's still at the UFC.

90
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.910
He bought two and at the same time bought one.

91
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.950
Um, and back in those days, you try to release the videos to be fresh.

92
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:17.520
So he didn't want to release one before two, we wanted to, to be the first one,

93
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.910
come out, very close to the event, all the hoopla.

94
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.240
And then later on added one also, as, you know,

95
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.340
one had arguably the worst commentator team in the history of sports. Phil.

96
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.990
<v 2>Good. Jim brown.</v>

97
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.240
<v 0>Jim, I liked Jim brown. Jim brown was cool. Then I still think he's cool,</v>

98
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.840
but what's super foot man, super moron. You know.

99
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.720
<v 2>You, how dare you. God hero is.</v>

100
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.560
<v 1>A karate hero bill, super foot Wallace is that he's a karate hero.</v>

101
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.650
<v 2>I thought he was karate hero. Is that what he did?</v>

102
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.650
<v 1>He was a bad kickboxer did you not? No boxer. Of course.</v>

103
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.560
<v 0>I knew I was standing backstage and I'm trying to explain to him the name of the</v>

104
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:01.700
show. Right. Which is not the ultimate fighting challenge. Like it's, you know,

105
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:03.890
maybe it's just a subtle difference, you know?

106
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.920
But to me it meant a lot being chipped versus challenge.

107
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.020
I'm trying to explain it to him and he is practicing his kicks over my

108
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:15.680
head. It's not, I'm not such a tall guy, but he was a high kicker. Right.

109
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.620
So he's doing these kicks over my head as I'm going build,

110
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.240
try to remember the name of the show.

111
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.460
<v 1>So he's just showing off or something. What is he doing?</v>

112
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:24.050
I think he was definitely being.

113
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.470
<v 0>Silly. Yeah. Just showing he was too cool for school. Yeah, I got it.</v>

114
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.010
And I said to him, I go, we're going to see any kicks like that. He goes, ah,

115
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.700
no, you do that in a real fight. They'll rip your balls off. I'm like, dude,

116
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.080
isn't that what you teach?

117
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.150
<v 3>No.</v>

118
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.410
<v 0>He's a jerk off. He's not really, he's a jerk off, you know what he did, Joe,</v>

119
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.090
there's only a couple of where there's actually a,

120
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.160
more than a couple of people I'm, you know,

121
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.330
maybe still annoyed at back then before email. Right.

122
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.500
When you wanted to communicate something, you had to write it down,

123
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.640
put it in an envelope, use a government issued like form of sticker thing.

124
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:02.630
You put on a non rope and you sent it through a government process and it was

125
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:05.300
called the mail. Right? Okay. So there's no email.

126
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.020
So bill super foot shows up, gets the name,

127
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:13.100
wrong burps into the thing pays no attention does a horrible job,

128
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.090
takes the money.

129
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.260
And then like three days later in black belt magazine and editorial comes out

130
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:21.830
how he says he's totally against it. So he must have written that.

131
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.720
<v 1>Before he died six weeks before, you know? So he just did it for the check.</v>

132
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.290
<v 0>I did it, uh, I don't know. I mean, it wasn't that big a check.</v>

133
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:31.970
It was probably 2,500 bucks. I mean,

134
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:34.460
if that was life-changing for him and he's in bad shape,

135
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.380
but I think he didn't like it.

136
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.390
Didn't like a lot of the guys that I think of his paper tigers. Right.

137
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.560
I think it was a threat.

138
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.540
<v 1>Well, I, you can't call bill super foot wall.</v>

139
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.750
So paper tiger bill super foot walls was a great kickboxer. He really was. He,

140
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:51.010
I saw him fight live.

141
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.700
He was a bad-ass kickboxer I saw him fight live deep into his forties.

142
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.260
<v 0>He came out of an era of kickboxing when there really were,</v>

143
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.550
when it really was a great thing to watch. Right. And he was a great Kickbox.

144
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.770
So this is from the Chuck Norris. Yeah, absolutely.

145
00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:09.940
And there was a bunch of guys which is named, um, uh, Rick Rufus, Rick,

146
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:14.170
the jet Rufus tried to get him, uh, uh, Benny the jet

147
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.331
[inaudible] yeah. I mean,

148
00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:19.810
I was after all of these guys and it was just a little bit too late in the day

149
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:20.320
for them.

150
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.350
<v 1>Right. Runny, Benny was, they were tired and.</v>

151
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:24.700
<v 0>You know, and you're right.</v>

152
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.330
I shouldn't go off like that as a kickboxer he was something he really was.

153
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.850
He just didn't enjoy working with him. I didn't enjoy working with them.

154
00:08:30.851 --> 00:08:32.500
I thought it was to show up,

155
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.400
ready to condemn something or already have condemned it and not pay enough

156
00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:37.600
attention to get the name right.

157
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.160
And something that was as history making as our first event. But anyway,

158
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.890
now he met her. They were horrible.

159
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.830
Cause it just goes down in the record books as the worst commentating team of

160
00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:48.664
all time.

161
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.310
<v 1>It goes down as the beginning and everything. I mean,</v>

162
00:08:51.311 --> 00:08:54.640
I sucked when I first started doing it too. It just, you know, no one,

163
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.400
no had any background in it. No one knew what to do. You.

164
00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.061
<v 0>Know? You know,</v>

165
00:08:59.061 --> 00:09:02.870
I didn't know about your fighting background when I asked your manager to do it.

166
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.380
What I liked was your comedy style. I liked your persona.

167
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.670
And when I talked to Jeff, he goes, you know, he was a kickboxer or something,

168
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.460
you know, I forgot what he said. It was like, it wasn't very specific.

169
00:09:13.461 --> 00:09:16.580
I was like, really? He was a fight. That's how I found out about it.

170
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.820
But I always thought you were, you had a tough guy persona.

171
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.000
That seemed very right for the show. And we needed someone.

172
00:09:23.001 --> 00:09:27.170
God knows that could talk when all hell was breaking loose,

173
00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:29.960
because hell broke loose pretty regularly in those days. Yeah. Yeah. And.

174
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.020
<v 1>You had a couple of guys that were doing the post-fight interviews.</v>

175
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.620
That just weren't so good at it. They just weren't so good at media.

176
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.000
Like Tony Blauer.

177
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:41.600
Who's a really good martial artist and there's a lot about self-defense. Yeah.

178
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:41.990
We had.

179
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.430
<v 0>To choose between people that sorta knew what was going on and real</v>

180
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.760
announcers. Right. I mean, that was the choice. Cause we couldn't find anyone.

181
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.240
Do you know, Brian Kilmeade, you know, started out doing this too.

182
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.920
Was Brian Kilmeade he's on a show called Fox and friends, you know, it's like.

183
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.510
<v 1>Out doing this. He did. Oh, I know exactly what that guy is.</v>

184
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.520
Five.

185
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.130
<v 0>I think. And Brian, if you're listening or anyone knows Brian,</v>

186
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:09.830
I'm sorry if I got the number wrong, but you know.

187
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.380
<v 1>His back was excellent. Nick, you know, Bruce, back to this day,</v>

188
00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:19.160
I owe, uh, Bruce a debt of gratitude. He gave me some really good pointers.

189
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:21.380
When I first started doing the post-fight interviews,

190
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.020
he gave me some real good pointers on like, you know,

191
00:10:24.021 --> 00:10:27.020
like what to say or what to save you're stuck and you know,

192
00:10:27.021 --> 00:10:30.050
like how did he say it? He's a pro and he's a really good guy.

193
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.850
So did Blatnick you know? Yeah. That was good. Yeah.

194
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.380
Yeah. Olympic gold medalist. I mean awesome dude too. Really? Really?

195
00:10:39.381 --> 00:10:43.430
He was a great guy. It's so sad when he passed. I really miss that guy.

196
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.690
He was a really fun guy to do a commentary with too. Just a real,

197
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.180
genuine, nice person. Yeah. And he'd be.

198
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.410
<v 0>Around, he had this</v>

199
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.290
like before the show or backstage or if there was any problem he was

200
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.220
unflappable and it just kind of gave off a calm. Sure.

201
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.150
It sort of helped cause like not everybody on the team was coming. Right, right,

202
00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:05.984
right.

203
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:10.370
<v 1>He was, he was a great wrestler too. Knew a lot about wrestling, you know,</v>

204
00:11:10.371 --> 00:11:14.900
and eventually developed his knowledge of a MMA jujitsu skills and was really

205
00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:16.190
interested in learning. You know,

206
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.580
I remember there's some videos of him rolling with Frank Shamrock, like very,

207
00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:24.140
very early in the day back, I think when Frank was the champion and uh,

208
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.280
you know, it's about the time of it. Yeah. I left right.

209
00:11:28.281 --> 00:11:31.850
When Frank won, when he beat Kevin Jackson,

210
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.480
an armbar dumb in Japan, I didn't go to the Japan show. That was when I quit.

211
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.430
I was like, that's when did you quit?

212
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.390
About 98 somewhere around then I would just write about it.

213
00:11:41.391 --> 00:11:43.520
And when Frank was so of the title.

214
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.150
<v 4>That point I would have, I really was, it was me for.</v>

215
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.550
<v 1>Me too. It was like, um, you know,</v>

216
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:54.400
it was all these little tiny propeller planes to these strange places,

217
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.560
Augusta, Georgia. And [inaudible].

218
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.860
<v 0>You know, I kinda liked Augusta. I mean that wasn't bad. Good barbecue. Yeah.</v>

219
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.160
Good barbecue and somewhat friendly town, you know,

220
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.990
as opposed to Charlotte where they invited me never to return, uh,

221
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.960
the chief of police said to me, if you come back,

222
00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:16.680
I'm not sure what I will arrest you for, but I guarantee you, I will arrest you.

223
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.270
Wow. What year was chief.

224
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.050
<v 5>Of police? What year was this? Well, that would have been on five.</v>

225
00:12:22.051 --> 00:12:25.080
So 95.

226
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.530
<v 1>Wow. What a Dick? The chief of police is.</v>

227
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.940
<v 2>Like a guy. Do you remember his name? Uh, Dick something.</v>

228
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.850
<v 1>Hey Dick, weed. I think Dick weed.</v>

229
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.500
<v 0>I'm going to remember the, I mean, come on what a crazy abusive power, but it's,</v>

230
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.510
it's all good now because John McCain said he would have ventured to him now

231
00:12:48.511 --> 00:12:51.630
it's okay. Because the war here said it's okay. You know, it wasn't me,

232
00:12:51.631 --> 00:12:53.010
you know, McCain I've said this before,

233
00:12:53.011 --> 00:12:56.520
like I was sorta hoping Jerry Falwell or somebody would come out against,

234
00:12:56.521 --> 00:12:59.970
you know, somebody I could take, you know, a war hero and you know,

235
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.740
powerful Senator. But you know,

236
00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:05.340
it was really a tough opponent to counter was uh, um,

237
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.200
the Senator from Colorado that had had the judo champion, he'd been an Olympic,

238
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.300
um, Judah con, um, Ben, he was native American Ben light, horse Campbell,

239
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.830
Ben night, horse Campbell, I dunno is, um, never heard of this before, you know,

240
00:13:19.831 --> 00:13:23.940
because we were kind of intimating that McCain didn't really know anything about

241
00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:24.774
the martial arts.

242
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.760
And he went and found Ben who was an Olympic gold medalist in judo

243
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.350
or a medalist. He might not have been gold. And he said, yeah, wait,

244
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.330
that's no good. You can't do it. You can't do sail boats. What are you thinking?

245
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.740
Can't use elbows or whatever he said, who knows, whatever the, whatever it was.

246
00:13:40.741 --> 00:13:41.520
He didn't know.

247
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.550
<v 1>One of the early opponents. And that was all for a lot of folks that don't know,</v>

248
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.790
this is where it gets weird with John McCain, John McCain's wife,

249
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.900
their family was involved with Budweiser. Right. And he was,

250
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.630
the Budweiser was in bed with boxing and boxing was.

251
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.700
<v 0>In bed with the UFC. Now I need three Joe.</v>

252
00:13:59.701 --> 00:14:02.490
I don't really think that's the connection. I don't think that's what it was.

253
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.110
It was, I think it's odd. I mean, John McCain, you know,

254
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.940
is a Republican. So Republicans tend to stand for state control, right? That,

255
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.310
you know, keeping a small federal government,

256
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.650
that's a kind of a Republican policy,

257
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.160
but I think John McCain really wanted a national boxing commission.

258
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.890
And I think that this was a good way to promote that.

259
00:14:22.891 --> 00:14:26.010
And I think he just was generally offended by the UFC.

260
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.720
And I think it was a great way to get press and it wasn't like people were

261
00:14:30.721 --> 00:14:33.870
coming out and going keep the UFC, keep the, you know,

262
00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:38.100
he just could beat on the UFC and get as much press as he wanted. And look,

263
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.730
look, look how different America is now. I mean, back then,

264
00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:45.480
that was the biggest problem facing the U S was the UFC. I mean,

265
00:14:45.481 --> 00:14:49.830
now look at the problems facing America and the world and you go, we really.

266
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.330
<v 4>Lived in kind of a time, you know, wait a minute. What do you.</v>

267
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.140
<v 1>Mean? The UFC was the only problem the United States had. Well, you.</v>

268
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.030
<v 2>Never reading the news in 1993. There.</v>

269
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.670
<v 0>Was, well, there's always things going.</v>

270
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.600
<v 1>On overseas. There's always things going on that, you know, had you.</v>

271
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.060
<v 0>Heard of a Sama bin Laden in 1993 and know that sense of Ghana stand.</v>

272
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:09.903
That was a Russian.

273
00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.820
<v 1>Yeah. That was the Mujahideen back then. Yeah.</v>

274
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.550
<v 0>They were fighting the Russians. So they were cool with us. Yeah.</v>

275
00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.820
I think Clinton years the economy was good. I mean, he got, you know,

276
00:15:18.821 --> 00:15:20.080
he did the intern. I mean,

277
00:15:20.081 --> 00:15:22.930
that was like the biggest thing or she did it with them or whatever.

278
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.880
I wasn't paying it. Yeah. That was the.

279
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.430
<v 1>Biggest issue. Well, I'm sure that what I was going to say, I mean,</v>

280
00:15:27.431 --> 00:15:28.240
what I mean is there,

281
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.960
there was certainly other problems in the world there's violence and all sorts

282
00:15:31.961 --> 00:15:35.620
of things in our, if you were reading the media, apparently, you know,

283
00:15:35.621 --> 00:15:37.390
it was really that big of a deal. Well,

284
00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:40.480
maybe it was you because you were really close to it too. You know,

285
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.250
I'll tell you what w for me it.

286
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.600
<v 0>Was, uh, you know, it was riding the tiger, right. Because you know,</v>

287
00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:50.560
it was great to be in mad magazine. It was great to be the, uh,

288
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.720
final episode of friends when Courtney Cox,

289
00:15:52.721 --> 00:15:57.100
his boyfriend enters the UFC and goes to it. It was great to be in virtuosity.

290
00:15:57.101 --> 00:15:59.940
You know, the Denzel Washington Russell Crowe movie. I mean, there's are,

291
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:05.110
there's big 95. I mean, it's really big media stuff. But on the other hand,

292
00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:08.950
when you're that visible, you know, you're making a lot of people angry if they,

293
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.380
if they don't like you you're in their face all the time.

294
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.670
So it was kind of a tough thing. So yeah. I mean, it was fun until it wasn't.

295
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.910
Um, and you, I mean, you know, the story we were,

296
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.500
we had backed off that marketing and we're, you know, the unified rules,

297
00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.690
you know, were coming into place and, you know,

298
00:16:25.691 --> 00:16:27.880
it was a very different folks who don't know.

299
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.520
<v 1>What we're talking about. When the UFC first came out,</v>

300
00:16:30.521 --> 00:16:33.970
there were no weight classes and there were no rules and you could not,

301
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.730
you know, a fighter could tap. They could,

302
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.210
but no one could throw in the towel and the referee couldn't stop the.

303
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.463
I was on one.

304
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.810
<v 0>That changed by two. That was insane by the way. Yeah.</v>

305
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.900
<v 1>Okay. So, but it's this sort of highlights it. So that's the first episode,</v>

306
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.750
the first UFC. And then from there slowly,

307
00:16:52.751 --> 00:16:57.190
but surely rules start becoming implemented strategies, change rounds,

308
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.510
um, weight classes, gloves, things got really interesting, really fast.

309
00:17:01.511 --> 00:17:03.430
And I'll think a lot of people were unaware of it.

310
00:17:03.431 --> 00:17:06.340
If you think about the difference between 93 and 97,

311
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:11.290
I came in in 97 when Vituro made his debut gloves were still not

312
00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:15.670
mandatory. They were, uh, optional, some fighters fought without gloves. Uh,

313
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.800
but it was wasn't that the case.

314
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:22.600
<v 0>I was against gloves after I saw tank knockout. What's his name, man too. Uh,</v>

315
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.520
um, tank was smart. He figured out, he goes, gloves are a weapon.

316
00:17:27.521 --> 00:17:28.600
I'm bringing them. Yeah.

317
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.330
<v 1>Yeah. You get hit harder with gloves. A lot harder. He could hit harder.</v>

318
00:17:31.331 --> 00:17:35.440
You don't worry about breaking your hands. There's all the wraps and everything.

319
00:17:35.441 --> 00:17:39.130
They give you a much better thing to hit with bare knuckles. Tricky.

320
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.160
If you hit someone in the knuckle with bare knuckles on your forehead,

321
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.980
you can break your hand very easily. It's a really common,

322
00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.870
especially if you catch them with the last two knuckles,

323
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.650
the ones that vibrate where your pinky is, your head was the.

324
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.580
<v 0>Most common injury in the early in the Gracies were like wear gloves.</v>

325
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:54.870
Don't wear gloves, wear a hat. I.

326
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.790
<v 4>Don't care. Yeah. You know, whatever you want.</v>

327
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.460
<v 1>Whereas vest, okay.</v>

328
00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.250
If someone else is wearing gloves and you're grappling with them,

329
00:18:01.251 --> 00:18:03.230
you actually can hold onto the gloves. I mean,

330
00:18:03.231 --> 00:18:07.370
if there's no rules about it and guys use the gloves to finish submissions now,

331
00:18:07.371 --> 00:18:11.030
too, they started doing a lot of that. A lot of guys, um, um,

332
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.750
the way Josh Thompson finished off, uh,

333
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.570
who was it? Um, uh,

334
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:27.170
Ryan heat, pat Healey thing was pat Healey. No, not pat Heeley. Yeah.

335
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.320
It w I think it was Josh Thompson and pat Healey. Anyway, he, uh,

336
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.740
he grabs the glove as he's finishing the rear naked choke.

337
00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.860
Like he's gone for the rear naked and he switches to Palm, to Palm,

338
00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.750
and then he grabs the glove and uses the glove to finish it off. And I was like,

339
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.310
I was like, that's slick. Well, it's totally legal.

340
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.680
It's totally legal to grab your own glove.

341
00:18:45.681 --> 00:18:48.050
And it's also totally legal to grab your own shorts,

342
00:18:48.051 --> 00:18:51.800
which is kind of interesting because one of the best ways to defend against

343
00:18:51.801 --> 00:18:54.380
Kimora is, is to just grab the inside of your shorts,

344
00:18:54.381 --> 00:18:56.450
like by your crotch and just hang on for dear life.

345
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.060
<v 0>She's always used the G for that type of effect. You know, you know,</v>

346
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.480
I'm sitting here, I'm watching you do this. Right.

347
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.790
And I was watching your brain try to find that, you know,

348
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.190
find out opponent and you know, you are,

349
00:19:07.191 --> 00:19:11.540
you're a Renaissance man of tough guy stuff. You know,

350
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.750
that's what you are, you know? Cause your comedy is like that.

351
00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:18.410
You've acted as a tough guy. You do comedy from a tough guy, point of view.

352
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.290
And you know, I think you've probably is this true?

353
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.290
I think you've probably seen more MMA than anyone on the planet.

354
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:29.630
<v 1>Maybe Joe, Silva's seen more than me because Joseph [inaudible].</v>

355
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.610
<v 2>Over there. He's got his hands over his eyes. It.</v>

356
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:36.170
<v 1>Was pat Healey who it was definitely pat Healey that Josh Thompson fought. Um,</v>

357
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:41.360
yeah, man, look, I've seen a lot. I've I've up close. I've been to,

358
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.320
I don't know how many events, but I've seen well, well over a thousand fights,

359
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:49.430
like up close and personal and some of the best fights in the history of MMA can

360
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.910
the history. But Joe Silva goes to all the Fox sports, one events as well.

361
00:19:52.911 --> 00:19:56.630
Now I go to the last two years, he's outpaced me. It used to be we'd with all,

362
00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.740
we would not see the same amount of fights, but over the last two years,

363
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:04.430
I don't really do those Fox sports. One ones as much anymore.

364
00:20:04.431 --> 00:20:08.480
I do Fox and the pay-per-view and then the Anik Florian team does the, uh,

365
00:20:08.481 --> 00:20:10.010
the other one. But, uh,

366
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.550
so Joe Silva might be the only guy on the planet that seemed more fights than

367
00:20:13.551 --> 00:20:17.870
me, unless you know, really hardcore fans. There's some psychos out there,

368
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.153
but I've seen everything.

369
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.220
<v 2>Every local. I don't know. It's hard. I think Joe fits into that category.</v>

370
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:23.803
He's a psycho.

371
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.400
<v 1>Joe Silva is a real MMA fan. That mother loves MMA. Yeah, here it is.</v>

372
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.780
This is Josh Thompson finishing off pat Healey put a beautiful technique too.

373
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.980
It's got the body triangle and then he's using, it's hard to tell here.

374
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.270
Nope. That's Palm to Palm. I'm wrong. That's just a regular Palm to Palm grip.

375
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.890
I stand corrected unless he finishes it in a different way and pulls the gloves.

376
00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:49.540
I definitely have seen someone it before. I don't know why I thought,

377
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.050
I thought it was Josh because Josh is a very clever guy. He's a,

378
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.540
the point stands. It's a good move.

379
00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.880
What point does it bad-ass technique though? Let me say no,

380
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.710
I couldn't tell if he did it. There is that John pulled out. Yes.

381
00:21:05.711 --> 00:21:09.550
John McCarthy. No, no. He's wearing a microphone. You Jesus Christ.

382
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.270
It was like, as he's finishing this off with a bow, that's another thing too.

383
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.410
That's changed over the years. That potty triangle man, guys, uh, oh yeah,

384
00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:21.250
he is doing it. He is doing it. He was doing it at the end. See,

385
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.840
my memory is good. Thought my memory failed me. Josh. Thompson's bad.

386
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.160
Good.

387
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.240
<v 0>You Jitsu. You know, so much of the fighting has changed.</v>

388
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.050
<v 1>I mean it's yeah, it's incredible. Right. It's uh, it's really it's.</v>

389
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.460
<v 0>It's like, you know, like even when you see old films of the, you know,</v>

390
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.850
the NFL back in the leather helmet football on the leather helmet, days, it,

391
00:21:41.851 --> 00:21:45.900
you know, football hasn't, I mean, the UFC changed more than 20 years. I mean,

392
00:21:45.901 --> 00:21:48.230
it's remarkable, but yet you and Joe silver.

393
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.320
<v 1>Still. Yeah. That's weird. Yeah. It changed radically.</v>

394
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:55.590
And I brought both of you guys in, you did, you did well,

395
00:21:55.591 --> 00:22:00.480
I was a post-fight interviewer. I'd never done any commentary ever. Um,

396
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.340
I had done commentary for more time. Um, but I'd never done talk or,

397
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.700
well, yeah, but it's still, let's see, you have to learn how to do it.

398
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.910
Absolutely. And you got a lot better, right? Oh, for sure.

399
00:22:11.911 --> 00:22:13.650
I was terrible in the beginning. It's.

400
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.540
<v 0>Um, but you were better in the beginning,</v>

401
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.590
people that we brought in on that first. Well, yeah,

402
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.660
maybe a serious upgrade. I had, uh, the, the.

403
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.400
<v 1>Benefit of, uh, first of all, watching them make mistakes.</v>

404
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.110
That's a huge benefit enough.

405
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.950
And then the other benefit was I was a huge fan and always have been,

406
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.270
I've been a fan since that tape that I picked up at that Hollywood video store.

407
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.420
Uh, and that was two. That was, that was number two. Yeah.

408
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.250
And then I started training. Yeah, it was, I started training soon after that.

409
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.990
Um, and uh, I remember thinking, man, this is, uh, I hope this works out.

410
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.351
You know,

411
00:22:49.351 --> 00:22:53.160
I hope this takes off because I remember when I looked at the very box that had

412
00:22:53.161 --> 00:22:55.170
the UFC on it, the first time I found out about the UFC,

413
00:22:55.171 --> 00:22:57.540
I looked at that box and went, wow, they did it.

414
00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.320
They did it because this is something that everybody in MMA had talked about.

415
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.780
I should say, MMA, everyone in martial arts.

416
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.690
And there are no martial arts anymore there's styles,

417
00:23:06.691 --> 00:23:11.370
but everything is essentially in my eyes. MMA is martial arts. Now it's not,

418
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.230
I mean, this idea of.

419
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.300
<v 2>Mixed martial arts. Yeah.</v>

420
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:14.671
<v 0>I mean,</v>

421
00:23:14.671 --> 00:23:17.880
I think they're still teaching kids TaeKwonDo and there's nothing wrong with it.

422
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.680
There's nothing wrong with it. But.

423
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:23.820
<v 1>Martial arts is MMA. You know, it is martial arts. And um,</v>

424
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:28.470
when we, we were coming up, like I was a TaeKwonDo guy and you know,

425
00:23:28.471 --> 00:23:32.220
I had friends that did karate and I had another friend that did this and

426
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.460
everyone always wanted to know what was the best. And you didn't know,

427
00:23:35.461 --> 00:23:39.240
you really had no idea. You had no idea until the UFC came along.

428
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.220
It was all just speculation.

429
00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:46.040
And everyone was convinced that their style of judo was unstoppable or

430
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.480
their shadow con was the best death touch and you know, whatever.

431
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:53.900
It was every, it was all just talking and guesswork.

432
00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:58.010
But when I looked at that box, I remember very clearly thinking in my head, wow,

433
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:00.050
they did it. They actually did it.

434
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.910
Like this was the thing that everybody always talked about.

435
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.750
Get everybody together, make them duke it out. Kuma taste style,

436
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.900
like a Jean-Claude van Damme movie in a cage,

437
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:12.320
but even better because he was in a cage, went up to gun two.

438
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.590
When I would tell people when I was working for you guys, I was, uh,

439
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.110
on news radio, which is an NBC sitcom.

440
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.710
Fortunately news radio was not doing well. It wasn't popular.

441
00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:24.500
So the network didn't come up to me and go, Hey. Had, what are you doing?

442
00:24:24.501 --> 00:24:26.000
Cage fighting. Commentator.

443
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.290
<v 2>Advertisers are very uncomfortable with your side gig.</v>

444
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.680
<v 1>They didn't have any problem because that show could have been canceled every</v>

445
00:24:32.681 --> 00:24:35.350
year. We almost got Kansas is a good show, Joe.

446
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.520
<v 4>It was a very good show. It was a very good show, good character, but we didn't.</v>

447
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.360
<v 1>Have the benefit of political backing. So we got moved a lot and uh,</v>

448
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:47.080
it was never like a guarantee, but,

449
00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.770
but when I was doing it, people had talked to me like I was doing porn.

450
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.800
They would talk to me like I was off like shooting porn on the weekend.

451
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.830
They're like, what are you doing? You doing cage funny? Why are you doing that?

452
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.800
Why are you, why are you interviewing cage fighters? I was like,

453
00:24:59.801 --> 00:25:02.650
I like watching it. And people would look at you like,

454
00:25:02.651 --> 00:25:05.650
there's something wrong with you for liking watching. I like watching it, dude.

455
00:25:05.651 --> 00:25:09.950
I'm telling you, man, I got seriously judged by, by people in the,

456
00:25:09.951 --> 00:25:14.260
in the industry back then, what was not popular? I commiserate.

457
00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:18.460
<v 0>And when I moved to Larchmont, which is a snooty little town in Westchester,</v>

458
00:25:18.461 --> 00:25:21.280
outside of New York, my wife goes, please don't tell anyone what you do.

459
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.720
You know, the UFC had paid for the house. She goes not hilarious,

460
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:30.490
please don't please. If you could not bring it up. Yeah. It's it's much,

461
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.730
much, much, much, much more acceptable now. I mean, no, absolutely.

462
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.890
It's not Fox it's uh, you know,

463
00:25:35.891 --> 00:25:39.070
it's rumored to be an Olympic sport in the making so.

464
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.040
<v 1>Well, that would make sense, but you know,</v>

465
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:47.140
if you have curling as an Olympic sport, man,

466
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.530
your people, you Canadian wild Scottish, which is, oh,

467
00:25:50.531 --> 00:25:52.330
the Scottish curl as well. Right? Well, th.

468
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.530
<v 0>They invented curling and, and, and the Canadians are Scottish because you know,</v>

469
00:25:56.531 --> 00:25:59.470
that drink Canada dry, the Scots thought that was a challenge.

470
00:25:59.471 --> 00:26:02.890
So they all went to drink Canada, dry, you know, that's oh,

471
00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.750
it's an old joke or sorry,

472
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.000
the three Scottish listeners you have are busting a gut right now, though.

473
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.960
I love the Canada dry material.

474
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.760
<v 1>Uh, one of those shows like best sports show or something like that way, way,</v>

475
00:26:15.761 --> 00:26:19.030
way back in the day. And, uh, I was telling them, I said,

476
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.130
I think it's going to be an enormous national sport one day.

477
00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:23.050
And they were laughing. They thought.

478
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.370
<v 0>It was so cool. You know,</v>

479
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.670
there's a lot of stick and ball guys in the sports business that still are

480
00:26:27.671 --> 00:26:31.360
waiting for it to go away. And they don't like rock and roll or hip hop either.

481
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.340
<v 1>Some on, um, who does amateur football. He does college football.</v>

482
00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.730
And he was talking about, uh, after Anderson, silver broke his leg,

483
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.620
that this is the reason why he would never cover the UFC. Never has, will,

484
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.540
you know, an MMA for sure.

485
00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:48.870
What was the reason because Anderson broke his leg because his leg got broke.

486
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:52.410
Exactly. And he's, he works in football, football guy.

487
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.070
He's college football. Well, they don't even make money.

488
00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.370
They're getting head injuries for free.

489
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.690
And the colleges are making billions of dollars. They are no rules,

490
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:05.400
guys not commenting on other sports.

491
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.350
<v 4>Joe. Well, they just, I'm not doing the.</v>

492
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.810
<v 1>No rules guy. Well then those guys, those,</v>

493
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.880
those higher moral ground sports guys. Yeah.

494
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.050
<v 0>But you know, there's a real reason for it. And it is.</v>

495
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.660
And if you look at the NFL, you know, the,

496
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:25.100
with NFL films that turned the sport into

497
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.520
a heroic endeavor,

498
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.790
and I think NFL films was really changing in,

499
00:27:31.791 --> 00:27:33.740
in the media business and then the sports business.

500
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:38.570
Cause they turned football into this epic story and it became very advertiser

501
00:27:38.571 --> 00:27:42.530
friendly and it, you know, ends up in, you know, the super bowl,

502
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.650
which is the most advertiser friendly thing in the planet. Right?

503
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.540
So I think that whole thing was built out and anything that rocks the boat,

504
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.460
the way we rock the boat with boxing,

505
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:57.080
when Tyson was moved from pay-per-view to Fox opposite,

506
00:27:57.081 --> 00:27:59.330
the ultimate ultimate back in the day,

507
00:27:59.331 --> 00:28:01.670
there hadn't been a heavyweight boxing match on broadcast.

508
00:28:01.671 --> 00:28:06.590
And I think 16 years and strangely Tyson has put up against our cheer,

509
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.620
a tournament of champions, you know, that's not a coincidence.

510
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:14.540
So I think when you're protecting something, you know, it's a siege mentality.

511
00:28:14.541 --> 00:28:18.920
And I think a lot of the pure sports guys still feel a little bit threatened

512
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:19.730
by.

513
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.720
<v 1>The youth. Well, you better tell Dana white cause Dana white will put shows on.</v>

514
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.470
Well, he used to always do that. Put us bike shows on, uh,

515
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.020
opposite of affliction or opposite.

516
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.610
<v 3>Of Dana. You know.</v>

517
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.210
<v 2>He likes to go to war. You know, I.</v>

518
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:39.470
<v 0>Am, uh, I am the number one, Dana fan. I got to say, he's the greatest.</v>

519
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.400
<v 1>If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be working for the UFC this time around. None.</v>

520
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.250
<v 0>Of us would be sitting here talking about the UFC, if it wasn't for him.</v>

521
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.460
<v 1>Well, I had no intentions of going back and doing commentary.</v>

522
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.200
I was totally talked into it by him.

523
00:28:51.201 --> 00:28:55.610
I was watching the fights like cage side that's back when, um,

524
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:59.930
Goldberg and um, else was doing it with them,

525
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.430
Jeff, uh, from hook and shoot Jeff Osborne. Um,

526
00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.050
and Blatnick they were doing it. That was, uh, you know,

527
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:13.130
2001 or two, 2000, 2001. So I was just watching.

528
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.070
<v 0>Look, Dana, got it the way, the way I got it,</v>

529
00:29:16.071 --> 00:29:19.940
the way you got it instantly and then was in, and then you're in and you,

530
00:29:19.941 --> 00:29:21.950
you know, and you're a Mormon, you can't, you know,

531
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.470
you gonna have four wives or whatever, the special underwear,

532
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.850
whatever it is is you are in, uh, yeah. In the UFC has that effect.
