<v 0>As he's. Okay. Listen, we didn't come to a conclusion.</v>

00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:24.590
26.

10
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.710
<v 1>Minutes, 20 minutes, 26, 27 dont have the exact.</v>

11
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.630
<v 0>Time for, I think we don't have any stake in this, like physically. Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.390
I'm I'm uncomfortable with that. Cause I feel like we're bullying.

13
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.310
<v 1>No, no, no reward. If you can do it. No, there's no reward. We'll.</v>

<v 0>Yes, dude. That's awesome.</v>

33
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.080
The rush that you would feel if you survived would almost be worth it.

34
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.920
<v 1>So we gotta get that motorcycle for you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.760
6 26 the Friday after Thanksgiving. Sure.

36
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.880
<v 0>The longest you gotta think like Melissa Eridge.</v>

37
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.440
<v 1>How about a drink? Every two miles. No, wait, hold on. Hold on.</v>

38
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.990
<v 0>Melissa. E only the convinced you guys,</v>

39
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.230
she's not gonna die every time she gets on a plane. You gotta feel like that.

40
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:49.230
Every time you get on that barber.

41
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.270
<v 1>We're talking about three different conversations.</v>

42
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.310
<v 0>Is Melissa Etheridge alive or not?</v>

43
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.550
&lt;laugh&gt; has she been in a plane crash or not?

44
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.231
<v 1>By the way,</v>

45
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:01.670
this is exactly how that last podcast we got up without realizing anything.

46
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:04.900
What? Yeah, we got out without anything. And then the be was started. Yeah,

47
00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:05.734
but it was great.

48
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.060
<v 0>It was great. Okay. Let's wrap it up in two minutes.</v>

49
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.380
Should we all run this marathon together? No, that's.

50
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.580
<v 1>Impossible. No, it's possible. Oh, it's impossible. Pu I already know.</v>

51
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:14.160
I can never do it.

52
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.500
<v 0>All. Drunk, drunk and stoned. This is what we did.</v>

53
00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:21.020
We do something incredibly physically intensive, but we do it hammered.

54
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.090
I mean hammered. If we're doing it as a group on yeah, I'm in, that'd be fun.

55
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.690
This is what I'm saying, but I'm not gonna run I'm we have to drink a shot.

56
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.570
Every two and a half miles. I feel lot.

57
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.290
<v 1>A double. No one has a tolerance. Chrysler has I.</v>

58
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.123
<v 0>Don't care.</v>

59
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.170
&lt;laugh&gt; I'd rather just do we're running drink a Gatorade event wise.

60
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.810
Not a we're jerking off in the bushes. Just you we're.

61
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.920
<v 1>Run. Yeah, no, one's gonna a marathon. Every we bike next to him.</v>

62
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.560
Every miles, your man, you gotta roller skate.

63
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.640
<v 0>I'll roller skate, skate five miles. We drink a shot at.</v>

64
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.440
<v 1>You. You could beat me roller skating through a marathon. Definitely.</v>

65
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.040
If it was flat, if it was flat, of course. Is it flat?

66
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.480
You beat me roller skating on America.

67
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.520
<v 0>Hold on. We might have a bed. Is it flat?</v>

68
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.360
<v 2>No. Yeah, of course. It's flat. No it's downhill. No.</v>

69
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.360
<v 1>I mean, it might be up downhill. Well, how about.</v>

70
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.280
<v 0>That track? That one. That was a track up and down.</v>

71
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.320
Coast's you don't you, you don't think he could beat you on roller skates.

72
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.790
Cause he's got's you. Who are you?

73
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.390
<v 2>Why let's let's make the bet. Tom cannot beat me.</v>

74
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.670
You've gotta wear roller skate for.

75
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.670
<v 3>Wait a minute. On what.</v>

76
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.030
<v 0>Track can you skate? I got like,</v>

77
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.470
of course I coach, we.

78
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.350
<v 3>Used, I used to go to roller skating parties, like every other middle.</v>

79
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.950
<v 2>A speed skater. That's.</v>

80
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.150
<v 3>That's different than what you're.</v>

81
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.660
<v 0>Saying, but here's the thing. You run the rollers skate.</v>

82
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:41.780
So you agree on the same thing, thing or green you're.

83
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.703
<v 2>Gonna die.</v>

84
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.900
<v 0>What are whatcha.</v>

85
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.660
<v 1>Talking about? Lose. Unless he runs outta steam, which is very, how would you.</v>

86
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.620
<v 3>Win that? This is insane. How would you win? You're quit. Yes.</v>

87
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.580
Cause you'll quit. How would you win that? Quit.

88
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.340
<v 2>That quit. That's six miles. He you roller skating. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

89
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.250
<v 3>But wait on, on this. So it.</v>

90
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.810
<v 2>Easier to walk than roller skate around you ever roller skate around a lap and</v>

91
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.810
you're like, I'm exhausted. I'm gonna take a break for three.

92
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.330
<v 1>Straight hours. You're gonna do that four straight hours.</v>

93
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.650
<v 3>That ain't, man. I mean, I've been skating whole.</v>

94
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.530
<v 1>Life. Oh my God. Oh my God. You're get tired. His ankles will.</v>

95
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.570
<v 2>Get tired. His will get tired. His thighs will get burnt.</v>

96
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.450
<v 0>Do.</v>

97
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.680
<v 2>This. And when he hits the slightest uphill and he's walking it, well,</v>

98
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:24.180
how we gonna do.

99
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.120
<v 3>Uphill, man? How we gonna do uphill? I.</v>

100
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.040
<v 0>Thought it was a flat track. Do.</v>

101
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.200
<v 2>This track, do this track. Jamie.</v>

102
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.800
<v 1>The, the Turkey stuff on the long beach.</v>

103
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.760
<v 3>Beach, like right the.</v>

104
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.760
<v 2>Marathon on S roller skate, the marathons.</v>

105
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.600
<v 0>It back to Snoop up. If.</v>

106
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.480
<v 1>It's uphill, it's slightly uphill and it's.</v>

107
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.790
<v 2>But it's, if it's on thes so much more exhausting to who? Roller skate. Uphill.</v>

108
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:42.390
Yeah. Than just.

109
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.870
<v 1>Yeah, of course by the it's so much easier on the downhill.</v>

110
00:04:44.871 --> 00:04:46.270
If it is slightly uphill, then just slightly.

111
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.310
<v 0>Downhill. The other way. Skating 26.2 miles 42.2 kilometers is undoubtedly.</v>

112
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.100
<v 1>Easier than running it.</v>

113
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.750
<v 0>Undoubtedly easier than running takes in my skating speaker. Hold on.</v>

114
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.470
Roller blades or skates. Okay.

115
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.710
<v 2>We're talking roller skates. Yeahs. This.</v>

116
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.590
<v 3>Is roller. This is for.</v>

117
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.460
<v 2>Roller blade. So I think okay. To cannot roller blade. What's the deal.</v>

118
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.513
Tom cannot.

119
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.460
<v 1>Blade roll skates, roller skates, roller skates, roller. Okay.</v>

120
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:08.300
That's not even fair. Key auto key off that's your.

121
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.340
<v 0>Choice. Roller skates are fair, but roller blades aren't fair.</v>

122
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.380
You would never be. Have you ever seen Brett earns act?

123
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.060
<v 1>That's roller skating. That's.</v>

124
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.860
<v 0>Roller skating. Yeah. That guy could beat you in a.</v>

125
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.860
<v 2>Run. I think you're miss here under hearing me. It's easier.</v>

126
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.330
<v 1>On roller blade. It is. Yeah. Way, way easier.</v>

127
00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:26.850
Roller skates is the hardest thing. We four wheels roller Tom. Not in mine.

128
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.330
Really? The way. Yeah. Speed skating. They do like.

129
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.010
<v 0>A, but they go fast on roller blade.</v>

130
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.320
<v 1>Way too fast.</v>

131
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.170
<v 3>It's easy. No to I do my, my Uber's here. I call an Uber. How about, how.</v>

132
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.130
<v 0>About, how about this bet, Tom, if you ares roller skates,</v>

133
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.970
you have to beat him by half. No.

134
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.960
<v 1>Just beat him. Just beat him. Just beat him. Just beat him. Roller skates.</v>

135
00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:45.794
Just beat our roller.

136
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.600
<v 0>Skates. Beat him is easy. Beat the real race.</v>

137
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.640
<v 3>You think he'll quit? He's confident. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

138
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.560
<v 2>You think he'll quit? You're be not quit. Quit. I think Tom will quit.</v>

139
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.440
<v 3>Do you know I'm going right now to buy another pair of roller skates? &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

140
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.520
<v 0>Are you gonna run it outta the land.</v>

141
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.480
<v 2>To recommend you? Yeah.</v>

142
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.280
I thought this through for me and I wondered if I could beat myself roller

143
00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:10.160
skating a marathon and, and I was like, dude, you're forgetting.

144
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.120
I'm not gonna tell you why I chose the fatigue.

145
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.640
You're you're you're choosing the,

146
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.350
the fatigue is totally different than jogging. Yeah. Like yeah,

147
00:06:17.351 --> 00:06:19.270
you go a little faster and yeah, you get some downhills,

148
00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:21.670
but you also have uphills, bro. I got pink roller.

149
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.310
<v 0>Skates. Delal ran 238.</v>

150
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.310
<v 2>Miles and you're telling me you could roller skate.</v>

151
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.150
<v 0>Those I'm no I'm telling you good point. Well, it's like a mountain it's yeah,</v>

152
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.550
we can't mow any of no way you could roller.

153
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.950
Cause you can't roller skate those possibility.

154
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.180
<v 1>I think it's I think it's a fair him quitting. It's a real possibility car here.</v>

155
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.220
I'm going home. Start paying him now. We'll.

156
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.740
<v 2>No, you are, you know, you're.</v>

157
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.300
<v 1>Gonna listen. You're gonna be roller skates.</v>

158
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.420
You're gonna beat to on roller kids. I think you can. If you don't quit,

159
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.500
you obviously will.

160
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.260
<v 2>If you don't quit. Ari gets a razor. Yeah. You get a roller.</v>

161
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.700
<v 0>Skates. Listen, let's not be hasty. This is a long podcast.</v>

162
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.530
Let's think this out. This, this has this real merit to another podcast.

163
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.290
Ours going back to New York. We Skype it. We could Skype it board. Yeah,

164
00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:08.730
we have a Skyper it okay, so we'll Skype. It we'll have uh, every,

165
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.050
the three of us will get together. We'll Skype. Ari in.

166
00:07:11.051 --> 00:07:13.250
We'll put 'em on the big screen. We'll work this out. Oh.

167
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.930
<v 1>No. This out. We like this. That's special. Now the big screen the Joe ROS do.</v>

168
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.400
This is what I feel. This.

169
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.400
<v 0>Is what I feel. I feel like the first time it worked out amazing. We, we,</v>

170
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.840
but we didn't really have it ironed out before we ran off to our 15 yoga classes

171
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.280
and our no alcohol and no steaks weed. And we didn't have any stakes.

172
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.080
I think this time let's,

173
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.600
let's give this a time for a bunch of to chime in online, you know, a bunch,

174
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.310
bunch of to sit around and think about devious ways.

175
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.270
We could trick each other to doing something that seems okay.

176
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.190
&lt;laugh&gt; seems good. But you think way more difficult, like bet beat and Tom,

177
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.730
you know,

178
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.310
I'm being so nice by not even suggesting you beating him by running and him on

179
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.350
skates. I'm not even suggesting that. Cause that's just ridiculous.

180
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.700
But I'm thinking maybe like half, maybe half is the root will bet.

181
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.060
<v 1>He doesn't think Joe doesn't think there's any way you'll lose on roller.</v>

182
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:02.460
There's.

183
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.900
<v 2>No way you'll lose. Joe thinks there's no way.</v>

184
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.340
Not only will you not lose by the.

185
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.260
<v 0>Way him.</v>

186
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.140
<v 2>You in 15 years easily, you see.</v>

187
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.020
<v 1>Gonna say two and half straight hours, not quitting in two and a half.</v>

188
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.740
<v 0>Hours. I don't need to. I'm gonna get him high as.</v>

189
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.180
He's gonna be thinking about the universe asteroids and you think will win

190
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.460
electromagnetic fee.

191
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.650
<v 1>Listen, if it's it all comes down to whether or not he's gonna tire her out,</v>

192
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.530
he's gonna get high. If he tires out, he's got no heart. You've got no heart.

193
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.533
Every 30.

194
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.290
<v 0>Yards be there with a vaporizer.</v>

195
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.770
<v 1>If there's no quit. And Tom, there's no way he won't beat you. I have a, if he,</v>

196
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:35.050
if he quits, this is your chance. He'll quit. He'll quit. If he doesn't quit.

197
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:37.010
No one's quitting. Wheels are faster than not wheels. No.

198
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.970
<v 2>One's quitting. No, no, no, no. I.</v>

199
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.600
<v 1>Agree. Yeah, but if he, if he quits, which is highly possible, no.</v>

200
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.000
<v 3>Burke thinks he's holding on some logical linchpin here. Tell us, tell us why,</v>

201
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.720
why you think it it'll definitely.

202
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.480
<v 2>Go your way. I have many a reason. You have many, a reason, not.</v>

203
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.320
<v 1>Fatigue related. Who release it after the bed bed one, uh, number one.</v>

204
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.280
<v 2>One besides Mickey male jeans number, number one.</v>

205
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:58.960
There's so much more weight on a skate than there is on.

206
00:08:58.961 --> 00:09:01.280
Just to pick up to pick up every time he's gotta go.

207
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.440
He's picking up an extra 10 ounce.

208
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.320
<v 1>You do get ounce. When you skate the next day,</v>

209
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.200
new muscle muscles are sore muscles. These are muscle.

210
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.250
<v 2>Muscles, time.</v>

211
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.200
<v 1>Miles an hour. He has to used them.</v>

212
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:12.800
You do get sore after you skate for the first time, dude. Yeah. His.

213
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.430
<v 2>Thighs will be on fire and will be sitting down and the rabbit or the tortoise</v>

214
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.790
