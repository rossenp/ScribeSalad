00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.450
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So Beto, I don't know.</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.140
Let's not call him Beto anymore. His name is Robert. Robert.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.870
Robert actually has a really great idea, Joe.

4
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:14.100
He wants to tax non-military families to pay for veterans healthcare,

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.710
to pay for veterans. Yeah, isn't that nice.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.850
So punish the people who don't want to join the military, very smart.

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.943
Robert.

8
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.630
<v 1>Punish the people who make the weapons influence the politicians,</v>

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.120
tax the defense contractor,

10
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:33.240
find out what the military industrial complex is really made of find out how

11
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:36.660
much money they're really making and saying, Hey, look at you guys,

12
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:40.590
you made X amount of billions of dollars. And look at all these guys that,

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.820
you know, we have to fund,

14
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.240
we have to rely on charities and we have to rely on things like the wounded

15
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:49.020
warrior project and all these foundations that are taking care of these veterans

16
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.710
when you're the ones who are profiting. And I mean that,

17
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.950
that's where the money should come from. Sound like they're poor.

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.320
These are insanely rich organizations.

19
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.110
<v 0>Yeah. Their stocks have tripled in the last four years there.</v>

20
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.160
They're doing real well.

21
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.280
<v 1>When we had that situation where Dick Cheney,</v>

22
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.380
who was the CEO of how Burton was giving Halliburton no bid contracts to go

23
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:15.330
over and fix places that we bombed. It's like what? Yeah. That,

24
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.570
that is like a doctor breaking people's legs so he can fix them.

25
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.530
So it's so crazy. And then drive around a Porsche.

26
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.210
It's crazy.

27
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.811
<v 0>Yeah. Well,</v>

28
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:28.560
Trump was sitting down at some table with all the head defense contractors a

29
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:31.230
couple months ago and it was after the [inaudible], you know, dismemberment in

30
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.230
 the embassy. And, uh,

31
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.230
 he was openly talking about how we can not stop that $110 billion weapons deal. 

32
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.230
And, and you should see the

33
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.230
, just the glee on these people's faces. I mean, it was just, it's

34
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.063
 just unbelievable how transparent it is, especially under.

35
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.980
<v 1>That was a weird conversation. Where, who was he being interviewed by? Oh,</v>

36
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:54.120
Steve, Steve Hilton. My friend. I know Steve Hilton and I'm that guy forever.

37
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.520
Um, we're actually family, friends.

38
00:01:56.521 --> 00:02:00.000
Our families have gone on vacations together and. It's a good guy. Is that the.

39
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.863
<v 0>Fox news?</v>

40
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.550
<v 1>No, no. It's one of the named.</v>

41
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.530
<v 0>Paris. No.</v>

42
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.820
<v 1>He's British. But, um, he was interviewing, um,</v>

43
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.130
Trump and they were talking about the mill and Trump was openly discussing how

44
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.270
these people want to go to war.

45
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.380
The military industrial complex wants to go to war. I mean, Trump's saying that,

46
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.970
you know, he didn't want to have anything to do with this,

47
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:27.840
but that they want to go to war. And it's like, like it's,

48
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.070
Trump is a weird guy because he's such a loose cannon that he says like that,

49
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:35.790
that you don't, that Obama would keep it, his cards, you know,

50
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.920
a Bama would hide his cards, but Trump hate him or love him. He,

51
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.450
he gives you glimpses that you're not going to get as far as like,

52
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:49.380
what kind of influence does the military industrial complex really have on

53
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:53.220
policy change and, and decision-making and whether or not they take action.

54
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.480
And he was openly discussing.

55
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.570
<v 0>He removes the mask. You know, it's,</v>

56
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:01.120
it's interesting because he think that he's talking out of both sides of his

57
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.850
mouth because on one hand he says that kind of stuff.

58
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.290
But then on the other hand, I mean,

59
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:10.060
he hired all the most rabid war generals in his cabinet.

60
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:12.220
And also just John Bolton. I mean, come on.

61
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:16.840
This is like a maniacal neoconservative who should have been for war with Iran

62
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:20.320
since the day he was born. So it's like, if you don't want war with Iran,

63
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.900
I mean, he campaigned on it. So we know that he hates Iran.

64
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.150
He campaigned on abolishing the nuclear deal with Iran,

65
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.320
but then he picks John Bolton to lead all of these efforts. I mean, it's like,

66
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.850
it's like starting a fire and then getting applauded and congratulated when you

67
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.410
stop the fire at the last minute,

68
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:37.600
before it erupts and takes over the whole planet.

69
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.330
And that's what would happen if we actually did bomb Iran,

70
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.590
I think that people don't understand how precarious the situation is that Trump

71
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.570
and these cronies have laid out.

72
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.460
<v 1>Not just his, but came so close to being a reality just a week ago.</v>

73
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.800
<v 0>You mean you don't think we should go to war after, uh,</v>

74
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.460
for bombing oil tankers and, um, Saudi oil tankers.

75
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:59.260
You don't think we should go to war over shooting down.

76
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.720
<v 1>A robot, shot our robot.</v>

77
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.610
<v 0>I would die for Saudi oil tankers and I'd be the first one to put my body on the</v>

78
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:06.880
line.

79
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.530
<v 1>I mean, there was a lot of people that were saying,</v>

80
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:11.080
this seems like the Gulf of Tonkin too. They're like, I don't,

81
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.430
I'm not buying this at all.

82
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.310
There were so many people that were like really kind of credible people who were

83
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:20.200
openly saying this stinks. Like it just seems staged. It seems like some,

84
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.200
some bit like why would they do.

85
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.350
<v 0>It's total false flag, going on over and over and over again.</v>

86
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.250
They're just trying so hard because they want to provoke Iran to the point where

87
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:35.110
he, Ron will be forced to respond. And this is after suffocating X fixating,

88
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:38.050
the sanctions that have, that are causing people's lives. I mean.

89
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.950
<v 1>For the folks that haven't been paying attention to this,</v>

90
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.980
what is it that makes them want to go to war with Iran?

91
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.940
<v 0>So we have to just look at what he, Ron is. I mean, he,</v>

92
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:53.110
Ron just won its independence less than a hundred years ago in a, you know,

93
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:55.840
an era of an, a wave of anti-colonial struggles.

94
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.430
And we immediately the [inaudible] as well as the CA CIA instigated a

95
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.610
coup. So we always talk about how we want Iran to have democracy.

96
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.560
They had democracy, they had a revolution,

97
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:07.660
a people's revolution that was overthrown.

98
00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:12.220
We overthrew Mohamed Moza duck and in stated a absolute monarchy for

99
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:12.821
decades.

100
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:17.380
And at the time it had the highest human rights abuses documented in the world.

101
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.740
It was pretty unique in that sense. And, you know,

102
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:23.560
you can only imagine why Iran is the way it is today.

103
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:28.270
And there was such a suppression of the left end of the communist party in Iran

104
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:32.230
that the Islamic revolutionary, um, revolution happened.

105
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:35.080
And the Ayatollah was the leader of that political movement.

106
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.200
And that's why Iran has the political system it has today,

107
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.350
but it's about the oil man. And it's always about the oil.

108
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:44.320
And it's always about the foreign domination of the region.

109
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.730
They hate that Iran is an independent country and doesn't bow down to us

110
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:53.380
imperialism and the U S capitalism and Iran also is allies with a lot of

111
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:57.130
states that is real in the us and Saudi Arabia do not want it to be allies,

112
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.090
you know, Hezbollah, Hamas. Um, and so that's,

113
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:06.950
that's a big problem for the U S and it's getting in the way of a lot of kind

114
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:08.330
of goals in the region.

115
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.320
But it's really fascinating when you look at what actually happened,

116
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:16.480
because you know, the nuclear deal was amazing. It was huge. I mean,

117
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.600
Trump keeps belaboring the fact that he, Iran should not have nuclear weapons.

118
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.060
They didn't have nuclear weapons. They never did.

119
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.780
And they were agreeing to never have them. That was the whole Iran nuclear deal.

120
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.740
But, um,

121
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.720
Trump just immediately rescinded that slapped insane sanctions on

122
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:35.480
Iran. And now, you know, sanctions every month,

123
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.100
just continuing to constrict their economy and even basically sanctions on

124
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.150
threatening sanctions on China and India and other countries that actually do

125
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:48.560
deals with Iran now, too, which is totally insane. So once you do that,

126
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.320
um, and then you say, well, you know, you're hitting yourself,

127
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:53.300
you're hitting yourself. Why are you doing this? It's like, no,

128
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:56.960
you're doing this to them. And on top of that, John Bolton keeps saying,

129
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:59.180
you know, there's all these unique threats coming from Iran.

130
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:01.370
We need to surround them with all these warships.

131
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.160
And they keep sending thousands of more troops, thousands, more troops.

132
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:07.040
So you're getting to a position now and now the drone, right?

133
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.630
We're flying a drone into Iranian airspace and expecting that they're not going

134
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:14.360
to shoot that down. Why the are we flying a drone and Iran,

135
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.170
the would we do if Iran flew a drone in here, right? I mean,

136
00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:19.610
it's just unbelievable.

137
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.420
The chauvinism and arrogance of the U S to be doing all this and then be like,

138
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.740
okay, now you guys are a belligerent threat. We have to do something. It's like,

139
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:32.630
no, you guys are the ones in circling them and enclosing all of their, you know,

140
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.710
basically just encapsulating their entire territory and threatening them over

141
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:40.130
and over and over again, basically hoping for something to happen.

142
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.020
And if you look back at the Gulf of Tonkin,

143
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.510
there was a guy who was actually on the USS Maddix,

144
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:49.280
the ship that was eventually attacked and got us into the

145
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:52.490
war with Vietnam. And he even said, um,

146
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.390
my dad was on the ship and he said, we had no idea why we were there.

147
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.480
And one of the generals or captains on the ship just said,

148
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.160
they want us to be hit.

149
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.730
They want us to be a tax so they can get into a war that they want to get into.

150
00:08:04.731 --> 00:08:06.290
And that's exactly what's going on.

151
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:09.290
And what's sad is whoever's in the Navy circling Iran.

152
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.040
They're going to be the ones who die when he, Ron does launch back.

153
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.030
They're sacrificing themselves for these generals and defense contractors

154
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:17.864
profits.

155
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.310
<v 1>Now there's some reason to believe that I ran as not being honest about its</v>

156
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:23.540
nuclear program. Right. I mean,

157
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:26.810
that was one of the reasons why it wasn't that what was the virus that the

158
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:31.550
United States Stuxnet Stuxnet virus that they put on the Iranian nuclear program

159
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.450
to, to kill it while they were in the middle of, um, um,

160
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.980
doing whatever they do to uranium.

161
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.370
<v 0>That's right. The centrifuges for the enriched enriching uranium. I mean, yeah,</v>

162
00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:44.680
that, that was, uh, that was also crazy it's cyber attacks. Right, right.

163
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.500
<v 1>Um, but the cyber attacks weren't they effective though in stopping the nuclear</v>

164
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:51.830
program, there was like a secret nuclear program that they were doing.

165
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.340
<v 0>I don't know what exactly, they, I don't think that ever was a nuclear program,</v>

166
00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:59.310
but I know that that was another crazy thing that the U S did was basically

167
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:03.390
infect their thing and destroy all of this technology. But I mean,

168
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.320
basically all we need to know is that they agreed to not develop nukes.

169
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:09.660
And it was all agreed from the international community.

170
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:12.150
And then Trump gets in there and just unravels it all.

171
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:16.200
And it's so dangerous because Iran would make Iraq look like child's play.

172
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.810
It's not a joke. And I mean,

173
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:22.500
it's literally so precarious at this point that anything can happen.

174
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:25.710
And he re-upped into a full blown war. And then when Trump says, oh,

175
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:30.090
I pulled back the airstrike because I wanted to save 150 lives. No, dude,

176
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:32.220
you're starting fires all over the world.

177
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.550
And then you get applauded and you want to congratulate yourself because somehow

178
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:39.750
he's still kind of appealing to this like non-interventionist line,

179
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:43.410
which is just fake to me because you don't appoint the most rabid war,

180
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:45.960
hungry people to surround you and to carry out these policies,

181
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.330
if you don't want that, to a certain extent.

182
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.280
<v 1>We also created this really weird ideological rift where people were</v>

183
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:55.170
complaining that he didn't do anything.

184
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.790
And people were upset that he was going to take action. And he didn't.

185
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.870
There was even about the drone. Yeah. Well,

186
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.240
did he will about the drone and about the attacking of the oil tankers and that

187
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:10.230
he was ready to launch, then he didn't. And what was the one of the Fox guys?

188
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.170
It was talking about the consequences of taking no actions.

189
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:15.990
Like I was Brian Kilmeade or one of those guys.

190
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.610
<v 0>It is insane, but the media has been attacking him and the Democrats do,</v>

191
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.850
and the media and the Democrats always attack this administration from the

192
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:27.360
right, whenever there's some sort of military involvement,

193
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.800
they always want him to bomb and go to war. It's pretty shocking. I mean,

194
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.320
I guess not too shocking when you realize the corporate media is literally

195
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:38.490
subsidized by oil companies and banks and defense contractors. No, you.

196
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.540
<v 1>Didn't. That's pretty crazy.</v>
