00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.880
<v 2>Well, there was also some pretty heavy moments in the documentary,</v>

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.880
the series where you talk about yourself. Yeah.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.440
And you talk about your own experiences as child being raped. Yeah.

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.440
Which is it unexpected and very intense.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.053
And

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.150
how difficult was that to sort of express on camera?

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.430
<v 1>Well, I'm pretty comfortable talking about that. Um, yeah. About being, yeah.</v>

9
00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:32.110
About being raped when I was seven years old,

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.150
but it was relevant to this show because it came up like to your earlier point

11
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:39.790
about the sort of topics that, or that, that what a dark world, it was up there.

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.340
Right. And like, like why, so it's like,

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.220
why am I drawn to those kinds of stories and why have I spent so much of my

14
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:49.700
professional life steeping myself in

15
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.700
dark worlds, criminal subcultures. Right. So that was, that was,

16
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.020
that was why that particular part of my, my life story, I think,

17
00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:02.850
was actually relevant to this, to this series. But to answer your question,

18
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.290
how difficult was it? Not, not very difficult.

19
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.930
It was difficult for me to go public with that story for the first time,

20
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:13.930
which was in 2004. I mean, I'd lived with it as a secret,

21
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.730
like pretty much my entire life,

22
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.570
but the decision to write about it was that was a very difficult decision,

23
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.600
a very difficult thing to, but between, you know, since then, I've,

24
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.880
I've gotten pretty comfortable talking about it publicly. I mean,

25
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:30.080
that story's been adapted as a play really, you know,

26
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:32.640
it's been produced all over the world play. Yeah. Yeah.

27
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:34.840
It's called stalking the boogieman. Like I wrote a,

28
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.640
I wrote an essay called stalking the boogieman. That's kind of when,

29
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:42.400
when I went public with that, I was, uh, that I'd been raped when I was seven.

30
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.510
And then I had then planned to kill the guy when I was in my early thirties.

31
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.390
Like that was the subject of the yeah. Of the essay.

32
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.030
And then that was adapted as a play and it was on, you know, uh,

33
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.190
this American life. And so, um,

34
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.510
I've gotten, I've gotten comfortable with, uh,

35
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:02.630
talking about that over the years. Were you, you.

36
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.871
<v 0>Were,</v>

37
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:07.820
you approached by law enforcement when you kind of went public about wanting to

38
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.100
stalk this person, a felon, I.

39
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.900
<v 1>Arrested. You got arrested. I got arrested really? Yeah. After the, the,</v>

40
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:15.180
after the, uh, the first essay came out,

41
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.180
the cops cops arrested me because I I'd,

42
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.580
I'd admitted stalking the guy and planning to murder him. I mean,

43
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.490
I'd admitted Tom behavior in, in the, in the piece that was published.

44
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.490
<v 0>Had the guy ever been prosecuted for what he did to you?</v>

45
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.010
<v 1>No. No.</v>

46
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.050
He was a juvenile when it happened and also like the statute of limitations.

47
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.010
It happened in Alaska, the statute of limitations expired. And also it's,

48
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.890
you know, it's my word against his, you know, at that point, I mean, so I,

49
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.920
since gone to the police and filed an official police report, um,

50
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.210
but I mean,

51
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.210
I withheld his name in the first piece that I published and I let him know.

52
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.880
Cause I mean, I met with him in person as part of the reporting, if you will,

53
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.120
of that piece, what was that like? Um,

54
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.000
it was a pretty uncomfortable conversation. FA you know,

55
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.640
it was a pretty uncomfortable conversation cause I'd been following the guy for

56
00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:15.200
months, like planning to kill him. And I didn't tell him that when we met,

57
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.360
how old, how old were you at the time? Let's see, I was early thirties,

58
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.830
the 32 33. And how old.

59
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.630
<v 0>Was he then? How old was he when it.</v>

60
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.390
<v 1>Happened? He was, he was at the, when it happened, he was in his, uh,</v>

61
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.150
late teens was still, still a juvenile though. So 16, 17.

62
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.310
Um, so he was a bit him in his early forties when I was stalking him.

63
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.750
And then when he and I met and how'd you meet him?

64
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.540
<v 0>How'd you arrange it? Well.</v>

65
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.500
<v 1>I sent him a letter. I sent him a letter, uh,</v>

66
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.460
like I sent him a register mail letter, a FedEx letter. And, uh,

67
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.940
I just made sure he was gonna get this letter and that I knew he'd gotten it.

68
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:54.300
And there was a couple reasons for that one is by that time I had planned to

69
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:59.260
publish this essay and just for like legal reasons needed to let

70
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:02.690
him know that this was, I needed to give him a chance to comment. Okay.

71
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.913
Even though in the letter,

72
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.530
I didn't tell him that I was planning to write the piece. I was just like,

73
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.930
listen, I remember what happened and you and I need to meet. Okay.

74
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.290
And if you don't respond this letter,

75
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.450
I'm gonna show up on your doorstep and have a conversation with your wife.

76
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.480
So he responded like pretty quickly and we a meeting,

77
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.441
uh,

78
00:04:21.441 --> 00:04:25.120
at a restaurant and then I switched up the location several times and we met on

79
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:27.080
the 16th street mall. Why did you switch.

80
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.920
<v 0>Up the locations?</v>

81
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.680
<v 1>I thought he might be dangerous. You know, that's just like basic sort of,</v>

82
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.720
but you still met him.

83
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.720
<v 0>Like, I don't understand. What is the purpose of switching up.</v>

84
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.560
<v 1>The location? I didn't want him to be able to set up on the location at all.</v>

85
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.870
I didn't want him to have other people waiting for me there or, or if Tim and,

86
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.790
and I, Frank,

87
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.390
I just wanted to keep him off balance the entire day so that he would be,

88
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.430
he wouldn't, he wouldn't have a possibility to sort of arrange anything.

89
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.350
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; okay. So we met on the 16th street mall,

90
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:59.550
which is pedestrian mall in, in downtown Denver. And, um,

91
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.300
yeah, I just, yeah, I mean, that experience obviously is,

92
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.340
is &lt;laugh&gt; branded my memory pretty clearly. You're a big.

93
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.100
<v 0>Guy, Uhhuh &lt;affirmative&gt; what is he a big guy as well?</v>

94
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.940
<v 1>Not really. No. I mean, he was a lot bigger than me when I was seven. Of course.</v>

95
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.461
You know,

96
00:05:16.461 --> 00:05:19.700
that was one of the first things that crossed my mind is I could just dismantle

97
00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:23.850
this guy. Right. Uh, but we just,

98
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.410
we walked around the block a couple times and I had you talked while you were

99
00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:28.690
walking talked. Yeah. And I had a,

100
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.530
I had a hidden recording device and a bike courier bag and a pistol,

101
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.050
uh, that I was carrying. Were you.

102
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.130
<v 0>Still thinking about killing.</v>

103
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.370
<v 1>Them? I knew I couldn't get away with it. See, I, I, I,</v>

104
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.800
I planned to get away with it. I think I would've gotten away with it.

105
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.703
<v 0>What did he say?</v>

106
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.600
<v 1>He apologized. He apologized and, you know,</v>

107
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.720
he said that, um, you know, that he'd been,

108
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.720
that he'd been sexually assaulted when he was a kid, but it,

109
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.680
which is one of the most infuriating things to me when child molesters or let's

110
00:06:02.681 --> 00:06:03.514
call, 'em what they are,

111
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.840
men who rape children when they put that out there as an excuse

112
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.480
or a rationalization or a reason for the behavior, because, uh,

113
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.710
that just infuriates me. But he apologized,

114
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.510
he said that it happened to him when he was a kid.

115
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.870
And he swore that it had only happened with me,

116
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:28.670
that I was the only person that he'd raped when that person was a child right up

117
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.990
in like repeatedly. And, um, I,

118
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.830
I had been going back and forth on naming him in that essay.

119
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.180
And I,

120
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.900
his telling me that it, I was the only one

121
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.020
in the end. I decided not to name him, like up to when, again, to that point of,

122
00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:52.300
they have to take the story away from me. It was like, we,

123
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.460
we were just like an hour from the print deadline.

124
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.130
And I still didn't know whether I was gonna name him and my editor,

125
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.210
Patty Calhoun at the westward. She was like,

126
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:03.450
just go block yourself in a room for 30 minutes, write both endings.

127
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.330
And then just, we just gotta pick one man,

128
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.370
just like go with whichever one feels. Right.

129
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:11.250
So I wrote one ending that ended with his name and one ending that ended with

130
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.250
how the essay actually ends,

131
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:16.730
which is not naming him and him just sort of disappearing and in the crowd on

132
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:20.360
the mall and went with that one, that one felt right.

133
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.400
It felt like a better ending. And it also, um, it,

134
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.760
it kind of spoke to a point that I wanna make,

135
00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:31.360
which is that they could be anybody, you know? And, uh,

136
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.200
I also wanted to give, wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt.

137
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.000
<v 0>Wow. You're a good man. That's a,</v>

138
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.790
a power powerful thing to be able to forgive someone for such a horrific act.

139
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.350
<v 1>I'm not sure I had forgiven him well.</v>

140
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.270
<v 0>Enough to not name him. Yeah.</v>

141
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.230
That's just to give him that that's a lot
