00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.800
During these overwhelming periods of anxiety and fear and terror

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.480
and injury. And when your body is thinking like, Hey man, this might be it.

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.161
You know,

5
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:15.360
and I think that's probably what a lot of these near death experiences are,

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.000
is that people are experiencing what you would call an endogenous psychedelic

7
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.230
experience that your,

8
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:25.270
your brain is releasing these potent chemicals that it has.

9
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.550
It absolutely has inside of it. Your, your, your brain has a ton of different,

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.870
you know, things like dethyltriptamine and different psychedelic chemicals.

11
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:37.430
It's capable of producing as well as like melatonin, dopamine, serotonin,

12
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.030
adrenaline cortisol. There's,

13
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:42.700
there's a storm room of going on in your brain.

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.660
<v 1>And, and in a moment like your death, just yeah, in a moment like death,</v>

15
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:46.860
like jacks.

16
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.450
<v 0>It all out, it,</v>

17
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.420
your system probably pumps it through your neurons and everything's firing,

18
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:54.460
and you're seeing things that aren't there and you're talking to dead relatives

19
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:57.860
and you're imagining the pearlley gates and you're imagination is on 10.

20
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.970
And you're just seeing everything. That's the reductionionist perspective. The,

21
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.610
the, the hopeful, optimistic, uh,

22
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.890
spiritual woo woo perspective is this is a chemical gateway,

23
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.450
and you're seeing through the door of the other side.

24
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.090
And then when they decide it's not your time yet,

25
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.770
you're sucked back to where you lie.

26
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.690
And then you're allowed to resume this life cuz you have more work to do.

27
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.720
And that's the perspective that a lot of people feel when they come out of those

28
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:26.760
experiences, right? They feel like I have more work to do. I can't stop. Now.

29
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.760
<v 1>My mom years ago, God, it was like 10 years ago.</v>

30
00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:34.760
More than that even maybe 15 years ago at this point had a heart attack, uh,

31
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.760
or a heart episode. Uh, rather my dad died of a heart attack,

32
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.360
but my mom was on the table and they were putting a stent into her heart,

33
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.950
into her artery &lt;affirmative&gt; and uh,

34
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.950
she was sitting there chit chatting while they were doing the surgery.

35
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.710
I guess she was on a local, more so than anything else. And uh,

36
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.390
she was joking around with the doctor. She's like here, I got hurry up doc.

37
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:57.630
Cause I gotta pick up my mom for the, and then went out, whoa.

38
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.230
And so she died for a minute and a half clinically dead.

39
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.060
They kept to restart the art. So I was like, what,

40
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.660
what just, what happened? What was it? And she didn't.

41
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.100
She said, you know, she didn't describe,

42
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:15.740
like I saw the bright lights and I saw people and blah, blah, blah.

43
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.540
She said I was floating and I was like, floating up. She goes,

44
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:22.260
no floating on my back. I was like, okay,

45
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:25.570
well you were on your back and the hospital. Do you think that's what it was?

46
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.130
She's like, I don't know. But this is, this is what I remember.

47
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.883
Every

48
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.130
iota of responsibility I ever felt in my life was gone. She's like,

49
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:42.450
I felt free. Like I felt instantly lighter.

50
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.160
And just as I was heading in a direction,

51
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.120
that's when like they pulled her back.

52
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.480
So she'd been dead for like a minute and a half her hearted stop. So I was like,

53
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:59.240
all right, you've been in this best of all possible worlds for,

54
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.760
you know, 60 plus years.

55
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.880
Now you've seen a glimpse of the other side, which is better.

56
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.640
And my mom said the other side and I said, what?

57
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.040
You were there for like a minute and changed why?

58
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.800
And she said I was completely free.

59
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.910
Like that was it. I didn't, I didn't know this one.

60
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.790
I don't have to care for this one.

61
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.470
I don't have to make sure this isn't taken care of.

62
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:26.270
I don't have to feed the cat. She was like, it was bliss. She's like,

63
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:28.750
and if that's what happens, then I look forward to that again.

64
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.470
So when I was having my three months ago and the doctor was like,

65
00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:34.790
you got a 20% chance of living.

66
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.700
I was sitting there going through all the in my head about like, all right,

67
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:43.020
well, this is it. You're, you've spent your life with your head up your.

68
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.380
You know, trying to figure out who you are. Go ahead,

69
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:49.940
look at your head and heart. What is your, this is it. This is the big moment.

70
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.620
Like, what are your thoughts what's going through? And I, you know,

71
00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:55.900
I'm such a chicken in life. I assume that I'd be like, the guy was like,

72
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.020
I'll suck your Dick to stay in this life.

73
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.050
Cuz I know this life and I don't know what happens afterwards and stuff.

74
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.250
So I thought I'd be begging for, you know,

75
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.250
for help from God or something like that. But I was like, I made dogma.

76
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.130
I'm sure Jesus would be like, go to hell, you buddy Christ my.

77
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.330
So instead of doing the, the religious thing,

78
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.010
I started thinking about just the journey itself. I was like, well,

79
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:21.400
if the journey's ending, what are your thoughts?

80
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.040
Just like when the day held up the phone, they were like,

81
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:28.840
do you wanna talk to your wife? And I was like, I, no, of course I did,

82
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.120
but I didn't want to cuz I was like, I know in my heart of hearts, if I an,

83
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.720
if I speak to my wife right now, I'm gonna be in that 20%. I'm I'm gonna die.

84
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:41.110
I'm gonna be in the 80%. I'm gonna drop dead because cuz that's,

85
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.350
that's the intensity of it. Not even like, oh my God, it's gonna kill me. It,

86
00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:49.830
it just the way they were. So like, do you want your wife is on the phone?

87
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.150
Do you wanna speak to her right now was very leading and

88
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.070
you know,

89
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.230
they're professionals and these cats deal with life and death every day.

90
00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.870
And this was my first experience with it.

91
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.940
So what I got out of it was you're probably gonna die was what they felt. Yeah.

92
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.100
And it still, I was in the state of like,

93
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.900
I didn't even realize I was under a heart attack.

94
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.620
And so I remember looking at the phone and being like, um, if I answer it,

95
00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:16.140
if I talk to Jennifer, that's gonna be it. I'm not gonna leave this room.

96
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.380
So I was like, I'm gonna play the odds if I don't talk to Jennifer,

97
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.410
maybe there's some part of me, me. That's like, look,

98
00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:24.770
I like talking to Jennifer. We've been together 20 years.

99
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.610
I better enjoy talking to Jennifer. Maybe if I put this phone call off,

100
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.890
you know that I'll get to talk to Jennifer when it's all done.

101
00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:36.970
So I said to the dude, I was like, you know what? Tell her, I'll call her back.

102
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.570
And the guy goes seriously. And I was like, yeah.

103
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.080
And I saw him talking and got off the phone and what she said, he goes,

104
00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:47.680
she was dude. And I was like, well, I'm dealing with my own right now.

105
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.840
So I was laying there on the table and I was like going through my life

106
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.880
and I was more grateful than anything else. I wasn't scared anymore.

107
00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:58.440
That was the thing. That was the love thing that I loved to communicate,

108
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.440
spent my whole life terrified of dying.

109
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.840
And when I was as closest to it, as I ever knew I was,

110
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.840
and for all I know I was closer someplace,

111
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.320
but like I was cognizant and told by a professional,

112
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.990
this is risky. I was just kind of,

113
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.550
I was grateful more than anything else. I was like, what a journey like, yeah.

114
00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:25.790
And I'm 47 and it seems short, but like you gotta admit, you did more than,

115
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.510
most people get to do.

116
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.630
And maybe that's why it happened at an early age because you weren't gonna get

117
00:06:30.631 --> 00:06:34.390
the rest of this time and like that. But like I wasn't mad.

118
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.780
I wasn't like why this is unfair. I remembered like, uh,

119
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:40.460
there's a issue of Sandman,

120
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:45.420
which I absolutely love Neil gaman's comic book series back in the day. And uh,

121
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.740
in, in like after the first story arc, uh, he, we meet his sister,

122
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.140
the, the main character's dream Morpheus character of dream. Uh,

123
00:06:55.141 --> 00:06:59.850
he's part of the endless, and he's got a, a other siblings, delirium desire.

124
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.090
One of his siblings is death and they represent death in the comic book.

125
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.530
You know, you're used to seeing the sky than the grim Reaper and.

126
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.530
She's the little, uh, um, emo girl,

127
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.250
goth girl wearing an knock around her neck and like that.

128
00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:17.770
It was written in the nineties and they don't tell you right away,

129
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.200
this she's death as you're reading the issue, you're like, oh.

130
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.240
I think she's meant to be death. She's faring souls over to the other sides.

131
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.040
You see a baby pass and she's holding the baby. And then there's the, the,

132
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.960
the refrain is like the,

133
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.440
I hear the sound of her wings and that's taking this soul over to the next place

134
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.190
as she's sitting around talking to her brother. And so he, uh,

135
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.710
she eventually gets into a room with this older guy. Um, who's like,

136
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.870
who are you? And, and you know, she's like, I'm here for you. You know who I am?

137
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:50.150
And he's like, that's it. He's like, oh my God, I did all these things.

138
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.710
I worked my fingers to the bone and what did I get? This is it. What did I get?

139
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.790
And she says, you like a line that when I read it, when I was 18,

140
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.300
it was powerful. But when I was laying on the table,

141
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.020
it was constantly going through my head and, and made it all easier.

142
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.060
Made me kind of at peace with the idea of dying.

143
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.820
There's this line she says to the guy, she goes, you get, you got what?

144
00:08:11.821 --> 00:08:15.060
Everybody gets, you got a lifetime. And as I was laying there, I was like,

145
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.900
oh my God, I got a lifetime. Like that's, that's what, it was. Nothing more,

146
00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:23.090
nothing less. And I did some in it and now it's gonna stop.

147
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.290
And people are gonna go on without you. And that's not terrible.

148
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.250
Like, I, I thought I'd be desperate to live.

149
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.770
And instead I had that weird,

150
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.010
like I understood what my mother said for the first time,

151
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.400
cuz I was laying there. I was like, oh my God, like I made it to the end.

152
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.440
Like this is it. This is the finish line.

153
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.400
And it had been something that I was terrified of ever getting to,

154
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.120
but then when really kind of faced with it, I was like, oh, like, I'm done.

155
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.760
Like, I'm not scared that I'm done. I'm actually kind of relieved that I'm done.

156
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.880
And like, you know,

157
00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:01.120
like I didn't get killed and I wasn't home invaded a shark.

158
00:09:01.121 --> 00:09:02.400
Didn't eat me. Um,

159
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.960
all the things that like I'd been terrified of my entire life.

160
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.200
Like I don't have to think about anymore.

161
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.840
I made it to the end and it it's kind of okay, so it's weird my whole life.

162
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.910
I thought like, you know, I'd be scared death. And most people we all are,

163
00:09:15.911 --> 00:09:17.870
we're all terrified of dying. Cause we don't know,

164
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.990
but that's the closest I ever came and I wasn't scared.

165
00:09:20.991 --> 00:09:23.590
Like suddenly the fear just went away and it seemed logical.

166
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.830
Like of course it's over like things end and I didn't want to die.

167
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.270
I wasn't didn't have a death wish, but I was like, if it's done, it's,

168
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.380
it's kind of, it's done and count your blessing and be happy. And don't be a.

169
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.340
Like don't if, if the ferryman shows up tonight,

170
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.140
don't hold out. Don't be the last at the party. Go no,

171
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.340
like just pay to ferryman, get on a boat and go,

172
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.820
we'll see what's next and stuff.

173
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.780
And then ultimately laydenheim did a good job and I wound up living and stuff.

174
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.650
So I, I, I know this much. I got to read a bunch of,

175
00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.650
like after I nearly died and it was all nice.

176
00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:03.050
People wrote very nice things about me and. And I expected, you know, this,

177
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.370
the creature of the internet that some people would be like, I wish he had died.

178
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.850
'em to death and. I wish he'd stay silent.

179
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.410
But generally it was like very nice things.

180
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:15.610
People were kind of positive and stuff. So I was like, man. Like,

181
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.160
you know, again, I didn't wanna die,

182
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.400
but like if I had like that,

183
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:26.240
would've been okay now I'm back at it. You know what I'm saying?

184
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.640
Like now until it ends, like I've gotta,

185
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.920
you know, and it's kind of easy.

186
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.280
As long as I don't wake up with a dead girl or a live boy,

187
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.990
I don't think like they'll Roke me over the coals when I die in the future and

188
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.983
like that.

189
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:46.910
But it felt weird to be so close to the completion and having something that

190
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.950
normally terrifies you suddenly be like, oh, it's okay. Like, and, and I don't,

191
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.710
if you walked up and put a gun in my face, I'm sure I'd feel threatened,

192
00:10:55.711 --> 00:11:00.580
but a guy kind of lost my fear of death. I'm not like death defying.

193
00:11:00.581 --> 00:11:03.900
I won't go out and do anything differently. But that,

194
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.660
that dark cloud, that kind of kills any good time.

195
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.140
The moment you start thinking about like the fear and anxiety,

196
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:12.140
you're gonna die one day, like, you know,

197
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.780
it's gone and all of a sudden I'm like, yeah,

198
00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:15.740
I'm gonna die one day and it's gonna be awesome.

199
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.730
But not for the reasons that think I'm saying it's gonna be awesome.

200
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.130
This is gonna be awesome. Because a finish, like it's nice to finish things.

201
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.490
We know how good it feels in life to complete something.

202
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.170
And that's the biggest thing in life you'll ever complete is your journey.

203
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.650
So I didn't walk away going, like I gotta do more.

204
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.810
Like I gotta live life to the fullest. I,

205
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.650
I just gotta keep doing what I've been doing.

206
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.600
Like living life the way I enjoy it, trying to do things. Sometimes they work.

207
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.600
Sometimes I fail and. Sometimes people are on your side.

208
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:50.080
Sometimes people are like, you blow and just do that time.

209
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.200
Have good conversations in the process. Meet interesting people,

210
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.280
hear new points of view and like that and keep at it.

211
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:02.400
But it's nothing to be afraid of. Like, that's awesome.

212
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.800
I don't wanna get eaten by a cat. Don't get me wrong. Like, and I guarantee you,

213
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.720
I would not be philosophical as a big cat was crushing. My, you know,

214
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.070
I'd be like, James, no, I'd find prayer quick. But

215
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.710
death is no longer something. I'm not looking for it. And I certainlyand,

216
00:12:19.711 --> 00:12:23.430
won't put myself in harm's way, but it doesn't precupy me anymore.

217
00:12:23.431 --> 00:12:27.670
I've been there and it's not the thing that I was led to believe.

218
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:32.070
It was like, it's not the, the ultimate fear come true.

219
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.180
It's not the grimmer. APER, there's a sense, at least in my case. And again,

220
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.580
I didn't have a painful heart attack.

221
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.900
I'm sure people have heart attacks where they feel like their bodies being

222
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.260
ripped and cleaved in Twain. But it, it wasn't,

223
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.060
it wasn't that it wasn't scary. It was okay.

224
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.180
<v 0>Well, listen, man, I'm glad you lived. Cause I love you.</v>

225
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.170
And you're one of my favorite people love too. I couldn't talk often. We do. I.

226
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.690
<v 1>I always love it. And after the heart attack, I couldn't wait to, we,</v>

227
00:12:57.691 --> 00:13:00.490
we started texting be like, bro, you gotta come in. I was like, definitely like,

228
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:00.930
I didn't.

229
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.770
<v 0>Want to ask quick&lt;laugh&gt; I wanted.</v>

230
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.650
<v 1>That's the protocol and that's.</v>

231
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.170
<v 0>So gross. Like it's so morbi listen, man. You might not make it.</v>

232
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.410
Do you think you get in here? The next's Tuesdays. Good.

233
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.720
<v 1>Yeah. But no, I, I happy to be here and stuff as all, as,</v>

234
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.760
as we all are happy to be above ground, it's better than below ground.

235
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.200
I'm happy to.

236
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.160
<v 0>Hear your perspective too. Really? I.</v>

237
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.040
<v 1>Pass I along cuz you're a seeker as.</v>

238
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.400
<v 0>Well. And I think it means a lot to a lot of people that are listening too,</v>

239
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:26.880
because that's what everybody's scared of. Right? Oh it blows too.

240
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.800
Everyone's scared of the ride, but you know, we, we.

241
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.040
<v 1>That's what we think we're trained to think that way. Yeah. Every movie,</v>

242
00:13:32.041 --> 00:13:35.590
every book you read, every song is about like how it suck when it's over and.

243
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.350
<v 0>And that fear can keep you from enjoying it while you're living it and.</v>

244
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.310
<v 1>Trying cool things and stuff like that. Yeah.</v>

245
00:13:40.311 --> 00:13:41.990
And I don't mean like putting yourself in harm's way.

246
00:13:41.991 --> 00:13:46.390
Like let's shoot a movie with real lions that's been done. Don't try it.

247
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:48.870
You can watch the video, but the things where you're like,

248
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.150
I'd really like to try it like blah won't work or, oh, there's maybe time later.

249
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.100
That's the one thing I did walk away for meant like time.

250
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.180
You're lucky for every second, every God second. So use it.

251
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.620
<v 0>Wisely and, and, and think, and I think if you can just think that way,</v>

252
00:14:05.621 --> 00:14:08.820
like today's a borrowed day. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, you'll have,

253
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.860
sometimes you have to trick yourself into like finding more enthusiasm.

254
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.420
You have to trick yourself to be pumped up about stuff.

255
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.130
But if you can really do that and, and,

256
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.010
and exercise those patterns in your brain and get them normal, there's,

257
00:14:22.011 --> 00:14:25.570
there's people that have tricked themselves into enjoying all sorts of things

258
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:29.730
that they know are good for them. Right. They just fire up those chemicals.

259
00:14:29.731 --> 00:14:33.610
And today we're gonna just go out there and attack this day because this is a

260
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:36.840
gift. This is this isn't supposed to be here. We got.

261
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.280
<v 1>One. I think that all the time now, honestly,</v>

262
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:44.000
that's like an underlying that goes under almost every thought I have and it

263
00:14:44.001 --> 00:14:47.720
doesn't happen constantly, but it literally happens about 10 times a week.

264
00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.120
You'll be doing something you'll be heading somewhere.

265
00:14:50.121 --> 00:14:54.080
You'll be eating something whatever to having a conversation.

266
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.200
And then you'll be like this isn't supposed to be happening right now.

267
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.200
I technically based on the odds, I was supposed to die back on that table.

268
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.680
So suddenly you're like, I'm playing on house money, house money,

269
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.000
you know what I'm saying? Have a live a house, money life kids live a house.

270
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.240
<v 0>Money, life kids. That should be a t-shirt.</v>

271
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:20.830
<v 2>The.</v>
