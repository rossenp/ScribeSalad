00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.940
The other thing that's coming out tomorrow is a tape where apparently Rudy

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:10.560
Giuliani tries to a 15 year old, allegedly, allegedly,

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.300
allegedly, allegedly what's funny is like, apparently his take on it.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.710
And again, he's older than us.

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.890
So his memory is probably terrible because it happened quite a while ago,

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.833
but they filmed this,

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.930
his take on it was that he was proud that they didn't get him the way they've

9
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:28.860
got other people. And the article that I was reading last night, it was it's.

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.370
The death of journalism is so apparent when you read

11
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:37.680
articles and then you see the actual thing and you go,

12
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:41.280
what the did you just write? Because this is not what it is, right?

13
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.500
This is like, these takes on things that are so it's, it's,

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.351
it's,

15
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:50.880
there's so much hyperbole and there's some was exaggeration and bias until we

16
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:52.830
watch it. We won't be able to know.

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.270
<v 1>Yeah. So I'm, you know, I'm mixed up tomorrow, but you know,</v>

18
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.710
you have me at bhorat so.

19
00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.900
<v 0>Barrettes. Yeah. I mean, listen,</v>

20
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.210
I still think Ali G into house is one of the most underrated comedy

21
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:07.910
films of all time. Especially if you like weed,

22
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.270
I wouldn't recommend it this month, sober October,

23
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.120
but when sober October is over ology in the house,

24
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.100
I actually bought a UK version of a VHS player because

25
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:22.730
it was only available on VHS from the UK. Okay.

26
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.350
Was it VHS or DVD?

27
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.740
You talking about the actual allergy series? No, it was a movie.

28
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.930
<v 1>Okay. Oh yeah. That one too. But a movie, but even,</v>

29
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:37.310
even the series was available for a long time. I had to like do the conversion.

30
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.683
Yeah.

31
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.660
<v 0>You're right, Brian. It was a DVD and it was an all regions.</v>

32
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.510
I'd buy an all regions player. And um,

33
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.830
because like players were limited to like certain region. It was really weird.

34
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.350
I don't have that to do you know what the science behind it is?

35
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.840
<v 2>Uh, it was different frequencies.</v>

36
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:58.550
I think it was Powell versus H or NTSC and TSC or some of them were

37
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.170
universal. They play everything. Yeah.

38
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.030
Some of the cheaper ones that you could buy,

39
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:06.350
like at Fry's had like a secret like menu, you could switch it back and forth.

40
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.760
<v 0>Yeah. That was the key. The key, right? It was like a cheaper one. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.420
So I had to buy one. I bought,

42
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.910
literally bought a DVD player specifically for this film.

43
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.170
Me and Eddie Bravo got barbecued and we watched this and could not stop

44
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.500
laughing. It's a hilarious movie. It's really ridiculous.

45
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.280
So apparently that, that comes out tomorrow.

46
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.510
And Rudy Giuliani is allegedly trying to a 15 year old,

47
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.410
but it wasn't really a 15 year old. She was in her twenties playing 15 year old.

48
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.480
He goes, really Gilan speaks out about, on Bora to controversy calls it,

49
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.900
hit job over a hunter Biden campaign.

50
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.780
But how could it be a hip hop over the a hundred binding campaign if they shot

51
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:45.770
it in July, bro.

52
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.380
<v 1>There's no logic to it. Right. It's just, they're just trying to cover it.</v>

53
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.590
<v 0>I think they have to say that. I want to know what the girl looked like,</v>

54
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.240
because they said she was playing a girl was 15, but I believe she's like 25.

55
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.970
Something like that. How old is the gal? Here's the,

56
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.730
oh, that's it was here. It does pants. Oh, Jesus Christ.

57
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.420
<v 1>Looking for hunter Biden's laptop in there somewhere.</v>

58
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.480
I guess he was saying he was tucking in his shirt, but.

59
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.970
<v 0>Why would he do that? Imagine if that was him in your room, lying on the bed.</v>

60
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.130
You'd be like, Hey man, what are you doing? Unless like,

61
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.040
you'd have to be a good friend. Yeah. They were so comfortable.

62
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:28.800
They could lie on their bed and adjust their balls, you know?

63
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.180
But if you just met a person and you're lying in the bed with the hand on the

64
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:37.650
Johnson with does he have sunglasses on too? It looks like he's on Coke.

65
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.230
<v 3>He's he's gotta.</v>

66
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.370
<v 0>Be, he's probably smoking, smoking Coke. He's on Viagra.</v>

67
00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:47.100
And this girl is touching him too. She's checking.

68
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.610
<v 1>Off his microphone internally because she's you didn't.</v>

69
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.930
<v 0>Have the wire tuck. Cause they do talk them down your pants. That is true. Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.130
I would like to see the film, the footage of it. We're gonna tomorrow.

71
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.760
Because if that that's the only thing that does make sense in his defense.

72
00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:03.594
Like if,

73
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.020
cause sometimes they put those things down your pants and you do got to get in

74
00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:10.710
there to get the wire out if he's taking the microphone off.

75
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.360
Yeah.

76
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.120
<v 1>I don't know. Also I don't want to get your mind back here.</v>

77
00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:17.460
Like drop it down my jacket and put it on the back here.

78
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.060
I don't know why he's putting it in his pants. That's true. That's true too.

79
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.860
Yeah. Why would you have it in there? He.

80
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.620
<v 0>Might've had it in the front pocket so he could sit down. Um,</v>

81
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.700
they often do that.

82
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.170
They'll put the mic in your front pocket as opposed to in your back the

83
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.530
backyard. Cause if you sit down on a chair that think digs into your back,

84
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.690
I've had it in my front pocket before. But the thing is like the gal.

85
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.580
See they're.

86
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.550
<v 1>Being pretty good about not showing their, her not showing her. Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.050
<v 0>I want to know like,</v>

88
00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:50.430
did he know that she was supposed to be 15 or did he just think she was a girl?

89
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.440
Here's the thing. If, if, if she is in her twenties and this is all speculation,

90
00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:58.530
right? If she is in her twenties and she's beautiful,

91
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.750
the problem is he's gross and he's old and a beautiful girl. If she was,

92
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:06.570
and we would have to see the footage, but if she was being flirtatious,

93
00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:10.740
like he's, he's helpless. He's under a spell,

94
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.590
like, uh, an old up look a dude like that. If he thinks like, oh my God,

95
00:05:16.591 --> 00:05:17.700
this might like that.

96
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:20.940
Might've been the last time I'm going to have a heart attack tonight. Yeah.

97
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.940
Then a gal who's an attractive young gal decides to.

98
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.530
<v 1>Uh, but I'd do it in his lawyer. I do it in his position.</v>

99
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:31.080
Has to know that that's coming, that.

100
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.680
<v 0>You gotta set up is coming, uh, set ups coming. Maybe not anymore.</v>

101
00:05:34.681 --> 00:05:39.420
Maybe he forgot like he's old dude. Yeah. You know? Yeah. I mean,

102
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.980
you gotta think. Not only that,

103
00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:45.100
but he's been under this tremendous stress of being a top lawyer for the,

104
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:48.450
the most up administration in the history of the United States.

105
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.220
So it's like the, just the legal he's been battling back and forth. Yeah.

106
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.500
It's a show. It's a show his brains probably hosed.

107
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.270
And he's probably in this hotel room going,

108
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.960
oh this is versus throwing me a bone. Oh yes.

109
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.530
<v 1>Yes it is. Oh yes. Big old bone.</v>

110
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.650
Just not for you to chew on. It's.

111
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.050
<v 0>Never stopped. It just never stops.</v>

112
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.530
<v 4>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

113
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.650
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

114
00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:21.820
they're going to be available everywhere.

115
00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:25.390
But after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

116
00:06:25.391 --> 00:06:29.410
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

117
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.480
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much.

118
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.590
Buh-bye.
