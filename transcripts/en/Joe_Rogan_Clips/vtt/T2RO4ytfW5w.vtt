<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.450
<v 2>While we live in a crazy age, it's fun, but stressful, stressful.</v>

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.410
<v 1>Well, and for your study for the study of human life extension.</v>

4
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:14.790
And anti-aging when you look at the stresses that are

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:19.260
completely, they're very novel to the human experience,

6
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.300
like the stresses of social media,

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.870
the stresses of cell phone use the stresses of blue light,

8
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:27.360
like staring at screens at night. Like all that stuff.

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.900
How much of an effect do you think that's having on people?

10
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:32.370
And have we even quantified that yet?

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.790
<v 0>Uh, we are quantifying it and it's having a real negative effect.</v>

12
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.960
Mental health issues is going to be the medical problem of the 21st century.

13
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.040
No question. There are companies that are doing these, uh,

14
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.360
remote video chats with a psychologist or psychiatrist. They are booming.

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.750
These are the next billion dollar companies. Yeah. Oh, you want to,

16
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.370
anyone want to make money, look into that,

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.940
but we are living in a stressful world and part of it's because we don't have

18
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.810
much else to worry about. We've gotten rid of all the major worries wolves.

19
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.630
Yeah. We don't have to. We went out on the Savannah anymore.

20
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.960
We're not going to get picked off by a cheater. Well, a lion probably,

21
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.020
but we built this world. We, you know, 6 million years ago,

22
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:13.950
the first hominid ape-like thing was up in the tree,

23
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.380
walking around actually upright, which is interesting, right?

24
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.960
It wasn't swinging from the branches that picked up a stick.

25
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.520
That animal picked up a stick.

26
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.190
And that was put us on this treadmill where we are today,

27
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.970
innovation after innovation tool, after tool, after tool. But in response,

28
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:31.260
our bodies have deteriorated. We only build our bodies as much as we need to.

29
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:35.370
So if we've got tools and we can throw rocks, we don't need a lot of muscles.

30
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.121
And in fact,

31
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:38.700
our head just expanded so we could build better tools faster and faster.

32
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.070
And you know, the culmination of that is an iPhone,

33
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.280
but where are we going to be in another hundred thousand years?

34
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:46.680
It's really scary because this treadmill, we cannot get off.

35
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:48.960
It there's no going back. There's no stationary.

36
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.600
Cause we've got problems that we've already created from our own technology that

37
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:53.070
we have to solve with better technology.

38
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.660
So that we're a species that once we've picked up that stick we're on this path

39
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.100
and those things that got us here,

40
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.790
there are actually four traits that I can think of that got us here that make us

41
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:07.380
different from all other animals. Those are our, not just our, what got us here.

42
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:09.240
They're our biggest threat. And,

43
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:11.490
but we also have to use them to get us out of this problem.

44
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.193
<v 1>And one of those.</v>

45
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.690
<v 0>Well, let's see. So the first one is toolmaking okay. No big deal.</v>

46
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.890
We've got hands that have evolved us, throw rocks shoes. Um,

47
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.570
our feet actually a built for shoes.

48
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.740
Imagine that they're only jeans that we've in feet are built for shoes. Yeah.

49
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.820
Yeah. Our feet actually are.

50
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.080
We've had shoes for so many years that we've got feet. That fit shoes.

51
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.680
<v 1>I've seen what it looks like when those guys in the Amazon walk around with no</v>

52
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:37.080
feet and they develop these hand like feet.

53
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.310
<v 0>Oh, they.</v>

54
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.410
<v 1>Can pick up stuff. Oh no, you have to see this.</v>

55
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.150
Because what happens is when they walk around barefoot in the dirt for so long,

56
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.440
their toes develop the ability to grip. So they're gripping the ground.

57
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.341
So their toes,

58
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:53.250
instead of being like a person wear shoes all the time where the toes are all

59
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:57.480
connected, they splay out like hands. That's very.

60
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.200
<v 0>Strange. I want, I want that.</v>

61
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.251
<v 1>My friend,</v>

62
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:05.110
Steve Rinella was in Guyana and he was hanging out with his tribe and they

63
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.060
live, they live in the forest and like, look at their feet.

64
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.130
<v 0>That's incredible. Maybe that's the way we should.</v>

65
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.300
<v 1>It was that.</v>

66
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.420
So the way I think people lived when they lived in the jungle forever,

67
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.070
this is the Hora. How do you say that? Horani um,

68
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.160
this is the Ecuadorian rainforest. These people, this, um,

69
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.880
when you look at their feet, I think it's soft ground.

70
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.870
And they're walking around in dirt all the time and they,

71
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.910
their feet splay out and they develop the ability to like push off

72
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.800
of things with their feet. So it's,

73
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.020
it's the exact opposite of the way human beings develop bunions or

74
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:48.640
they smush their feet into like these shoes that don't really fit

75
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:49.474
human feet.

76
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.480
And then they get these weird Bunyan's where their toes are pointed towards the

77
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:55.330
other toes. This is the opposite. They spread out like fingers.

78
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.920
<v 0>Yeah. Well we can trace the genetics of this. W we become a very weak species.</v>

79
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.540
If you get into a fight with, uh, with, you know, let's say a Chimp,

80
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.960
let's say a.

81
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.040
<v 1>House cat, even.</v>

82
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.670
<v 0>That will bite you off a dog, your face off, right. We we're at their mercy,</v>

83
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.080
but even the strongest human cannot beat your average Chimp or any Chimp that

84
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.660
pathetic. So what, we're basically a lollipop,

85
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.760
physique where a stick with a big head,

86
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.030
but that's because we've had these tools for so many years, we've had fire.

87
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:24.640
Even our guts have shrunken down. We don't have long intestine.

88
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.930
So he put us out in the wild we're screwed. We can no longer exist in the wild.

89
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.790
Yeah. But I live in Boston. I'm out there in the winter for maybe 10 minutes.

90
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:35.470
I'm dead. So that's who we are. Now.

91
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:40.120
We are this pathetic physical species that has built tools that are

92
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:43.330
goddess here, but are actually messing with our minds. The, the blue light,

93
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:46.120
the chairs, we sit in the food, we eat all the time.

94
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.890
These have made us a weakest species.

95
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.520
So what I'm hoping to do with my research and,

96
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:55.180
and some companies are building is to get us out of that problem and engineer

97
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:59.260
our way out and also make wellness and health a thing that people actually can

98
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:00.550
take care of themselves.

99
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.480
<v 1>And what are the steps that there's one thing that people can do.</v>

100
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.260
And exercise is a good one, right? Because of the fact that we live,

101
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:11.590
these sedentary lifestyles and most of the time people are sitting down and

102
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.990
there's a lot of time spent standing at screens.

103
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.280
How important do you think it is to get out and do something?

104
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:19.870
And what kind of an effect does that have?

105
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:23.410
Like what kind of quantifiable effect does that have on life extension? Oh,

106
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:23.740
it's very.

107
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.440
<v 0>We're clear. There, there are two things you can do, uh,</v>

108
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.200
that are well known to extend your lifespan. And when I say extend lifespan,

109
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.730
I don't mean be older for longer. I mean,

110
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:34.270
be healthier in your eighties and nineties. Like my dad, who's turning 82,

111
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:38.380
who's got the physic and mental aptitude of a,

112
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.470
probably a 30 year old he's stronger than me. So you want that? Okay.

113
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:43.690
So what you have to do, well, you have to start early.

114
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.320
You can't just start when you're 80, although it helps, but it's not the best.

115
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.410
Do you want to just get out of the chair? People say walk,

116
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:54.070
but I think it's better to lose your breath, become hypoxic, hypoxia, chambers,

117
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.020
or hyperbaric chambers. These stress, the body a little bit.

118
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.320
So run for 10 minutes a few times a week. That's what I do. Um,

119
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.650
and you don't have to run for hours. It's just 10 minutes is enough go biking.

120
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:08.540
So it's a fact that people who regularly ride bikes and I think it

121
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:11.510
was something like up to 80 miles a week,

122
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.980
but they would have a 40% less chance of having a heart attack than someone who

123
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:17.840
didn't do that. So it's a massive change,

124
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.630
not just a little thing at the margins, massive changes.

125
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.730
The other thing is which I do, uh, is to skip meals. So it's not that hard. I,

126
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.670
I now feel, wait if I eat a meal for breakfast or lunch,

127
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.710
and I try not to snack to this, this idea of nutritionists three meals a day,

128
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:36.890
plus snacks never be hungry, is killing us. It really is.

129
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:40.790
And we know that if you do these things to animals in controlled settings,

130
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.010
they live longer, a lot longer, 20,

131
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.710
sometimes 30% because they're healthier for longer.

132
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:49.070
They don't get cancer and heart disease and dementia.

133
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.680
So I don't know why we don't all do that.

134
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:54.170
I just think we just like to sit around and eat earth Watson.

135
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.220
<v 1>It's good. It feels good. Just eat chips. Yeah. But M and.</v>

136
00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.060
<v 0>M just.</v>

137
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.740
<v 1>Feels good. Oh, for sure. Yeah. But is there like, so when you talk about,</v>

138
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.790
um, how eating one meal a day can extend your life,

139
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.670
is it because when you're eating all the time,

140
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:14.510
you're taxing your digestive system, which taxes your resources,

141
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.370
or is there some sort of a mechanism that leads to

142
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:23.030
decay of the human body from over-consumption? Like, what is it?

143
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.601
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

144
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:27.290
So over consumption or just consumption in general makes your body complacent.

145
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.780
And we know this in great detail at the molecular level,

146
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:32.870
there are genes that respond to how much you're eating and what you're eating

147
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.130
and why they're exercising.

148
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.570
And these are called longevity genes and they give our body resilience and fight

149
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:42.380
aging and slow down what we can now measure the biological clock.

150
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:43.400
So I can take your blood.

151
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.220
Or actually now we've developed a very cheap test as a swab,

152
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.280
to be able to tell you very accurately how old you are,

153
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:51.920
not based on how many times the earth goes around the sun. That's ridiculous.

154
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.730
Age is just a number. You can actually take a swab. I can tell you how you are,

155
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.060
how old you are really, but then using real science,

156
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:00.590
tell you how to slow that down.

157
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.510
And this is really cool just in the last few years,

158
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:04.580
we figured out you can reverse human aging as well.
