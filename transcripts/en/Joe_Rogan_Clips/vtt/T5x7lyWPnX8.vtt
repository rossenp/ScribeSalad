00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.600
<v 3>It was insane and I couldn't believe it. And so I'm like, well,</v>

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.080
now I need to do a performance with that.

4
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.160
And now I'm gonna do a performance with, because the guy who, who did his name,

5
00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:17.200
young orbs, he was the guy showing his NFTs and the gallery he used to work.

6
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:19.000
Or he, I guess he still works for 3d left,

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.110
but he used to be behind high the scenes.

8
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.670
Now he's like made his own installation. He's in FTS, home blowing pulled.

9
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.660
<v 0>Pulled, please. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.710
Explain NFTs to people that don't know what you're talking about,

11
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:30.990
because I don't know what you're talking about. I do, but I don't.

12
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.270
I know it's a non fungible token. Yes. I'm not exactly sure what that.

13
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.070
<v 1>Means. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, it's just not very fungible. You know,</v>

14
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.030
tokens are super fungible. Got it.

15
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.820
<v 0>These aren't very fungible. I don't even know if, if I, if I was on jeopardy,</v>

16
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.780
what is fungible?

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.820
<v 1>Fungible? I'm not sure what fungible fungible. I don't. What does fungible.</v>

18
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.980
<v 0>Mean? Okay. Let's think Google it duplicatable.</v>

19
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.460
<v 1>Yeah. Like duplicatable, maybe something let's Google it. Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.580
<v 0>Go Google it. What is the, what is the ju go to duck dot go. So the.</v>

21
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.090
<v 1>Yeah, give you the truth. Uh, fungible. It.</v>

22
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.210
<v 0>Goes, let, it's like economic term. Oh, of goods connected for,</v>

23
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:10.930
without an individual specimen being specified,

24
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.490
able to replace or be replaced by another identical item.

25
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.090
Mutually interchangeable. It is by no means the world's only fungible commodity.

26
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.360
Okay. I know. Oh yeah. I understand it even less now. Yeah. I, I.

27
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.000
<v 1>Have heard fungible, like done used in economics, but yeah,</v>

28
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.680
but you can't replicate, so yeah. Non fungible. So basically it's like, I have,

29
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.160
I've made a little video of me or yeah. I've made a video of me,

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.040
a 32nd video of me, like running around, uh, you know,

31
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.920
a park or something like that. If I wanna make that non fungible, then I min it.

32
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.950
And by min um, you use a mentoring service like foundation or Zuora.

33
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:48.350
There's there's many others. And, um,

34
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.510
you get a crypto wallet &lt;laugh&gt; and uh, you get the crypto wallet set up,

35
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.910
you put money in it. It's converted into the crypto of your choice.

36
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.230
So let's say E which is very popular ether. What? Ethereum,

37
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.340
that's a very popular crypto. Do you know about that? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah.

38
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.413
E.

39
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.263
<v 0>Nerds. E.</v>

40
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.540
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; actually it's uh, but yeah, so,</v>

41
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.060
so these are some NFTs that we created. So, so see that one on the,

42
00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:15.340
the very top left. Yeah. That's that's um,

43
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.060
a ho that's the looking glass holographic display. Oh, wow. And, um,

44
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.210
and so that device, we made a, an NFT, me and my Panther, modern,

45
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.450
who his name is, Brady keen check out his music. It's disgusting. But, uh,

46
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.770
so he made the 3d GRA motion graphics and the TVs and designed all of that

47
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:37.250
stuff. With the wires, we shot a bunch of video of me doing the thing. He put,

48
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:41.530
inserted them on the TV screens. And then we, um, formatted it. It's on a loop,

49
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.280
it's got music with it. And, uh, that is then put into this device.

50
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.960
And so I'm trying to push this phrase called digital mean the

51
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.240
convergence of physical and digital media mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

52
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.520
So that's like a perfect representation because it's,

53
00:02:56.521 --> 00:03:00.440
the NFT is sold with the device. So when you bid on it and you know,

54
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.600
you win it or whatever that device is sent to you,

55
00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:06.320
there's laser etching on the back that says the name of the piece who made it

56
00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:06.841
and so forth.

57
00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:11.120
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but technically it's that unit with the hologram.

58
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.120
So it's the world's first holographic NFT, which was bought by, uh,

59
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.830
Lee. What's the name? Charlie Lee, Charlie Lee, who created light coin,

60
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.670
another cryptocurrency. He bought it for almost nothing. And, uh,

61
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.990
so he now has the physical unit that has the hologram in it.

62
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.590
And you could ostensibly just put it on a shelf and call it good.

63
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.710
Or you can use the display to upload more holographic stuff if you want to.

64
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.390
So that was the first holographic NFT.

65
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.900
Those other videos that you saw cycling were just standard.

66
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.820
Here's a video we've made it in NFT, but.

67
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.900
<v 0>Then someone can't replicate that video.</v>

68
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.540
<v 1>They hold the license to it.</v>

69
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.820
<v 0>Right. But if you just replicate it and have it on your laptop,</v>

70
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.220
how's someone gonna stop you.

71
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.700
<v 1>I mean, I guess if you're trying to make money from it, then you couldn't. Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.380
Or something like.

73
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.260
<v 0>That, you wouldn't be able to make money off of it. You wouldn't be.</v>

74
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.890
<v 1>Able to make money off of it. I mean, to technically you could screenshot it,</v>

75
00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:03.650
you could screen capture it. You know, if it's a video mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, um,

76
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.850
in this case it's a hologram.

77
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.570
So you would have to just you'd have to have a looking glass device and then

78
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.850
you'd have to get the file in order to see it, which it is available.

79
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.210
<v 0>But it's stunning when you hear guys like people like be sold and then Ft for</v>

80
00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:18.530
what? 59, 69, 60 $9 million. Yeah.

81
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.240
<v 2>He's got a little more with his pack. Could you get a hair sample? Oh yeah. You.</v>

82
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.160
<v 0>Get his own hair. Is that his pubes? It could.</v>

83
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.120
<v 2>Be. I hope so. I.</v>

84
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.520
<v 1>Don't know if he &lt;laugh&gt;, he's got very long luscious pubes. So.</v>

85
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.840
<v 2>Like he send a whole package when you get his NFT.</v>

86
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.400
<v 0>Okay. So you get an image.</v>

87
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.880
<v 2>This is, I think this is like an iPad with the image on it.</v>

88
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:39.360
The one that's sold for a bunch, I believe was all of them together. Yeah.

89
00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:40.440
All of them video sort of.

90
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.403
<v 1>So not just.</v>

91
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.910
<v 2>One for a year. It's 5,000 pieces. Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.310
<v 1>Yeah. I.</v>

93
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.990
<v 0>Mean, someone bought it for 69 million in what Bitcoin or what?</v>

94
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.470
<v 1>Mm. Yeah. I think E they have to,</v>

95
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.670
they have to buy the auction is an E so Christie's, you know,

96
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:58.270
it's like was auction by Christie's. It was like, E was, I think it was an E.

97
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.670
And.

98
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.820
<v 0>Then how would you go about being actually rich with this?</v>

99
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.260
How does people go from this to being a baller? Oh.

100
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.140
<v 1>Well, I mean, well, you know, they bid whoever bids it, you know,</v>

101
00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:10.020
just like a regular auction.

102
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.380
And then they bid using cryptos and the cryptos transferred before they trans

103
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.180
the file to.

104
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.620
<v 0>The, the, so the $69 million in E he could actually put into his account. Yes.</v>

105
00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:21.260
You can has 69 actual million dollars. Yeah.

106
00:05:21.261 --> 00:05:23.170
You just convert it and you can get a Ferrari.

107
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.410
<v 1>Yeah. You could, you could get one Ferrari for 69 million. The thing with.</v>

108
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.130
<v 2>ETHO with, with some of these contracts, like, I don't know specifically,</v>

109
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:33.570
which one is, I heard him mention this. He has a, uh,

110
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.970
it's built into the contract.

111
00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:38.010
So if the person who bought it for 69 million sells it for a hundred million,

112
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.640
10% of that goes back to his wallet. Yeah. Yeah. That's 10 million.

113
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.520
<v 1>From that. Yeah. You set the resale. So like on ours, we did 15%,</v>

114
00:05:46.521 --> 00:05:47.354
which is the average.
