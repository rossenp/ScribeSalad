1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And I ain't no fighter, man. I'm oh,</v>

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:05.490
one in one lifetime.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.410
<v 1>Oh one in one, one draw.</v>

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.000
<v 0>We have with the draw teacher showed up. I got in a fight.</v>

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.430
I got in a fight in the eighth grade at a stop. The violence rally. No.

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.380
Cause I figured that'd be the best place to talk.

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.620
Cause what's, what's a better spot.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.720
Talk your then at a stop,

9
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:35.400
the violence rally because presumably someone will come in and go, Hey man,

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.890
this dude, we brothers, Mario brown slept the out of me. Mario.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.240
<v 1>Brown. Where are you at? Mario?</v>

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.420
<v 0>Mario brown is, uh, air force retired.</v>

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.000
We still to this day now, but on that day he slept,

14
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.480
it dug out of me in the gym, in front of everybody.

15
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.180
That's the worst ill in front of everybody.

16
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.070
<v 1>That's a hard one. That's a hard.</v>

17
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.070
<v 0>Yeah. I thought I was going to get off on that one. Wrong. Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.250
<v 1>I didn't know how to fight at all until I learned how to fight.</v>

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.280
I was terrified of fights. I never, never,

20
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.160
never was never was the guy who like,

21
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:12.720
I was just trying to get away from everybody.

22
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.410
Cause I grew up in different places. We moved around a lot when I was a kid.

23
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.220
So I didn't grow up like with a bunch of friends where everybody knew everybody,

24
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.780
like I was always the new kid.

25
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.270
<v 0>So you always had to always.</v>

26
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.530
<v 1>Always. And so then when I was 14, I was like, all right, this.</v>

27
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.060
I moved to a new city, new town. And I was like, I gotta learn how to fight.

28
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.840
So I started taking martial arts. I just became obsessed with it.

29
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.210
Do you teach your kids? Yeah. Yeah. I teach them,

30
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:42.510
but they're not into it anymore. They, uh, they were into it for a little while,

31
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:46.140
but they, they liked doing other stuff, mostly gymnastics and. But.

32
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.740
<v 0>Are you teaching them, did you think to, cause I'm trying to silo my son.</v>

33
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.170
You know how to approach self-defense is three he's

34
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.790
three. I noticed early. Yeah.

35
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.690
<v 1>But it's not it's it's not a bad thing to get it to be a part of his body when</v>

36
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:02.640
he's really young. My daughter started when she was five.

37
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.350
<v 0>But the question becomes about teaching proper conflict resolution because I</v>

38
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:12.300
also I'm wired a little weird in the sense that I feel like because he's a black

39
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:16.290
kid, he's not going to get judged the same if he throws the first punch.

40
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.920
So I don't want him in a position where he might get expelled or some, you know?

41
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.120
Right. But if you got to get them up the off you going on,

42
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.470
bend that knee sideways.

43
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.970
<v 1>Well, that's the beautiful thing about kids learning jujitsu too,</v>

44
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.710
is that also the really used to conflict because you have conflict in the gym

45
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.710
all the time, not conflict in a negative way, but when you're sparring,

46
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.160
you know, you slap hands and you just do it and you go full blast.

47
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.080
You're trying to get each other as hard as you can.

48
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.270
And you can do that in jujitsu because you're not hitting each other.

49
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.100
You're just choking each other and getting an arm bars.

50
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.001
And then when someone gets you,

51
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.920
you just tap and then you move on to the next thing.

52
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.270
And the thing about doing that is then you're not worried about conflict.

53
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:56.850
It doesn't seem as scary to you.

54
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.970
Like for me until I started learning martial arts, I was terrified of everybody.

55
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.980
I thought everybody was going to kick my. Like.

56
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.540
I was like every I'd seen some dude that bullied me and my and I'd go around the

57
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.280
whole opposite way of school.

58
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:12.730
I w I walked the total way around the school to get to the bus

59
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.930
Was down 15, extra minutes. I didn't care.

60
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.930
<v 0>I have to walk 20 extra minutes home if I didn't want to cut through the south</v>

61
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.930
part projects because there was this dude, Spencer,

62
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.970
that was always every week for sure, going to give me the business.

63
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.340
<v 1>Those people go ruin your lives.</v>

64
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.821
<v 0>Every week.</v>

65
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:33.550
Like they would sit on the porch and watch me walk in the corner store.

66
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.780
And then bill come and take my now laters and laughing and mind you I've set

67
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:38.614
aside lunch.

68
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.030
I ate less at lunch so I could eat candy and chips on the way home.

69
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.680
And it was snatched that right out. My only thing that saved me growing up,

70
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.990
I had an ad, a good basketball goal.

71
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.450
So all the gang bangers in the neighborhood would come to our yard to shoot

72
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:58.090
ball. So I essentially learned every,

73
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:01.840
every terrible person in my neighborhood shot ball at my house.

74
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:04.030
So you can't with me because then you won't be able to shoot ball.

75
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.080
<v 1>Oh, that's.</v>

76
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.170
<v 0>Nice. So I don't know if my mom did that by design.</v>

77
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.080
I know she did it to keep me from going up to Powderly park,

78
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.410
to shoot ball where, you know, that's why the bull would go down.

79
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.830
But all the came to her house.

80
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.680
But out of respect to my mom and my dad, like they never started.

81
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.430
And I just walk around the neighborhood perfectly fine. Not at school.

82
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.110
I could still get with, but on the walk home, it was gravy. That's very nice.

83
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.520
Once she got the basketball guy, that was good.

84
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.370
<v 1>Very nice. Yeah. It's hard.</v>

85
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.840
A kid who's really mean who's like bullying you in high school and in junior

86
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:40.780
high school that could people's whole lives up.

87
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.650
Sometimes people never recover from that. You know,

88
00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:47.140
it's a natural inclination that people have to with someone who's scared and

89
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.500
weak too. Just you see it in animals, man. You see it in dogs.

90
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.680
<v 0>That's what we forget. We had like clothes and automobiles of civilizes. No,</v>

91
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:57.723
it's still,

92
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.170
I'm trying to take your woman and reproduce and I'm trying to spread my genes

93
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:03.250
and I'm going to take your food.

94
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.270
Like that's the basic of bullying is that yeah.

95
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.343
<v 1>It's nature.</v>

96
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.700
And it forces you to overcome because almost every fighter that I've ever met

97
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.000
professional fighter was with George St. Pierre.

98
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:20.050
Who's like one of the greatest of all time told the story on the podcast about

99
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.820
he was a drive in his range Rover when he was world champion through

100
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:25.654
Montreal.

101
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.770
And he saw this homeless guy and the homeless guy was his bully in high school.

102
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.270
And he realized, he was like, whoa. I was like, what's going on, man?

103
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:34.991
What are you doing?

104
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:38.200
And like talk to the guy and try to make amends with the guy and help him out a

105
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:41.710
little bit. But it's like, man, this is his bully in high school.

106
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:42.544
And he realized like,

107
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.120
most people that are causing pain and inflicting pain on people,

108
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:50.050
they're in pain, man. That's why they're doing it. You know, it's like victims,

109
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.440
you know, the victims of crimes,

110
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:56.610
oftentimes perpetrate those crimes on other people that,

111
00:05:56.611 --> 00:05:59.870
that happens with kids get abused at home. They get beaten at home.

112
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.140
They're the ones who want to beat and kids up at school. You know, they just,

113
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.050
they want to dish out that violence on someone smaller than them.

114
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.590
Cause they're getting a dished out on them by someone that large. Yeah, Matt,

115
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:13.790
I mean, th that's that's the constant victim narrative, but on the other hand,

116
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.990
families of people that grow up that are martial artists, like,

117
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.650
like all the kids know how to fight. They're the nicest, friendliest people.

118
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.220
They don't worry about it. It's not the thing that with their head. Like for me,

119
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.560
I knew, I didn't know how to fight. So it was scary.

120
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.160
So like every time someone would with me, I'd be like, oh, I gotta get away.

121
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:32.630
I can't fight. I don't know what I'm doing.

122
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.860
Some dude got me in a headlock and threw me down on the ground and was gonna

123
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:39.830
punch me in the face. I'll never forget this. Like I forget what was happening.

124
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:43.430
We were talking w like I said, something, he said something stupid to me.

125
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:44.840
I said something stupid back to him.

126
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.420
Then he just got me in a headlock and threw me on the ground.

127
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.270
And he held me like that he was going to punch it. I was like, Nan,

128
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:53.750
I ain't going to bother. I'm just sitting there going, God. And I'm helpless,

129
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.300
locked up in a headlock with this dude on top of me going.

130
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.950
And the only it's the only his mercy that he didn't punch my face in,

131
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.610
or he didn't want to get suspended or whatever. And I remember going, that's it.

132
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.800
I'm going to learn how to fight. This is ridiculous.

133
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:07.610
<v 0>Do you,</v>

134
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.810
do you ever run into the people from your past who have a revisionist history on

135
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.460
y'all's relationship and then.

136
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.240
<v 1>Not too much because the only people that I'm friends with from back then,</v>

137
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:18.620
I'm actually good friends with that.

138
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.260
I was friends with when I was growing up all your couple of buddies,

139
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.490
but most people that don't.

140
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.730
<v 0>Ever bought a ticket to your show and came up to them.</v>

141
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.180
<v 1>By the time, by the time I was in high school, that's,</v>

142
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.910
that's the only people that are still am in contact with anymore.

143
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.450
I had already gotten balls deep in martial arts,

144
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:38.420
like my first year of high school. So by like halfway into high school,

145
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:42.320
I was already crazy. I was already competing and traveling all over the place.

146
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:46.310
And so it was it. But I do run into people that fake stories.

147
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.500
I run into people that tell me things that have,

148
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.390
remember that time we were at a party. You kicked that dude in the hand.

149
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:54.860
I'm like, dude, I never kicked anybody. I never happened. A hundred percent.

150
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:57.230
Definitely never happened. I never went to a party and beat anybody's.

151
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.600
<v 0>Never happened with that memory of D correct him.</v>

152
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.090
<v 1>I T correct him. I'm like, I never fought anybody.</v>

153
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.710
Some dude was telling me some story about,

154
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.960
some guy told him that one time we were on the street and some guys across the

155
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:09.794
street were talking.

156
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.110
And I went across the street and kicked both of them in the head. And like,

157
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.490
that never happened. Never happened. I'm a guarantee you, it never happened.

158
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.000
Cause the last time I was in a street fight, I was like 15. I'm like,

159
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.650
this never happened. This is not a true.

160
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.250
<v 0>Yeah, I'm the opposite man.</v>

161
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.420
And when people come to me with that I don't remember, I just let them have it.

162
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.660
If that's your memory of us in college. Fine. Whatever weird though.

163
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:33.494
Right?

164
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.480
<v 1>No, it didn't happen when you definitely know.</v>

165
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:39.890
Like I know for a fact I was never in any street fights outside of high school.

166
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.920
<v 0>At a professor from college, accused me in a fate. This is an,</v>

167
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:44.330
a Facebook thread of something.

168
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.620
There's some article about me and like all the other alumni commenting on it.

169
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.270
And one of the professors I remember in 1994,

170
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:56.460
when you said this thing to me in and stormed out of class, I'm like,

171
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.840
I didn't enroll until 96, but I didn't say that. I just,

172
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.000
I literally just apologize. Like,

173
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.380
because she's clearly been mad at me all of this time about something that I

174
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:10.810
didn't even do. And I'm just like, there's nothing, I can say this,

175
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.900
if that's your narrative fine, you know what,

176
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.730
I'm sorry for the that I didn't do whatever. But,

177
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.220
but then she replies on her that, well, thank you. It means a lot.

178
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.540
And then whatever. So in my weird arrogant brain,

179
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.530
I've freed her

180
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.230
of her anger or whatever the it is. She thought I did,

181
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:35.190
but that's a great approach. I just don't feel like going back and forth.

182
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.540
That's a great approach. It's, it's so much easier to evade.

183
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.480
I'm more of an innovator and a schemer than a fighter.

184
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.510
Like I'm not gonna argue with you and go back and forth.

185
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:48.150
But what I will try and figure out a way to do is over the next two years,

186
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.640
diabolically dismantle anything you stand for and believe in like, that's,

187
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.500
that's my approach to things like there's a comedy club owner. It,

188
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:02.010
God is my witness. Before I die. I'm opening a comedy club across the street.

189
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.620
This is a mega, no,

190
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.350
I've heard the stories. Where's this one, uh,

191
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.940
can not tell it's one of the Carolinas.
