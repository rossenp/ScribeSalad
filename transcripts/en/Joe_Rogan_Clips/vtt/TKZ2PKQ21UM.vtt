170
00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:43.950
I remember being in a coffee shop,

171
00:07:43.951 --> 00:07:46.550
trying to read a magazine mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I, I couldn't read,

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.773
like I couldn't,

173
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.150
I couldn't take in a paragraph &lt;laugh&gt; I would try to read a paragraph and then

174
00:07:51.151 --> 00:07:52.870
it would start over again and I would try to read it again.

175
00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:55.190
You're outta your mind. What do you mean? Start over again. And then I,

176
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.630
and I bombed that night. I went on stage that night. You gotta.

177
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.820

251
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:21.330
Cause I don't want kids hearing in this going, oh,

252
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.850
Ari did it Savage Ari Shafi no, no.

253
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.370
Do I gotta spike my friend's drunk please. Don't do it. Good point.

254
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.250
I can't co-sign it. I can't even release the podcast because I don't want,

255
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.730
I don't want anyone going like, cause I am in a good mood. I want Molly. Yeah.

256
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.050
I'm high as. You.

257
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.840
<v 2>Don't want anyone getting an act? The represeation of what Molly does to.</v>

258
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.520
<v 1>You. I don't want kids. It's different. If I take you don't myself,</v>

259
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:46.280
taking over a train either. The whole podcast is about you drugging me.

260
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.800
It's not about me taking Molly. I think you've expressed.

261
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.080
<v 2>That you were against it on the podcast.</v>

262
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.680
The views of this podcaster do not represent &lt;laugh&gt;.

263
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.520
<v 1>Do you know how hard it is to be your friend? &lt;laugh&gt; you such a.</v>

264
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.080
<v 2>Good time idea. It was so great to see you all smiles.</v>

265
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.480
<v 0>You were such a good mood, but you never, you never doed anybody before,</v>

266
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:07.160
but you chose to anybody that one moment to dose burrt yeah.

267
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.040
<v 2>I realized how great it would be. I had to take would you.</v>

268
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:09.641
<v 0>For the same day,</v>

269
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:12.910
if you went to Tom's house steel podcast and you had the Molly on you would've

270
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:14.070
dosed him. Okay. He wife'.

271
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.350
<v 2>D says he, his wife's different Tom alone. Hasn't really,</v>

272
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.190
I feel like he's not the reason I have to do this month of sobriety where I do

273
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:22.030
blame you a lot more.

274
00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.590

Like a little kid machine, little kid'snotebook.

294
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.320
<v 1>He was touching my drink. Turn, turn.</v>

295
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.400
<v 0>It to let me see. So we, you see, so like,</v>

296
00:13:16.401 --> 00:13:20.640
like a little kid with a notebook says birth CRO seventh grade. Yeah.

297
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.520
<v 1>Croer yeah. He said he, we, we went, I went to the, I couldn't,</v>

298
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.120
I couldn't be around my kids. I had to take a goodbye to my kids that night.

299
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.440
Hi as I go to my daughter's room and she's got these lasers that make stars on

300
00:13:31.441 --> 00:13:35.470
her ceiling and you dancing, I'm blowing up. I'm just like, okay. &lt;laugh&gt;.

301
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.430
<v 2>It's like, I'll turn it up. I go turn.</v>

302
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:41.550
<v 1>This up daughter. She gave me a hug and I was like, beaming. I was like,</v>

303
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.830
I smelled her hair and I was like, God, I love you. That sounds awesome.

304
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.270
And I'm like, and in my head I'm like, I,

305
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.470
Joey said something to me that he goes, you would've already had your stroke.

306
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.790
Would've already happened.

307
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.630
<v 0>Like Joey's a doctor. No, but.</v>

308
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.020
<v 1>But in those moments, in those moments, it out helps. It helps.</v>

309
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.860
It's just panic attacks no matter. Right, right, right. Right. So give island,

310
00:14:00.861 --> 00:14:05.460
Georgia hugs and kiss a goodbye. Give Leanne the longest kiss goodbye. And it's,

311
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.060
by the way, my flights don't me until midnight. And it's like seven o'clock.

312
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.260
I can't be in there. I can't be around them. Cause my I'm like talking quick.

313
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.770
I have big ideas. And so then I go to the store, wait, good.

314
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:16.763
<v 2>Was a shower.</v>

315
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.410
<v 1>Shower was pretty amazing. Yeah. Right. &lt;laugh&gt; shower was pretty. I can't deny.</v>

316
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:24.410
Molly's not amazing. It's just it's surprise the element. It's the surprise.

317
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.370
<v 0>The, the come Down's not worth it. In my opinion.</v>

318
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.250
<v 1>Comedale's not worth it at all. And but then we went to the store.</v>

319
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.490
What you do and just hung out. I just had to,

320
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.450
I needed to be somewhere and I couldn't just wait, wait at the airport. Yeah.

321
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.960
So the only place safe, like there. Yeah. The store.

322
00:14:36.961 --> 00:14:40.960
So I sat at the store for like an hour drinking comedy store.

<v 2>From anyone. It's a one time only thing.</v>

351
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.250
<v 1>No, not with our head fans. It.</v>

356
00:16:02.611 --> 00:16:03.690
doing it behind your back.

357
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.770
<v 0>Cut that thing off your wrist. But.</v>

358
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.450
<v 2>But, um, I'm glad we did it. It was so much fun. At some point he just goes,</v>

<v 0>The world be a better place if everybody was on just a smidge. Yeah,</v>

363
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.880

364
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.160
<v 2>World. I didn't even give him a full dose.</v>

365
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.800

366
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.800

367
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.480
<v 1>Best two thirds. The best is he goes, I, we were in the,</v>

368
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.630
a store and I'm talking to Tony hinchiff and I go,

369
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.430
he would've never have done it to anyone else. He only would've done it to me.

370
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.910
And he goes, that's not true. That's not true. I said,

371
00:16:40.911 --> 00:16:43.350
would you do this to Rogan? He goes a hundred percent. If it was like,

372
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.430
he was together. It was all of us together. Yes, no, no.

373
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:49.790
You and Joe at his house, you wouldn't spike his drink and then go, Hey man,

374
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:50.790
if he forced me.

375
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.460
<v 2>Into a thing where I had to give up things I love for a month &lt;affirmative&gt; then</v>

376
00:16:54.461 --> 00:16:55.660
yeah, he would've got it. Mm-hmm.

377
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.180
<v 0>So a is, has been mad at you and I, I listen.</v>

378
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.540
I'm probably the only one here besides him that listens to his podcast.

379
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.100
&lt;laugh&gt; you don't listen to his podcast. I do.

380
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.660
Ari gets furious at you bet for this.

381
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.860
<v 1>Oh then let's stop. I'm you got me. You got.</v>

382
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.690
<v 2>Me bro. October. What doing with our lives. You get.</v>

383
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.130
<v 0>You really get mad at him for that. So mad. So mad. He got so mad was crazy.</v>

384
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:18.610
It didn't even.

385
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:19.011
<v 2>Do anything.</v>

386
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:22.450
He drank just as much after October as before it never curved anything.

387
00:17:22.451 --> 00:17:24.570
What are we still doing this for? He's.

388
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:28.330
<v 0>He's got a point that the whole reason why we did it in the first place was to</v>

389
00:17:28.331 --> 00:17:30.170
try to sober you up. We didn't, we didn't.

390
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.170
<v 2>Think be able to do it. He had no problem at all. Oh. So.</v>

391
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.640
<v 0>Are we announcing that on the 1st of October we're done with this?</v>

392
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.840
&lt;laugh&gt; well, listen, no one has a problem here, except bet. I,

393
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.160
I like of all a glass of wine with, with dinner maybe too. Isn't it?

394
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.400
I like a shot. I like a shot of whiskey before I go on stage. That's nice to me.

395
00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:49.601
I mean,

396
00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:52.600
we occasionally have like a beer while I'm on stage watching the Yankees,

397
00:17:52.601 --> 00:17:56.720
but I'm not a drinker in the sense of, I don't get drunk a lot. Yeah. I,

398
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.840
if I get drunk once a month, it's a crazy month,

399
00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.840
like drunk and it's usually somewhere,

400
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.640
whether I'm like with you guys or something and we're just maybe a podcast.

401
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.000
We're just, we just start doing drinks. Yeah. Hang on. Do you just get like.

402
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.830
<v 1>A little, I've always wondered that. Do you just get like a buzz? Like a little.</v>

403
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.830
<v 0>Buzz? Yeah. And then you're fine. Then I stop. Yeah, dude. I,</v>

404
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.350
I work out too much. I'm too healthy. I'm I'm I, you know,

405
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:17.990
I'm getting up in the morning. Most mornings.

406
00:18:17.991 --> 00:18:21.670
I'm either doing yoga or I'm running or I'm lifting weights and doing cardio.

407
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.510
I just, I, I can't take the beating the beating and, and at 52, it's not fun.

408
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:36.460
<v 4>I.</v>
