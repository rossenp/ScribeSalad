00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.650
<v 2>Um, another thing I heard,</v>

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.640
this is really crazy that Trump is going to start a third party that he's been

4
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.760
talking about. Start starting out party called the Patriot party, which is like,

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.623
holy.

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.880
<v 0>I don't know anything about that. Again, rear view, mirror,</v>

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.763
rear view mirror.

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.620
<v 1>I believe he's going to be in the rear view mirror. I just don't.</v>

9
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.790
I think people are going to get bored.

10
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.340
I think it's going to a few months ago by,

11
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.790
or whatever it is until he's in the news again. And then, uh,

12
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.590
it just won't be exciting without him. And then I think we need a foil.

13
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.420
We need someone like the 20, 21 season.

14
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.410
It's going to be pretty boring if Trump's not involved at all. Like, if,

15
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:47.730
if this was a long running show, like Ozark or something like that. Right.

16
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.893
And we get it,

17
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.030
I get to the new season when he steps down like this can't be it. Oh,

18
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.751
I see what they're gonna do.

19
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:57.000
They're gonna pretend that everything's gonna be fine. We've got Biden.

20
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.060
We've got Harris. We got a lot of, uh,

21
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.960
really diverse people in the cabinet. This is going to be wonderful.

22
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.780
We got it. We nailed it. Everything's great.

23
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.800
And then something that's what the worry is.

24
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.570
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I mean, look, there,</v>

25
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.010
there are sadly a lot of really

26
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.230
important and serious things that we could and should be talking about that

27
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.730
should capture our attention and be able

28
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:27.331
to,

29
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:31.890
as the people provide that pressure to our leadership and hold them accountable

30
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.880
for whether or not they're doing their job in actually working for the people,

31
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.400
uh, or, or not.

32
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.540
<v 1>You're talking about like a reasonable, you're talking like a reasonable,</v>

33
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:45.090
responsible person. That's not human,

34
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:47.400
but there's not that many of you out there. I think.

35
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.160
<v 0>There are Joe. I think there are, I think.</v>

36
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.210
<v 1>We're a bunch of grown-up babies with phones and they just were just tweeting up</v>

37
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:56.580
a storm and watching YouTube videos. That's what I think.

38
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.920
I think people are so addicted to this drama. I mean, my God,

39
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.330
th th they're watching Twitter over the last few days is been like watching

40
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:09.020
people can complete an ultra marathon. Like they're,

41
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:13.740
they're get to the finish line. We're there where the cross, the line and yeah,

42
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.370
we made it, we did it. We did it. It's over. you. Like,

43
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:21.330
there's so many people like playing, you know, having memes and this, and,

44
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.110
and these like self-aggrandizing posts about like,

45
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.920
to directly to Trump, dear Mr. President, you.

46
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:31.380
And this and that and celebrities are doing,

47
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:32.920
and all these people are getting in on.

48
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.050
And it is a fascinating thing to watch because I'm like, okay,

49
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.650
you made it across the line. Now, what, what happens next?

50
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:43.020
We're going to do with all this. You gotta, you, you like the fight.

51
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.110
You're like, you like the conflict. What are you gonna do with all this energy?

52
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.273
You got.

53
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.960
<v 0>Rechannel that let's reach handle that actually fight for the people</v>

54
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.130
against those who wield. Uh, the.

55
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.770
<v 1>Yeah, but that's not fun. What's fun is a bad guy. A guys are fun.</v>

56
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.600
We need another bad guy. I mean, we got plenty.

57
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.480
<v 0>Of those. Trust me, we got plenty of bad guys, but we don't have.</v>

58
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.313
<v 1>A bad guy. Like.</v>

59
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.060
<v 0>But here's, here's the thing is,</v>

60
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:11.650
and I agreed like people who have been looking

61
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:16.450
forward to January 20th as though

62
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.610
this is going to solve all of the,

63
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.510
all of the problems that our country has faced, uh,

64
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.370
are missing the reality that the

65
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:30.100
way we got here are because of some,

66
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:35.080
some deeply seated problems that, that have pre-existed, uh,

67
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.610
the previous administration and that still exist in our country today,

68
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:44.350
which is why I think it's so dangerous for some, uh, leaders,

69
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:47.920
especially in the democratic party and in the media over the last few days who

70
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:52.540
are so easily dismissing the 70 plus million

71
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:57.380
people who voted for Trump as though they are all the KKK or they are

72
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.950
all this or that, throwing them into that bin,

73
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:04.240
that Hillary Clinton called the deplorables. Yeah. And this is, um,

74
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.510
the reality of, of how dangerous that train of thought I think is,

75
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:13.750
is going to continue to, um,

76
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.790
reveal itself, unless look, you know, uh,

77
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.130
Joe Biden gave,

78
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.310
gave a very unifying speech for his inauguration.

79
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.530
It is that the pressure is on him to, to deliver for the country's sake.

80
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:34.090
I wish him well in working towards that. Uh,

81
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.350
but it's not going to be an easy task. And, um,

82
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.390
ultimately he will be held accountable for,

83
00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:46.060
for his own actions in whether he is able to be that

84
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:49.660
unifying force, or if we end up seeing, uh,

85
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.000
and address some of these deeper seated problems, you know,

86
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.150
he said in his speech that whether you voted for him or not,

87
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:59.980
that his goal is to serve you, the American people. Um,

88
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.890
you know, again, that the pressure will be now on,

89
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:06.880
on him to actually show that is true through his actions and,

90
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:11.140
and actually actively reaching out to those 70 plus million people who didn't

91
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:11.974
vote for him.

92
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.470
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

93
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.030
it would be wonderful if we all got together United and said,

94
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.570
let's wish him well, and let's,

95
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.500
let's cheer him on and hope he does a fantastic job.

96
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.610
And all of you Trump's supporters who thought that he was a puppet of the

97
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:33.900
institution, ha wish him well, like for our country, be happy,

98
00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:36.510
be happy if he's, if he's right and you were wrong,
