00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.120
<v 2>One thing I will say about Spotify layout though, like as a fan, you know,</v>

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.560
I want to tune into the pod. Sometimes I find it hard to, to watch on my TV.

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.160
Yeah. So that sucks. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.440
<v 1>You're, you're working on that. Yeah. They're, they're gonna,</v>

6
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.160
it's eventually gonna be on all platforms in terms of like television based

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.430
forms. Well, right now it's on, uh,

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.750
Chromecast and it's gonna be on it's on Google play

9
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.510
and they're working on Roku and apple TV.

10
00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:34.590
They're working on a bunch of different platforms. That'll eventually be,

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.190
but it's not as smooth as it probably should have been when it first,

12
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.380
when we first transferred over and just December,

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.860
but they just weren't ready for the volume. They had never had a show.

14
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.260
First of all, they,

15
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.860
they created video because of the conversation we had about this podcast. Yeah.

16
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:56.180
They wanted the podcast to be audio only. And, uh, my manager was like,

17
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.420
think about the Elon Musk moment when Elon Musk smoking weed. Oh, that's huge.

18
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.170
That is a viral moment. That only happens with video where Elon's like,

19
00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:07.330
it's legal. Right? I'm like, yeah, it's totally legal. That's huge.

20
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.490
I saw the painting. Yeah. And then it's, I remember I was at the airport and uh,

21
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.410
I had, uh, sunglasses and a hat and I'm on my way to Vegas.

22
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.090
And I'm like looking at this, uh, CNN monitor.

23
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.200
It shows Elon smoking weed on my podcast. And I'm like, oh no, &lt;laugh&gt;.

24
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.440
<v 0>What.</v>

25
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.240
<v 1>A trip. I was like, what have I done? But the, those moments,</v>

26
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.720
those crazy viral moments, um, they don't exist without video.

27
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.440
And my manager said that to Spotify and Spotify's like, you're right.

28
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.120
And then they started working on the video platform and then

29
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.510
know there's been a lot of weird, like, um, a lot of, uh, you know,

30
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:46.830
we were talking about like how people

31
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.590
get a sense of who a person is without actually communicating with them without

32
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.390
actually being there with them. And you could define someone or, you know,

33
00:01:57.391 --> 00:01:58.590
have this like, um,

34
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.300
distorted perception of who a person is without actually communicating with

35
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:04.000
them.

36
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.660
That's one of the things that happened with Spotify with like some of their

37
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:09.620
staff where they thought I was transphobic or thought I was like, mm-hmm,

38
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.740
&lt;affirmative&gt; a bad per I,

39
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.660
I saw one of their staff say that I was a shock Jack shock,

40
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.620
jock like that. I'm not even remotely.

41
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.380
<v 0>You's a dude. The mic. Yeah. I always tell people cuz sometimes</v>

42
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.930
I know he's a cop and stuff. So I see you more as a comic than anything. And

43
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.970
you didn't intend on this becoming as big as it's become.

44
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.330
It's just organically grown and people tune in cuz they want to tune in.

45
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:39.530
You're not, you're not being forced fed down people's throat.

46
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:40.970
They're like choosing to listen to you.

47
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.890
<v 1>Yeah. But when I've actually on purpose,</v>

48
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.200
never advertised for this show,

49
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.120
I've never asked people to watch it.

50
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.720
I've never gone on television shows and promoted it.

51
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.280
I've never taken out any billboards or ads.

52
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.640
Spotify did some of that stuff when I switched over to them,

53
00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.680
but I never did any.

54
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 0>Of it.</v>

55
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.960
So I always think it's so odd when people hold you to the same standards as like

56
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.440
CNBC or these entities where you're just like a guy with a mic,

57
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.320
you.

58
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.590
<v 1>Know what I mean?</v>

59
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.440
They Don don't like it because it gets much more of an audience than them.

60
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.680
That's what freaks 'em out.

61
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.360
When you have these huge multinational corporations that have

62
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.390
thousands of employees and they can't even touch the amount of reach that a guy

63
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.590
with a podcast has. Yeah. That's madness for them.

64
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.750
<v 0>I've seen clips of your like first episode or whatever or pictures.</v>

65
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:33.150
It's like absurd. It's absurd, you know? Yeah.

66
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.030
And it's been an organic thing. Yeah. You can.

67
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.950
<v 1>See, you can see how it grows,</v>

68
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.020
but it also a lesson to all these other comics too. Like what's the difference?

69
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:45.140
Well, the difference I grind, I just keep going. Yeah.

70
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.220
It's the same thing with that. Got you. Good at comedy.

71
00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:48.740
What got you good at comedy stage time.

72
00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:51.540
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what gets you good at podcast podcast time? You don't.

73
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.140
<v 0>Have to notice doing it. Even just doing my podcast.</v>

74
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.540
Cause especially during the pandemic, what's called dance time,

75
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.530
Forman or dance hour dance Hourman or dance just uh, when the pandemic hit,

76
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.090
you lean into what is available to you. So standup wasn't really there.

77
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.770
So I doubled down on the podcast.

78
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.170
I got like a nicer space to film it in like a nice studio and,

79
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.250
and I've been doing it for two years now and obviously I'm better at it now than

80
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.890
I was first three months or whatever.

81
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.160
It's a skill it's skill and time is time. And any,

82
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.960
anything that you do and I've just found,

83
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.280
it's helped with my standup even, uh,

84
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.240
cuz talking is talking and even though this is conversational,

85
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.920
it just wires your brain and you have certain pathways where you are

86
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:38.390
comfortable,

87
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.950
formulating thought it's conducive to podcasting and then also

88
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.993
stand up.

89
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.030
<v 1>Yeah. Well the best example that is bill Burr.</v>

90
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.550
<v 0>Yes. With his Monday morning podcast. Cause he's.</v>

91
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.230
<v 1>Ranting, just him and a microphone and,</v>

92
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.150
and he's so prolific with the standup because he's developed that muscle of

93
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.223
creation.

94
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.470
<v 0>And also I'm kind of an introvert.</v>

95
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:02.540
Like I don't really talk a lot just like if I'm at a party or something,

96
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.620
I'm not like life of the party or anything, it's kind of laying the cut.

97
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.060
So having a weekly podcast where I have to expunge at length for an hour or

98
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.820
two hours, whatever it may be. It forces you, you have no guests. Uh,

99
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:19.140
sometimes I do, like I had Joe list on, um, I love Joe list.

100
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.730
I love Joe list too. Yeah. Yeah. It's hilarious. So I I'm gonna,

101
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.570
I'm gonna use my network. I've been doing stand for.

102
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.370
So I wanna like get Bobby on eventually and just whoever wants to do it to like

103
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.663
get some guests,

104
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.450
but I also like not having it be so guest dependent where the people just like

105
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.930
me and my co-host. Yeah. And yeah. Yeah.

106
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.400
So just like I've just found that podcasting has lent itself, uh,

107
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.960
uh, elevating my standup, even.

108
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.120
<v 1>For sure. It, it not just elevated my standup,</v>

109
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.720
but it elevated who I like the way I think about things.

110
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.400
It elevated my ability to communicate with people.

111
00:05:55.401 --> 00:05:58.320
Like I'm way better at talking to people now. Um,

112
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.200
I'm critical about my ability to talk to people. Like if I, um,

113
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.280
have a conversation that's clunky and this is so weird,

114
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.360
like just a dinner conversation. I say something clunky or it bothers me.

115
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.680
Like I wake up in the middle of the night, take a leak and it bothers me. I'm,

116
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.510
I'm like if people think I'm like cocky,

117
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.070
I'm the most hypercritical person that I know. I hate everything I do. Yeah.

118
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.670
I have to accept that. Everything I like when, when I release a special,

119
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.870
I don't ever watch them, I edit them and then I never watch 'em again.

120
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.110
I just release it. I don't wanna watch myself. I hate myself.

121
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.830
<v 0>I'm the same way dude, in that way. Yeah.</v>

122
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.950
Like sometimes trolls will like write some or whatever.

123
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.980
I think what troll Don understand is I don't love everything I do. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah,

124
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.020
of course. You're.

125
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.660
<v 1>Probably right. Yeah. For sure. There's no other way to get good. Yeah.</v>

126
00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:46.660
You have to be hyper critical.

127
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.180
<v 0>Yeah. And put the thing about being an artist or whatever is,</v>

128
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.540
is you have to put yourself out there good or bad.

129
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.220
You have to put yourself out there. Yeah. And if you get that, you get that.

130
00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.210
Some people like it, some people don't, but I took the swing and there it is.

131
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.970
And, but that's, I don't love everything that I've done. The thing is.

132
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.330
<v 1>They didn't take the swing, the trolls didn't take the swing.</v>

133
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:08.050
And one of the things that they have the ability to do is they have the ability

134
00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:11.650
to criticize you and criticize everyone without looking at themselves.

135
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.370
And that's why they focus so much time on criticizing other people.

136
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.200
<v 0>Yeah. I've almost found though that I don't get mad at that.</v>

137
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.560
I understand it for what it is, but also I think that troll forum or whatever,

138
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.400
like that's their comedy store. That's that's their outlet. Yeah, for sure.

139
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.900
Yeah.

140
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.880
<v 1>And I, I get it. Well, that's why I think, uh, comments are important.</v>

141
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.000
I used to think that comments are like,

142
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.600
like I had a friend reach out when I said that, um, I wanna figure out a way to,

143
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:42.550
for Spotify to put comments on the episodes. And they were like, don't do that.

144
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:44.390
This friend reached out. And he was like,

145
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:46.710
that is the worst part of YouTube is the comments I'm like,

146
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.270
I don't know if that's right.

147
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.390
I mean it sometimes the worst part of the comments,

148
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.390
but also sometimes it gives people the abil and I, I can't read them.

149
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.220
And one of the reasons why I can't read them is I don't, I don't have the time.

150
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.140
I don't have the time to engage with all these different ideas and opinions.

151
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.300
And I think that if, as long look,

152
00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:10.060
if I was being disingenuous with my criticism on myself,

153
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.740
I probably could use comments to keep me in line. But I'm ruthless with myself.

154
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.980
Like I'm good. And I don't wanna hurt my feelings.

155
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.380
<v 0>I'm the same way. Uh,</v>

156
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.530
I kind of CRA I put it out there and I don't need to go it.

157
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.890
I always like in going into the, the comment section,

158
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.930
it's like Lord of the rings,

159
00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:30.010
you put a BA battle helmet on &lt;laugh&gt; fight the Yorks. Yeah. You,

160
00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:33.450
you fight Bork. Yeah. It's just not emotional as an artist. You,

161
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.690
you there's no good. There's no good. And going into the comment, it's not,

162
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.930
not healthy. So.

163
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.560
<v 1>It's not healthy to hear the good stuff either. Yeah.</v>

164
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.560
<v 0>Praising you like,</v>

165
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.680
but I understand the value and that it's community based and yeah,

166
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.280
that's great that they have a forum to do that. There's a value in that.

167
00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:50.320
There's a value in that. That's where YouTube shines.

168
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.000
I don't have to be privy to that. I can just create,

169
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.360
blast it out and just worry about me.

170
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.761
<v 1>That's where she,</v>

171
00:08:56.761 --> 00:09:01.080
YouTube shines over all other forums is that they have that comment section.

172
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.480
I think that Spotify needs to recognize that.

173
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.160
And I've tried to talk to them about that.

174
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.760
And there's been some discussion about putting,

175
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.920
but one of the things they said was like, if we put comments on your podcast,

176
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.950
we have to put comments on everybody's podcast. Yeah. So, um, but I go, why?

177
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.470
Why just put 'em on mine. I don't give a. Just put 'em on mine.

178
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.310
I it's like these people that are commenting. Even if they have criticism,

179
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.390
they're listening, man. Yeah.

180
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.070
Like sometimes they hate me and sometimes they love me, but that's,

181
00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:29.990
they're entitled to it, but that's just like me.

182
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.230
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't like me all the time either. Yeah.

183
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.580
<v 0>They, I, I have this thought. I go sometimes like when somebody write something,</v>

184
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.060
I want to be like, you think you can top what's in my brain. Yeah.

185
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:41.460
It's impossible. You think you're a better troll in my brain.

186
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.660
<v 1>You're not there. When I wake up at five in the morning, angry at myself.</v>

187
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.460
When I go to the gym, you have no.

188
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.460
<v 0>Idea. Yeah. The biggest trolls in my head. Good luck. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

189
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.300
<v 1>Good luck. Good luck. Yeah. Is monsters in my head. Good luck.</v>
