00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, but it's like times have changed.</v>

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.900
You can put your mad.

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.150
<v 1>At you for something you did when you were little, which is funny.</v>

4
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.780
That's one of the things that's going on now is people are retroactively getting

5
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:12.950
canceled for things.

6
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.090
<v 2>Yeah. Like they did when they were kids. It's ridiculous. I mean, it's like,</v>

7
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.330
everything's a permanent stain on, on you. There's no growth.

8
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.010
You can't become a better person.

9
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.751
<v 1>Like what's,</v>

10
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:28.490
what's what is the desire that people have to do that? Like,

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.150
where's that coming.

12
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.030
<v 2>From? Well, you know, there's, there's two ways we could talk about it.</v>

13
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.740
We could talk about the psychological side of it,

14
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.530
which is like a moral purity thing that's going bonkers.

15
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:39.830
Or we could talk about it in terms of the, the ideas,

16
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:43.910
the theory that's fueling this. And that's all about, um,

17
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.900
that has this idea, that, that comes from French philosophy, that,

18
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.590
that words and ideas and thoughts and patterns have traces that don't ever

19
00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:54.680
really go away. And so if something, you know,

20
00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:57.710
used to be associated with something bad and we still use the word,

21
00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:01.550
or even if you pretend that it was the case, uh, and you still use the word,

22
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:02.990
then it carries this negative trace.

23
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:07.010
So the moral panic and the psychology side of it's fueled by this kind of like

24
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.821
stupid idea,

25
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:10.430
that words always have to mean kind of what they meant in the first.

26
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.770
<v 1>Place. Well aware of that though, is it, I mean,</v>

27
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:16.810
is this just conveniently connected to it or conveniently similar? I mean,

28
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.010
you think that people are actually aware of this concept?

29
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.620
<v 2>I don't think they, I don't think most people do. Like,</v>

30
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:24.500
there's just so you know, we're, we're generally talking about this,

31
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.570
whatever woke thing that's happening. Right.

32
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:30.050
And so you gotta think of woke kind of like, kind of like a church, right?

33
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:31.940
Like you got, like, I grew up Catholic, so it's like,

34
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.320
you got cultural Catholics.

35
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.040
Like they kind of go to church and maybe they go to confession sometimes and

36
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.310
they don't really do, they do it, but they don't really do it.

37
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.900
And then you have like, the hardcore is like,

38
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:45.590
I had a friend in high school that like took notes at church. Oh, right.

39
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:46.490
I'm like serial.

40
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.460
<v 3>Killer. Yeah. It's like, you do what you, you take notes.</v>

41
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.121
<v 2>And then, you know,</v>

42
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:52.970
you've got the pastor and he obviously studies it or the priest in a Catholic

43
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:56.210
context and they study it and then you've got the theologians that really study

44
00:01:56.211 --> 00:02:00.260
it. And so the stuff I'm talking about is like theology level.

45
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:03.470
Like that's like the scholars and then your average person just wants to feel

46
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:04.304
like a good person.

47
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.110
<v 1>So you've got like the woke academics, like the seriously,</v>

48
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.620
the woke people that are teaching it to kids. Yeah.

49
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.300
That really teach it as like critical theory, like critical race theory.

50
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.130
That's right. Yeah. So those,

51
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.100
those are the ones that are probably aware of all the nonsense.

52
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.590
<v 2>Th they're they're making the nonsense. Actually.</v>

53
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.260
I think they pick some of it up from culture, you know,

54
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:28.610
from activist groups or whatever,

55
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:30.930
but then they refine it and turn it into something. And it, you know,

56
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:32.270
it has this really weird feeling to it.

57
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:35.960
Like you get the impression that it's like the wrestling with their inner demons

58
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.550
and then they're like writing it down.

59
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.020
Like it like th this book now white fragility, right. Robin D'Angelo's book,

60
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:42.854
white fragility.

61
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.900
<v 1>The MADtv destroyed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. God for MADtv Sanka,</v>

62
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:48.850
baby Jesus. And.

63
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.820
<v 2>That's right. It's so good though. Um, because he's right.</v>

64
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.910
He's actually right about it. So if you read the book,

65
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.260
there's all these weird vignettes that she tells these stories she's oh,

66
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:03.250
I went to this potluck for work and, um, I'm walking around,

67
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:05.950
I walk up and then I see there's two parties and we're at the park and there's

68
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.890
two groups of people. One of them is all black and one of them's not.

69
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.150
And I had this moment of panic that I might have to be in the all-black group.

70
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.900
And it's like, lady, what's going on. You know? And then it's like,

71
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.140
all white people are racist is like our conclusion from this. And it's like,

72
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.370
maybe it's you.

73
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.620
<v 1>She,</v>

74
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.670
so she had this panic that she was going to have to party at the park with black

75
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:30.360
people. And she was worried that she was racist because of that.

76
00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:32.100
And therefore all white people are raised.

77
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.860
<v 2>See, that's what I'm thinking is going on. Right. So I'm thinking,</v>

78
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.430
I've thought this role a number of years is that a lot of this stuff where you

79
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:40.560
get these like woke activists, doing their blogs,

80
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.980
are these scholars writing this stuff down is that they're looking at their own

81
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:47.190
lives. So you have these people that are like, they're walking down the street,

82
00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:49.080
you know, maybe whatever they walk into the hotel,

83
00:03:49.081 --> 00:03:51.420
they walked into the restaurant and they're like, I saw a black guy.

84
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.120
And then it's like, I'm not supposed to notice that.

85
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.520
And then he started having like this thing in their head,

86
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.790
and then they go write an angry blog about terrible racism is because they're

87
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:02.820
wrestling with it themselves. It's like Sigmund Freud. Right.

88
00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:07.560
He had that whole idea, um, that everybody wants to have sex with their mothers.

89
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:11.040
And like, your psychology is all how you resolve that problem. And it's like,

90
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:14.640
maybe you just wanted to have sex with your mother Sigmund Freud, you know?

91
00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:16.790
And then now it's, everybody's a racist is,

92
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.320
is kind of the vibe of the new thing.

93
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.370
And there's like this weird religious kind of thing happening around it.

94
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.010
<v 1>That's really the thing that gets me is how similar this is to religious or</v>

95
00:04:29.011 --> 00:04:33.420
religion, not just really religious ideology, like how rigid it is,

96
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.860
but also indoctrination like religious cults, how they indoctrinate people.

97
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:42.330
And one of my friends, Kurt, Medsker really funny guy who, um,

98
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.010
was a Jehovah's witness when he was younger. And so he's really, really,

99
00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:49.740
really sensitive to this stuff. He's like, I know where this is going. Yep.

100
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.300
Like this is the same thing that I got when I was in the Jehovah's witness cult.

101
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.260
It's these rigid ideologies that cannot be challenged.

102
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.220
You can't in any way veer from, of course, that's right.

103
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.530
<v 2>And they set you up. Right. So every single,</v>

104
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.670
single one of these things sets you up. So for example,

105
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.660
uh, one of my favorite examples of these kind of like setups, right.

106
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.220
It historically in the book I talk about, um, historically, you know,

107
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:18.840
the black feminist came along and they're like, oh,

108
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.340
feminism's too white feminism.

109
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:23.310
Isn't paying attention to black feminist issues or black women's issues.

110
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.670
And so then these feminists were like, oh, we have to fix that. You know?

111
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:29.880
And they start writing about black issues to the best of their ability.

112
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.450
And then three years later, the lady writes a paper saying, oh,

113
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:37.470
you're just sticking black things in and it's fake and you're tokenizing it and

114
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:40.720
you're fetishizing it. And it's like, so you can't do it. Right. There's that,

115
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:45.150
that is called the indoctrination stuff. So it's like, you and I could be,

116
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.980
you know, talking about something like this,

117
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:48.270
and you could say something and I'm like,

118
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.320
don't you think it's a little bit racist. And then the next step is like,

119
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.230
what are you going to say? You're going to say yes or no. If you say yes,

120
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:58.310
and now you've owned it. Right. So now you're like racist. And so I'm like,

121
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.730
well, do you interrogate your racism? Like, do you spend time working on that?

122
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:06.320
And so you see sure you're dragging people into it. If you say, no, I can say,

123
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.880
well, one of the symptoms of participation in,

124
00:06:09.881 --> 00:06:14.360
in systemic racism is, is an inability to see it. If you're white,

125
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.620
it's invisible to you.

126
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.070
And so maybe you need to look harder when it seems like you're getting a little

127
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:23.840
defensive and panic and then you start panicking. And when you start to panic,

128
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.340
when you start to stress out, they're like,

129
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.670
and literally this lady emailed me the other day, this, this Indian woman,

130
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.090
I get a lot. I get insane. Number of emails about.

131
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.760
<v 4>People, India. No, no. From Canada. Oh,</v>

132
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.710
but everyone didn't say number of emails from people.

133
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.200
<v 2>Who are in different, different, like, uh,</v>

134
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.080
levels of stress with different things that are happening in their lives around

135
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:45.170
this woke explosion that's happened in the last month or so.

136
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.640
So this lady is like, I had to go through a brown fragility training at work.

137
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.760
What brown fragilities of St.

138
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.040
<v 1>Even black now it's, they're working their way down to brown people.</v>

139
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.520
Brown people have for jobs, those poor people.

140
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.390
So people who racially were sort of like Switzerland,

141
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.780
like Indians, like in India,

142
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.570
like no one ever thought they were racist. Right. You never,

143
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.600
you would never hear about racist Indians. Right.

144
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.780
Maybe Russell Peters would joke around about it. Right. You know, Russell. Yeah.

145
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.390
Yeah.

146
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.250
<v 2>Now you hear about it. And what they're doing is that they had that.</v>

147
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.430
What happened was they explained to the ladies or not the lady that was like the

148
00:07:21.431 --> 00:07:24.220
whole group, it was a done in a room, you know, in front of a bunch of people.

149
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.120
And they explained, uh, brown people in general,

150
00:07:28.121 --> 00:07:31.300
like it's some kind of block of brownness or whatever. Uh,

151
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.530
brown people have anti-black racism too. And that upholds white supremacy.

152
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.330
Oh my God. And then they start just doing this.

153
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:40.870
And it's almost like cold reading. Right. You know, like the Edwards guy,

154
00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:42.460
whatever that guy's name was had that show.

155
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.610
And so it's like the cold read and they wait for somebody to start looking like

156
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:48.670
they're getting the sweat or something happened. And then they say,

157
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.760
now what we need to do now that we've introduced this idea of,

158
00:07:51.761 --> 00:07:54.730
of your brown fragility is we need to your anti-blackness.

159
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.030
Cause we need to interrogate the feelings that came up and suddenly go one by

160
00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:01.810
one through the room and made every single one of them confess their feelings.

161
00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:03.130
Like who's not going to participate.

162
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:05.740
And here's that double bind because it gets to you. Right.

163
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.110
And so what do you say? You say, well,

164
00:08:08.111 --> 00:08:09.730
I don't really know what you're talking about. Well.

165
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.010
<v 3>They're going to say you're hearing it. Exactly.</v>

166
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.310
<v 2>And then if you confess to it, then, then you're falling in.</v>

167
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:18.100
So this is straight up cult indoctrination style. Yeah. It really.

168
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.010
<v 1>Is like those people and game of Thrones, you remember that those,</v>

169
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.450
those people that almost like took over the crown and kidnapped Searcy, that,

170
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.520
that it is. Yeah.

171
00:08:27.521 --> 00:08:32.440
It's like that sort of pattern for whatever reason just seems to

172
00:08:32.441 --> 00:08:34.300
reoccur with humans.

173
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.140
<v 2>You know?</v>

174
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.890
And I think it comes down to our natural religious impulses that I think,

175
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:41.650
I mean, you know, pretty well from my background, you know,

176
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:45.220
I don't believe in God, I'm an atheist and dare you. Oh, well, you know,

177
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.700
we get along. And so it's like,

178
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.300
I still do think that we have certain impulses underneath that lead people to

179
00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:55.920
build religious structures around themselves and have religious, you know,

180
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.680
thoughts and feelings and want to have spiritual development and all of this.

181
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.890
And so religions can kind of do one of two things. You know,

182
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:05.460
I used to be kind of hard about religion and like tough, like, you know, uh,

183
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.720
angry atheist kind of picture,

184
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:10.290
but I've thought about it more and which you're not allowed to think about

185
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:13.530
things and change your mind now. But I did. And um,

186
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.540
what I realized is that some religions look up,

187
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.460
they're like looking at God and they're afraid of sin,

188
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:20.100
but they they're paying attention to God. They're thinking about renewal.

189
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.110
They're thinking about redemption. They're thinking about forgiveness.

190
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.610
And then some religions look down and all they do is look at the sin and they

191
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:28.920
focus on the sin. And that's where the witch hunts came from.

192
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:32.130
That was when the Calvinists got like, you know, fire and brimstone,

193
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:35.820
Jonathan Edwards, screaming, you know, sinners in the hands of an angry God,

194
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:40.800
you're hanging on a spider's thread above the fires of hell and God knock you

195
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:42.990
into it. Cause everybody's full of sin. Next thing you know,

196
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:46.860
they're killing witches. So it's like, you start focus. If you look up,

197
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.870
you know, then religion can be great. It can actually lead people,

198
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.650
even if they spiritual development community. So on. But if you're looking down,

199
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:57.930
you're going to start obsessing about everybody.

200
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.180
If you're obsessing about Sandy,

201
00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:02.340
you're going to start obsessing about everybody. Else's sin to, uh,

202
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.820
cause you're going to want to like, does this feeling with, again,

203
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:10.380
reading Robin D'Angelo's white fragility, is this feeling like, uh,

204
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.220
that she doesn't want to feel alone?

205
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.340
Like she has these struggles and she doesn't want to be alone.

206
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:19.080
So she's a white lady. Oh yeah. Robin,

207
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:24.450
DeAngelo's a white lady who goes in and for like $12,000 a pop does these

208
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.740
corporate seminars? Yeah. 12, 12 grand for two hours. And teaches,

209
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.180
she goes into tells white people that they're racist and then like interrogates

210
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:36.480
their feelings when they, when they get defensive about it. Oh my goodness.

211
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.020
It's like the biggest corporate corporate training hustle ever.

212
00:10:40.021 --> 00:10:42.300
And her idea of white fragility, you can't disagree with it.

213
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:43.260
There's no way to disagree.

214
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:47.250
I've absolutely like rammed it on some people on Twitter where these walkies

215
00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:50.310
that come and try to trash me. And I just say, you know,

216
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.200
that looks a little bit like white fragility.

217
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:54.330
And I give some reason that's kind of out of the literature.

218
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.020
And then they were like, I can't have white fragility, you know, I'm whatever.

219
00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:00.510
And it's like, oh, that's definitely, you're getting defensive.

220
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:02.490
Defensive is one of the symptoms of white fragility.

221
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.030
You just wanted to know your complicity and the system of racism that you

222
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:07.890
benefit from. And then it's just like,

223
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.560
you can't get away from it because the end kind.

224
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.390
<v 1>Of language, like what you just said is like, it, like, that's like checkmate.</v>
