00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How long were you there?</v>

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.770
<v 1>I'd say about six months or so. And.</v>

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.080
<v 2>What, what progress was made while you were there?</v>

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.720
<v 1>Well, we came up with a bunch of</v>

5
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.000
reasonably good ideas about how the reactor worked,

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.790
and one of them was the base.

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.910
The square base of it was essentially like a cyclotron,

8
00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:27.620
which is a small particle accelerator, a circular one particle accelerators,

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.030
linear particle accelerators, or just a, you know, long tube essentially.

10
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.850
And they accelerate particles with high voltage and, you know,

11
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:37.130
radio frequencies until they reach high speeds.

12
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:40.580
But a cyclotron does that and a small circular area.

13
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.590
And there's this very heavy element, fuel element,

14
00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:49.700
one 15, something that wasn't on our periodic charts at the time,

15
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.920
but it is now. It is now. Yeah.

16
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.580
<v 2>When did it become on the periodic table now? The way the charts.</v>

17
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.610
<v 1>Now, you know, I don't remember. Do you remember when they, uh.</v>

18
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.340
<v 3>2004 Durham stat, Germany,</v>

19
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:05.480
I think is where they first fabricated for atoms that lasted 220 milliseconds.

20
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.250
The items it's nothing. Right.

21
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.030
And then it later was discovered a couple more times they could fabricate it.

22
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.050
Then they gave it,

23
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.100
they gave it a place then on the periodic chart after that called it Muskogee.

24
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.210
<v 2>So they told you about this stuff in 1982?</v>

25
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.520
Yeah. Well, we kinda, what, what year was this?

26
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.390
<v 1>It was 80, 88 and 89 when I was there. 82 is when</v>

27
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.813
[inaudible], I'm sorry. Yeah. So.

28
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.790
<v 2>88, 89, they told you about this stuff. So this was.</v>

29
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.160
<v 1>No, they didn't, they didn't tell me about it.</v>

30
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:41.090
That's one of the things that this group came up with, the, um,

31
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.070
um, I keep losing my train of thought with this thing.

32
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.470
<v 2>So this one area, this,</v>

33
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.460
this element one 15 was the fuel.

34
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.800
<v 1>Yeah, it was the fuel, um.</v>

35
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.980
<v 3>The world where forgive you for having a migraine. I.</v>

36
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.570
<v 4>Just, it's really hard to think through this. Just give me a minute,</v>

37
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.793
give you more.

38
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.030
<v 3>Yeah, definitely. As I say, one thing you know about for the last 30 years,</v>

39
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.870
people have just been on the attack on Bob, you know, getting to know him,

40
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.730
the personal effects on his life.

41
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.170
It's really hard to understand unless you meet his family and his wife. I mean,

42
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.530
this is the last thing he wanted to do was have to talk.

43
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.770
<v 2>Yeah, we should explain that Jeremy, that you and I had this conversation,</v>

44
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:34.730
I watched your documentary, we had this conversation and I said,

45
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.500
I have to talk to him. Yeah. The document there was, there's been detractors.

46
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.950
There's been a bunch of people that called on many of the things that you've

47
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:47.840
said. But over time, many of the things that you talked about,

48
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.150
even in the eighties have proven to be true.

49
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.660
Things that people said were not true, were proven to be true.

50
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.520
Element one 15 was one of them.

51
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.800
<v 1>Right, right, right. Uh, element 15,</v>

52
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:03.310
the fuel they had was stable. In other words, it didn't decay.

53
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:07.870
It wasn't emitting radioactivity. Um, when they synthesized, uh,

54
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.110
two or three atoms of the one 15, uh,

55
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:15.190
it did decay and it was not a stable element. So they're,

56
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.420
they're kind of two different things,

57
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:21.370
but this is kind of typical elements always have, or pretty much always have,

58
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.580
uh, stabilize the topes and unstable isotopes.

59
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:29.050
Like I think cesium as like 30 unstable isotopes to it.

60
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:33.760
So are well hydrogen, for example, you're familiar with hydrogen gas. Um,

61
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.380
it's stable. It's not radioactive, but there's also two other types of hydrogen

62
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.990
deuterium and tritium and deuterium. Isn't radioactive.

63
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:48.160
It's another stable isotope of hydrogen, but tritium is radioactive.

64
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:52.090
Now they're all hydrogen, but they just have a different amounts of neutrons.

65
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.650
So it's the same thing with other elements and element one 15,

66
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.590
depending on the amount of neutrons it has, uh,

67
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.880
designates the isotope, but it's one 15.

68
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.270
They will continue to take, uh,

69
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.500
or experiment and try and make one 15 at different isotopes.

70
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.930
And I'm sure eventually they'll come up with a stable version,

71
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.650
but it's the taste stable version that has the properties that we're talking

72
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:18.030
about.

73
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.990
<v 2>So they somehow, or another had acquired a stable version.</v>

74
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:24.090
Did they say that the stable version had come with.

75
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.280
<v 1>This craft? It absolutely came with the graft. Yeah.</v>

76
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.170
<v 2>So at the time you having a firm knowledge of the periodic chart</v>

77
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.720
and knowing what was real and what wasn't real,

78
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:37.050
what was your reaction to having this stable element?

79
00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:39.360
One 15 that wasn't even supposed to exist?

80
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.380
<v 1>Everything was impossible, right? I mean, down, down to the metal,</v>

81
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.360
I did get a chance to look inside the craft on only one

82
00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:52.080
occasion. And this was important because, um,

83
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.850
where the reactor sat might have been critical to how it operated since

84
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.660
everything operates without any interconnections.

85
00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:02.520
So the placement of components might be critical.

86
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.560
So they allowed me to go inside and, and look at it. Um,

87
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.630
again, I forgot what the hell.

88
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.280
<v 2>So you're going into this craft and what are you thinking when you're inside of</v>

89
00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:15.480
it? Like, what are you seeing?

90
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.580
<v 1>It's um, it's a very ominous feeling because it's,</v>

91
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.510
there are no F first of all, everything is one color.

92
00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:26.010
It's like a dark pewter color.

93
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.320
And there are no right angles anywhere it's as if somebody took

94
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:36.000
a I've said this before somebody took a model out of Anne,

95
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.480
fashioned it out of wax and then heated it just for a short time.

96
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:42.600
So everything melted, everything looks like it's fused together.

97
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:46.890
Everything has a radius of curvature where two, uh, items meet.

98
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.660
It's a, it's a really weird looking thing. But, um,

99
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.480
uh,

100
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.300
there was almost nothing other than small foldable hatchway

101
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.350
that, um, that looked recognizable, everything was, uh,

102
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.300
was really unworldly to pick on it a way to describe it.

103
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.550
<v 2>So you,</v>

104
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.420
you get inside this thing and it's designed for something that's much smaller

105
00:06:13.421 --> 00:06:13.600
than.

106
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.900
<v 1>Me. Yeah. You can't really stand up until you get to the very center of,</v>

107
00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:19.300
and I'll tell you I'm five 10.

108
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.700
<v 2>And what do you think this was designed for?</v>

109
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.730
<v 1>I'd say something close to half my height. Wow.</v>

110
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.420
<v 2>So these little three foot tall ish creatures.</v>

111
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.450
<v 1>Yeah. And th th the seats were small too. I mean,</v>

112
00:06:31.451 --> 00:06:35.050
obviously it was made for something, something small,

113
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.730
but there is no, like, there's, there's nothing else in there.

114
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.540
There's just seats the reactor and some of the sub-components there's no,

115
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:48.340
there's no control panels. There's no bathroom. There's no, no decorative,

116
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.440
uh, components or artwork or anything that you would recognize or trim. I mean,

117
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.310
it's just a very bare bones thing. You're not seeing any screens.

118
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.770
Well, there are arch ways around it, et cetera, part of the superstructure.

119
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.480
And then one of the archways can become transparent.

120
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.610
When I was in there, there was another group working on one of the archways,

121
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.850
and you could call that a screen morally.

122
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.330
<v 2>So through that Archway, it would be,</v>

123
00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:23.050
it would maintain the solidity, the, the solid,

124
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.300
whatever metal it was. Yeah.

125
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.120
<v 1>It just became transparent. Yeah.</v>

126
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.030
I saw that happen once or twice before I left.

127
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.960
Did you ask any questions about what the, no, there's no asking there's no, no,

128
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.160
but when.

129
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.790
<v 2>You watch something become transparent and you realize it's still there,</v>

130
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:40.624
but you could now see.

131
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.930
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, not now, that's not that impressive.</v>

132
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:47.800
We do have some liquid crystal materials that are like that, you know,

133
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.860
they haven't seen them smart glass. Yeah. They call it smart glass.

134
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:54.790
So this is just a, and I don't know if the craft is made of, you know,

135
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:59.710
an advanced metal or a ceramic, it was cold to the church. So, um,

136
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.960
you know, I would lean more towards a metal.

137
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.360
You're not allowed to ask questions. No,

138
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.090
the only they work on the buddy system.

139
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.290
So I can only exchange ideas and talk to Barry. Now,

140
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:15.970
this really interferes with science because science is based on free discussion.

141
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.410
And ideally you get a bunch of guys together, exchange ideas, work on problems,

142
00:08:20.411 --> 00:08:21.850
and that's how things move forward.

143
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.170
But they're so over the top concerned about security.

144
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.640
They split everything off and everybody becomes stagnant.

145
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.620
It, it, it, it just destroys any of the progress you can make,

146
00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:38.980
or at least makes it go so slow. Um, they,

147
00:08:38.981 --> 00:08:41.050
I think they wound up shooting themselves in the foot.

148
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.820
<v 2>Which is probably why they arrived at this bottleneck that they needed to get</v>

149
00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:49.570
this madman with a jet powered Honda, come in and see what he could.

150
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.910
<v 1>I think that was an act of desperation.</v>

151
00:08:51.911 --> 00:08:54.490
I think they wanted someone that's thinks out of the box and let,

152
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:58.110
let's just this guy a try here because they weren't. And, uh,

153
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.980
they might've done this four more times since, uh, you know,

154
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.100
up to the point in time today, assuming they're still working on this thing.

155
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.650
<v 2>And when you see this craft and you're inside,</v>

156
00:09:09.651 --> 00:09:14.570
was there any indication that there was an area that they would use to

157
00:09:14.571 --> 00:09:17.750
control it to pilot? Was there a pilot seat?

158
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.410
<v 1>There were three seats. They sat around, uh,</v>

159
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:26.210
the reactor was in the dead center of it, and then equidistant around,

160
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:30.680
there were three seats and that's all there. There was a,

161
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:35.360
a large unit. They're not consoles. There are large rectangular objects,

162
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.190
also spaced equidistant around the center. Um, there's nothing on them.

163
00:09:40.191 --> 00:09:43.490
There's no buttons, there's no lights, there's same color.

164
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.480
Everything is the same color, different shape, right. And, um,

165
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.770
directly underneath them, there's three levels in the craft. Uh,

166
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.460
the main level is what we're talking about directly under that.

167
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.010
Those are the gravity amplifiers,

168
00:09:58.011 --> 00:10:02.240
the big rectangular objects underneath them are the gravity emitters that look

169
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.860
like for lack of a better word, a trashcan hanging on a pipe, three of those.

170
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.690
And then the top layer. I, this is just my personal belief.

171
00:10:11.691 --> 00:10:14.210
I think that has to do with, uh, uh, uh,

172
00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:17.360
navigation or their version of a computer, uh,

173
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.790
with some planar panels,

174
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.790
sensor panels around the craft that we would call portholes,

175
00:10:22.791 --> 00:10:25.250
but they're not portholes. They're just black areas.

176
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.870
And I think that just determines its position in space,

177
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.130
but I was,

178
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:36.200
I physically was in the center section and I stuck my torso in

179
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.950
the bottom section and hung upside down so I could see how the gravity

180
00:10:39.951 --> 00:10:44.150
amplifiers were positioned. What is the, the, roughly the size of this thing?

181
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.410
It's a, I think it, I don't remember from being there, but, um,

182
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.490
after all this stuff was over, I had, uh, John Andrews,

183
00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:55.370
a guy from the testers model corporation, and, you know,

184
00:10:55.371 --> 00:10:59.390
we sat down and tried to figure out from what I saw,

185
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.810
um, and known sizes of things.

186
00:11:02.811 --> 00:11:07.490
And we came up with 52 feet in diameter and I think that's a really small,

187
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.300
yeah. So I think that's a fair, a reasonable guess. Now.

188
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.930
<v 2>You said there's nine of them and you've got a brief glimpse at the other ones</v>

189
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:15.950
where the, how.

190
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.080
<v 1>Are they doing? Oh, they looked completely different. One looked like a,</v>

191
00:11:20.081 --> 00:11:22.160
I called a jello mold and it,

192
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.940
it looked like a classic jello mold with the ripple sides to it.

193
00:11:25.941 --> 00:11:30.740
One was a very flat disc. Um, you know,

194
00:11:30.741 --> 00:11:32.210
like, uh, oh,

195
00:11:32.211 --> 00:11:36.080
I don't like a straw hat or something like that that was sitting up on its edge.

196
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:41.150
And the thin part of it had, it looked like a projectile had been fired through,

197
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.913
um, the edge of it.

198
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.270
So I don't know if they were attempting to see if the metal could be penetrated

199
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.250
or if something, or if that's where the thing came from, maybe it was shot down.

200
00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.870
Um, but that was the only one where I saw there was, you know,

201
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:57.610
actual physical damage to it.

202
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.780
<v 2>And that one was roughly the same size. They're.</v>

203
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.870
<v 1>All. They were kind of too far away to tell. Hmm.</v>

204
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.210
<v 2>And did there, it was several teams that were working on the propulsion system.</v>

205
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.730
So there was different teams that were working on these different.

206
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.410
<v 1>Aircraft. I don't know. I could only assume.</v>

207
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.750
<v 2>Now when you're sitting in this thing and you're looking at this</v>

208
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.600
other worldly craft, your,

209
00:12:24.601 --> 00:12:28.740
your goal is to try to figure out how this thing functions your goal is to try

210
00:12:28.741 --> 00:12:31.530
to figure out how this reactor, I mean,

211
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.980
but it would imagine they would give you more time than just one day to check

212
00:12:34.981 --> 00:12:35.610
that.

213
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:40.560
<v 1>Oh yeah. It wasn't one day, right? Yeah. I mean, this is Barry was there.</v>

214
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.080
I think Barry was sleeping there. I'm sure they had, now that,

215
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.550
that isn't weird. I mean, up at the tone of pod test range,

216
00:12:47.551 --> 00:12:50.160
where they work on still fighters, you know, you go,

217
00:12:50.161 --> 00:12:54.630
I think three weeks on one week off and you stay up there too.

218
00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:58.290
So it's not weird to stay up at the test site. Right. So, um, yeah,

219
00:12:58.291 --> 00:12:59.370
I think he pretty much said it didn't,

220
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.410
he acted like he's been up there for a long time. Um, but, um,

221
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.130
yeah. Who knows you, do you have contact with this guy? No. Oh no.

222
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.290
I wish I did.

223
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:14.190
I kinda thought he was gonna come out after I did.

224
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:19.050
And I think I took so much flak and it's so much for

225
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.450
what went on. I think I actually,

226
00:13:21.451 --> 00:13:25.830
I wound up helping security there and everybody became afraid of, you know,

227
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.960
doing or saying anything after that.

228
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.220
<v 2>So what kind of reports did you have to give? Like,</v>

229
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.930
so you're not making much progress, right?

230
00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:36.930
You're just trying to figure out what this thing is. And it seems impossible.

231
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.830
<v 1>Well, we didn't personally make them, I mean, we were always,</v>

232
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.600
there was never a lot of information that we gained. Um,

233
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.760
the guy you would call him,

234
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:52.650
our supervisor was the name was Dennis Mariani and kind of a military

235
00:13:52.651 --> 00:13:56.340
looking guy. And he would routinely pop in, you know,

236
00:13:56.341 --> 00:14:00.060
during the day and, you know, Hey, what's going on guys?

237
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.750
And he would essentially relay, enter any information, anything new.

238
00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:04.950
We came up with. I mean,

239
00:14:04.951 --> 00:14:08.790
he was our go-between where we presented him the information,

240
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.520
and then he took it to wherever they were, you know,

241
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.550
assembling all the data from every, no, I assume.

242
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.770
<v 2>You're working normal days, like an eight hour day.</v>

243
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.620
<v 1>No, no, no.</v>

244
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:23.250
It was really weird that I would be only called in on certain times and certain

245
00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:25.950
days. And they would be weird hours too.

246
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.920
Most of the time was later in the evening. I mean,

247
00:14:28.921 --> 00:14:32.130
I can get a call at 11 o'clock at night and they'll say, you know,

248
00:14:32.131 --> 00:14:36.510
it's now 11 o'clock, um, by 1145,

249
00:14:36.511 --> 00:14:40.950
you need to be at McCarran terminal. And, um, you know,

250
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.340
we'll let you know when we have more information, but.

251
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:49.020
<v 2>What did you do while you were there? If you're looking at this object,</v>

252
00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:53.660
this reactor and can't figure out what it is or how it works,

253
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.960
other than the fact that it works on this element that we don't even know about.

254
00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.850
<v 1>Sure. I mean, the thing was too, that what you do and, you know,</v>

255
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.010
with anything, if you're trying to analyze it, all you can do is perform tests.

256
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.290
And all we did is try and come up with every kind of test we possibly could.

257
00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:14.790
I mean, we tested, you know, it, it,

258
00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:19.630
it violated a lot of what we thought was impossible to violate. I mean,

259
00:15:19.631 --> 00:15:24.190
one of the first laws of thermodynamics, I mean, essentially any machine,

260
00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:27.160
any device that operates always makes extra heat,

261
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.590
nothing works at a hundred percent efficient.

262
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.580
Even the headphones you're wearing anything that takes power.

263
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.660
Some of that power is going to be converted to heat and it's just wasted

264
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.820
this didn't. I mean,

265
00:15:39.821 --> 00:15:43.300
we looked at back then we had infrared cameras they're different today,

266
00:15:43.301 --> 00:15:47.920
but back then you had a poor liquid nitrogen into the camera to cool the sensor

267
00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:51.970
down and, um, and get these infrared images you've seen,

268
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.140
but it never got no matter what the load was on the reactor.

269
00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:01.360
It never got above the ambient temperature, which is impossible. I mean, you're,

270
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.433
you know,

271
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.360
pulling out huge amounts of power and nothing ever gets warm.

272
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.400
Um, we tried measuring magnetic fields and there was nothing there.

273
00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:16.630
So we started playing around with the, uh, emission, from the emitters,

274
00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:21.520
the gravity wave itself and saw what we could do with it and how

275
00:16:21.521 --> 00:16:22.360
it was focused.

276
00:16:22.361 --> 00:16:26.800
So we really spent all our time just trying to see

277
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:31.030
what the stuff can do and what we can control. Oh, so.

278
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.260
<v 2>You were seeing what it could do,</v>

279
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.270
would you couldn't ever figure out how it was doing it?

280
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.710
<v 1>No, not really. I mean, we really, we really could only use, uh, uh,</v>

281
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.560
come up with a best guess. And now I can't say we really,

282
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:45.700
I,

283
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.320
that I could absolutely state for certainly or certainty how anything

284
00:16:50.321 --> 00:16:51.154
actually works.

285
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:52.683
<v 2>Now.</v>

286
00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.940
How did you know at all how they were piloting it? Because some,

287
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.100
they were doing some tests where they're having these things fly around

288
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.600
in the sky. And this is what gets us deeper into your story.

289
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.370
Right? Um.

290
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:17.050
<v 1>I was out there for, uh, one test, um, right.</v>

291
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:21.940
In fact, I was in with Barry in the lab and Dennis came in and said,

292
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.880
uh, we're about to run the test. Why don't you guys come out?

293
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.650
Or I think he said, Barry, why didn't you come out here and bring Bob with you?

294
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.930
Uh, we went out there and the Kraft was already outside the hanger

295
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.780
and was just preparing to lift off.

296
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.620
Now they were in communication with somebody in the craft.

297
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.930
So there was a person in the, yeah,

298
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:48.640
there was certainly a person in there now it's not a comfortable place to be in

299
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.610
because it's, so the guy has to be sitting on the floor in the middle, uh,

300
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.930
my best guess. And this.

301
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.020
<v 2>Is the same specific craft that you, because you were the,</v>

302
00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.550
that was the only craft that you were in. The only.

303
00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:02.600
<v 1>One that I, I touched and worked on, um, and it,</v>

304
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.790
it quietly lifted off the ground,

305
00:18:04.791 --> 00:18:08.690
which was incredibly impressive to see quietly or silently

306
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:15.260
well quietly because it did reduce it. It reduced,

307
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.550
um, a little Corona discharge from the bottom at Krone.

308
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.810
Discharge is kind of a high voltage brush, little bluish glow discharge,

309
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.380
as it was lifting off the ground. You can hear a slight, his sound. Now,

310
00:18:27.381 --> 00:18:29.990
as soon as it cleared the ground by about five or 10 feet,

311
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.520
maybe even less than that, the hissing stopped and the blue goat disappeared.

312
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:39.590
So it lifted off quietly and then it hovered silently if you want to be

313
00:18:39.591 --> 00:18:40.424
specific.

314
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.850
<v 2>Wow. So then what kind of maneuvers was it doing?</v>

315
00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.600
<v 1>It took up for that particular time. It took off,</v>

316
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.920
moved a little round around to the left and right. And then sat back down the,

317
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.360
um, the craft itself. Um,

318
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.790
they communicated with it with a reg because I saw the guy talking,

319
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.640
uh, and a regular VHF radio to the person in the craft.

320
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.650
And I even saw the frequency that was on the, the frequency counter of the, uh,

321
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.860
communication that transceiver there. Um,

322
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.320
but what's weird is he shouldn't be able to communicate with the craft,

323
00:19:21.321 --> 00:19:23.180
with a radio, the radio,

324
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.810
the radio waves should bend around the craft. I mean, it,

325
00:19:26.811 --> 00:19:30.920
it shouldn't be possible at every single thing about these,

326
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:35.600
the craft and the way they operated didn't make any sense to us.

327
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.020
I mean, that's something we talked about for a while after why.

328
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.730
<v 2>Should the frequency bend around the craft?</v>

329
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.073
<v 1>Well,</v>

330
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.130
you really have to look at the way the gravity wave comes out of the craft.

331
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.850
There's a,

332
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:50.930
the reactors in the center and there's a wave guide that goes up to the top.

333
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.470
There's actually a small appendage that sticks out at the top of the craft and

334
00:19:54.471 --> 00:19:58.520
it produces a heart shaped gravitational distortion around the craft. Now,

335
00:19:58.521 --> 00:20:03.410
if the craft is sitting in the air and you walk underneath it and look up,

336
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:08.720
you actually cannot see the craft, the light bends around it.

337
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.820
You're bending gravity, bends, light, it bends radio waves. It's um,

338
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:14.990
it,

339
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:19.910
it shouldn't be possible to communicate with a craft that has an envelope around

340
00:20:19.911 --> 00:20:22.340
it. That's distorting all forms of energy,

341
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.540
but they were apparently in contact with it somehow.

342
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.860
<v 2>Or another through some unexplained way that they don't bother explaining to</v>

343
00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:35.270
you. So this thing gets up, it just does some very simple maneuvers left, right.

344
00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:40.130
Left, right. Goes down. Um, and did they discuss this with you?

345
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.330
I mean, they said they wanted you to see.

346
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.890
<v 1>It. Yeah. They just want it now. They didn't discuss anything with me. It set,</v>

347
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.390
it sat down, looked around for a bit and Barry said, let's go back.

348
00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:52.810
And we went back in the lab, all we got to do is see it, um,

349
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.570
fast forward. Um, to some months later, uh,

350
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.540
I did have the test flight schedule of the craft.

351
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.440
Now they had times they had designated high-performance tests.

352
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.300
This obviously wasn't one that, uh, was a high-performance test. The, uh,

353
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:11.560
high-performance test went,

354
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:16.270
goes above the mountain range and they do much more radical moves with the

355
00:21:16.271 --> 00:21:16.631
thing. Look,

356
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:21.430
this is a prized item and they're not doing anything like taking it out of the

357
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:24.670
atmosphere or flying around to other countries or anything like that. This,

358
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.150
they just play with this thing right over the test site. Um,

359
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.370
but they were doing some radical moves with it.

360
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.000
And since I had the test flight schedule, statistically,

361
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:40.960
the amount of traffic and the surrounding areas on the highway was

362
00:21:40.961 --> 00:21:45.160
lowest on Wednesdays. And that's why Dennis, Dennis told us that, uh,

363
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.370
all the test flights occurred only on Wednesdays,

364
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.120
because it'd be the least chance that anyone would see what's going on.

365
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.470
<v 2>In this. It was before the,</v>

366
00:21:54.471 --> 00:21:59.130
the government had expanded the forbidden territory around area

367
00:21:59.131 --> 00:22:01.380
51 and papoose lake and all that stuff.

368
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.450
<v 1>Yeah. I think that occurred after my story came out,</v>

369
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.380
then people started going up on the mountain tops and trying to look down into

370
00:22:10.381 --> 00:22:14.610
there and they kind of freaked out and then did the land grab and pushed

371
00:22:14.611 --> 00:22:16.380
everybody back. But yeah, that,

372
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:21.120
I think all of that occurred long after that was great that I came out.
