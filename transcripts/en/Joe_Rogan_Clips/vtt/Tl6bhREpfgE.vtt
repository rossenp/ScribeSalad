00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. The thing is these stuff aren't hard to obtain, like,</v>

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.280
you know, getting a Porsche isn't hard, right?

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.490
<v 1>It was hard for a lot of people. Depends on how much you make, what you do.</v>

4
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:12.240
What kind of job.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.920
<v 0>You're trapped in. Hard is relative. Right. You know, like, like I tell my kids,</v>

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.900
hard is, uh, basically undiscovered. That's all it is. Right.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.130
So for example, when you first do algebra, it's hard. Right?

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.670
But that's just because it's new so hard equals new.

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.880
That's what hard means it's new because once you do algebra 3, 4, 5,

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.300
10 times is not new anymore. And therefore it's not hard.

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.740
So once you break past the, the newness of a thing,

12
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.570
it's no longer hard, like building a business. It's not new to me.

13
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:53.550
Therefore, it's not hard. It's very easy for me to build a business.

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.080
Yeah. Because I've done it so many times in my life. You see what I'm saying?

15
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.880
Jeff it's eyes is cash flowing four X.

16
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.140
What it was doing when I first joined the company and all I do is make a few

17
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:11.040
tweaks, but that's only because I'm not new to the tech startup space.

18
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.920
I've been working with over 20 startups, over 20 startups in, in, in,

19
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:20.340
in a matter of two, three years as a consultant. So this stuff, when people say,

20
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.980
oh, it's hard. It's like, no, no, no, it's not hard. It's new.

21
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.260
And you're an idiot and you don't know what you're doing.

22
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.490
It's not hard to achieve anything in his life. My, uh, you know,

23
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:33.240
I used to work for 50 cent. Right. And, um, uh, I, uh,

24
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.340
when I lived in new Brunswick, right by Rutgers, I, I, I,

25
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.060
I wasn't really a 50 cent fan. I enjoyed his music.

26
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.350
I wasn't a fan to buy a poster. I bought this poster. It was him and G unit.

27
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:46.320
And he had his big stash of money. And I was like, yo, this just,

28
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.070
this poster motivates me. You fast forward 10 years.

29
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:53.880
And some other things I did to get close to 50. And I actually worked with 50.

30
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.260
That was technically hard. Right? It's not easy to get next to 50.

31
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.370
But when I did it, it happened like that. Then I started working with Carmelo.

32
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:03.600
Anthony. You're saying.

33
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.340
<v 1>Once it actually happened, it turned out. It.</v>

34
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.540
<v 0>Wasn't actually hard. No hard. It's hard for some people. No,</v>

35
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:12.540
they're just not disciplined. Hard.

36
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.650
Hard is dealing with yourself. That's what's hard.

37
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.750
Can you defeat your own mind? So when I wake up every morning,

38
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:25.560
the only thing I got to defeat is doubt. It's the only thing I have to defeat.

39
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.420
Once I defeat doubt, I live in a limitless world,

40
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.580
infinite possibilities. I can literally do anything. You so-so. People told me,

41
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.450
oh, in order to be in tech, you know, you need a million dollars. And, and this,

42
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:43.170
that, and the third dude, I got equity in three tech companies,

43
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.220
three tech companies. And I'm not rich. I didn't, you know,

44
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:49.170
put up millions to get into these companies.

45
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.180
I'm part of these companies because I built me and it wasn't hard.

46
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.370
It really wasn't hard to get into these companies.

47
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.350
I just had something to offer and they saw value in me.

48
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.330
I want to be the next Elon Musk. I want to be the next bill gates.

49
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.290
I want to be the guy that Zuckerberg hates. You see what I'm saying?

50
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.790
I want to be the guy that,

51
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.190
that builds the new Silicon valley on the east coast. You know that like,

52
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.820
that's, those are my aspirations.

53
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.600
So when people tell me what you can and cannot do, when it is hard, I'm like,

54
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.280
dude, I'm selling Bitcoin. How many black dudes, you know,

55
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.350
sell Bitcoin? None. I don't know anybody who sells Bitcoin.

56
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.210
Exactly. And people are telling me, this is hard. It's not hard. You, you,

57
00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:37.840
you get what you want. And, and I didn't get into Bitcoin out of dumb luck.

58
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.100
I manifested that. I said, I wanted to sell Bitcoin. How can I manifest it?

59
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:44.470
Then I let it go. And the universe brought me the opportunity.

60
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:49.240
And then it happened when I said, when I first said, I want to be a VC.

61
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.000
First thing I want to do is start building a portfolio.

62
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.490
I didn't look for companies. They found me. It just,

63
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.940
I just had to ask the universe and it presented opportunities.

64
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.610
And I just had to say, what do you mean by how to ask the universe?

65
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.610
I had to put the intention out there. So do you think that.

66
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.680
<v 1>Literally by thinking about things, you can make them.</v>

67
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.100
<v 0>Happen. You can make the opportunity present itself,</v>

68
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.430
and then you have to be ready to take advantage. So let's,

69
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.650
we gotta walk through the story of the 50 something, right?

70
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:20.980
So I get invited to his bus launch, right? For the company.

71
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.450
Now I'm sitting on the bus,

72
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.060
they moved me to the back because of security reasons.

73
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.860
So I'm in the back of the bus. When the bus start moving in, my head,

74
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.500
fear kicks in and doubt kicks in and I'm telling myself,

75
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.720
I should just hop with the bus stop. And I said,

76
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.510
I should just hop up and just start screaming. I'm on a bus, a 50 cent.

77
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.090
And I'm like, nah, I don't do add, ain't invited you out here.

78
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:42.790
You got to sit here and that's not right. And you know,

79
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:46.810
all these things society says is right. So I stand up and I go, yo,

80
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:51.220
I'm on a bus of 50 cent. Right? And in a whole crowd, rushes the bus.

81
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.270
After the crowd finishes, they take one of the, uh, energy drink shirts.

82
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:58.240
They throw it on me, throw the hat on me. They bring me to the front of the bus.

83
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.150
Now I'm sitting next to 50 cent, fast forward two years later,

84
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:02.170
I'm in a 50 cent company.

85
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.610
But it's because I started off with defeat in doubt,

86
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.460
but also listening to my intuition. My intuition said to hop up and do that.

87
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.100
Right. But the opportunity was presented to me. I didn't,

88
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.840
I didn't create opportunity. They DMD me and said, yo, we want you to come.

89
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.690
I didn't ask. They invited me.

90
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.000
But it's because I kept putting that 50 cent energy out there. You see names.

91
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:33.610
I kept putting that out there. Like I won't mess with 50 cent.

92
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.810
I want me to say for 10 years, I've been putting in information that,

93
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.190
that energy out there, 50 of you listening, yo holler at me.

94
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:42.430
I want to work with you again. Um, but I really,

95
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.130
I just really love 15 his attitude. And he's just really a fun dude. You know,

96
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:45.964
he had a funny.

97
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.500
<v 1>About father's day see's roundabout. Father's day father's day. Mother's day.</v>

98
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.543
Very funny.

99
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.620
<v 0>Oh, but you know, the universe, anything you for,</v>

100
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.060
it will present the opportunity. The only thing is are you woken up to see it?

101
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.540
Can you identify it when it hits? And, and,

102
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.050
and can you defeat the fear to, to, to.

103
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.200
<v 1>And do you have all the other bases in your life covered where you have the</v>

104
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:14.750
bandwidth to tackle some correct difficult. Correct.

105
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.860
<v 0>But usually the universe only presents opportunities you can handle. They don't,</v>

106
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.320
it usually it doesn't. Cause if you couldn't handle it,

107
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:22.340
you wouldn't be able to recognize it.

108
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.940
<v 1>Do you say this? Like the universe presents this to you,</v>

109
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:29.060
this like a spiritual concept. Is this like,

110
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.110
are you manifesting reality with your thoughts and intentions?

111
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:35.060
Do you really believe that? All of that? Why do you.

112
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.590
<v 0>Believe that? Because I lived it.</v>

113
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.190
<v 1>I experienced it, but you lived it and you're successful at it. See, that's my,</v>

114
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.480
my perspective on that is always you hear about things like the secret and law

115
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:46.790
of attraction. You hear that from people that are successful, they say,

116
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.110
I willed it into existence,

117
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.530
but what about the people that tried to will it into existence and nothing ever

118
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:52.364
worked out right? Well.

119
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.090
<v 0>Or at Labaro right. Or at Laboy land for work and pray.</v>

120
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.640
A lot of people go into the secret and they just praying,

121
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.480
but they ain't working. Right. That's important. You know? So.

122
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.230
<v 1>You see what you're saying? I don't look at it in the same way,</v>

123
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.690
but I look at it in a similar way.

124
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.740
I think there is something to intention. There's something.

125
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.120
And there's something also to having that kind of faith to believe in intention.

126
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:18.530
Whereas I think a lot of people do,

127
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.740
they're reluctant to give into that because it seems too. Woo. Woo.

128
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:26.120
And it seems like some crystals and astrology and horse,

129
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.770
you know what I mean? Cause it's a lot of that.

130
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.900
<v 0>The new wage has ruined the law of attraction. You know what I mean? It's like,</v>

131
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.630
oh, just speaking into assistant happen. No, that's not true.

132
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.190
You have to first educate yourself. So when we talk about Hotep, right?

133
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.740
When we talk about Hotep, you got to bring up the 5% nation.

134
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.630
You've got to bring up Supreme mathematics, zero SIFA, one knowledge to wisdom,

135
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.720
three understanding. But at first starts at the number one, right?

136
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.320
Number one is knowledge. So the problem is people that trying to manifest,

137
00:07:54.321 --> 00:07:56.390
but ain't got no knowledge of anything, right?

138
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.380
So how do you manifest something with no knowledge, got to educate yourself.

139
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.640
You've got to first start educating.

140
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.310
<v 1>Yourself, discipline yourself so that you can educate yourself as well.</v>

141
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.210
<v 0>Right? And also knowledge is the springboard for imagination,</v>

142
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.650
right? So if there's a complicated calculus problem,

143
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.480
but you don't know what calculus is, how can intuition feed you,

144
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.410
uh, insight or inspiration to solve a calculus problem?

145
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:24.890
You first have to have the knowledge of calculus. Then when you get it,

146
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:28.520
you get all this influx of inspiration. Like Arnstein talks about, you know,

147
00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:31.100
he sits down, he kind of meditates and then the inspiration comes.

148
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.020
But the inspiration can only talk to you based upon your understanding,

149
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.690
because I know what I'm saying. Yes.

150
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.520
So the problem is people out here not educating themselves. You know, I,

151
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:48.560
I, my day begins and ends with educating myself begins ends.

152
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.050
And during the day I'm just reading books,

153
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:54.050
hopping between books and reading and listening to lectures.

154
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.840
And people think I'm deep. And I'm like, I don't know. I don't know, whatever,

155
00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:58.740
whatever warm, intelligent,

156
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:03.030
but really my secret is consuming as much information as possible.

157
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.830
That's my secret. And in from that, I'm able to say, oh, well, you know, da or,

158
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.100
you know, studying history, you know, you can do a lot of things,

159
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.030
but if you're not educating yourself or

160
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.650
doing, you got to do something, like just start.
