WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>He's he's a beast, but again, America could guy could go to Walmart.</v>

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.720
Nobody knows who the he is. &lt;laugh&gt; wander around.

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.600
He's one of the best heavyweight kickboxers of all time. Literally.

4
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:14.760
Nobody knows who he is. It's strange, you know, without, without question. Yeah.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.120
Yeah. Now, when you were training with Cody, when you were over a team,

6
00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:22.070
alpha male, what, what is coaching like? Like how are they,

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.070
how are they doing rounds with him?

8
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.830
<v 1>Uh, well he was doing his sparring separately. They brought us,</v>

9
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:31.350
they brought me and Eddie up just to spar with him. Uh, was.

10
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.990
<v 0>Who was Danny? Like who was coaching him?</v>

11
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.470
<v 1>Uh, Danny and Danny Castillo.</v>

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.830
<v 0>Danny Castillo and Chris Holsworth. Yeah. So they were essentially his coaches.</v>

13
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.670
They were, yeah, they were coaching him. Okay. Yeah.

14
00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:43.700
And so when you were working with him, were they saying, Hey,

15
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.380
we wanna really work on certain things or were they just letting you do your

16
00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:48.780
thing? Were they asking you to? I.

17
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.300
<v 1>I was being, you know, I go up there and like I said, I go grapple. Right.</v>

18
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.500
And so I was trying to be a good giving him. Good. Looks, skim the switches,

19
00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:59.340
give him that, like that TJ shoulder move type thing. Did you.

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.300
<v 0>Practice that stuff or did you, no, I.</v>

21
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.290
<v 1>Just, I just been one of those guys, like when ki, ever since I started with ki,</v>

22
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.570
like, and I've had to help somebody, like give him looks,

23
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.970
who's been that guy and I've been good at it. I've always been.

24
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.530
<v 0>Did you practice TJ's looks or did you just kind of know how to do it? I, I.</v>

25
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.050
<v 1>I, I always switch regardless. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,</v>

26
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.170
it is one of my favorite things to do just offensively and defensively.

27
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.450
I love switching. Did you.

28
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.120
<v 0>Have a traditional, a martial arts background?</v>

29
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:25.160
Did you start out with traditional martial arts? I started with.

30
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.280
<v 1>Moai. Started with.</v>

31
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.800
<v 0>Moai. Yeah. Interesting. I started with Moai. Yeah. Yeah. Some the best guys,</v>

32
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.521
you know,

33
00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:34.040
it's interesting now that the switching thing has become almost like a standard

34
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.440
thing. Yeah. Like with TJ, you don't even know what he's doing. You don't.

35
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.200
I mean, he doesn't have like a revert back to stance.

36
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:41.800
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he might stand south by,

37
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.470
he might stand Orthodox and he can do both equally. Well, yeah.

38
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.230
<v 1>Well, I'm naturally either right with my, with my left hand naturally,</v>

39
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.430
but I stand Orthodox. I surf Orthodox. I skate, Orthodox.

40
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.470
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; well, there's a lot of people. I mean, that was what, uh,</v>

41
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.950
Eddie Futch used to, or Emmanuel Stewart rather. Yeah.

42
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:02.870
Used to teach guys to do that. Yeah. He would take a guy who's right.

43
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.940
Handed and make 'em fight south paw. Yeah. It's like,

44
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.420
you want that lead hand to be your most coordinated hand. Yeah.

45
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.260
<v 1>Yeah. But we have,</v>

46
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.060
we have pad sessions that I'll just stand softball the whole time and I have no

47
00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:16.540
problem with it. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I, in fact, love sparring softball,

48
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.100
and I love just switching.

49
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.980
<v 0>Do you feel like your straight left hand has as much power as your straight</v>

50
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:22.900
right hand? Sometimes even.

51
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.490
<v 1>More you sometimes even more. Yeah. Yeah. I feel,</v>

52
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.370
I feel like I have power with both hands. Uh,

53
00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:30.850
almost equally just depends on the angle and where I'm catching mm-hmm

54
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.050
&lt;affirmative&gt; sometimes I try, I also try to catch people at the same time as,

55
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.650
as they're trying to get away from my right hand mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I'll

56
00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:39.610
switch stances and aggressively switch into, into the, uh,

57
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.570
the left hand and may get a power hand. And they,

58
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:43.930
they think they're getting away from my power hand,

59
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:48.000
but really they're walking into it and I make him switch into it. Ah, yeah.

60
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.880
<v 0>Now, so when you were working with Cody mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, did they,</v>

61
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.720
did they have any requests? Did they say, Hey,

62
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:57.000
this is what Cody's trying to work on. You know, just.

63
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 1>Really just, I was just switching a lot, trying to give him that,</v>

64
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.480
that switch left, that switch hook that he got caught with last time.

65
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.600
And he was trying to just be a good team man,

66
00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:07.440
and give him the head kicks and that kind of movement.

67
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.080
And he was doing fairly well, um, blocking kicks, coming back, uh,

68
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.040
and trying to wrestle more. But because I, I think they were talking about,

69
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.720
that was one thing that he lacked on the first fight. Not wrestling him enough.

70
00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:19.110
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.060
<v 0>Yeah. Well.</v>

72
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.430
<v 2>What happened Saturday was definitely not the game plan. You know, you could,</v>

73
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.710
you could see it's it was,

74
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.590
it wasn't anything like he sparred and it wasn't anything like he trained,

75
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.430
I think emotion absolutely took.

76
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.950
<v 0>Over. Yeah. So what was their game plan?</v>

77
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.660
<v 1>I think just piece him up, get him, you know, catch him the first round,</v>

78
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:42.740
but actually finish the fight. I think that, that would've been more the right,

79
00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:46.380
but obviously kick him a lot. Right. And just get him to walk into something,

80
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.700
try to wrestle him a little bit in there too. I think,

81
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.140
I think TJ came out really smart as well though.

82
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.540
<v 0>Well, TJ throws himself into the fire too. Yeah, he's not,</v>

83
00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:56.460
he does not play a safe game. Yeah. Oh.

84
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.620
<v 2>He didn't. He didn't on Saturday. And I, and I think that,</v>

85
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.370
I think that he probably a little surprised by how, um,

86
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.930
just by how unsafe Cody was so early mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, I mean,

87
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.290
that exchange at the end. I mean, it's Cody. I mean,

88
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.410
TJ's just blocking and looking and Cody is just going for broken. Right.

89
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:15.650
Everything he's throwing. Yeah.

90
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.170
<v 0>Yeah. And we, when we were watching the replays,</v>

91
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:21.840
you could clearly see the Cody's path was wider.

92
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.960
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it was more strain. Yeah.

93
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.720
And then TJ was more loose and he got there quicker, you know,

94
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.160
and the knock down the first knocked down when he tagged him with the right

95
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:32.560
hand. That was where really where it came from. Yeah.

96
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:33.520
They're both thrown at the same time,

97
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:36.400
but TJ was also doing a better job of getting his head offline mm-hmm

98
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.480
&lt;affirmative&gt; and the thing is like TJ's relationship with Dwayne Ludwig.

99
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.430
Very unusual. It's like, those guys are like glue. I mean, they're,

100
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:49.190
they're stuck together. Yeah. And Dwayne is a maniac, you know, you know,

101
00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:50.070
Dwayne. Oh, I.

102
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.270
<v 2>I, I know Dwayne I've known Dwayne a long time. We are friends.</v>

103
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.910
And when we coached against each other that the ultimate fighter,

104
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.710
he literally in the Parkland reminded me that he had the fastest knockout in UFC

105
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:03.900
history because he was. Like he, he,

106
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.340
he's just one of those guys that.

107
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.780
<v 0>Who's about. What? Just because.</v>

108
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.260
<v 2>We were trying to,</v>

109
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.740
he had a training practice that he invited all of Henry's guys to,

110
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.740
but Henry couldn't come. And I was like, well,

111
00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:19.340
I'm gonna have Johnson on come in. And, and Joe, can't come. And he's like, Hey,

112
00:05:19.341 --> 00:05:21.420
listen, I'm gonna whip my Dick out right now. I'm gonna remind you,

113
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:24.290
I got the fastest knockout in GFC history. So you better calm down boy.

114
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.370
And I'm like, well, okay. But, so he's very emotional.

115
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.130
He's very focused and he's very dedicated to TJ.

116
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.290
So I'm agreeing with you on that, but he will go zero like.

117
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.130
<v 0>That. Oh yeah. DNEs crazy as. I, I know DNEs very, very, very well.</v>

118
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.280
But what I'm saying is that what is obsessed? Yeah. With,

119
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.320
with TJ's performance and with TJ's improvement.

120
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:50.120
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; when TJ first beat he and morale. Um,

121
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.480
Dwayne sat down with me.

122
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.200
We sat down and we had lunch together that day and he was just,

123
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.360
and it was a big underdog. I mean, he,

124
00:05:56.361 --> 00:05:59.600
and was thought to be the best pound for pound fighter, if not number one,

125
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:00.760
certainly number two, that.

126
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.400
<v 1>Was, was insane. That was insane when he did that, I was like, Jesus.</v>

127
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.840
<v 0>But also the way he did it, he came out so loose.</v>

128
00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:09.320
Like he was sparring mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he came out like, you know,

129
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:11.680
like did touch gloves. Like he were gonna do a spar session. Yeah.

130
00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:15.440
And it looked like a guy spared with a a hundred rounds. Yeah. It wasn't,

131
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:19.710
there was no tension to him. It was very loose. He really loves that.

132
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.950
He loves it. He's a, he's a rise to the occasion kind of guy TJ is.

133
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.430
And that's one of the reasons why I think he really thrived off this rivalry

134
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.510
with Cody, whereas with Cody,

135
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.390
especially because TJ won the first fight and won it by knockout. Yeah.

136
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:40.380
You know, Cody like had all this tension. Yeah. Whereas TJ had this inner smile,

137
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.700
like through the entire process.

138
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.180
<v 1>Yeah. No, definitely. I definitely agree with you.</v>

139
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:46.100
And I think Cody was definitely,

140
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.900
it seemed like he was a little more emotional of the two mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

141
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.340
and one thing that I,

142
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.740
and we're talking about emotions and fights and everything.

143
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.220
And one thing that I always remember when I get emotional, like even,

144
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.810
and it happens in sparrings sessions and you know,

145
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.250
it might happen in fights and stuff. And I always remember Karen telling me,

146
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.890
you want to be, that's your phone, bro.

147
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.090
<v 0>That's not me. Don't.</v>

148
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.370
<v 3>Tell me, can't be me.</v>

149
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.690
<v 0>How dare you? How dare you shut that piece of.</v>

150
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.930
Now you got Siri going. You don't even know how to use a phone.

151
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.560
And you're one of those dudes. Oh, I know how many film you're one handed it.

152
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.920
Like as if no, one's gonna notice I am I running it outta the way volume.

153
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.000
It's still on &lt;laugh&gt; it's it's dead. I killed it. &lt;laugh&gt; go on gas.

154
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.680
<v 1>On anyways. I always remember.</v>

155
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.000
I always remember Karen telling me,

156
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.230
cuz I will get emotional at times and I let my,

157
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.910
my Peruvian machismo get in the way. And I was, you know,

158
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:45.590
especially like it hap it happened a lot with Kevin.

159
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.830
You know like when Kevin first came to see Kevin Ross,

160
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:52.430
when Kevin first came to CSA, man,

161
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.110
those were &lt;laugh&gt;. I would get beat up a lot.

162
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.980
&lt;laugh&gt; call it tough love. I don't know, know what you wanna call it.

163
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:04.540
But I would, he would sweep me and beat me up and like, ah, well.

164
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.900
<v 0>You want him to give it your bet?</v>

165
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.740
<v 1>And he made me better. He turned me, oh, for,</v>

166
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.180
he turned me into a training partner versus like somebody he had to like,

167
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.180
he didn't baby me at any moment. He, I built, you know,

168
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:19.460
he built me into what I am saying, but became training partners. And,

169
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.690
but one thing that I always remember from Karen is like,

170
00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:24.930
you don't want to be emotional. You want be like a assassin, you know,

171
00:08:24.931 --> 00:08:27.770
you want to be, you want to go in there and be calculator.

172
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.250
You wanna be yourself.

173
00:08:29.251 --> 00:08:31.490
Cause that's when I fight the best without myself and not,

174
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.250
but not have no emotion involved. Do.

175
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.330
<v 0>You have any sort of a pre-fight routine that you go through mentally in order</v>

176
00:08:37.331 --> 00:08:39.930
to get yourself into a state of mind like that? You know? Yeah.

177
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.200
<v 1>Recently since, uh, I, I lost a, I don't know if you watched my,</v>

178
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.320
my last year's fight. My second MMA fight with belt. I got, yes. I saw I got,

179
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.560
I got dropped. I got submitted. You got hit with a wheel kick.

180
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.520
<v 0>With a wheel kick. Yeah.</v>

181
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.040
<v 1>I didn't see it come else. And then you got triangled.</v>

182
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.000
I was going through a lot of the time going through a divorce, you know,

183
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:01.280
very emotional time, uh, of my life last year. And then I had to, you know,

184
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.640
dig deep and rise to the occasion and, you know,

185
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.600
get out of that hole that I was in. Um,

186
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.960
so I started grounding my energy before fights.

187
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.600
I was trying to like trying to visualize and really see myself, you know,

188
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.440
doing the things that I would do because that's,

189
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.550
that's how I got a lot of my knockouts in, in, uh, in lion fight. I could,

190
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.670
it was the weirdest thing I could like, just like visualize and see it.

191
00:09:21.671 --> 00:09:26.470
Like when I knocked out Tyler toner, I saw that happening before the fight even.

192
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.590
And I was like, it felt like a dejavu moment, like, oh. Like I seen this happen.

193
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.740
And I just like tried to like, get us almost I pause.

194
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.780
Can I just remind myself there's another day in the office? And like,

195
00:09:38.781 --> 00:09:42.820
I've had 50, almost 50 fights now. And I just know that it, you know,

196
00:09:42.821 --> 00:09:44.580
regardless of what happens, where I win or lose,

197
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.980
I'm like go out there and give it my best.

198
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.780
But what I try to do is just try to like close my eyes and like, um,

199
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.620
I call it GRA grinding myself.

200
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.290
I visualize like roots coming out of my feet and,

201
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.730
and hands. And I,

202
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.370
I really like ground myself and ground my energy into visualize roots,

203
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.010
like tree roots coming outta. Yeah.

204
00:10:04.011 --> 00:10:06.810
Like tree roots coming outta my hands and coming out my feet.

205
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.330
And I like this last fight was crazy. Actually.

206
00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.530
I could visualize it like going all the way into the ring.

207
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.650
And like once I walked in there, it just felt like home.

208
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.440
<v 0>Oh wow. Crazy.</v>

209
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.240
<v 1>Yeah. And I don't think I told, I even.</v>

210
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.280
<v 0>Told him that, is this something that you read how to do?</v>

211
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.800
Or is this something that someone coached you how to do?

212
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.160
<v 1>Actually, my ex-wife taught me how to do &lt;laugh&gt; funny enough. Uh, yeah.</v>

213
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.640
She taught me how to do that and I, I just, like, I thought I was like,

214
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:35.720
she's bullshitting anyways. I tried it. And did.

215
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.950
<v 0>You tried after you got the horse? Yeah. That's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

216
00:10:38.951 --> 00:10:40.390
Thanks honey. &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;.

217
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.933
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

218
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.230
<v 0>He got the roots and he got the cats.</v>

219
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.110
You call her up and tell you she was right.

220
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.350
<v 1>I did. I, I texted her a while back and I was like, you were right.</v>

221
00:10:48.351 --> 00:10:50.870
Like that works. That's fine. And it's crazy. I,

222
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.870
you know that along with some alpha brain, I go out there and I'm like,

223
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.990
I'm ready to rock and roll. I feel at home.

224
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.980
<v 0>Now what, what I was getting to was that,</v>

225
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:02.100
that relationship between a coach and athlete,

226
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.540
when it works out great. It's so important. And when you don't have that,

227
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:08.700
like, I mean,

228
00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:12.500
there's no disrespect for D to Danny Castillo and Chris Holdsworth who are both

229
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.220
were very good fighters. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I'm, I'm sure a dedicated,

230
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.050
but Dwayne is a different kind of thing. I mean,

231
00:11:20.051 --> 00:11:24.810
he obsesses on various techniques and improvements and footworks and how to

232
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:29.770
change things and how to, how to set things up. He's he's all day 24, 7.

233
00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:31.010
He never shuts off. Yeah.

234
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:36.090
And the kind of relationship that Dwayne has with TJ is so rare

235
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.320
and so beneficial mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but that the chronic relationship,

236
00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:44.040
you guys have this kind of really tight bond between coach and fighter

237
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.040
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it.

238
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.720
If it's there's you can win without it mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but when you have

239
00:11:49.721 --> 00:11:52.680
it, it is just, it's so powerful. It's so powerful. It's so powerful.
