00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now,</v>

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.800
this thing that you did when you walked across Antarctica, um,

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.900
very impressive, incredible,

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.550
but I'm sure you've seen the national geographic article about you.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.310
And they said that there was another man from,

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.070
was it Norway that had done it already?

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.730
That wasn't the first time someone had gone across Antarctica.

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.270
He had gone actually a further distance. Yeah.

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.250
<v 1>So something I've been talking about super openly, including in my book,</v>

10
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:35.210
which is a net to your article, you know, it's a little bit unfortunate. Um,

11
00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:39.080
I actually just published a 16 page letter, um, um,

12
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.930
asking NatGeo to retract the entire article.

13
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:45.290
And the reason it's 16 pages is unfortunately the entire article they wrote is

14
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:49.850
just so riddled with inaccuracies and kind of misrepresentations and omissions,

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.790
um, that, you know, we had to kind of ask them, say, Hey, look, you know,

16
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.550
you kinda got this wrong. I was never properly interviewed for it.

17
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:57.710
But one of the things you're talking about, this guy, Borg, Auslan,

18
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.390
this Norwegian guy, absolute freaking legend. So what this guy did,

19
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.130
um, in 1996, so, you know, 20, some years before that, I attempted my crossing,

20
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.020
his, he crossed Antarctica, um, from the edge of the coastline,

21
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.390
crossed the ice shelf all the way across the landmass,

22
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.900
across the other ice shelf, um, roughly 1800 miles.

23
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
And what he used to propel himself was he used the kite, um,

24
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.160
for a good portion of the time. And it's an absolute extraordinary project.

25
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:27.860
And what's really weird about sort of this national geographic article.

26
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:30.920
A number of senses is one of the premises of it was saying, you know,

27
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.840
Colin never talked about Borg Auslan.

28
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.360
Like he never talked about him in his book. He never mentioned it.

29
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.340
He never this and in my book,

30
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.100
which is really bizarre and why we're asking for a retraction,

31
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:42.950
cause it's just really ineffectual was that, you know,

32
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:47.220
here I am on page 49 of my book, literally it says the Norwegian adventure,

33
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.930
Borgen Auslan in many ways define the terrain of astonishing modern Antarctic

34
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.930
feats becoming the first person across Antarctica solo.

35
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.880
When you traveled 1800 miles in 63 days from 19 96, 9 97,

36
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.370
not only did he cross the entire landmass of Antarctica,

37
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.970
but he also crossed the full Ron and Ross ice shelf from the ocean's edge.

38
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.720
Allison's expedition has deeply inspired me and it was unsupported any hauled,

39
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:11.510
all of his food and fuels with no resupplies. So it was weird.

40
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:13.760
It was like the journalist like wrote this article,

41
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.510
read my book and I had done,

42
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.300
I don't know a lot of there's a lot of speculation. Um,

43
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.780
I had did this big project in the film project around the row is with discovery.

44
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.110
I don't know if it was coming out discovery or whatever, but it's,

45
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.001
it's really bizarre. We,

46
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:30.260
we could talk about all the different kind of fine points of that,

47
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:32.900
but the big distinction and like, I'll say it I've said it,

48
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.660
shout it from the route rooftops, but I'll say it here again.

49
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.370
Borga Auslan is absolutely incredible. Like I'm an of the guy,

50
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:43.910
what he did in 96 is phenomenal. That's why I write about it in my book.

51
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.440
That's why I've written about it on my social.

52
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:48.650
The day after I finished my crossing, I wrote about it on there as well.

53
00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:50.420
And I said, wow, so many people have inspired me.

54
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:53.320
I'm standing on the shoulders of giants. The only way I was able to do this.

55
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.740
<v 0>This has impossible first. Right? So he did it first. Right?</v>

56
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.880
<v 1>So the difference is,</v>

57
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.530
is there's kind of two really specific distinctions in the world of polar travel

58
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.080
there's unsupported, which means not using,

59
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.030
I'm not using a guy getting, sorry, not getting resupplied with food or fuel.

60
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:14.050
Like I was talking about with the food and then there's unassisted,

61
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.520
which means not using anything to propel you other than your own body.

62
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.990
So that's called human powered alone. So what he did is considered assisted,

63
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.680
um, in that he used a kite, but he was able to go twice the distance of me,

64
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.440
which is amazing. So he cried. How.

65
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.610
<v 0>Often did he use the kite?</v>

66
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.990
Because what I had read that he had only used the kite and a few instances where

67
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:35.550
the wind was, right? So.

68
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.880
<v 1>That's another one of the things that the national geographic article, um,</v>

69
00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:40.140
unfortunately got wrong.

70
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.560
And in my 16 page letter that anyone can read it's on my website,

71
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.280
calling a braided.com/blog letter to not geo where it's linked to my Instagram.

72
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.700
Um, it's not like a, he said, he said thing where I'm like, oh, Hey,

73
00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:51.534
this got wrong.

74
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.230
It's just actually a really kind of documented in source document that has links

75
00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:56.640
to everything. Um,

76
00:03:56.641 --> 00:03:59.700
and one of the links that shows his actually his entire kind of project

77
00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:03.000
afterwards in the aftermath of him talking about it, including talking about,

78
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.030
um, with para wing, which was the, one of his sponsors,

79
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:07.920
the guys who actually built a manufactured, the kite.

80
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:10.980
And they're talking about how he used it for about at least a third of his

81
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:15.180
journey, six, 600 or so miles. Um, as well as, you know,

82
00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:19.740
he was able to use the kite going 125 miles in a single day. Um, which is,

83
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.030
like I said, it's amazing.

84
00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:23.490
It's really incredible what he did in the time that he did it.

85
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.020
It's just really kind of an apples and oranges comparison when it comes to polar

86
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:30.720
travel and the distinctions of that, um.

87
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.250
<v 0>Further, but he used some assistance. Yeah. So there's.</v>

88
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.860
<v 1>Basically these different distinctions in the world of polar travel.</v>

89
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.020
And that's another one of the things again, um,

90
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.620
I'm not sure how they got this wrong. I, uh, in,

91
00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:44.010
in the link on the 16 page thing,

92
00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:46.050
I showed the text message when the journalists asked me, well,

93
00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:49.380
tell me about these definitions of unsupported and unassisted. Um,

94
00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:52.500
and I sent him the link and there's these links it's kind of published thing on

95
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:54.790
this website called Antarctica logistics, um,

96
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.260
and expeditions the main sort of expedition, um, facilitator,

97
00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:00.780
the person who like runs logistics down there. It's very clear.

98
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.480
Unsupported means no use of resupplies on assisted means no use of kites or

99
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.610
dogs. And so the thing that I did solo, um,

100
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.750
that people I guess have gotten somewhat confused about at first was I was the

101
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:15.510
first person to cross the land. Massive Antarctica,

102
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.880
solo unsupported, no Risa pies and unassisted, no kites.

103
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.860
What Borg Auslan did is he was the first person to cross Antarctica,

104
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.830
not just the landmass, but also the ice shelf.

105
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:32.010
So there's frozen ocean on these ice shelves. Um,

106
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.150
so from the coast cross the ice shelf across the landmass and across the other

107
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:37.560
ice shelf. And no one yet,

108
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.490
including myself has ever done a solo unsupported,

109
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.350
unassisted crossing of both the landmass and the ice shelves.

110
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.390
I hope someone does it, man. It'll be amazing.

111
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:51.810
I had 375 pounds sled and I almost ran out of food at the end,

112
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.440
crossing the landmass. Um, and, uh, if, uh,

113
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.100
you'd need maybe a 600 pound or something like that,

114
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:00.800
or maybe more optimized food solution that no one's thought of yet,

115
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.030
but hasn't been done yet. How big was Auslan sled? Similar size to me.

116
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.900
So he was out there for, I think he was out there for 63 days roughly.

117
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:13.420
I was out there for 54 days. So we were not out there a lot different. Oh.

118
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.740
<v 0>Okay. So the sled really did make a big difference that if he's going that much</v>

119
00:06:17.741 --> 00:06:21.390
further than you. Exactly. Exactly. Okay. So,

120
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.060
so one more time you were out there. How many days? I was out there 54 days.

121
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.700
<v 2>And he was out there 63 days. Okay. That's not that.</v>

122
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.380
<v 1>Right. And so he, like I said,</v>

123
00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:31.810
on some of the days he talks about it openly that he went,

124
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.180
he does it in kilometers, but if you calculate back to miles,

125
00:06:34.181 --> 00:06:38.680
like 125 miles in a 15 hour period of time, that's unfathomable,

126
00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:40.990
just walking, pulling a sled, they're just two different things.

127
00:06:40.991 --> 00:06:44.320
It's like the difference between sailing across an ocean and rowing a boat

128
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:45.910
across the ocean. Do you think national.

129
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.500
<v 0>Geographic got that wrong then? Because the way they wrote it, it was, you know,</v>

130
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.150
they made it look like you're just a fame. And that, you know,

131
00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:59.920
there was a bunch of other explorers and outdoors people that were in support of

132
00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:02.410
the fact that Auslan was the only one, the first one to do it.

133
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.760
They didn't make this distinction. And they actually made it seem as if this,

134
00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:09.040
the sled was an ingenious solution,

135
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.840
but it seems like that was a planned thing. And that was an engineered thing.

136
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.050
And that it wasn't something that he built up on the fly.

137
00:07:17.051 --> 00:07:21.340
This was the method that they use to help him get across the state. No, totally.

138
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.740
<v 1>And like I said, if you look in the letter that I wrote,</v>

139
00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:25.750
it's got links to the actual, the manufacturer,

140
00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:28.510
they kind of talk about it as being this elegant solution is like,

141
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.260
you put a kite up randomly, Hey, I got an idea,

142
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.900
but it's like a fully manufactured thing. It's a legit kite. And like I said,

143
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.250
this is not me knocking on that.

144
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:38.950
I actually think that project it's one of the project that inspired me the most

145
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:41.920
to do what I did. It is amazing. It sounds. Can we.

146
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.370
<v 0>See what Auslan does? Is there any photograph of Iceland's kite?</v>

147
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.950
I want to see what it looks like. Yeah.

148
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.670
It's whenever someone does something extraordinary,

149
00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:56.350
like there's no doubt just what you did. 50, how many days again? 54 days alone.

150
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.820
crazy. It's crazy for anybody to on that is nuts. So,

151
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.890
and you're the first one that's ever done it,

152
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:06.220
just pulling that thing and you showed us what it was like last time you were

153
00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:09.160
here. Totally. And some of the areas where you had to pull it,

154
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:12.940
it seems like an insane physical. Totally.

155
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.200
<v 1>I mean, so yeah, it was, uh,</v>

156
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.140
it definitely tested me to the edges of my potential.

157
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:19.330
There was many times that it felt impossible.

158
00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:20.800
I think we talked about it last time,

159
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:24.040
but the second chapter of my book is called frozen tears because on the first

160
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:27.130
hour trying to pull my sled through, into 75 pounds,

161
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.000
fully loaded a food and fuel, I started crying. Like I literally started crying.

162
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.570
The tears are freezing in my face is the all type pathetic feeling. I mean,

163
00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:37.510
it was really, really brutal and really challenging. And you,

164
00:08:37.511 --> 00:08:40.360
one of the things for sure, in the national geographic article, they're not,

165
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.830
they're not disputing that I did this.

166
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.130
There's not like they're saying you didn't walk 932 miles by herself across the

167
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:45.964
Antarctica.

168
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.540
<v 0>Grudgingly gave you credit for doing something really freaky.</v>

169
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.860
They also didn't mention the difference between the time it took you to travel

170
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:57.960
that and the time it took Auslan to travel a far greater distance or that he

171
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:00.750
used that kite to go more than a hundred miles in a day. Yeah.

172
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.860
Those are pretty big important.

173
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.160
<v 1>Totally. And I think that, yeah, uh,</v>

174
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.540
hopefully you can pull up a picture of the Alison cut with the kite. Um, it, uh,

175
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.640
it's, it's LinkedIn there finding.

176
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.740
<v 2>His specific there. I find in kites. They're not with Tilly him. Yeah.</v>

177
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.400
There should be. Yeah. We'll.

178
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.280
<v 1>Find it in a second, but you know, it's, uh, like I said,</v>

179
00:09:19.281 --> 00:09:21.590
it's unfortunate thing. Um, you know, I wrote this letter,

180
00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:24.470
the editor of national geographic actually responded to the reviewing it,

181
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:26.150
you know, I think they're going to hopefully do the right thing.

182
00:09:26.151 --> 00:09:30.230
The facts are pretty clear on this one, them, but just explaining it here.

183
00:09:30.231 --> 00:09:31.340
Here it is. Here's the, yeah.

184
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.200
<v 0>Okay. Yeah. That's a big difference. It's a big kite. Yeah.</v>

185
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.120
I'm sure that has a lot of power behind it too.

186
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.620
And I bet that really helped him. Totally. And she can ski with those things,

187
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.390
like the fact that he's got skis on and he's getting

188
00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:50.810
pulled by that kite. I mean, you're gliding. Yeah.

189
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.540
You're not propelling yourself. They're both really cool.

190
00:09:53.541 --> 00:09:56.180
Things are just different that Jamie going back to that, look,

191
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.430
he doesn't have poles in his hands. No.

192
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.650
<v 1>He's just holding onto the kite being pulled along by it.</v>

193
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.680
<v 0>So he's probably strapped that kite. Yeah. It's.</v>

194
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.470
<v 1>Like, if you imagine like a kite board, like a kiteboarding on the water,</v>

195
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:06.770
something.

196
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.460
<v 0>Like that, strapped at the waist he's holding on to that, that kite,</v>

197
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.180
but it's pulling him while he's on skis. Yes.

198
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.630
Whereas what you did was pull with trekking pole.

199
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.470
<v 1>Yeah. Trekking poles and, uh, you know, cross country skis with skins,</v>

200
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:23.930
but just to give me tracks. So I didn't sink too deep in the snow,

201
00:10:23.931 --> 00:10:26.480
but I'm just walking basically just pulling it with my own body.

202
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.590
<v 0>He's not doing that. That's a different thing. I'm sure.</v>

203
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.600
I'm sure there was times where he had to walk, right?

204
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.290
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. He man hauled for parts of it as well, like a significant distance.</v>

205
00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:38.210
But a lot of it, when the wind was with him, you know,

206
00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:39.710
he put up his kite and pulled along and.

207
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.190
<v 0>That he was able to go more than a hundred miles in a day. Makes me go,</v>

208
00:10:43.191 --> 00:10:47.240
wait a minute. What? Yeah, come on. That's a different thing.

209
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.940
Totally different thing. That's a different thing.

210
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.780
National geographic to not recognize that,

211
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:55.130
that that's a different thing that he can go on the snow pulling 300 pounds,

212
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.320
more than a hundred miles at a hundred. And how many.

213
00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.730
<v 1>He went 125 and one time in 15 hours. ridiculous. Yeah.</v>

214
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.390
That's it totally different thing. Completely. Completely national.

215
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.990
<v 0>Geographic. Jesus Christ. Yeah. I mean they should,</v>

216
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.970
they should have been really clear about that.

217
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.450
Cause they were trying to make it out like some elegant solution that he

218
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.980
casually use, not big deal,

219
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.460
but what he really did was it made what he did was amazing.

220
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.410
<v 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>

221
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.760
<v 0>What we just saw in that image of him getting polled by that giant</v>

222
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.190
kite on skis,

223
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.520
strapped to this harness with all the weight behind him,

224
00:11:31.521 --> 00:11:35.060
also being pulled by that giant kite, that's a different thing.

225
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.440
124 miles in a day pulling 300 plus pounds,

226
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.490
get the outta here. It's hard to walk hundred and 24 miles in a day.

227
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.110
Let alone got nothing on your bed.

228
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:50.450
Zach bidder who holds the American world record for the fastest 24

229
00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:51.500
hours ever run,

230
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.930
ran it full clip at 11 hours,

231
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:57.280
he ran a hundred miles. Wow.

232
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:02.200
So 124 miles in 15 minutes while dragging hours,

233
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.100
hundreds of pounds or 50 minutes, I'd say 15 minutes, 15 hours,

234
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.050
124 miles while dragging hundreds of pounds of

235
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.740
gear all in 15 hours is insane.

236
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.090
That's insane.

237
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:21.430
If Zach bidder can run a hundred miles in 11 hours and break

238
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:26.140
a world record or set a world record or American record American record.

239
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.150
Yeah. That's a crazy record. Yeah. A hundred miles in 11 hours.

240
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.410
It's crazy running.

241
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.540
And that guy did 124 with hundreds of pounds of gear in a sled and 15 hours.

242
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.990
Exactly. That's a different thing. It's two different things, man.

243
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.010
And so road record correction. Yeah. Zach, I want to go back. Yeah. Zach,

244
00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:44.844
when the

245
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.080
American record first and then he broke the world record in his latest attempt.

246
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.380
Zach bitter is a monster. Yeah. Shout out to Zach. Um,

247
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.970
but him being able to do that running is

248
00:12:56.971 --> 00:12:57.541
incredible.

249
00:12:57.541 --> 00:13:02.340
That guy being able to go further in just four

250
00:13:02.341 --> 00:13:06.570
hours longer pulling hundreds of pounds of gear, come on,

251
00:13:06.571 --> 00:13:09.570
national geographic. They're just two different. That's a different,

252
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:12.270
and it's not unimpressive. It's incredibly impressive. And that guy has

253
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.370
steel resolve to be able to do that and get all the way across the ice shelves

254
00:13:17.371 --> 00:13:19.770
and all that that he had to do. Absolutely.

255
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.290
<v 1>And I mean, the biggest thing for me is unfortunately,</v>

256
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.640
that was portrayed in a certain way.

257
00:13:23.641 --> 00:13:26.070
I don't know if it wasn't fact-checked or what that, but like for me,

258
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.570
the whole purpose of any of this,

259
00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:30.240
the whole purpose of writing the book and sharing it with the world and being

260
00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:32.850
on, you know, talking to people, you know, few of your podcasts or whatever,

261
00:13:32.851 --> 00:13:36.450
like my whole goal is to inspire other people to step outside of their comfort

262
00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:40.200
zones, do things in their life, challenge themselves. Like this is not about me.

263
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.970
It's not, not, not just in the best, maybe.

264
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.020
<v 4>A little bit about you. You wrote a book. I like it. I have you in the book. No,</v>

265
00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:47.940
I have not really. No that surprises me.

266
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.430
<v 0>I started writing a book at one point in time, but I had, uh,</v>

267
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.990
I had a deal with a book publisher and the notes were so brutal.

268
00:13:54.991 --> 00:13:55.920
I gave him the money back.

269
00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.440
<v 5>They didn't like it. They wanted me.</v>

270
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.750
<v 0>To write essentially the way I write,</v>

271
00:14:00.751 --> 00:14:04.050
stand up and want to need it to be like set up punchline, set up punchline.

272
00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:07.170
I was like, this is not how you're right. Things guys.

273
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.090
Like they wanted the intonation of the voice and they actually wanted to take my

274
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.860
standup. They offered to just take my stand-up and transcribe it into a book.

275
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.350
And I said, I'd never do that. And they're like, well, George Carlin did it.

276
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:23.970
I go it's because he owed the IRS a billion dollars. Come on, man. George,

277
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.280
if you asked George was a good idea, but he would say, no, you know,

278
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.810
he needed money. George Carlin was like deep in the hole with the IRS.

279
00:14:30.811 --> 00:14:32.790
He did a lot of things. I'm sure he didn't want to do. Yeah.

280
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.030
But that doesn't mean it's a good idea to write it. Well, I'll.

281
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.030
<v 1>Tell you, I have walked across the land mass of America by myself.</v>

282
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.220
I've wrote a boat, I've done some other crazy in my life,

283
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.690
but the hardest thing I've ever done is write.

284
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.220
<v 5>A book. Yes, man.</v>

285
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.240
<v 1>It really was. You know, I'm, I'm proud of, I'm proud of the outcome. You know,</v>

286
00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:50.250
I really poured my heart and soul into it, but it was challenged.

287
00:14:50.251 --> 00:14:53.090
I've been journaling since was a little kid like since I was 12 years old.

288
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:55.940
So going back through all my journals and thinking about, you know,

289
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:59.600
there's the Antarctica piece of this, but at the subtitles, from fire to ice.

290
00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:02.180
So I talk about, you know, being burned in this fire in Thailand being told,

291
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:05.060
I would never walk again. Normally we go and throw all these pieces of my life.

292
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.660
But one of the things that happened when I was in an article,

293
00:15:07.661 --> 00:15:09.280
which it was interesting to me,

294
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.670
maybe you'll find it interesting is as I was out there by myself in this empty

295
00:15:13.671 --> 00:15:17.450
white landscape, 24 hours a day light, endless white nothingness,

296
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.420
my mind started filling in with all of these memories.

297
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.140
So I deleted almost all my music. I'm in silence. I'm a full solitude. And like,

298
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:27.200
if I said to you, Hey Joe, remember the day you graduated from high school.

299
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.910
And like, someone's going to pop in your mind right now.

300
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:31.040
We're going to keep talking and you're going to move on from that.

301
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.770
But when I was walking out there by myself, someone would pop my head like, Hey,

302
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:34.071
Colin,

303
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:36.710
remember that your first swim race when you were a little kid and all of a

304
00:15:36.711 --> 00:15:38.150
sudden, like, I'd be back there.

305
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:41.630
Like I could like dive in and I could see my mom on the edge of the pool deck

306
00:15:41.631 --> 00:15:43.910
and this, you know, the winds blowing across my face.

307
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:46.730
And I can see the kid next to me and I can taste the chlorine in my mouth.

308
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.230
I mean, visceral memories,

309
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:53.180
like a lucid dream were coming back to me throughout for weeks and weeks

310
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:56.780
and weeks at a time. So the book itself, it reads about Antarctica,

311
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.140
but it intersperses the way my experience wasn't Antarctica,

312
00:16:00.141 --> 00:16:03.960
which was actually going back in through my life and this kind of tapestry of

313
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.680
more visceral memories and flashbacks,

314
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.010
other expeditions in childhood and the ups and downs in my personal life.

315
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:13.160
And kind of all of these things kind of conspiring into one, but it was,

316
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.580
it was wild to go deep into the brain like that. I'm sure.

317
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:16.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

318
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.320
We should probably point out we've had a podcast before in this podcast that we

319
00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:24.970
did before was right after you got back from this journey in Antarctica and you

320
00:16:24.971 --> 00:16:26.650
described the whole thing in Thailand,

321
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.980
you'd start getting burned and how you never thought you were gonna walk again

322
00:16:29.981 --> 00:16:33.070
and yeah. All that stuff. So we should tell people, so stop. Right. Pause,

323
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.420
go back, come back here again. Um, what did,

324
00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:40.240
did it upset you when the national geographic article came out? Like,

325
00:16:40.241 --> 00:16:43.210
what did you see? Like, well, they just got it wrong. Let me,

326
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.760
let me straighten them out. You know, it's.

327
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.960
<v 1>One of those things. Um,</v>

328
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.690
I'd be curious to hear your perspective on kind of media and stuff like this.

329
00:16:49.691 --> 00:16:52.720
You've been around, you know, doing type of stuff like me more longer than me,

330
00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:57.010
but it, you know, it hurt my feelings obviously. And I was kind of just,

331
00:16:57.011 --> 00:17:00.730
it was bizarre because it was so factually inaccurate and national geographic is

332
00:17:00.731 --> 00:17:01.600
a, you know,

333
00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:04.810
a magazine or an outlet that I've looked up to throughout my entire life.

334
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.130
It's just like a really beautiful, um, platform. And so I was just surprised.

335
00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:12.250
I was surprised that I was never asked for a proper long form interview of this.

336
00:17:12.251 --> 00:17:15.220
I was surprised that I was never contacted by a proper fact checker.

337
00:17:15.221 --> 00:17:18.550
There was just some things that were just like weird, not a place. And you know,

338
00:17:18.551 --> 00:17:20.140
I guess it was a freelancer. I don't, again,

339
00:17:20.141 --> 00:17:23.290
I don't know the whole story behind it. Um, but uh.

340
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.460
<v 0>If I had to guess, look,</v>

341
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:29.290
there's very little in like praising people.

342
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.300
There's a whole lot and taking people down. Yeah.

343
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.330
If they could find that you did something that you, uh,

344
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.140
did something incorrect or you lied about something or exaggerated about

345
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.870
something, I mean, they made you out to be a liar. I mean,

346
00:17:40.871 --> 00:17:44.380
I read it and I was like, wow, like they're, they're saying he's a liar.

347
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.830
They're saying how much of it is fiction? Yeah. Literally said fiction.

348
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.190
But how much of could be fiction if you,

349
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:55.400
really did walk before days? Not only that, the.

350
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.260
<v 1>Kind of weird parts about it is not only that,</v>

351
00:17:57.261 --> 00:18:01.340
but I also had a GPS on me the entire time. It was completely transparent.

352
00:18:01.341 --> 00:18:02.510
Every 10th, 10 minutes,

353
00:18:02.511 --> 00:18:06.080
the entire journey we're live for to see the New York times covered it.

354
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.940
They had my GPS tracker up live.

355
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.010
The map of my route is in the first page of my book, let alone online 24 7.

356
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.460
There's been hundreds of articles written about this by outlets who have fact

357
00:18:16.461 --> 00:18:19.010
checked and research or whatever. So for natural to make all those claims,

358
00:18:19.011 --> 00:18:20.480
it's like saying like Collin,

359
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:25.190
somehow tricked every person ever from every news outlet.

360
00:18:25.191 --> 00:18:27.710
That's covered this. In fact, checked it and reported on it.

361
00:18:27.711 --> 00:18:30.410
And editors as a book. And there's some hacked his Jeep. I mean,

362
00:18:30.411 --> 00:18:34.490
it's like a crazy conspiracy, weird like kind of stuff because.

363
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.780
<v 0>Everyone, how do you say his name, Auslan house that Auslan had done it.</v>

364
00:18:38.781 --> 00:18:40.100
Everybody knew that Allison had done it.

365
00:18:40.101 --> 00:18:41.810
Maybe they just didn't understand the details of it.

366
00:18:41.811 --> 00:18:45.890
So they started complaining, Hey, he didn't do it. First Auslan did it first.

367
00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:49.700
And this guy's like, I got a story. So he goes to try to go after you,

368
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.740
but then realizes, oh, it's kind of, he kind of did it first,

369
00:18:54.741 --> 00:18:57.860
but the other guy did it. Well, let's just say that the kite was cool.

370
00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.120
<v 5>They had a cool kite.</v>

371
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.080
<v 1>Even weirder things like in the first paragraph or second paragraph of the</v>

372
00:19:03.081 --> 00:19:04.160
entire article,

373
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.840
he takes a quote from page 50 of my book and a quote from page

374
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.330
214 of my book and puts them in,

375
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.060
parses them together as if they're a single statement. And I'm like,

376
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.910
there are about two completely different things that I'm talking about.

377
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.030
And you're like, dude, that's why people do, man. You.

378
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.880
<v 6>Want to sell dirt? You know? Or he says like.</v>

379
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.490
<v 1>Colin made up this thing about no rescue zones.</v>

380
00:19:25.491 --> 00:19:27.650
No one's ever written about the fact of Inanna.

381
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:31.130
Carney talks about me getting picked up in Antarctica. Like I can call an Uber.

382
00:19:31.131 --> 00:19:34.040
He literally says in there, use a somebody else. Else's quote says, I mean,

383
00:19:34.041 --> 00:19:37.310
getting picked up in Antarctica is like calling an Uber, which is by itself,

384
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.820
just really says that in the article, which is just crazy. That's hilarious.

385
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.550
<v 0>Try getting an Uber in the woods in Montana.</v>

386
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.520
<v 1>I'm like Uber. And then the craziest thing. And again, it's so crazy.</v>

387
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.940
My response to this is just factual. It's it's not, you know, it's,

388
00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:55.280
it's I just try to not be too defensive or anything about it,

389
00:19:55.281 --> 00:19:56.330
but it's just the good.

390
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.420
<v 0>News is this will reach way more people than that. Yeah.</v>

391
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.250
<v 1>But I would say one last thing about it.</v>

392
00:20:01.251 --> 00:20:05.930
The irony of this is if you Google Borg Auslan in 2018,

393
00:20:05.931 --> 00:20:07.940
right after 2019, right after I finished my crossing,

394
00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:10.970
he's interviewed about all of this and in a quote and I linked to this in my,

395
00:20:10.971 --> 00:20:14.450
you know, my letter, it, him saying there are parts of Antarctica,

396
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.980
particularly in the large history zoned,

397
00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:19.610
which is exactly where I was talking about where rescue is impossible. Like he,

398
00:20:19.611 --> 00:20:22.670
the guy who used against me is also quoted saying the other thing,

399
00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:26.600
but then he says, it's like, the whole thing is just, you know, it's crazy.

400
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.050
There's.

401
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.620
<v 0>So much money and on someone. That's, that's what it is. I'm sure.</v>

402
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.830
Trying to keep my head die while I'm sure this guy wrote that articles,

403
00:20:33.831 --> 00:20:38.000
probably a little bit of a hater, you know, probably saw you and like the,

404
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.640
this guy, it's the world we live.

405
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.950
<v 1>In. Unfortunately I try to, you know, keep my head up. Like I said,</v>

406
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:46.370
I wrote this book to inspire other people to step outside of their comfort

407
00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.070
zones, doing, see things too. Right. I.

408
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.230
<v 2>Got paid for it as well. I got, what's also like, what's that like, no,</v>

409
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.090
you definitely don't get paid. You should get paid for.

410
00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:54.720
<v 0>The whole thing.</v>

411
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.280
But the fact that they're trying to diminish what you did.

412
00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:00.960
And when you really did do,

413
00:21:00.961 --> 00:21:05.010
was walk by yourself for 54 days through Antarctica.

414
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.970
And then one of the things he was even saying something about it was on a road

415
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:14.640
and I'm like, Hey, why don't you walk dragon 300 pounds on a road? Like,

416
00:21:14.641 --> 00:21:18.900
does that matter? Everything's covered in snow and ice like road is this,

417
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.400
there's basically this.

418
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.080
<v 1>A 300 mile stretch. It's the last third of my, part of my journey,</v>

419
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.620
which by the way, was on my GPS, which by the way, I talk about my book,

420
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:29.161
which by the way,

421
00:21:29.161 --> 00:21:32.430
I widely acknowledged and it's called the south pole Overland traverse.

422
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.240
And so the south pole station, the U S mill or sorry,

423
00:21:36.241 --> 00:21:39.780
the U S research station that's at the south pole was resupplied, um,

424
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.350
throughout the summer season from the coast. And they drive this kind of, um,

425
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.130
a bunch of tractors, basically up this area called the lever at glacier.

426
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.590
And it's not like a paved road.

427
00:21:49.591 --> 00:21:52.920
This is them driving over ice and snow and neck filling and crevasses along the

428
00:21:52.921 --> 00:21:53.760
way, et cetera.

429
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.490
And there's some tire tracks and some flagging that are out there.

430
00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.080
So first of all, I've traveled,

431
00:21:58.081 --> 00:22:00.750
already traveled almost 600 miles without any of that.

432
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.540
And then as I get there and we know this is part of it,

433
00:22:03.541 --> 00:22:06.330
and I've talked about widely with all the polar experts,

434
00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.840
all of the people that make the classifications and unassisted refer

435
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.430
specifically to kites and dogs.

436
00:22:11.431 --> 00:22:14.940
And they're trying to make this claim that the road somehow, quote, unquote,

437
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:19.620
Eric, big air quotes road, basically some rutted up tracks in the snow. Um,

438
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.690
you know, I'm, I'm out there on a paved road.

439
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.810
There's not a paved road out there. And the thing is Antarctica is so brutal.

440
00:22:24.811 --> 00:22:27.000
We showed some clips last time he's sitting at my tent and 50,

441
00:22:27.001 --> 00:22:30.480
60 mile per hour winds that it was like, yeah, when that blows over,

442
00:22:30.481 --> 00:22:33.750
imagine driving a tractor over snow and then 50, 60 mile an hour winds come in.

443
00:22:33.751 --> 00:22:36.360
What do you think happens? It's blown over immediately.

444
00:22:36.361 --> 00:22:39.000
So I never saw these tractors, never saw these vehicles. I remember I saw,

445
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:43.140
I saw some flags. Of course I saw some rutted tracks, but I linked to it on my,

446
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.273
so it's really.

447
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.520
<v 0>Not much difference in walking on flat ground. No.</v>

448
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.470
<v 1>Not adult and still there's still, this is tricky there.</v>

449
00:22:49.471 --> 00:22:52.800
So there's still huge bumps of snow and all the, a lot of the time it was white.

450
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.530
I was completely whited out. I couldn't see five or 10 feet in front of me.

451
00:22:55.531 --> 00:22:58.380
So it's not like I could, a lot of times these flags that were every a hundred,

452
00:22:58.381 --> 00:23:01.560
400 meters, it's not like I'd even see those. So it's just a shame.

453
00:23:01.561 --> 00:23:05.040
And I've been very transparent about the fact that I used that route.

454
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.180
It was the safest route.

455
00:23:06.181 --> 00:23:08.550
It was the only route the logistic company wanted to support.

456
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:13.470
And it felt completely in the distinctions of what is known as

457
00:23:13.471 --> 00:23:15.660
unassisted. And he kind of makes this claim about,

458
00:23:15.661 --> 00:23:17.640
that's not true where people are rethinking that.

459
00:23:17.641 --> 00:23:19.980
And one of the weird things is they're thinking it, right?

460
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.950
So they're there now because of some of this,

461
00:23:22.951 --> 00:23:25.770
the polar community have gotten together after my project.

462
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:30.060
So my project squarely falls in the definitions as they were followed all of the

463
00:23:30.061 --> 00:23:33.780
rules and all of this. Now, now they're sitting together and they're saying,

464
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.201
you know,

465
00:23:34.201 --> 00:23:38.010
maybe we should rewrite some of these rules or make certain definitions

466
00:23:38.011 --> 00:23:39.960
different, which by the way, if they want to change the rules,

467
00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:43.500
that's totally fine. The problem is it would be like this.

468
00:23:43.501 --> 00:23:46.700
This is with them calling me sort like a liar or something will be equivalent of

469
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:49.850
this. With the major league baseball got together and said, you know what,

470
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.420
all games and baseball are going to be 10 innings now instead of nine innings.

471
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.620
And all of those guys over the last hundred years that played 200 in a thousand

472
00:23:57.621 --> 00:24:00.800
games or whatever who played nine innings, they cheated, they lied.

473
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:03.110
They didn't play the full game. Like they, you know, they're just like,

474
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:04.700
you know, they're there.

475
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.850
If they want to change whatever distinctions or classifications or stuff,

476
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.820
forward-looking great. And what.

477
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.850
<v 0>Would the distinctions be that they would change that you can't do it on a road.</v>

478
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.040
<v 1>So I think they're trying to make it finer grain, which is like,</v>

479
00:24:15.041 --> 00:24:16.810
there would be like a kite distinction.

480
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.050
There would be a no support it's distinction.

481
00:24:20.051 --> 00:24:23.020
There would be a distinction for using, you know, partial of a,

482
00:24:23.021 --> 00:24:25.720
if there was a flagging or this like, you know, road,

483
00:24:25.721 --> 00:24:28.110
which by the way is not a road to be clear, it's snow and ice.

484
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.140
It's like a restaurant. Um, I don't, I don't, there's a,

485
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.083
if.

486
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.350
<v 0>At no point in time, was it like flat ground ice? And yeah.</v>

487
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.800
<v 1>No, we're a tractor. We might see like some wheels. And in fact, Lou, rod,</v>

488
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.080
who's the other guy who I was racing out there in Antarctica.

489
00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.650
He wrote a whole blog post about that's linked to in my letter. And you know,

490
00:24:47.651 --> 00:24:49.930
of course Casey did the exact same thing as me, by the way,

491
00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.290
the exact same thing, same distinction. Um, and, uh, you know,

492
00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:54.430
I finished a couple days ahead of him,

493
00:24:54.431 --> 00:24:56.770
but what he did was absolutely incredible as this is this race.

494
00:24:56.771 --> 00:24:59.530
And we talk a lot about it in the book and a ton of respect for that guy as

495
00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:03.640
well. It, a friend of mine and you know, he, you know, writes about this,

496
00:25:03.641 --> 00:25:06.340
you know, quote unquote road or the south pole Overland traverses,

497
00:25:06.341 --> 00:25:09.160
it's actually known. And he's like, it's rutted up tracks.

498
00:25:09.161 --> 00:25:11.410
Like you couldn't even if in the parts where I saw tire tracks,

499
00:25:11.411 --> 00:25:15.490
it's like actually worse than actually, cause you don't slide across it.

500
00:25:15.491 --> 00:25:18.190
The snow is all, run it up. It's chunked up. It's actually like tripping.

501
00:25:18.191 --> 00:25:19.810
You it's like even worse than hitting.

502
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:23.320
<v 0>On broken ice versus powder. So this journalist and.</v>

503
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:24.700
<v 1>All these other people who are saying this,</v>

504
00:25:24.701 --> 00:25:26.620
this is not like they've been out there before.

505
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.930
<v 0>So it's an attractive thing to say. Part of his journey was actually on a road.</v>

506
00:25:31.931 --> 00:25:32.764
You're like, oh.

507
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.100
<v 5>That guy wrote in an article. Yeah. It sounds.</v>

508
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.390
<v 0>When you say part of it was on a road, it sounds like, like this is the road.</v>

509
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.450
Oh, Christ. That's it. That's the road that,

510
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.800
that ain't really a road, man. That's just flat snow.

511
00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.260
<v 1>Exactly. And that would be like the best case.</v>

512
00:25:50.261 --> 00:25:52.240
Most of the time it's wind blowing across it.

513
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.540
Like that's on the perfect conditions. Perfect. Sunny day, I looked at.

514
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.660
<v 0>It, the left and looked to the right. Like it doesn't make a difference.</v>

515
00:25:58.661 --> 00:26:02.410
It's the same. It's the same. Yeah. That's really deceptive that they,

516
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.890
they wrote that. Yeah, that's really deceptive because they made it seem like,

517
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.680
oh, and then he gets to the highway and he's just walking. It's like, Hey,

518
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:10.960
check it, put my thumb out. Like I'll pick up a bomb.

519
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.170
And he still went 54 days across Antarctica.

520
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.080
And I know they acknowledged that in a small way in the article,

521
00:26:17.081 --> 00:26:21.430
but they really like just that,

522
00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.820
just the description calling that a road like that is,

523
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.270
I mean sort of technically a road, there's no ground mat.

524
00:26:28.271 --> 00:26:31.630
It's just all ice and snow. I don't see the ground. Exactly.

525
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.210
<v 1>And like I said, I was transparent about it. That was my route.</v>

526
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.370
Asked all the people there like, yep. You're within the rules.

527
00:26:36.371 --> 00:26:38.740
You're doing the right thing. No one's ever done this before. And then,

528
00:26:38.741 --> 00:26:39.460
you know.

529
00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.200
<v 0>Everybody's a hater. Yeah.</v>

530
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.490
<v 2>That's the world. You know, the expression. Tell me that.</v>

531
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:45.480
<v 0>Throw crabs in a bucket.</v>

532
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.390
None of them ever get out because when they try to get out the other ones,

533
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:49.470
grab them and drag them down.

534
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.110
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Or pile.</v>

535
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.960
<v 0>On top of each other. The little crabs. Yeah. Get in here with me.</v>

536
00:26:55.830 --> 00:27:00.780
I can't walk 54 days. You can either track onward.

537
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.790
Onward. Onward. Onward is nice, but man, it's really disturbing. Okay.
