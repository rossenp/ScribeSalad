00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.460
<v 1>And we're live a welcome aboard. Jessica Rosenworcel.</v>

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.000
Did I do it? You did it. I was so nervous about that.

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.200
And Eddie Wong of course, has been on the podcast many times.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.120
<v 2>Number one podcast in the world. Oh, thank.</v>

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.953
<v 1>You, Jerry.</v>

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.470
<v 2>Oh brother. How are ya? I'm chilling, man. I'm I'm good. I just, I, you know,</v>

8
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:27.060
I wanted to introduce you to the homie, the commissioner from the FCC,

9
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.390
Jessica Rosenworcel, because think things were,

10
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.130
things are bad for the internet right now.

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.380
<v 1>While you are very concerned. And a lot of people are about net neutrality and,</v>

12
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.830
uh,

13
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.160
we all have some questions about it and we're excited to talk to you about it.

14
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:45.120
So maybe we could, uh, aluminate some of the issues and, and give us, uh,

15
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.740
an understanding or try to, uh, help us understand what's at stake here.

16
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.510
And why are people so concerned?

17
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.831
<v 3>Well,</v>

18
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:56.190
I think people are concerned because the future of the Internet's the future of

19
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:57.270
everything, I mean,

20
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.870
every aspect of our lives is now touched by that connectivity.

21
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.040
And it's a funny thing, but the agency where I work in Washington,

22
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:10.020
the federal communications commission has enormous power and control over

23
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:13.050
our internet experience. And for decades,

24
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:16.110
we've had these policies that have been all about internet openness.

25
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:21.090
And what that means is you can go where you want do what you want online and

26
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:25.770
your broadband provider can't get in the way or prevent you from looking at some

27
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.850
websites or looking at some videos or setting up some businesses.

28
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.570
But that changed last month in Washington,

29
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.090
when the FCC over my objections voted to end net

30
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:42.030
neutrality. And as a result,

31
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.010
all of our broadband providers now have the legal right to block

32
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:50.040
websites, to throttle content,

33
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.740
and to set up sweetheart paid for prioritization deals and

34
00:01:55.741 --> 00:02:00.690
over the long haul that could really change the internet and the web as well.

35
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.790
<v 1>Now, one of the arguments pro net neutrality, um,</v>

36
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.450
one of the arguments for people that were excited about this being signed,

37
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.540
where they were saying that net neutrality was really, uh,

38
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.050
only over the last couple of years and before the last couple of years,

39
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.780
net neutrality, as we know it, the last couple of years,

40
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:22.050
everything was fine and that it will continue to be fine and that people were

41
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:25.200
just panicked. And there was that really bizarre video that,

42
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.470
that one dude made where he was showing that these are all the things you're

43
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.860
going to be able to. Do you work with that cat? I do.

44
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.830
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.830
<v 1>He seems like an odd, odd fellow. Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.090
<v 3>Yeah. Well, uh, he's, uh, he's a smart guy. He's a seasoned lawyer.</v>

47
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:44.880
I think it's fair to say. He, and I see the world a little different.

48
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.440
<v 1>Yeah. So he doesn't see, he sees this through the eyes of big business. Right.</v>

49
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:54.150
He thinks that this is, uh, the free market, let the market decide. And,

50
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.870
um, and that's what the argument, I mean, I've even mark Cuban was, uh,

51
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.450
arguing against it. So I was like, wow, this is stunning.

52
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.430
<v 2>Yeah. Neutral for me.</v>

53
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.670
The net neutrality thing is huge because when I was in law school,

54
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:10.510
I read this one book called fighting for air and it documented like the

55
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:13.960
telecommunications act of 97. It's like boring stuff. Right.

56
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.270
Don't go read the telecommunications act of 97,

57
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:19.720
but like radio mattered to me when we were like growing up with the radio.

58
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:23.740
Like I remember they would actually break records on the radio back in the day,

59
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:26.770
like Fox flux still does it on hot 97 and he'll break records.

60
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:29.440
He broke my boy old Drew's record the other day.

61
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:33.790
But like recently the it's like clear channel. I heart radio.

62
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:37.510
They own all the radio stations and it really sterilized content.

63
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:41.230
And they play the same songs every hour in every city,

64
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.180
almost around the world. And I, when I read that book and I went to law school,

65
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:47.440
I realized I was like, yo,

66
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:52.120
it was because of the deregulation of

67
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:57.040
radio that allowed for all these local independent radio stations in every

68
00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:00.700
city that were repping local culture and state culture,

69
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.920
that kind of eroded. That means of communication. And I was like,

70
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:09.610
this happens to every single industry we have, whether it's radio television,

71
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.000
but now it's coming from the internet. And by deregulating it,

72
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.110
you're going to gut it again. And you know, like when,

73
00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:18.580
when technology started popping in, podcasts came around. I mean,

74
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.870
that's what enabled JRE. And that's why my first place to go is like,

75
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.920
I'm gonna come see Joe,

76
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.020
because you were one of the innovators with this new technology.

77
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.760
<v 1>Well, thanks. But I think, um,</v>

78
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.440
what people are super concerned about is things getting blocked, right?

79
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.870
That's that's like one of the first ones. Yes.

80
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.320
Is that something that we legitimately have to worry about?

81
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.550
<v 3>This is a good question. Here's what I know right now.</v>

82
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.440
Your broadband provider has the technical ability to block content and

83
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:54.274
websites.

84
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.290
It's got the business incentive to block or slow access to some websites.

85
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.870
If they don't have a special commercial relationship with them.

86
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.300
And now the FCC just gave them the legal green. Right. Just go ahead.

87
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.190
And so I feel over time, this is something we need to be concerned about.

88
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.940
And so this open platform that was full of independent, independent voices.

89
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.530
Now you've got this new gatekeeper, your broadband provider,

90
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.820
they've got a lot more power than when they used to, how close was the vote?

91
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.530
It was three, two.

92
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.250
<v 1>And what's the argument for this?</v>

93
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.410
<v 3>Well, that's, that's fair. Um,</v>

94
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.720
I think there's an argument that you want government out of the way deregulation

95
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:41.770
is going to lead to more competition and we'll have, um,

96
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.140
a flourishing of new ideas and content.

97
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:45.880
If we just move government out of the way.

98
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.970
And even if you're sympathetic to that argument,

99
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.130
here's where I think it breaks down. According to the FCCS own data.

100
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.130
Half of the households in this country don't have a choice of broadband

101
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.510
provider. I'm familiar with this.

102
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.410
I'm one of them only have one provider that serves my house. So the thing is,

103
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:07.460
if your broadband provider started blocking your content or throttling your

104
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:11.030
access to some video in a competitive market, you'd pick up,

105
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.680
you take your business somewhere else.

106
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.250
But about half of our households don't even have that opportunity.

107
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.230
So to me,

108
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:23.000
the idea that the competitive market will prevent this behavior just

109
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:23.834
doesn't fly.

110
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.940
<v 1>Yeah. That doesn't seem to make sense.</v>

111
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:27.710
And that's an issue in my neighborhood as well.

112
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:29.630
And a lot of other people I know as well. I mean,

113
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:33.500
I think they make deals where only one company,

114
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.870
whether it's Verizon or whatever has an area.

115
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.710
<v 2>Yeah. They monopolize the areas. They limit the opportunities and choices.</v>

116
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.990
And when they say deregulation, it just anytime they deregulate things and say,

117
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:47.360
Hey, we're going to leave it to the market and have competition.

118
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.840
I think it's impossible to have that when you have a country with such an

119
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:55.370
inequality, income, inequality gap, right. That's the problem is that all right,

120
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:57.710
let's all go compete, Joe. You're not going to start a Verizon.

121
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:59.510
I'm not gonna start a Verizon. You know what I mean?

122
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:01.310
Like we can't compete with these dudes.

123
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.060
And even Comcast can't even compete with Verizon. Like, you know,

124
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.260
these dudes were all getting smashed. So there is not actual competition.

125
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.280
I think deregulation works when you have multiple players and options and that

126
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:17.030
the market actually can come into play, but with the economy,

127
00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:21.170
so top heavy right now, I don't think there is a possibility of competition.

128
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.950
<v 3>Yeah. I mean, listen, competition is the best regulator we know, right.</v>

129
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.970
We want there to be these markets where consumers have lots and lots of choices,

130
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.580
but if competition isn't existing,

131
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.640
you need a little oversight to make sure that every consumer gets a fair.

132
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.451
<v 1>Well,</v>

133
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:38.870
it seems like that's where the real argument lies that if there are monopolies

134
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:41.690
and they seem to be in certain areas with,

135
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.870
in regards to what kind of internet access, you can get,

136
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.720
that if you don't have regulation, then,

137
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.840
then what is going to protect the consumer and what is going to protect free

138
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:52.910
speech. What's going to protect it.

139
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:56.000
Say if you are on Verizon and your system is on Verizon,

140
00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.500
what if you decide to make a podcast that criticizes Verizon and everybody says,

141
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:03.200
you know, Hey Eddie, Wong's got a podcast criticizing us.

142
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:05.240
I want to shut that down. And they can just.

143
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.790
<v 2>I would have been shut down a long time ago. Yeah.</v>

144
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.080
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, not saying that they would do that, but they could.</v>

145
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.190
<v 2>Yeah. And that's.</v>

146
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.143
<v 1>What's scary.</v>

147
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.880
<v 3>And you know, so much of our speech these days,</v>

148
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.730
it doesn't take place in public places.

149
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.600
It takes place on these private platforms. So they have a lot of power.

150
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.770
And we have to think about that as a, as a country in a democracy,

151
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:29.690
how much openness do we want?

152
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.460
And then how do we create a framework in Washington that supports that openness?

153
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:36.770
And that's really, to me, what net neutrality was about.

154
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.630
<v 2>The question I have is right. Let's say, um, the, you know,</v>

155
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:46.910
Vera, let's say a service provider buys Hulu, right. Or the,

156
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.110
or they buy, or they create their own streaming platform called like Zulu,

157
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.300
right? So they start Zulu.

158
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.110
They could start to charge Netflix more money for

159
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:02.370
using their service. They could charge Hulu more money. They could charge,

160
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.230
you know, beats more money, whatever.

161
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.950
So that they have an advantage for their own streaming services.

162
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.970
And in that way they can culturally control content.

163
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.900
<v 3>And you know, you're so right. And what happens is you as a consumer,</v>

164
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:19.080
you just get online and you might not even notice. Right.

165
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.220
You might not even notice they're taking you to the video content that they have

166
00:09:23.221 --> 00:09:25.380
a special pay for relationship with.

167
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.420
I think though the biggest harm is to entrepreneurship. Yeah. Because right now,

168
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:32.670
look, you have a good idea. You got a business,

169
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:37.140
a service you can go online and you can almost instantly have global reach.

170
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.940
That's amazing.

171
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.250
But now you're going to have to figure out is your broadband provider instead

172
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.340
going to shuffle off all your traffic to someone else,

173
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:48.780
who's paying them on the side.

174
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.740
Are you going to have a fair shot to show your wares and your ideas to the

175
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:53.520
world?

176
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.440
<v 2>It's harder because I start thinking like a bad 1% or dude, and I'm like,</v>

177
00:09:58.441 --> 00:09:59.130
all right,

178
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:04.050
if there's no net neutrality and I'm the only person that can service Calabasas,

179
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.510
California, Woodland Hills, California. Well,

180
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.350
I'm going to charge all the other streaming providers more money to use this.

181
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.310
And I'm going to create a competitor and every single one of these sectors.

182
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.760
So you can have an advantage if you have your show with me.

183
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.490
And if you're on the other one, I'm going to disadvantage you.

184
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:21.690
I'm going to tax you basically.

185
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.090
<v 1>Hmm. So right now these are concerns. And, um,</v>

186
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.660
there's nothing that's actually happening yet. Th this,

187
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:33.150
this ruling was just passed. That's right. Um,

188
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:38.130
are there any plans in place for things that we should be concerned with?

189
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:43.170
And is there anything that we can do about this current ruling? Yeah.

190
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.790
<v 3>Yes. There's loads because I'm not giving up in the fight for net neutrality.</v>

191
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:49.020
And I don't want you to either.

192
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.270
We got a few different pathways ahead first in Congress. Right now,

193
00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.150
they are trying to get rid of what just happened at the FCC.

194
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:04.620
They're trying to use this law called the congressional review act that an

195
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:07.740
effect just undid everything that the FCC just did.

196
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.810
So it's a way to wipe out what just happened. And while the odds are long,

197
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.470
there's more than 40 United States senators who have sponsored that law.

198
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.301
And in the house side,

199
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:21.600
there's more than 80 members of the house of representatives.

200
00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:26.220
So there's momentum growing in Congress to take a look at this issue and

201
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:30.060
maybe fix what the FCC did. And if you're sitting out there and thinking,

202
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:33.990
they're not listening to you, we should do is something totally old fashioned.

203
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.310
You should pick up the phone,

204
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.830
call your members of Congress and your representatives,

205
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.700
and let them know you care about this issue because that still today is one of

206
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:45.660
the most powerful ways of conveying your opinion to those who represent.

207
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.700
<v 2>You. When is the vote happening on that?</v>

208
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.170
<v 3>It is not yet scheduled.</v>

209
00:11:49.171 --> 00:11:54.100
I think it's going to happen first in the United States Senate and in the house.

210
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.630
I also think we are going to have litigation.

211
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.560
We've already got a few states attorneys general who want to Sue to overturn

212
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:05.380
this. We've got some big companies, some public interest groups.

213
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.810
So I think it's fair to say, we're going to court.

214
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.630
And then we're also seeing activity in state houses and that we've

215
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:18.280
seen net neutrality legislation introduced in Nebraska, Nevada,

216
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.050
Washington, state, Massachusetts, California, lots of places.

217
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.660
And I'm not sure how that all comes together legally.

218
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:29.740
But what you see is this momentum growing that people are not happy with what

219
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:30.820
Washington just did.

220
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.790
<v 2>The thing that I'm worried about with the state's laws, right?</v>

221
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:37.060
So just to lay it out for the listeners right there, people will, well,

222
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.920
the government will pass the federal law,

223
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.190
but then states have their own rights to regulate certain things.

224
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.310
Let's say we use marijuana laws as an example,

225
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:49.660
because recently a lot of states passed legal marijuana laws. Right.

226
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.430
But then Trump gave people the power to enforce federal laws

227
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.110
about marijuana, more stringently. Right. He was telling the federal government,

228
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:03.820
Hey, enforce our federal marijuana laws. Um, what's really Jeff sessions, right?

229
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.540
Yeah. Yeah. His goon is doing that,

230
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.760
but so how would federalism work if states started to pass their own

231
00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:17.740
net neutrality laws versus the, the, the FCC commissioner Orleans.

232
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.220
<v 3>Those are hard questions. I mean, they go right to the constitution.</v>

233
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:24.010
What's interstate what's within the state's authority,

234
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:29.080
but I'm just standing back and seeing really just a lot of energy on this issue.

235
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:34.120
There's nothing else that I've worked on in Washington where this immediately

236
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.050
state houses decided to put pen to paper and introduce legislation.

237
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.200
And I think that that momentum is what's really exciting here.
