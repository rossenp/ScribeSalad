00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.640
<v 0>Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.600
<v 1>What do you think about this con McGregor fully Mayweather fight.</v>

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.440
<v 2>I mean, it's a spectacle, I guess I'm excited. Uh, I'm excited about it,</v>

4
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:13.760
but I feel like it's gonna be another big notch in, uh,

5
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:17.200
Mayweather's belt and I don't think he needs another one. Like I just,

6
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:19.760
I get a little bit, Ugh. I get a, I,

7
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.750
I respect Floyd Mayweather as a boxer,

8
00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:26.550
but it's not the kind of boxing I get excited about watching. Well,

9
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:28.310
even though I know it's technically, you know.

10
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.910
<v 1>It's gonna be, it's gonna be a boxing match. Yeah, for sure.</v>

11
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.350
It's gonna be an actual 12 round boxing match.

12
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.750
So we're gonna get to see some sort of an athletic competition. Um,

13
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.030
but don't see.

14
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.550
<v 2>Yeah. Sorry. I just don't,</v>

15
00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:45.540
I don't see how McGregor can be better than the best

16
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.860
boxers in the world who have tried. Yeah.

17
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.660
<v 1>He won't be, he won't be better than the best boxers in the world,</v>

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.580
but what he might do, first of all, he is definitely gonna make it exciting.

19
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.660
Yeah. He's gonna, the trash talk is gonna be fun. It's be amazing.

20
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.930
It's gonna be epic. Yeah. It's gonna be a fun spectacle and he has legitimate,

21
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.890
scary one punch power and he's way bigger.

22
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.970
So it's all about whether or not he can hit Mayweather.

23
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.650
<v 2>What are they fighting at one 50.</v>

24
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.530
<v 1>Something? I don't know. That's a good question too.</v>

25
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.650
How much weight does he have to lose?

26
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.530
How much is Floyd gonna make him dehydrate himself? Right? Does he even give a?

27
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.770
Does he even respect his skills enough to make him dehydrate himself?

28
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:25.560
Like he did with Canello cuz he made Canello cut a load to weight. Sure.

29
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.480
I think he made a fight at one 50. Is that correct? Find out what Floyd made,

30
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.040
whether made Canello Alvares fight cuz Canellos a big fellow. Yeah.

31
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.800
I've seen him in person, him getting onto one 50 is a rough, rough suck.

32
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.640
I think that, um, it's.

33
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.950
<v 2>Always scary when you look at these dudes and they just look emaciated it before</v>

34
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.430
the it's terrifying. Like Chaz, I mean, you know, he is a tall guy, so.

35
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.910
<v 1>He's well, one of the worst I ever saw was when Connor made it to 1 45,</v>

36
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.310
we fought Aldo. It was like Jesus Christ.

37
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.430
Like he looks so GA and dried up at the weigh ins and then the next day he looks

38
00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:58.310
like a gorilla.

39
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.300
<v 3>Uh, Canello came in at 1 52 it okay. And this fight is at.</v>

40
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.900
<v 1>1 54. It is at 1 54. That's what they're making it. Interesting. Okay.</v>

41
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.660
Well this also says Connor's not gonna have a hard time making a 1 54.

42
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.020
<v 3>Now this says Canella waiting at.</v>

43
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.860
<v 1>1 68. No, that was his last fight with Chavas junior Chavas junior.</v>

44
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.420
He fought above his weight class actually Chavez junior.

45
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.500
I think it was fighting 1 75. Wasn't he? And he came down. Maybe,

46
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.690
maybe there was a normal wait for Chavez Jr. Oh this was.

47
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.010
<v 3>For the 30 day way in when he fought Mayweather this.</v>

48
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.010
<v 1>So 30 days out. Yeah, a month out he.</v>

49
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.370
<v 3>1 66 0.8.</v>

50
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.730
<v 1>Yeah. Well they had stipulations in the contract,</v>

51
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:40.010
like how big he could be at certain points. Yeah. You know, just stur.

52
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.650
He wanted to dry amount.

53
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.080
<v 2>I mean I'm, what's the uh, what, what are the what's the whole, uh, Cardinal,</v>

54
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.400
I mean, is it, are they gonna have all boxing under cards? Is it.

55
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.400
<v 1>It's a good question. I think be fun to do a little,</v>

56
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.960
the only fight is going to be interesting skill wise. Yeah.

57
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.480
Is if Conner figures out a way to mall him,

58
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.480
he's almost gotta like close the distance quick,

59
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.000
get him up against the ropes and just hit him with like shots while he is

60
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:10.960
holding him. He's almost got to clip him in some sort of weird,

61
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.120
awkward, like my Donna,

62
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.160
like exchange you ever see the fight with my Donna Floyd had, but Floyd, uh,

63
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.270
got clipped by uh, a big overhand. Right?

64
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.390
I think it was at the end of one of the rounds. Like very end of the round,

65
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:24.630
his legs dipped like whoa, a.

66
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.510
<v 2>Little jig, a little, uh, a little wobbly.</v>

67
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.450
<v 1>He got a little dip. Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.790
And it's just because he got MAED it wasn't because skill wise he was

69
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:34.110
commensurate. And then when Floyd came back in the rematch,

70
00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:35.670
he just boxed his face off.

71
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:39.660
Just him up because he just wanted to let him know like, look, dude,

72
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.220
I barely took you serious in that first fight. It got close,

73
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.660
but it only got close cuz like this sloppy bra and then he just put a skill

74
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.740
clinic on him in the second fight. Second fight. Wasn't even close.

75
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.100
I think that that's the only kind, but that's not how Connor normally fights.

76
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:57.460
He's not like a swarming face first brawler type dude.

77
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:59.970
He's the guy who's like cautious about getting hit. Yeah.

78
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.010
<v 2>I I'm. I'm thrilled about it, but I'm also, uh, I, I, I wish I wish I,</v>

79
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.890
I wish I knew more about your side of.

80
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.930
<v 1>The tracks. Well,</v>

81
00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:12.290
we don't know enough about Connor because Connor has never had a professional

82
00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:15.610
boxing match. Right. You know, and the thing is you see a striking,

83
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.290
but you only see a striking when he is working on kicks and wrestling and all

84
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:20.320
that other too. If you.

85
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.200
<v 2>Just kicked him, like, would that, I mean, just to, just to.</v>

86
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.600
<v 1>Do it, just to let 'em know, just to do it, that would be up.</v>

87
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.960
<v 2>It'd be up. But it.</v>

88
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.640
<v 1>Would be hilarious. Well, I think you'd probably,</v>

89
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:33.560
there's probably some stipulations in the contract that say you can't get him in

90
00:04:33.561 --> 00:04:35.600
an arm bar or.

91
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.360
<v 2>Choke him.</v>

92
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.680
I think just kicking him in the head and knocking him out would be worth losing

93
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.430
all the money and getting more money after that. Could you imagine.

94
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.910
<v 1>He would be a folk hero if they got in close?</v>

95
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.150
If they got in close and Floyd was like sucking and juing on the outside and he

96
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.310
threw a jab to cover up or left high kick and that left high kick next,

97
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.510
him just dang. And you see Floyd go limp and he would go limp.

98
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.540
He'd never been high kick like that. Jesus, that would be crazy.

99
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.020
&lt;laugh&gt; because if he didn't know it was coming, yeah,

100
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.580
he could clip 'em with it. Like if he had no idea,

101
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:10.860
if you hid a kick behind a punch, like fighter,

102
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.420
a lot of fighters do they'll like throw a punch, literally cover your face.

103
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.620
So the kick is behind it already. And then boom,

104
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.700
the kick comes like while your vision is already,

105
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.490
you're thinking about the next punch and bang, the kick lands.

106
00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:26.210
And you get Cod happens all the time. If he did that, that would be insane.

107
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.170
Would it be worth it? It would,

108
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:33.650
but it would up everything up cuz no one would ever trust another fighter from

109
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.370
MMA to ever fight a boxer in a boxing match again,

110
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.010
because we've only had the op the opposite happen. Really?

111
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.610
<v 2>Could they, after this,</v>

112
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.320
could they do an MMA fight with the two of them? No,

113
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.880
no.

114
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.760
<v 1>I don't know. Oh my God. It would last 30 seconds. Maximum, really massive.</v>

115
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.680
If Connor wanted to give him an ear beating for 28 minute seconds, look,

116
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.880
Connor's so much better as a wrestler, as a submission artist,

117
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.200
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; as a kicker, there's just no way he'll,

118
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.200
he'll hit him with spinning elbows and.

119
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.560
Like there's things you can't do in a boxing match that you're not expecting.

120
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.800
And if someone's just kicks your legs, once you're gonna be like, oh my God,

121
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.990
what the? Now I'm just trying to think about way to build.

122
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.830
<v 2>More money out of, uh, out of what's going on. I mean, you know,</v>

123
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.430
it's the only way what's gonna come in hundreds and hundreds of millions of

124
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:22.830
dollars.

125
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.630
<v 1>This, this, this is the only way. This is the only way,</v>

126
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.230
but this is a giant big difference though.

127
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.390
Floyd would have to learn how to fight MMA style.

128
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.190
He would have to learn how to stop. Takedowns Uhhuh.

129
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.390
He'd have to learn how to check leg kicks and he'd have to learn how to defend

130
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.660
emissions. And that will take years and he's not gonna do that at 40 years old.

131
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.860
I don't know what he knows. Now,

132
00:06:40.861 --> 00:06:44.740
as far as wrestling defense and what he knows about kickboxing or jujitsu or

133
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.140
anything else, I don't know what he knows, but if he knows nothing,

134
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.780
he's a hundred percent.

135
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.460
100% bet the house on it like Connor might

136
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.140
win a boxing match. I mean, maybe there's like a,

137
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.890
a small percentage chance that he just runs in there and clips Floyd with a big

138
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.490
shot and rocks him and then takes him out. I don't know what that percentage is,

139
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:10.890
but if you ask a boxing expert, there's like 4%, 5%, right?

140
00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:14.210
That's what a boxing expert would say, which I'm not, but I'm an MMA expert.

141
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.930
And if they fought in an MMA fight,

142
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.560
it's 100% that Connor would him up 100%,

143
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.640
no ifs, no S no butts, no chance, no chance.

144
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.320
Cause Connor's gonna be farther away from Mayweather than anyone has ever hit

145
00:07:28.321 --> 00:07:30.360
him. And he is gonna be kicking him in the stomach,

146
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.000
in the legs and he'll soften him up. And the rounds are five minutes long.

147
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.800
And eventually he gets a clinch. And when he gets a clinch, Mayweather is.

148
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.390
He's going to the ground. He's not gonna be able to stop,

149
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.230
but he's gonna get mounted and he's gonna get elbows force fed into his eye,

150
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.990
socket, his nose, his mouth, his jaw,

151
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.230
the sides of his head, his ears. He's gonna get elbowed in the ear.

152
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.830
He's gonna get punches dropped down on him.

153
00:07:55.831 --> 00:07:58.190
When he is totally pinned down and defenseless,

154
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.900
he's gonna have an knee on one of his biceps while this guy's literally on top

155
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:05.660
of him pounding him in the face and he won't be able to get up.

156
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.340
He won't be able to stop the crucifix. He won't be able to stop anything.

157
00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:12.660
He'll be tied up and smashed on the ground until he decides to choke him.

158
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.860
So he is be, he'll be completely defenseless. So in that sense, the,

159
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.850
the odds would be insane if Maya decided in the next two months,

160
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.290
cause the fight's gonna take place in August.

161
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.530
If they decided in the next two months, which by the way.

162
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.450
<v 2>I feel like is soon. Am I wrong? Quick? I feel like it's.</v>

163
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.650
<v 1>Too soon. Very quick. It's very quick. It's not, maybe it's not too soon.</v>

164
00:08:28.651 --> 00:08:30.530
Maybe they've been negotiating for a long time,

165
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:35.490
but at least Connor knows something right about boxing or this could be

166
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.490
a thing. But if they just took it from now and said too, too months from now,

167
00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:41.040
you're gonna have an M and may fight. Holy.

168
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.280
The odds would be a hundred thousand to one.

169
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.000
Like if you ask like any real MMA expert, they'd be like, what? How is he? Oh,

170
00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:51.320
he's a hundred percent. A hundred percent.

171
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.840
And boxing experts think that Mayweather is a hundred percent,

172
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.840
but they'll give him a smile. Slight chance. You never know. It's crazy.

173
00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:00.360
People are throwing punches. You never know.

174
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.800
Cuz Mayweather can throw a punch for sure.

175
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.800
And Connor can throw a punch for sure. Right? Who knows what happens?

176
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.680
Who knows most likely though Mayweather out boxes him,

177
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.600
but you could see con landing something. It could be crazy. It's.

178
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.040
<v 2>He's just the hardest person to, it's not just that.</v>

179
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:16.630
He's the greatest he's he's the hardest person to land a punch against.

180
00:09:16.631 --> 00:09:17.790
That's why I just, yeah.

181
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.630
<v 1>Ever. It just he's the best defensive boxer ever.</v>
