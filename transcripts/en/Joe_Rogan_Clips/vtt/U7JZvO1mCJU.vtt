WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
<v 0>Foster care and all that kinda stuff. And it's been great.</v>

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.040
It's been great talking, talking to everybody.

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.720
And I think that when you have a topic like that too, it helps because they're,

4
00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:11.240
they're not really trying to, to crush you as much when you're, you know,

5
00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:13.920
when you're talking to 'em about kids who need families and homes and that kind

6
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:14.250
of thing.

7
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.160
<v 1>Right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:19.560
They have to be careful with letting their piece of claw out. &lt;laugh&gt;.

9
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.230
Now you said that your experience with adopting three kids started out as a

10
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:28.670
nightmare. Yeah. Like how did it start.

11
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.470
<v 0>Out as a nightmare? Well, it goes into it, uh, you know, you know,</v>

12
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:34.670
you have friends that, that join the military and when they're in high school,

13
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:36.630
they think they're really tough. And they're like, yeah, yeah,

14
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:39.070
it's gonna be awesome. And then they go to boot camp and then they're like, oh,

15
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
this is really hard. And they, then they get on top of it and then they're,

16
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:43.500
and then they're good again, you know,

17
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.980
but they have to go through that transition of like, oh man,

18
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:47.780
maybe I'm not as tough as I thought I was. And then.

19
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.740
<v 1>They get tough. So you never had any kids. I never had any kids had dog,</v>

20
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.900
a dog thing did the dog thing.

21
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:56.860
So you know how to take care of in a very small way.

22
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.260
I had a friend who said that to me, so well, I've had a dog. Oh yeah.

23
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.850
About having a kid. I've heard that a lot.

24
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.970
I'll kill you with a rock &lt;laugh&gt; you better not compare the two that's.

25
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.970
<v 0>So stupid. Yeah. And we, no, we, we went from, you know,</v>

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.050
zero kids and you kinda think, well,

27
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.090
I babysat my sister's kids and that kind of thing thing, and yeah, that's,

28
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:17.924
that's the.

29
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.530
<v 1>A movie question they to a whole movie. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

30
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.000
<v 0>Two hours. And even what happens is you go, so, so for us, we,</v>

31
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.120
we had a really interesting experience where we went to an adoption fair and

32
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:34.000
that's, that's in the movie. It's a real thing where they, because they,

33
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.361
you know, their,

34
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.800
their budgets are stretched so tight that they they'll have these outdoor

35
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:41.840
events. Not every county has 'em, but LA county has. 'em where you,

36
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.070
where they'll bring a bunch of kids that are,

37
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:48.110
that are in the system and a bunch of prospective parents.

38
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.390
And they'll just have like games and stuff going on.

39
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.510
It's a really bizarre event. And we went, you know,

40
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:56.150
and you're there to meet kids, you know, to meet your kids.

41
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.990
And so we went there and we didn't wanna have anything to do with teenagers

42
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:03.580
because not, you know, just because we were scared, we thought we're,

43
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:06.500
we're not ready for that. We just want to find like some little kids,

44
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.900
cute little kid that we can, you know, help out. And, uh,

45
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.580
and then the teenagers are all off to the side because everybody's afraid of 'em

46
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.340
and it's the most heartbreaking thing you've ever seen cuz they know why they're

47
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:20.820
there. Like they chose to be there and they know that everybody's scared of 'em.

48
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.570
Right. So I was there and I was like, oh my God, the worst thing I've ever seen.

49
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.490
And we ended up sort of inadvertently meeting this teenage girl and her brother

50
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.130
and sister and just, they just seemed cool.

51
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.050
And they just seemed like really good kids and just scared, scared, scared.

52
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:40.410
But we wrote 'em down on our sheet and just again, not what we &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

53
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:41.890
What we had planned on when we did this,

54
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.730
but we wrote 'em down on our sheet and we went home.

55
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.560
They were gonna match us with them cuz no one else was gonna put 'em down and

56
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.400
we, we get home and we find out, yes,

57
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:52.880
you've been matched with these kids and we're like, okay, here we go.

58
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:57.040
We're gonna have, you know, we're gonna have a teenager. Uh, they were 16,

59
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.200
13 and 11. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; whoa. So, so we're, we're,

60
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.840
you know, kind of wrapping our heads around this over the next couple weeks.

61
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.760
And we, we got to a place where we were like, okay, you know, we can do this.

62
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.600
And then we got a call from the social worker and she said, you know, um, it's,

63
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:14.440
it's not gonna work out with them. The, uh,

64
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.240
they've been in the system for four years,

65
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.910
the girl she's really holding out hope that her mom is coming for her.

66
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.230
So she's refusing the placement. And so we tried to,

67
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.630
and, and I was like, I was, you know,

68
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:32.430
when you hear that it's so just the same reaction you guys just had.

69
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.910
So my wife and I wrote an, a letter to send through the,

70
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.180
the social workers, just saying, Hey, we get it. If you,

71
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:44.100
maybe you guys just want to come and just do the foster thing or, you know,

72
00:03:44.101 --> 00:03:47.420
however you want to do it. And we, we, we just sort of sent the letter off.

73
00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:49.860
We didn't hear anything. And then she came back and she just said, yeah,

74
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:52.860
it's not gonna happen. And then she very matter of factly just said,

75
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:54.060
but there's these other three kids.

76
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.980
And those kids are my kids now who I love more than anything in the world.

77
00:03:58.981 --> 00:03:59.340
Really.

78
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.290
<v 2>And that's how in that conversation, like.</v>

79
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.970
<v 0>No, there's these other three kids. And we were like, oh, oh, alright. And you,</v>

80
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.370
you want there to be, or I shouldn't say you, I mean,

81
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.450
I wanted there to be a certain amount of randomness. Like when you have,

82
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.250
you know, biological kids, you don't know what you're gonna get. Yeah.

83
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.050
And go into that, that event where you're sort of like meeting kids and it,

84
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.040
it feels weird. And so when she said there's these other three kids, we said,

85
00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:24.640
okay. And then they turned out to be younger, you know, six,

86
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:26.680
three and 18 months. Um,

87
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.360
but I never forgot meeting that, that girl and her brother and sister.

88
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.200
So when the, when the time came that we were gonna make a movie about it,

89
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.360
I really, that was the Genesis of the Lizzy character was right. Mm.

90
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.310
I wanted to make sure there was a teenager in this movie because they they're so

91
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:43.790
misunderstood. And in the process,

92
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.750
I went out and met with a bunch of families that had adopted teen girls and then

93
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.230
met with a lot of those girls who,

94
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:53.110
some of whom are grown up and some of whom are still, you know, uh,

95
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:57.190
with their families. And, and this is the thing, you know, the,

96
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.910
the scariness that we're all talking about,

97
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.860
everyone of these families that I met with just great stories, like amazing,

98
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.260
great stories, like hard times, you know, trying,

99
00:05:06.261 --> 00:05:08.780
trying to make that connection and whatever. But,

100
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.300
but everybody with the same story wouldn't have it any other way changed our

101
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:17.100
life for the better met these incredible kids. And, uh,

102
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.810
this is yeah. And now I'm yamering, but no, you're not making camera.

103
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.610
<v 1>At all. How, how old are they now? How many years.</v>

104
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.610
<v 0>Have you had them? Uh, almost seven years. So my son, Johnny just turned 13.</v>

105
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.450
Wow. My daughter's nine and my, my other son is eight. And, um, how, how.

106
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.010
<v 2>Long was it between the phone call of like I had these other three kids and you</v>

107
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.890
actually getting them in your house? Um.

108
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.010
<v 0>God, what was it? It,</v>

109
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.040
it was a couple of weeks because there was a couple of weeks, that's it? Yeah.

110
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.680
No, it wasn't long at all. Whoa. But, uh, yeah,

111
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:52.160
it was cuz cuz they called and they said we have these other three kids and

112
00:05:52.161 --> 00:05:55.080
then, uh, and then there was gonna be a meeting because they, they,

113
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.960
they won't tell you much about the kids until,

114
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.200
until they really sit down with you and then they kind of walk through like

115
00:06:02.201 --> 00:06:05.440
here's, you know, whatever trauma, here's, whatever, you know, kind of, so,

116
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.600
and again, they don't for,

117
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.280
in our case they don't have all the information obviously on their past.

118
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.400
So they can kind of tell you, like here's how they came into this,

119
00:06:12.401 --> 00:06:13.600
what they system and that, that kind of thing.

120
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.070
So I wasn't able to go because I was, I was,

121
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.710
I was at a work thing and so my wife went to the meeting and I was like

122
00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:21.950
listening to it, you know?

123
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.430
And I was on speaker phone in the meeting and uh &lt;laugh&gt; and there was this one

124
00:06:26.431 --> 00:06:26.951
moment, you know,

125
00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:30.070
and she's telling us everything and there's this one moment where she slides the

126
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:32.910
picture across to my wife. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; says here's a picture of them.

127
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.420
And there's this long pause and my wife goes, oh, are cute.

128
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.740
But &lt;laugh&gt;, they didn't sound cute by the inflection in their voice.

129
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.541
And you know, you're,

130
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.820
you're trying not to be you're you're trying not to be that guy, you know,

131
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.820
you're like, wait, what do they look like? &lt;laugh&gt; but, but you know,

132
00:06:47.821 --> 00:06:50.700
you don't wanna be shallow about it. I mean, kids are kids and you know,

133
00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:53.180
you're gonna fall in love with them regardless, but you know, like you kind,

134
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:56.980
everybody wants to think their own kids are cute, whatever. So it, it was funny.

135
00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:59.970
And then when saw the picture, the picture was, it was just a weird,

136
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.530
bad picture of the kids.

137
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.130
Like my son who was six at the time looked like he was 11 and he looked like

138
00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:08.170
this. It was just the look on his face and whatever looked hard. Yeah.

139
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.290
He looked, he looked hard and a little, yeah. And,

140
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.090
and we go over to the house and these kids are adorable, so, oh,

141
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:16.850
so this is sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. So, so when you,

142
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.600
so we have the meeting go, okay,

143
00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:21.120
we're gonna go meet with 'em and just to be clear, we didn't say okay.

144
00:07:21.121 --> 00:07:24.280
Because the picture, because the picture was kinda like neither here nor there,

145
00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:26.320
you know, we were just like, all right, let's go meet these kids.

146
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.440
So we go to the house and these kids are adorable. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and,

147
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.960
and it's the weirdest thing ever,

148
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.960
cuz you go to this foster home where they live and you play with them for

149
00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:38.870
like two a hours.

150
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.350
And when do you ever play with any kids for two straight hours?

151
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.430
Like actually actively play with kids, especially kids you've never met before.

152
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.590
Sure. So it's exhausting. Yeah. And it's weird. And,

153
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.590
and we touch on this in the movie that I was really scared when we were getting

154
00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:58.990
there. Cause I wanted so much to walk in, see these kids well up,

155
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.420
up with tears, know it's for real know,

156
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:04.900
these are my kids and just have that like cosmic connection moment.

157
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.660
And that didn't happen at all. Like I it's more weird. Right.

158
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.820
Were so you I'm gonna live with you. Yeah. And well,

159
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.180
and the little kids are just kinda like, this is no,

160
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:17.380
it's actually weird in the other direction.

161
00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:21.410
They're so used to kind of being passed around that. They're just kind of like,

162
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:23.170
oh, okay. Who are these people now? Wow. You know?

163
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:28.570
And so we get in there and then the, the foster mom in our case was like, uh,

164
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.330
go to your mom and dad. And I was like, oh, don't do that. Don't do that. Whoa,

165
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:34.570
whoa. Don't say, you know, slow your role.

166
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.450
Cause it just felt so obtrusive to the kids, you know? Yeah. And so we,

167
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.520
we would go there every day for five straight days, we,

168
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.360
we would go there when the kids were off school and we we'd go and play with

169
00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:49.160
them first in the backyard and then you'd take 'em to the park and then you'd

170
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:50.920
take 'em to the park and you'd take 'em out for ice cream.

171
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.560
And you're just kinda like getting to know these kids that are strangers to try

172
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:57.960
to change their names. Uh, yeah. First day, soon as we walked in, I was like,

173
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:02.760
you're you're white now. &lt;laugh&gt; no, we didn't do that.

174
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.920
The little one wouldn't even know though dude.

175
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.080
<v 2>Yeah. Year that's. That is true. That is true. No memory.</v>

176
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.680
<v 0>You know what a lot of, a lot of people do. In fact, a lot of kids,</v>

177
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.990
a lot of older kids that's sort of have that will, will wanna change their name,

178
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.150
not just their last for a new fresh start. Yeah. That they'll just want to,

179
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.790
you know, really. Yeah. Yeah. I, I sense I don't have any experience with that,

180
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:26.990
but I've heard that, that sometimes kids will choose to, there was a, a,

181
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.230
a young lady that was at the screening last night,

182
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.590
who was who her picture is at the end of the movie. She's like,

183
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.220
she's in Ireland getting her PhD right now of this girl that these people

184
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.100
adopted outta foster care. And she's, she's amazing. Yeah. And, and she,

185
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.820
she had chosen to change her name. Yeah.

186
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.740
<v 2>I mean, that seems like it would mean something. Yeah.</v>

187
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:50.340
Now that I think about it, it just seems, you know, changing a name yeah.

188
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.980
Is especially as a teen, but I mean, I get it. If you're saying like,

189
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.810
I wanna put everything in the past. Yeah.

190
00:09:55.811 --> 00:10:00.090
You wanna start over fresh start really lock it down. This is the new means.

191
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.570
My new I'm Kobe Bryant. I used to be number eight. I'm 24 now &lt;laugh&gt;.

192
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:05.931
<v 0>Well,</v>

193
00:10:05.931 --> 00:10:09.810
and that touches on something that is really difficult when you're doing this as

194
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:13.170
an adoptive parent, is that you're trying to walk this line all the time,

195
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:18.320
where you, you know, you, you need to claim these kids for your own.

196
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.000
You need to be the person who's like, you're with us. Like we're, we're,

197
00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:24.760
we're with you. We got your back. We're behind you. Like you, you,

198
00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.400
you need to do that. That's what these kids don't have. Right.

199
00:10:27.401 --> 00:10:29.160
This thing that we all take for granted, right?

200
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.320
We have these parents that love us no matter what knucklehead things we do.

201
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.640
So you're trying to do that. But at the same time,

202
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:38.510
you're trying not to impose your world on them because they're coming into it

203
00:10:38.511 --> 00:10:41.670
with their own, you know, personality and their own, you know,

204
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.270
culture or whatever it is that behind them.

205
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.230
So you're always trying to kind of be careful and walk this line between just,

206
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.550
just completely bringing them in,

207
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.190
but not trying to change them into who you are.
