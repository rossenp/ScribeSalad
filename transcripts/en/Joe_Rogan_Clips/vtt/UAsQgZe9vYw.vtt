00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.880
And that is the mushroom that was documented in the sacred mushroom in the cross

3
00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:09.320
where John Marco Allegro,

4
00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:13.880
alleged that he alleged that the entire Christian religion was

5
00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:15.080
essentially a misunderstanding.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.160
And it was really all about the consumption of these psychedelic mushrooms and

7
00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:24.030
fertility rituals that these were all sort of captured in

8
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.550
stories and tales and parables. And.

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.831
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:31.510
it was academic suicide for him to come out with that statement and still very

11
00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:32.344
controversial.

12
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.310
<v 0>Um, have you read the, the, his work? Yes, I have. What do.</v>

13
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.270
<v 1>You think? Well, um, linguistically the guy's way over my head, right?</v>

14
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.660
If you read his, his book, it's all about linguistics. Uh, the one,

15
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:46.940
the translators of the dead sea scrolls, uh, way beyond my Ken of knowledge.

16
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.300
It's so far beyond my Ken of knowledge. I can't make rhyme or reason out of it.

17
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.620
That.

18
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.580
<v 0>Seems to be the problem with it. Most people can't. Yeah. So.</v>

19
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.020
<v 1>But, and there's threads of truth in all of this, but I don't buy it.</v>

20
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.610
Um, you know, on its face on the, the grandiose conclusion that he made,

21
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.490
but clearly mushrooms have inspired religion. Yes.

22
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.130
And I teach these workshops on gourmet and medicinal mushrooms.

23
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.090
And one of these workshops is very spiritual guy. He's very quiet,

24
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.250
but very definitely, you know, walked us. He looked like the real deal.

25
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.880
He waited until everyone was gone. And he said, Paul I've been sent here.

26
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.600
And I said, really? And he says, I I'm a devout Christian

27
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm in Billy Graham's inner circle.

28
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.280
And a bunch of us take suicide mushrooms to sacraments Jesus and has brought

29
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:44.110
us, has brought us closer to of Jesus closer to our religion.

30
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.710
Now I don't care if you're Muslim or Christian or,

31
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.710
or Hindu the idea of these mushrooms making you feel the,

32
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.710
the spiritual universe more spiritually connected,

33
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.950
given your cultural heritage and your reference points. But he said,

34
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:02.510
these are extremely important. Now, my mother was a charismatic Christian.

35
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.340
I met some people in her group who came to their religious

36
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:11.740
beliefs through psychedelics. Don't do psychedelics now,

37
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.460
but that was their portal. They had their big revelation through psychedelics.

38
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.140
So the, the connection between, uh,

39
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.700
soul and magic mushrooms and religion,

40
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.930
I think has a lot of credibility. And there's lots of great examples of that.

41
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.450
The specificity of some of the arguments people make. I have.

42
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:34.770
Great, great doubts about.

43
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.810
<v 0>That's interesting. Um, what about in the ancient Hindu religions,</v>

44
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.610
the ancient Hinduism,

45
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.240
some of the ancient books be of various sacraments that have sort of never

46
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:48.360
been defined, right?

47
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.560
<v 1>Yeah. And why is that? Brah and cows are sacred. You know,</v>

48
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:54.840
when the philosophy Keas grows out, out Cal poop, right in India,

49
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.920
and yet they won't eat cows and Buddhist supposedly died from a mushroom.

50
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.040
He was, and he was given a mushroom by a peasant and, and Justin,

51
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.080
the mushroom died. Um, you know, that, and so there is that connection.

52
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.840
I've always thought curious that the philosophy S is such a religious provoking

53
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.840
mushroom, and yet cows are highly revered as being sacred. Well,

54
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.910
I would think you would keep the mother of the much from sacred. Yes. You know,

55
00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:23.590
you wanna protect the resource. But again, these are at times when,

56
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.670
when fables and parables and,

57
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.590
and religious rights were controlled by the cognizanti and they were the

58
00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:32.550
gatekeepers of knowledge,

59
00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:37.350
that was too powerful for the general population to understand or appreciate.

60
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.220
And so they protected that knowledge. And that's,

61
00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:44.260
that's the rule of most religions is that the, the inner circle, you know,

62
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.540
holds the keys to the kingdom.

63
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.140
And what's happened with Orthodox religions is they create institutions where

64
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:52.820
you have to pay tithings in order to have a gatekeeper, to,

65
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.820
to have a contact with God. And that I think is,

66
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.260
is the problem with monotheism versus polytheism Jack.

67
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.970
<v 0>Had era before he died, was working on, um,</v>

68
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.970
a book about psychedelic drugs, specifically mushrooms and, um,

69
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.370
and religious experiences.

70
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.970
And he had some really crazy old paintings that he had found,

71
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.090
um, that showed people that were naked,

72
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.840
seemingly dancing and ecstasy with translucent mushroom around them.

73
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.560
And the idea being that this is supposed to this,

74
00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:28.920
this image was supposed to represent someone who was tripping.

75
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.600
<v 1>There's a lot of really interesting books that have been, um, published that,</v>

76
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.440
um, show art, you know, going back hundreds of years, um, even, you know,

77
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.390
into the, the late 13 hundreds, uh, showing,

78
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.270
um, you know, Christian, um, art where mushrooms are,

79
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.590
are pretty easily seen. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Um, so there's,

80
00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:56.430
there's a lot of history to that, but, but it becomes the unfathomable. I mean,

81
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.830
I, maybe you can imagine it to be true, but how can you prove it to be true?

82
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:02.380
Right. How can you, yeah. So a lot of that is like,

83
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.940
it's great historical information, probably a lot of it's true, hard to say,

84
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:10.500
which is, which is true and which is not, but it seems reasonable, right? Yeah.

85
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.900
But in modern times now, Johns Hopkins,

86
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.180
the clinical studies are on my spirituality, uh,

87
00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:21.380
showing that these are some of the most spiritually significant experiences of

88
00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:22.214
people lives.

89
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.170
And the interesting thing about John's Hopkins studies is that 70% of the people

90
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.010
had positive experiences. And 14 months later,

91
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.450
they still described as experiences as being significantly positive,

92
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.890
their friends, their colleagues,

93
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.730
their fellow workers also say that materially changed these people's

94
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:43.440
personality, but the 30, depending on people had negative experiences,

95
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.840
the negativity of the experience did not extend more than the experience itself.

96
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.160
So this speaks to reremembering and what's been determined is when you have

97
00:05:52.161 --> 00:05:54.920
these really profound spiritual experiences, it sits with you.

98
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.560
And when you reremember, it, you rekindle that thought,

99
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.240
and this may be a way of overlaying PTSD rather than having the reference

100
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.960
standard that's associated with PTSD. You supplanted with a positive experience,

101
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.200
but the people who had negative experiences during tripping did not have a

102
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.280
negative that negative consequences did not extend more than the experie itself.

103
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.990
So this was, this is a profound insight.

104
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.430
And so John Hopkins role Griffiths just emailed me recently.

105
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:26.030
They have other clinical studies that are ongoing looking at one,

106
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:30.950
which just got published on meditators, uh, given placebos, uh,

107
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:35.870
versus getting, um, high doses of soul Ibin and, and then measuring,

108
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.690
um,

109
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.580
the consequences of those experiences months or a year or two later.

110
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.100
And again, the same thing is reinforced theses.

111
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.220
I mushroom experiences create a positive reference point that

112
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.180
you can capitalize on by reremembering them subsequent from experience by not

113
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.650
even having to take the mushrooms again. Hmm. That is profound.

114
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.890
When you have a happy memory that you can anchor your personality on it's a game

115
00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:05.810
changer. Yeah.

116
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.163
<v 0>I just, uh,</v>

117
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.210
I wonder if we're ever gonna see in our lifetime centers where you can

118
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.450
go in a train professional can guide you.

119
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.080
<v 1>Through something like this it's happening now, is it? Yes.</v>

120
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.240
The California Institute of, uh,

121
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:26.080
integrative studies and based in San Francisco are those training therapists and

122
00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:28.480
Canada. There are therapists in Europe. There are therapist,

123
00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:31.720
there is training programs now in psychedelic therapy. Um,

124
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.400
this is something that is, has a tremendous momentum. Um,

125
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.390
indigenous peoples have a really night structure. Many of them do not all,

126
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.390
but many have a really good structure for the responsible use of these

127
00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:46.230
substances. Us are displaced peoples,

128
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.710
and I would call us European based people. And many other people displaced.

129
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.950
We don't have the same constructs historically that we can operate within.

130
00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.660
And so the psyche therapists movement is hu huge right now, uh,

131
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:03.860
Canada is leading the way the Canadian government is very,

132
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.420
very positive towards psychedelic therapy, uh,

133
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:11.260
because the opioid crisis and because significant, uh,

134
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.340
results is in the movie, this has come out called dosed. Um,

135
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.050
and it attracts a heroin addict, um, a young lady in Vancouver. Um,

136
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.650
it is a heroic movie. It is not one of these.

137
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.010
You kind of feel good at the end of the movie, but it is a, it is, she,

138
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.810
it is intense and she's doing a Boga and she also does high doses of mushrooms,

139
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.250
but the opioid crisis is so pervasive.

140
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.240
There's so poor treatments available that through these psychedelic therapies

141
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.640
in several days, they're seeing a tremendous, um, um,

142
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:51.000
success and people breaking, you know, decades, long opioid addiction, uh,

143
00:08:51.001 --> 00:08:52.480
within a week. And, uh,

144
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.760
so the psychedelic therapists are integral to that success. And so there are,

145
00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.840
there are clinics now arising all,

146
00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:04.480
all over the world for this Portugal and Mexico and Spain, um,

147
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.320
in Jamaica, they're,

148
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.520
the clinics are arising specifically to meet the needs of people who are trying

149
00:09:09.521 --> 00:09:12.560
to get these legally. Uh, so they don't get in trouble with the law.

150
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.150
So in Portugal and Spain and Jamaica, uh, for instance, that these are legal,

151
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:17.830
uh, many of these substances are.
