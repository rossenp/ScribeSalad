00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.200
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. With, with what just happened with Epstein.</v>

2
00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:08.240
People are, you can't get away with this stuff anymore. Well,

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.560
what happened with Epstein? This is what I like about it. Yeah.

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.200
It's it was so blatant. And so, so outrageous that people go, Hey,

5
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:19.680
maybe they did kill Kennedy. Yeah. Like, yeah, they absolutely did. Maybe they,

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.030
I was just doing shows in Fort worth and I was looking at these audiences and I

7
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.550
was going, they'd kill 'em again. Yeah. They'll kill 'em again,

8
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.590
give these people a couple of shots at tequila.

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.750
Another shot goes right to Kennedy's head. Well, if there was another one,

10
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.710
like Kennedy, right?

11
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:38.230
Like let's let's think if someone took over after Trump and this guy

12
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.580
was trying to get rid of the NSA and get rid of the C I a. Yeah. And, and,

13
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:42.861
you know,

14
00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:45.980
and then there was some at mafia and industrialists and there was some,

15
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:48.860
and the mafia got him in the office in the first place, a hundred percent.

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.060
So they were like, Hey, you piece of. Yeah. We're the reason why you're here.

17
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:56.820
We Rigg Chicago for you. And so then he has this military BL the bay of pigs.

18
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.460
And so then the military's after him, everybody's angry.

19
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.250
He said wants splinter this CIA into a thousand pieces and give all like piece

20
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:06.650
time intelligence gathering capability to the military.

21
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.010
If we had someone like that. Yeah. Some guy like that. And by the way,

22
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:13.490
he was everything that moved too. Yeah. I mean,

23
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.210
he was a different world doing drugs and everything. You know,

24
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:19.410
he was enjoying himself. He was on meth. That's crazy. They had a doctor,

25
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.960
Dr. Feelood. That's where the name came from. And they would Motley crew song.

26
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.520
Dr. Phil feel good. And it was Kennedy's doctor. Yes. Wow. Yes.

27
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.000
Yes. That's when being president, it was a great job. Well, they all were on it.

28
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.400
Yeah. That's how they got the party moving. Yeah. Just, just meth heads.

29
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.600
Its a busy man running things to do. It's hard. Yeah. It's true. I mean, listen,

30
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:41.800
this is the argument for Trump being on amphetamines right now. Yeah.

31
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.870
How the else? You gonna run a country. Yeah. You have to,

32
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:46.630
you have to be a little amped, a little amped up.

33
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.270
He's definitely amped got a little piece of something, but I like,

34
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.790
I like seeing him. I like seeing him, you know, when he goes big, what is it?

35
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:53.510
Sidebar?

36
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.510
<v 1>Uh, South Dakota today started a new, uh, campaign antimethth campaign.</v>

37
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.350
But it is uh, on meth.com and meth.

38
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.620
We're on it is this slogan that, oh my it's been over four.

39
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.180
<v 0>50 Grand. I mean there's not anybody in what there's gonna spend. How much?</v>

40
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.300
450 grand of taxpayer might have figured this out. Oh my God,

41
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.340
this is why people hate the government.

42
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.700
Cuz nobody was able to stop this and say, Hey, this is not the best.

43
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.780
This is the dumbest ad campaign I've ever seen in my life. Meth we're on it.

44
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:24.930
That sounds like a onion article. It's like a rap song. This bad rap song.

45
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.450
This is so does it seems like an onion article.

46
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.370
I love what it says goes South Dakota has a problem.

47
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.090
There isn't a single solution because meth is widespread,

48
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.490
but we can approach it from different angles. So it doesn't take over counties.

49
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.330
Towns, neighborhoods let's work together. Meth. We're on it. God,

50
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.480
what's up with that brown water. Turn that back up. Put back on.

51
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.880
How about you fix that toilet water. You got your kids swimming around and yeah.

52
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:51.280
Look at that water. It's disgusting. Yeah. Meth is probably yeah.

53
00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:52.360
More than one problem. Yeah.

54
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:55.360
Meth is not even in the top 10 problems in South Dakota.

55
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.880
Meth is what you need to get on to fix the other problems in South Dakota.

56
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.160
The whole town councils got yeah. You need to start cleaning, but Epstein.

57
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.920
They just charged guards. I mean this is hilarious. Yes, yes, yes.

58
00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:10.080
This is a very funny comic. Nick Mullen on Twitter was like, oh yeah,

59
00:03:10.081 --> 00:03:13.560
this is the justice. We all wanted the guards. You know? No here's, what's good.

60
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:17.360
Not the two prison guards tasks with watching Jeffrey Epstein on night.

61
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.360
He killed himself

62
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.670
that should charged with falsifying records. And's conspiracy and conspiracy.

63
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.790
Here's why that's good.

64
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.670
Somebody paid those guys and they're gonna sing or they're gonna die.

65
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.230
Something's gonna happen either. They're gonna take those guys.

66
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.310
I think it's a way to satiate the public. I don't think there's. I mean,

67
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.670
I don't think that BARR,

68
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.180
the attorney general has any real desire to get to the bottom of what happened.

69
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.700
I mean, this is clearly obviously sexual black male Epstein was involved with

70
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:47.460
intelligence. Whether it's us, whether it's Maad it's somebody,

71
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.460
his island was a honey pot. He had powerful people and compromising positions.

72
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.093
Uh, he was an,

73
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.140
probably like an access agent where he would give these Intel agencies access to

74
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.010
in insanely powerful people ex against people like that. So there, uh,

75
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.810
if you don't wanna open up that wound because it's just gonna,

76
00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:09.730
it's never gonna stop bleeding and guys like BARR who are in, you know,

77
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.610
this is a guy that's participated in multiple cover ups. He, you know,

78
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.970
I don't think he has any really interest in he's.

79
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.320
He's a lifelong government official. You, you could say deep state,

80
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:22.080
you can say whatever it is, but he's just a career.

81
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.640
His job is to protect the interest of these power factions in Washington.

82
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:31.640
These government agencies, there's no way they open this up and there's no,

83
00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:34.360
there was no way that they could have had Jeffrey Epstein and open court

84
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.520
pointing fingers that maybe prime ministers and presidents,

85
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:39.400
it would tear countries apart.

86
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.390
It would be the biggest political scandal in our lifetime.

87
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.670
I just can't believe they just meked him like that though.

88
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.790
They didn't just Merk him. They mured him twice. Here's what I want to know.

89
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.990
When he tried to commit himself suicide.

90
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:53.470
The first time were the cameras broken then too. Great question.

91
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.830
I don't know how think we never heard that. Well, we,

92
00:04:55.831 --> 00:04:57.550
we didn't see any footage of him.

93
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.830
I've never seen any footage of him in his cell. I mean,

94
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.020
they haven't released any if the camera's ever working. Right. I mean,

95
00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:05.860
from what I can underst no, but understand. Did they even comment on it?

96
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.740
Remember the first time that he attempted to commit suicide?

97
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.860
I think they got it. Yeah. I don't know. That's a good point. I mean,

98
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.660
I think they, they, they, he, he, they found him, they transferred him.

99
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.980
I don't know if they have photographic evidence of him doing that. Google.

100
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.610
What happened the first time Epstein tried to kill himself cuz I'm,

101
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:26.970
that's that's an interesting thing. Like and where is uh, yes,

102
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.850
a very interesting thing. So do they know for sure.

103
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.410
Did they watch the footage and see him tying a rope red and then,

104
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.610
and then they went in and go, next time you gotta do it like this,

105
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.850
you tie the knot stronger. You, you take off from the chair.

106
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.720
My favorite thing was the cellmate, the cellmate that they gave him. Oh yeah.

107
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:44.240
Which he's like a long, it was a,

108
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.280
a cop who Guilla Copish from westchesterchester's huge. Yeah.

109
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.560
Huge skinhead looking dude,

110
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.720
Italian guy coked out giant muscles and killed a bunch of people and sold drugs.

111
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.240
Just &lt;laugh&gt; just him and Epstein. And they got along.

112
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.440
He was so he was like the like Hollywood stereotype

113
00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:06.560
of the last guy, guy you would want in your foot.

114
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:11.240
You wanna be in a cell with big xcorup cop with giant muscle

115
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.000
stuff. Yeah. It is monster and connected to the law. I mean,

116
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.910
it just seemed if that's the guy, I mean,

117
00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:20.910
that would be the guy that maybe he's the guy who killed him. Who knows? I mean,

118
00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:22.750
he's a giant guy. I mean guys like that,

119
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.870
I'm sure would take a bride pretty easily. And then, oh,

120
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.070
and those guys don't open their mouths. Just know just for cigarettes. Yeah.

121
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:31.150
Why not? Yeah. I mean, you can't open his mouth. He's in jail. Right? Right.

122
00:06:31.151 --> 00:06:33.390
They got him locked up and they go look and who knows? And like, listen,

123
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.070
if they Tommy come on, right Tommy do this come you're here forever.

124
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.340
You're like killing P I think they gotta watch the,

125
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.780
I don't know if they can do this, but they gotta watch the bank accounts.

126
00:06:40.781 --> 00:06:43.460
Now obviously the people that are paying off people are pretty smart. Yeah.

127
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:44.620
There's ways to hide money,

128
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.700
but somebody got paid off substantial amount of money. Yeah. Somewhere,

129
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:52.900
somewhere that you might not have. You don't think so this is a weird one.

130
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.763
Like this one,

131
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.610
this one involves so many people money might not have been asked around. Right.

132
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.970
You know what I mean? Like somebody just might've called in favors for this.

133
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.290
Where is said just hide. Yeah. Where is just lane Maxwell. Oh,

134
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:09.730
that is in Brazil. Yeah. Somebody said she was in LA. Yeah.

135
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.210
She was in LA at an in and out burger with a book.

136
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.810
And they stageded a photo agents. Yeah.

137
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.680
And they released a staged photo and I don't know what the she thinking like,

138
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.320
oh, America will forgive me if they see I'm eating fast food.

139
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.120
I don't even understand. No, no, no, no. She was trying to release a message.

140
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:30.000
Okay. Yeah. She was reading a book about CIA agents that had been murdered.

141
00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:31.400
Yeah. But what's the point of that message.

142
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.800
She's trying to say he's a intelligence agent, right? Yeah. Who,

143
00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:37.480
that was something that was actually said by,

144
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.710
was it one of the attorney generals when they're prosecuted?

145
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.030
Alexander cons said AB seen intelligence would belong to intelligence. Yeah.

146
00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:49.070
Well, if you just look at this, is there. Yeah. There's a photo.

147
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.350
So does it show the book? Uh, it's another photo.

148
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:57.430
I think you can see the side of the book. Mm. Okay. But they also added in that,

149
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.060
that movie poster that's right. Somebody swapped out the, the movie poster,

150
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.700
they photoshopped, they took advantage of this opportunity to promote a film.

151
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.580
Right. Wasn't it? The Seth Rogan movie.

152
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.900
This is an interesting product placement in the,

153
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.220
in the background of a human trafficker, having a sandwich,

154
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.700
at least she's got good taste in, um, listen in food.

155
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.500
She's interested brand deals. She's got an old iPhone.

156
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.290
So she's shown she's struggling a little bit. It financially.

157
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.730
It's very interesting. &lt;laugh&gt; she's not on the new iPhone. That's,

158
00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:28.010
that's a burner. She's got a burner. She probably had five different phones.

159
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.050
She probably drives 'em into, there it is. These are, you know,

160
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.730
I think it's hard for people to understand that like elements of the CIA or the

161
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.450
Maad would condone the abuse of children to get leverage and information on

162
00:08:39.451 --> 00:08:41.920
people. But that's kind of what's happened before. Yeah.

163
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.800
I think they just figured look these 15, 16 year olds,

164
00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:48.000
they're gonna keep their mouth shut. I mean, we're, we're talking about when,

165
00:08:48.001 --> 00:08:51.560
when this happened, this is all a long time ago, right? It wasn't that long ago.

166
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.600
Like how long ago did it start? I mean it's well, it's nineties.

167
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.240
It's been going on for a, probably for very decades, but right.

168
00:08:58.241 --> 00:09:00.160
But my point was, when it initially got started,

169
00:09:00.161 --> 00:09:03.120
they probably didn't have the internet. Right. A hundred percent. When did they,

170
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:06.640
when did he start bringing people out to the island? He got the island, I think,

171
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.080
uh, late nineties or early 2000. 2001. Yeah.

172
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:13.080
So nobody really understood the concept of social media or where it was all

173
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:15.230
gonna go. But what's really crazy is like,

174
00:09:15.231 --> 00:09:19.590
no one's ever accounted for how that guy got all that money. Well, Les Wexner,

175
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.410
who was the,

176
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:24.310
the head of Victoria's secret was like his mentor and they were buddies and

177
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.870
Wexner gave him and you know, what's so funny about the mainstream press,

178
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.310
you know, the wall street journal ran some article. They're like,

179
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:34.350
how could a guy like Les Wexner who sold women's jeans forever? You know,

180
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:39.300
get it, uh, totally bamboozled by Jeffrey Epstein. That's like, no,

181
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:41.420
nobody there thought that it was maybe a,

182
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.780
a pathological relationship and that those guys knew each other and maybe were

183
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:48.820
in the similar stuff or whatever. I don't know. But maybe there was a,

184
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.180
a mutual benefit to them knowing each other.

185
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:56.090
They think that somehow this billionaire got bamboozled by Jeffrey

186
00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.650
Epstein, which is just insane to think. Yeah.

187
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.490
But that's the way the press thinks they're like this guy's a CEO of a

188
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.050
multinational. I mean, he's, I'm sure he's uh,

189
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.930
didn't do anything untooured yeah. I'm sure. He' prince. Well prince. Yeah.

190
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.490
The, the prince, the interview with the prince was fascinating. Yeah. Well,

191
00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:15.290
my favorite thing about that was I think the prince is autistic or something and

192
00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:18.360
the people on Twitter were like, don't make fun of him. He's got some,

193
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.320
I think he is, he's got something. And the people on Twitter were like, Hey,

194
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.680
don't shame him for him. I'm like, okay, can we just,

195
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.560
how do you know when someone's autistic? Like, there's a, there's a spectrum,

196
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.840
right? When is it on, like, when do you,

197
00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:36.120
do you lick up a lot looking strip and they go, oh yeah, bro, you got it.

198
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.430
A lot of people now, for whatever reason, it's,

199
00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:43.390
it's becoming more and more obvious, more diagnosed. It's more diagnosed.

200
00:10:43.391 --> 00:10:45.630
And you, I think you've even talked about it before. It's people,

201
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.790
people are not socializing with each other face to face as much.

202
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.790
And so there's a lot of like awkward yeah. People that, you know,

203
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:56.670
maybe are on the spectrum and maybe aren't, they're trying to ban

204
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.820
&lt;laugh&gt; because saw, you know, they're gonna band. I saw they,

205
00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:03.340
do you wanna wanna do jazz hands? Yeah. They wanna do jazz.

206
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.380
Have a real problem with loud noises. Yeah.

207
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.500
L O L prince Andrew forced a scrap visit to floodstrick in York as

208
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:13.020
he's called into crisis talks at Buckingham palace.

209
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.130
How sad summoned for crisis talks. Oh, right now. Yeah.

210
00:11:18.131 --> 00:11:20.570
Like it's happening right now or something now, crisis talk.

211
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.170
They're gonna hang him too. Some of his answers were so crazy. Yes. Well,

212
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:28.290
if my attorney advises, I will testify. He's like, I don't no.

213
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.730
When a man has sex,

214
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:34.610
like he went into this whole thing that was just completely he's clearly he was

215
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:37.810
clearly had a relationship with Epstein that wasn't good. I think, uh,

216
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.080
Epstein knew how to do it, you know? Yeah. I mean, I think, and so did Clinton,

217
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.080
so a lot of these people, Clinton flew with Epstein all the time.

218
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:47.720
26 times. Yeah.

219
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.960
And I've been telling people like I haven't flown with my mom 26 times.

220
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.920
I haven't flown with anyone 26 times. Yeah.

221
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.560
Maybe Jamie and I decided we maybe flew together 10 times and uh,

222
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.080
maybe hinchiff and I have done 26 times hinchiff and I have probably flown as

223
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:05.040
many times. You'll regret that when Tony gets outed for whatever he's doing,

224
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.000
&lt;laugh&gt; I mean, Tony looks like a, like a,

225
00:12:08.001 --> 00:12:10.960
like a F fuile Lord that's disembaling chamberaids &lt;laugh&gt;.

226
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:15.150
So whenever they find the bodies in his yard, you will be answering for that.

227
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.150
They gotta find home video of Tony with joker costumeew one. Yeah.

228
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.670
A hundred percent, a hundred percent, a hundred percent. A hundred.

229
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.670
He's got a joker is on his screensaver on his phone.

230
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>
