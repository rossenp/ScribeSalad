00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.330
<v 2>Left the view, by the way she left the view. She's free to be on your show.</v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:10.320
Now we wish her. Well, imagine you as her on your show, I would love to.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.140
<v 1>Interview her as her, but I think there's, there's.</v>

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.030
<v 0>Such a small chance, small chance. So you're saying there's a chance going.</v>

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.880
<v 1>To happen? Yes, there is a chance, but it's not big. What if.</v>

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.510
<v 0>I helped her? What if I was there? What if I was there like as a moderator.</v>

8
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.630
<v 1>Any you want to organize it I'll show up. I would do it.</v>

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.790
<v 0>I absolutely. But you and her together on this show.</v>

10
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.800
<v 1>I don't think I should do it the whole time,</v>

11
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.260
but I think it would be fun to interview her for five minutes and then say,

12
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:39.180
Hey Megan, I get it. I also hate Troy bay hearts. So I don't love you,

13
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:43.620
but I also hate that squawking bird. So I hate the whole thing. And frankly,

14
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:47.070
that show, you want to talk about a show that set women back is the view.

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.450
You want to talk a bit that shut the CIA is engineering, uh, you know,

16
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.790
at T fun the capital ride,

17
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.500
some crazy misogynist engineered the view because there's

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.380
nothing worse than the view in terms of like,

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.770
there are so many brilliant women out there, none of them are on the view.

20
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.160
None of them have gone near the set of the view. I mean,

21
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:13.110
they have brought in the lowest tier, uh, of, of, of the, what is it?

22
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:14.730
The Y chromosome, no.

23
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.820
<v 0>WX.</v>

24
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.260
<v 1>Of books. They brought in the lowest of the double axis for that one. It's.</v>

25
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.850
<v 0>Rough. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.510
Did you watch the episode with Tulsi gabber gun to defend herself and joy?

27
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.260
Bihar starts panicking, going over her notes while Tulsi is refuting.

28
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:29.094
Everything that she said.

29
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.670
<v 1>Yeah. I mean tripping. It was like, again, these people have dementia.</v>

30
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.390
These are people who like, should not be allowed out of the house.

31
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.980
They have a national platform. I mean, it is crazy.

32
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.410
They have no idea. These people had never read like a book.

33
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.780
<v 0>And there's versions of it less than the other one with Sharon Osborne. Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.510
Well w what did Sharon? She said something racially insensitive.

35
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.610
<v 1>Said that she doesn't like, I don't, I think she said,</v>

36
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:58.770
why is Pierce Morgan racist? I don't even think it was that bad.

37
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.990
<v 0>She's friends appears Morgan. Right? Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:04.590
And she goes to the thing that makes me pause is Sheryl. Underwood is cool as.

39
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.060
I know Cheryl under no, any of them, but she's cool as. I know her forever.

40
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.650
I did Montreal comedy festival with her back in the day. She's hilarious.

41
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.150
Stand-up I know.

42
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.910
<v 1>That. She's great. Cause I know people that know her, but I never, she.</v>

43
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.780
<v 0>Murders. She goes on stage with her purse. Yeah. Yeah. She's funny.</v>

44
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:25.950
Really funny. Yeah. Really funny and cool as. So if she doesn't like her,

45
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:29.550
I got to go, man. You know what I mean? Yeah.

46
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.380
<v 1>There's probably something there. There's.</v>

47
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.700
<v 0>Probably something there. I don't know.</v>

48
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:36.120
But I remember when she was making fun of the guy who got his Dick chopped off

49
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:39.870
and the wife threw it in the blender or threw it in the garbage disposal and she

50
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:43.390
was laughing about what it must have looked like a he's running around.

51
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.800
<v 1>No one wants stats. She's not anybody's.</v>

52
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.370
<v 0>Choice.</v>

53
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.260
Crazy thing to laugh at a guy getting his Dick chopped off and someone

54
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.370
throw like he's getting mutilated. Yeah. His humanity is taken from him.

55
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.070
His manhood is literally getting grounded and she thought it was funny.

56
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.030
But again,

57
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.990
people think things are funny because they don't think about the person they're

58
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.430
making fun of you and are both guilty do in the course as comics. Absolutely.

59
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.170
But that one was like, particularly like.

60
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.660
<v 1>You're like, wow, we'll just, it was started to view.</v>

61
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.780
And then they have all these ones they like to talk. Yeah. You know,

62
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:21.400
and it's just slidable and then everyone gets like C list and then D list.

63
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.880
And then they're like resurrecting sitcom stars from the eighties. They're like,

64
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:27.760
what are you thinking about Palestine? It's like, what are we doing here? Right.

65
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.920
We don't need any of these people's opinions.

66
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.870
<v 0>It's it's a weird thing, man. Like Sherri shepherd.</v>

67
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:38.890
She used to be on the views. Well, she's really nice too. She was at the store.

68
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.060
She was always cool as. I'm sure. They're all nice. She was really nice.

69
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.410
Sherri shepherd is a really nice lady. And she's also like super religious.

70
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.450
Like she's a God fearing Christian woman like full stop. Yeah.

71
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.400
<v 1>I just, I can, I suggest to think for the view, this is a suggested I have men,</v>

72
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.270
no.

73
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.080
<v 0>Chance.</v>

74
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.010
<v 1>Just men on the show, but women.</v>

75
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.720
<v 0>And watch it. See, that's the thing it's like,</v>

76
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.500
it's a lot of it is women that are home, right? During that time at airs.

77
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:08.800
During the.

78
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.940
<v 1>I know if he'd put the women in the audience and the men discuss the issues,</v>

79
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.260
this is just an idea I have for ABC corporate. Well,

80
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.360
clearly one woman serve everyone drinks and give her a

81
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:26.920
quick opinion quick in and out. Just the guys go back, just go. She goes,

82
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:29.530
she walks in. She goes, yeah. Israel seems like it's a go. Thanks.

83
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.800
And then they keep going. I think that's a happy medium. Why doesn't the.

84
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.840
<v 0>View? Have any trans women on it? Great.</v>

85
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.600
<v 1>Point. It has a lot of women that look trans, but none of them,</v>

86
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.260
it has a lot of second and third takes after a drink. He'd go, huh.

87
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.670
But it doesn't have a ton of yeah, it's zero. I agree.

88
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.480
It should be all trans women imagined the best era of the view.

89
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.760
And I've talked about it before was when Rosie O'Donnell was talking about

90
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:58.540
building seven. Yeah. That was the bed that I watched. And I was back in that.
