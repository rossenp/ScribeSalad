00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.740
It's so interesting to me that breathing and breath work and

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.700
knowing how to breathe properly is it's not common knowledge,

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.940
but it's so critical to health and it's free.

5
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:18.930
It's not like we're not talking about something that requires devices or,

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.100
or like a long learning curve or just,

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.110
just some of these benefits.

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.140
<v 1>Oh, so, so many of them, and especially the most simple ones, right?</v>

9
00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:33.560
Anyone can breathe in six seconds in six seconds out.

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.850
If you want to really go up to the next stage and figure out what breathing can

11
00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:42.230
really do for you on a, on a bigger and more powerful level, you can do TUMO.

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
You can do Wim Hoff. You can do holotropic. You can do Koreas.

13
00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:47.990
You can do pranayama as they're all doing the same thing.

14
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.100
<v 0>Tropic I've I haven't done it, but it makes you trip. Right?</v>

15
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.680
<v 1>It's an interesting experience. What was that like for you? Uh, you know,</v>

16
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.880
I know a lot of people have found profound benefits from this. Uh,

17
00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:04.760
they used it, um, in a hospital,

18
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.960
11,000 people were put through this thing and they showed it was more effective

19
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:11.900
than any other therapy. Me personally,

20
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.350
that the science is much more thin in holotropic breathwork.

21
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.610
And what I had been told by the instructors kind of threw me off where they're

22
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:23.270
like, they sit you in a room and they blast music.

23
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.790
And for three hours you breathe as hard as you can.

24
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.070
And they told me that you're going to be able to enter into the space because so

25
00:01:31.071 --> 00:01:35.000
much oxygen is getting into your body. The opposite is happening.

26
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.300
You were inhibiting blood flow to your brain.

27
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.110
And so your brain is processing that as a threat.

28
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.700
And sometimes you inhibit so much blood flow that perhaps your brain is

29
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:49.280
interpreting this as though you are dying,

30
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.480
which is why so many people have this reaction where they said,

31
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.140
I am reborn after holotropic and that's awesome.

32
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.570
I don't want to take that away from anyone, but,

33
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:03.020
but what I've seen is that this side there is not,

34
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.500
there's been a ton of subjective, anecdotal studies,

35
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:10.490
not a ton of a few of them, but the actual science behind it. No,

36
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:15.020
one's gone into an MRI and looked at what's really happening and that's

37
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:16.310
something I really want to do.

38
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:19.850
And hopefully I'm going to be doing in the next next few months just for cure.

39
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.870
<v 0>That makes sense. If people are having psychedelic experiences,</v>

40
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.320
cause many psychedelic experiences are tied to near death experiences.

41
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:29.060
A lot of people that have near death experiences,

42
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.250
they report these moments that mimic what a lot of people have

43
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:35.900
experienced on psychedelics. Yep.

44
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.470
So what they're doing through this holotropic breathing they're harming

45
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:41.540
themselves, right? Or do we not know?

46
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.550
<v 1>No, not, not that I know of. Um, the,</v>

47
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:49.100
the doctor who put 11,000 people into there, nobody had any problems.

48
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:53.270
There were no side effects. So I've heard that some people can, can freak out.

49
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.770
I heard that there's possible bowel issues involved and uh, some,

50
00:02:57.771 --> 00:03:01.120
some real meltdowns in, in the class that I took,

51
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.710
I wasn't sure how much was psychosomatic and how much was actually because of

52
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:06.544
the breathing.

53
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.830
I had a pretty strange experience where a guy turned into a Wolf for awhile,

54
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.230
um, and went humping around the room. Oh,

55
00:03:16.231 --> 00:03:18.060
so a guy not to,

56
00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:21.360
you wish if it were a real Wolf,

57
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.720
that would have been incredible, but.

58
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.830
<v 0>He thought he was a Wolf. He inhabited the body. He was just an.</v>

59
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.640
That's possible too. And just like, act it out. Or.

60
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.640
<v 1>Maybe he really became a Wolf. We will never know,</v>

61
00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:38.490
which is why this stuff should be studied. You know,

62
00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:42.870
there's a lot of talk that breathing this way will trigger endogenous

63
00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:45.900
DMT. And that's the reason people trip out so hard.

64
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.500
I tried to do a study in which I would breathe this way and they would take

65
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:53.160
blood before and after. But the scientists that I was talking to said,

66
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.190
it would be such a small amount. They wouldn't be able to detect it.

67
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.750
So there there's a lot of gray area, which to me is not a bad thing. It's great.

68
00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:04.170
There's still mysteries to breath. There's mysteries to the human body. Right.

69
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.980
Um,

70
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.150
and if people are finding great benefit from this and there's no side effect,

71
00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:11.490
then, then that's great. I just found it was a little,

72
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:16.470
little thinner than the other techniques, like Wim Hof method or like Priya.

73
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.000
<v 0>Um, no, I, this guy that had this experience and he turned into, well,</v>

74
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.380
did you talk to him before?

75
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.990
<v 1>Awesome guy, super solid.</v>

76
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.330
He was a lawyer working in San Francisco and left and

77
00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:33.570
went to live off the grid in a cabin in Mendocino,

78
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.070
which is completely legit and admirable. Um, and he was a,

79
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.360
he was a groovy dude, uh, and afterwards really warm, welcoming guy.

80
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.100
So I don't want to take away any, any process that he went through. Uh,

81
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.060
he said it was very cleansing for, for himself. And I think that that's,

82
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.100
that's great. You're a very nice guy.

83
00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:57.540
I wish I was a little might have to refer to, to rip on it. Right. You know.

84
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.210
<v 0>I understand. I understand. Yeah. I'm just saying,</v>

85
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.660
you're a very nice guy with your disclaimer. I'd like to talk to him.

86
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.090
<v 1>You know, where we can find him he's out in the Tundra right now.</v>

87
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.690
You gotta go hunt him down. Is he? No, I have no idea maybe.

88
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.470
<v 0>Right. Maybe he's got a, like a caribou in his mouth, um, could be,</v>

89
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.680
so this guy ran around, did he have clothes on? We do this.

90
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.660
<v 1>Yeah. He was, uh, he was scratching his crotch a little bit, um,</v>

91
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.610
and growling and growl and it got it got interesting. Yeah. Everyone saw it.

92
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.930
Uh, and again, you know, he was going through his process. That was cool.

93
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:38.010
But the whole time I was watching him breathing and he wasn't really breathing

94
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:39.540
in any differently than me.

95
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.470
Cause what you do is you have a half the class or the sitters for the people who

96
00:05:43.471 --> 00:05:46.620
are breathing and you watch over these people in case they have problems.

97
00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:50.070
So I was a sitter during this process. I was not breathing.

98
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.340
And I was looking at as respiration really didn't look any different.

99
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:56.850
So I'm wondering how much of this is, is the set and setting of this.

100
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.880
You're in Mendocino, you're at a hot Springs. There's really loud music,

101
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.570
fake lute music is, you know, that's,

102
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:09.470
that's something I wish they could have worked on a little bit. I wish.

103
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.660
Um, but it was a lot of like fake keyboard loots and symbol,

104
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:19.090
the fake tinny symbol crashes, the, the Maxim, uh

105
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.670
[inaudible] that's.

106
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.760
<v 0>The academies. Yeah. Well that would seem like, you know,</v>

107
00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:26.050
when you talk about set and setting,

108
00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:29.380
that would seem to be like a terrible set and setting.

109
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.090
<v 1>Well, a lot of people, uh, enjoyed that music and, and good, good,</v>

110
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.900
good for them. It would be interesting to mix it up with,

111
00:06:36.901 --> 00:06:41.170
with three hours of death metal and just see where that would take

112
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.230
some good. Yeah.

113
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.390
<v 0>Yeah. Um, so when you did it, so you were a sitter,</v>

114
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.260
but then you also did it. Right. And when you did it, what did you experience?

115
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.830
<v 1>Well, it definitely affects you because you're breathing in a certain way.</v>

116
00:06:56.831 --> 00:07:01.000
It's going to affect your physiology. So I got really cold. I got really hot.

117
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.050
I got really Spacey. I felt like I was kind of dreaming for a while.

118
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:09.400
Three hours is a long time to breathe as hard as you possibly can,

119
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.150
but the shifts in temperature and in circulation because the body's trying to

120
00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:16.390
compensate. Right? So the more your breathing,

121
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.520
your pH is going to be, you know, going down. So you're becoming more alkaline.

122
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.430
So, so your body doesn't like that.

123
00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:28.870
It really wants the pH because all the cellular function happen at a certain pH

124
00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:31.000
at some point for, so it was, to me,

125
00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:35.560
it was fascinating to feel my body fighting against this and constantly trying

126
00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:40.150
to balance itself throughout the whole thing. But it's definitely Spacey.

127
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.300
There's no doubt about it. Uh,

128
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.350
you are extremely lightheaded. You feel very high. Uh,

129
00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:50.740
I was talking to Ben Greenfield about it and he said it was the most profound,

130
00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:54.460
spiritual experiences he's ever had, uh, just by breathing.

131
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:57.250
And a lot of people say the same thing. I, you know,

132
00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.320
those subjective experiences are cool,

133
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.640
but I think it would be a lot more interesting to find out what happens to

134
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.331
everybody,

135
00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:07.900
not just one person when they do this and to look at the brain and to look at

136
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:10.750
the body and really analyze that to,

137
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.600
to see if there's some physiological reaction.

138
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.270
We know what's happening with blood flow to the brain.

139
00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:19.480
We know what happens to the brain when it's denied blood for blood flow to

140
00:08:19.481 --> 00:08:23.920
certain areas. But, but how does that affect us psychologically afterwards?

141
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.720
How does it affect us physically?

142
00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:29.080
I think these are good questions and it'll be interesting to find out.

143
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.290
<v 0>Did it take you to feel like you recovered from that experience?</v>

144
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.570
<v 1>Uh, pretty, pretty quickly. Um,</v>

145
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.640
I went outside afterwards and drank a beer in my car and just sorta re-centered.

146
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.780
Um, but, but it was mostly just, uh, the,

147
00:08:42.781 --> 00:08:46.600
the feeling of extreme lightheadedness dreaminess, um,

148
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.160
and then everything just sort of boils back down in your back and

149
00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:52.990
Mendocino at the hot tubs, you.

150
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.540
<v 0>Know? And when, when they sell you on this, like what, what,</v>

151
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.210
when they have a class for holotropic breathing, what are they,

152
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.690
what are they saying it's going to do well, you.

153
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.410
<v 1>Can't claim any medical benefits, right? Because the FDA would come after them.</v>

154
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.380
But, but they say it is a spiritual journey. And for many people it is. And,

155
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:14.390
and I think that's a wonderful thing that they're getting benefit from this. Um,

156
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.380
and they use this,

157
00:09:15.381 --> 00:09:19.220
this fuzzy language like that because they can't say it's going to help with

158
00:09:19.221 --> 00:09:21.070
your asthma. They can't say, but,

159
00:09:21.071 --> 00:09:25.610
but what's interesting is there are other methods like Korea, Sudarshan, Kriya,

160
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.650
60 independent studies, and is so similar to holotropic the differences.

161
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.200
You don't breathe super hard for three hours.

162
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.190
You breathe extremely intensely for about five minutes, then slow it down.

163
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.640
<v 0>But let me, uh, holotropic breathing first before creation.</v>

164
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.690
So holotropic breathing. What is the actual technique? Like how does it,

165
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.613
how do you do it?

166
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.000
<v 1>You breathe as hard and as fast as you.</v>

167
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.600
<v 0>Are able to breathe, big, deep breaths, whatever you want to do,</v>

168
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.890
whatever you want to do, you can do that.

169
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.100
You breathing through the nose, through the mouth.

170
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.410
<v 1>Whatever you want to do they say through,</v>

171
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:07.220
through the mouth is going to allow you to get more air in. And this was, um,

172
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.240
yeah. Yeah. You'll.

173
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.340
<v 0>Get more air in larger volume. Yep.</v>

174
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.100
<v 1>Yeah, for sure. And this was created, um,</v>

175
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:17.510
in the seventies by Stanislav Grof who is a psychiatrist, um,

176
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.000
who was one of the first test subjects of LSD.

177
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.770
And he started using LSD at Johns Hopkins and in other universities and found it

178
00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:28.820
had this profound effect for people with schizophrenia and other serious

179
00:10:28.821 --> 00:10:31.310
problems. It got banned in what, 68.

180
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.440
And so he wanted to find a way to allow people to have these experiences without

181
00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:41.300
the drug. And so he developed this specifically to mimic the effects of LSD.

182
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.070
So, and he's, he's written 12 books on this stuff.

183
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.900
Some of the science, mostly the psychology of what's happening with it. Uh,

184
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.740
I wish that there was some more hard science to it. There there's not yet,

185
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.930
but hopefully that's forthcoming in.

186
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.920
<v 0>That number three hours. Is that consistent? They've.</v>

187
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.200
<v 1>Been it. It's interesting when I did this and this, this was several years ago,</v>

188
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.830
it was three hours. So you, you had to go three hours now,

189
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.760
they're they're doing,

190
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.820
I guess that was too hard for a lot of people they're doing these hour sessions,

191
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.580
which is, uh, which is news to me. Um.

192
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.980
<v 0>Yeah, everybody wants to be Swami Rama.</v>

193
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.600
Nobody wants to live in a cave at 30 years. Three hours is the miracle, man.

194
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.370
That's too much time, bro. You.

195
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.870
<v 1>Got it. But if you're going to go into that zone, I think you want the,</v>

196
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.740
the F the full pie. Not, not just the piece. Yeah, I would imagine. Um,

197
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.770
but I guess it's, it's pretty hard for people to do that. For that.

198
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.520
<v 0>I've had some friends who've done the holotropic breathing.</v>

199
00:11:37.521 --> 00:11:39.560
One of the reasons why I asked you this, and, uh,

200
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:44.030
these friends are pretty hardcore psychedelic experimenters,

201
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.040
and they found it very profound.

202
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.810
And they said that they could achieve states that are very similar to, uh,

203
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.280
psychedelic experiences.

204
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.480
<v 1>You hear that all the time and you didn't find that.</v>

205
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.980
I found it very lightly. Uh, I did not go into the,

206
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.300
the spectral universe.

207
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.320
<v 0>And you've done that before. Have you had psychedelic experiences?</v>

208
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.570
<v 1>I have. I went to college. Um, but,</v>

209
00:12:08.571 --> 00:12:11.280
but I did not dabbled too deeply.

210
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.730
<v 0>All these disclaimers. My mom's my mom. I understand. Okay. You can wink.</v>

211
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.100
Okay. I got it.

212
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:27.960
[inaudible].
