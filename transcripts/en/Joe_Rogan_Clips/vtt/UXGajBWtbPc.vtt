00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.600
<v 1>So that there was one other thing that we wanted to talk about when we first</v>

3
00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:10.680
started, one of 'em was Jeffrey Epstein. Do you remember what the other one was?

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.880
You were gonna show me the Jeffrey Epstein. So I got, I'm such a child there's.

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.160
<v 2>Thing. And then George Lopez' comment. Oh, that's.</v>

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.910
<v 1>It. That's it. So, and then there's a, there's a bounty on Trump's.</v>

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.990
<v 2>Head, I guess. I don't know how anyone heard it or where that listed it,</v>

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.830
but I read it on Twitter and then people were making.

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.550
<v 1>Jokes about it. How much is the bounty?</v>

10
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.470
<v 2>80 Million from somewhere in Iran or? I don't know.</v>

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.750
<v 0>If you go to bet DSI, you can &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

12
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.260
<v 1>You'd imagine if they knew Trump, where does the world stand?</v>

13
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.140
If they only drop one nuke and it's on the white house,

14
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.820
small one little baby nuke, just levels the entire building and everything near.

15
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.700
<v 2>It. Well, I, I ran, jumped or dropped out of their, the, uh, nuclear accord.</v>

16
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:57.540
So they're gonna start enriching uranium again.

17
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.900
<v 0>Trump though tweeted,</v>

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.650
I ran does not have any nuclear weapons exclaation point hashtag something.

19
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.370
Right.

20
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.730
<v 1>But they can get 'em. Yeah, this is so crazy.</v>

21
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.680
This seems like for the first time, in a long time,

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.560
I'm thinking we could go to war with a country. Like this seems crazy.

23
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.750
<v 2>The internet jumped into world war II memes immediately, instantly</v>

24
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.230
24 hours of straight jokes.

25
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.230
<v 1>What do you think happens?</v>

26
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.700
<v 2>I don't know. I don't even know what's happening right now.</v>

27
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:36.420
It could be because stuff could be happening right now.

28
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.660
<v 1>It's what did the guy do?</v>

29
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.820
Cuz Dan crechhaw was saying that he organized the attack on the embassy and then

30
00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:46.370
he was organizing other attacks on us sites.

31
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.010
<v 0>He was a bad guy. Supposedly he like, there was,</v>

32
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.450
there is some stuff saying like he is a bad guy.

33
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.410
It's just how Trump did it is how the problem, uh, he did help, uh,

34
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:01.210
fight ISIS a lot. Uh, also, uh, so he, he wasn't,

35
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.560
he was a really bad guy, but there was points like he,

36
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.600
the biggest problem is that Trump just went out and pretty much assassinated

37
00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:10.480
him, you know? Right. Like instead of dealing with it like an adult.

38
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.960
<v 1>Did you imagine when they went through all those other,</v>

39
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:14.880
like really finely detailed points,

40
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.120
this is a strategy we can employ or we just take him out with a missile. Did.

41
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.800
<v 2>He? I read he was trolling Trump too. Like trolling him on Twitter.</v>

42
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.230
I don't know if that was true. &lt;laugh&gt; if that guy had guy was yeah.

43
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:26.064
It's like pop.

44
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.920
<v 1>My, my God.</v>

45
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.590
Could you imagine if that guy was trolling Trump and Trump killed him? Yeah. Oh.

46
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.390
<v 0>My God, God. He was talking about his hands or.</v>

47
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.630
<v 1>Something. Oh my imagine. Imagine he talking about his orange skin,</v>

48
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.070
his fake hair, his baby hands. He's like, oh yeah, baby hands.

49
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.300
&lt;laugh&gt; oh my God. He got into a meanme battle with Trump.

50
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.900
I hope this I might have Googled.

51
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.700
<v 2>It too quick. It could be a fake site. I don't think it is.</v>

52
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.300
<v 1>The daily dot. Is that a fake site?</v>

53
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.820
<v 2>Uh, maybe, maybe it was too quick. I don't know.</v>

54
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.450
<v 0>The.</v>

55
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.040
<v 1>Daily dot I, is that a real.</v>

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.760
<v 2>Website? I want, I I'm trying to confirm. Okay. This other side,</v>

57
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:05.960
these other things look real. I keep his posted. Okay.

58
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.880
I don't want to comment just yet. Yeah.

59
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:09.720
Cause I have a feeling I have a lot to say about this.

60
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.960
&lt;laugh&gt; I wanna see what the memes are. &lt;laugh&gt;.

61
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.400
<v 1>It's so crazy, man. It's so crazy that this, this situation that we find our,</v>

62
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.310
and were none of us who were listening to this,

63
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.550
had anything to do with any of this that might kill a million people.

64
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.750
None of us, none of us. And then our leaders like that,

65
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:32.950
we we've been so roped in this game of Thrones mentality that our,

66
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.550
our leaders are gonna make these critical decisions for us.

67
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.750
And they're gonna be in charge of whether,

68
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:41.300
what kind of diplomas see we employ on, on other natures.

69
00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:44.380
They're gonna represent us in the most personal way possible,

70
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.180
like the way he does it. Like the way Trump does it. That's personal.

71
00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:50.300
That's how he is. So he's standing for us,

72
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.100
but he's standing up for himself as a person. This part of that too, right?

73
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.500
Like he doesn't wanna be with,

74
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.020
he wants you to know the United States not gonna be with me in charge.

75
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.010
And I're like, yo, so it's like him. He's the one out there.

76
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.410
And he's the one they go. You can, you can just N the guy he's like, well. I'll.

77
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:09.570
I'll just N him commander of the Islamic rev, rev,

78
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.370
revolution, guards, corpse, uh, force major general.

79
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.810
How do you say his name? Kasim. Soliani Kasim. Kasim.

80
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:20.840
I don't know how to say the first name. Soloman. I think so.

81
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:22.520
Lemanney responded to us.

82
00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:25.720
President Donald Trump's announcement of sanctions are coming with a game of

83
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:29.120
Thrones, inspired meme of his own. Oh my gosh. And it says,

84
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.800
I will stand against you. And it has the game of Thrones, like, oh,

85
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.920
and you, so he put that up and then Trump. Yeah,

86
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:41.510
this is a couple months ago, but I, but that he remembered this.

87
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.710
<v 2>Is November, uh, 2000.</v>

88
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.430
<v 1>Eighteen's a year ago. So bro, he's got that speed memory. Trump.</v>

89
00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:50.270
Trump can remember. This owes me since the seventies. &lt;laugh&gt; that's crazy.

90
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.110
That is crazy. A guy memes you and then you murder him. Woo

91
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.750
Jesus Christ. Baked Alaska better hide.

92
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.580
<v 2>Game is a game of Thrones.</v>

93
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.060
<v 1>Thing. It's so crazy.</v>

94
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.980
It's so crazy that these worlds have collided.

95
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.180
And then what do you think Putin is probably laughing his off right now.

96
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.100
He's probably got his feet up on the chair, smoking a cigar,

97
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.130
just laughing and laughing, watching his chaos play. And then for sure,

98
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.450
he's gonna help Iran for sure. There anything that,

99
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.850
detabilizes his number one competitor. That's what China's gonna do too.

100
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.770
This is so dumb. It's also scary,

101
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.050
but it's also one of those things where we don't know what the is going on.

102
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.320
So it could have been the right move. We don't know. I mean, it might,

103
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:47.600
it might have been the thing you have to do to avoid more, more deaths. China,

104
00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:52.600
Russia, and Iran hold joint Naval drills in the Gulf. Ofman oh, terrific.

105
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.360
That's great. China, Russia, and Iran together.

106
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.520
We're getting to some world war II here. That's world war II.

107
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.960
That is like when Italy was joined in Germany. I mean, that's what that is.

108
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.800
You should probably get away from the coast, bro. &lt;laugh&gt; imagine imaginesion.

109
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.200
If this guy gets us into world war II,

110
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.630
by deciding to do that and then have these crazy threats,

111
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.110
see the rest of the world does not want to thing. This is one of the things like

112
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.510
if you think you're the baddest and you represent the baddest country,

113
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.830
you gotta kind of almost be like a real baddest.

114
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.230
Like a guy like Steve Amio, Chich like a UFC heavyweight champ.

115
00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:37.500
They don't go around saying they're gonna kick her everybody's.

116
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.020
Cuz everybody already knows it. And if you, you,

117
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.900
you start saying that you're gonna be able to do whatever you want

118
00:06:45.901 --> 00:06:49.860
and maybe even do it in a disproportionate manner. All the other countries,

119
00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:54.020
like why do you have any power? Like who are you man? And they say like,

120
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:55.660
where we're really powerful. We all get together.

121
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.650
You can pre you're pretending you're more are powerful than everybody.

122
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.250
That's a weird thing to do.

123
00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:05.170
It's a weird chess puffing strategy to take on a country that has allies.

124
00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:08.290
That's where it gets up. It's not just Iran, Iran.

125
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.010
It's all Iran's allies. They all get together.

126
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.530
Now you have a giant force of people and nuclear weapons. Congratulations.

127
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.480
Did you guys play chess or did you play checkers growing up?

128
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.120
How the are you just a tic TAC, toe ACE. And you didn't see this coming.

129
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.620
This is why it's really important to have, you know,

130
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.260
people have to be able to talk, be able to have dialogue.

131
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.740
<v 2>You see this tweet.</v>

132
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.740
<v 1>That he said before, the one yeah.</v>

133
00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:40.090
Targeted 52 Iranian sites representing the 52 American host just taken by Iran

134
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.730
many years ago, bro. That was during the Carter administration.

135
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.770
I think we can let that go&lt;laugh&gt; it's not the same people.

136
00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:51.650
Those people are all dead. This that's crazy. So this is more team mentality.

137
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.210
Yeah, but that'll get the Yos all the. Yeah.

138
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.130
All the dudes just jump off the tractor,

139
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.720
jacking off into the fields and they hear that like yeah, get him Trump.

140
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.560
Woo. This could get hot.

141
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.680
It could get hot and it could get real.

142
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.800
And if he really has the ability to do that,

143
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.160
what other calls does he have the ability to do?

144
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.800
Is there ever gonna be another moment like that?

145
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:20.110
Where I ran boxes in a ship and then he sends in a fight or

146
00:08:20.111 --> 00:08:23.630
jet, I mean, is this gonna really happen?

147
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.350
Because then none of us can go anywhere.

148
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.950
We have to hide and we gotta get outta LA. Cuz it're definitely gonna nuke that.

149
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.150
Like this is because imagine the movie,

150
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:39.310
if it all played out like that in like a Stephen King movie made a thing about a

151
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:39.991
game show host,

152
00:08:39.991 --> 00:08:43.340
that event becomes the president of the United States and starts a war while

153
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:44.660
he's on speed. &lt;laugh&gt;.

154
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.780
<v 2>I do that every day when.</v>

155
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.220
<v 1>I'm really high. Well now I'm getting there. I was not getting there before.</v>

156
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.200
Um, this was enough to make me go, holy. Like,

157
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:02.160
is there a better way to handle that than blasting that guy with a robot from

158
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:06.920
the sky? Like what did we start? I don't know, man.

159
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.960
It's I don't wanna know. Right?

160
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.750
You don't wanna know that all over the world, these little pieces are in motion.

161
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.670
They're trying to protect us from terrorists,

162
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:19.630
trying to make sure that they stop ISIS.

163
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.150
And this sect is growing here and these people are getting shot there.

164
00:09:23.151 --> 00:09:25.550
And what about the cartels? And they're getting up this much. You,

165
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.230
if you would be paralyzed by fear,

166
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.950
if you took in all the information on all the danger all over the world,

167
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.990
you'd be paralyzed by fears. I.

168
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.380
<v 2>I was when I was in Vegas while this was happening this weekend,</v>

169
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.060
if you didn't look at your phone, you wouldn't have known yeah.

170
00:09:40.061 --> 00:09:42.660
Any of this was going on. No, I didn't hear anybody talking about it.

171
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.420
<v 1>Yeah. I didn't either. It walk, call around.</v>

172
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.900
That was the good thing about being off social media. And this is,

173
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.580
was my point in the first place. By the time things get to me,

174
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.020
it's it's already been sort of distributed better. You know, I get a, you know,

175
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:56.370
I'll have to do jump on right away.

176
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.890
And then it becomes the focus of my day long before we know anything.

177
00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:04.850
And I keep refreshing CNN every five minutes. I'm scared,

178
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.090
like legitimately this is like for the first time in a long time I'm since like

179
00:10:10.091 --> 00:10:13.850
nine 11 where I'm legitimately like, oh, oh this is, this is some real.

180
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.200
This could be really bad because if he says he's gonna do something in a

181
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:23.080
disproportionate manner, he's threatening them. He's calling their bluff.

182
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.000
Brothers is so dangerous, so dangerous because all they have to do is just new.

183
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:33.000
Kaua do something like that. Where the rest of the world would be like, Hey,

184
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.870
Hey, Hey, Hey, what are we gonna do in kill each other? Everywhere one,

185
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.590
cuz that's what could happen.

186
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.430
This like mutually assured destruction was always supposed to be the,

187
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.110
the big impediment that mutually assured destruction.

188
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.030
If we knew that if we shot them, they'd shoot us. We'd all be dead.

189
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.990
That that's what kept us from using bombs. But who the knows, man?

190
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.430
What if I ran just says, listen,

191
00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:00.300
if we just sneak a bomb and by the time it's detonated,

192
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.700
they won't even have a chance to respond. The whole system will be.

193
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.820
Their grid will be down. All their entertainment will be down.

194
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:09.820
Everything will be down.

195
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.780
And then the rest of the world can figure out a way to unite together and take

196
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:17.890
over the power that the United States wants and to joy,

197
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.250
they were abusing that power.

198
00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.770
They were the number one superpower in the world and they let their guy take

199
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:27.050
diet pills and threaten everybody on Twitter. &lt;laugh&gt;

200
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.930
I don't know if he takes diet pills. He had 'em in his dresser,

201
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.570
but I don't even know if those are his &lt;laugh&gt;. I just wanna say.

202
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:46.880
<v 3>So.</v>
