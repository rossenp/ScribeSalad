00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
<v 0>Door.</v>

2
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.080
If you were living in the 1950s and someone brought you to 2018 and picked you

3
00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:08.400
up from the airport in a Tesla, you're on a plane. Seems normal. Yeah.

4
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:11.360
You're on a plane. Just like planes. What are these screens on the seats? Holy.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.560
Yeah. There's screens in the seats and someone picks you up in a Tesla.

6
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.480
It doesn't make any noise. It's electric.

7
00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:19.400
There's a giant laptop in the front of it. Yeah. That shows this huge map.

8
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.590
And you're driving around out and people are taking phone calls in the air.

9
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.750
Yeah. They just, Hey, what's up Mike? You're like what?

10
00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:26.790
You're talking in the car.

11
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.430
What the you driving around to all these different places. And,

12
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.990
and you see the, the,

13
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.430
the mass of humans and the architecture change and people would freak the out.

14
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.670
Sure. The, with the,

15
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.740
and this is the world that we've totally become accustomed to. That's right.

16
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.100
And no one, this is no one's prepared for this.

17
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.740
We're all just playing it on ear. And the, the worst aspects of it, the,

18
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:54.340
some of the chaos and the social upheaval and the, the way the,

19
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.100
I mean the infighting between people, people getting kicked outta restaurants,

20
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.300
cause they work for the wrong people. And, but this,

21
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.210
if you see max waters telling people that if you find people that it work for

22
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:06.850
the Trump administration, you find them in a restaurant,

23
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.690
you find them anywhere you go and you get together a group of people,

24
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:15.210
you build a crowd and you let them know that you don't agree with their policies

25
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.090
like whoa, we're calling for gangs.

26
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.640
We're calling for gangs of people randomly in the street, interrupt S meals,

27
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.800
interrupt people in stores, get a crowd together. Don't let them be in,

28
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.440
be safe in public. Cause you disagree with their policies. Woo.

29
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.160
This is getting crazy. And I know one of the policies of the immigrants,

30
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.440
the children of immigrants being separated from their parents,

31
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:39.600
which I'm a hundred percent with you. It's imoral, it's disgusting.

32
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.030
It's saddens me. That it's even considered an option. It makes no sense.

33
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.790
I don't give a. If they broke the law,

34
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:49.350
you don't take parents and kids and separate them. You just don't.

35
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.430
It'ss disgusting. There's other ways around it. If you're saying whoa,

36
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.310
they shouldn't have broke the law. Maybe they shouldn't have broke the law.

37
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.830
You don't get to do something.

38
00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:59.470
That's a thousand times worse than crossing a line.

39
00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:04.220
The dirt that imaginary line of the dirt crossing is nothing

40
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.180
in comparison to your crime of stealing a baby from its mother. That's insane.

41
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.540
That's not America in 2018. That's just insane.

42
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.700
And we wouldn't be doing that to Canadians. Okay?

43
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.820
If Canadians came over here with their beautiful, cute blondehaired kids,

44
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.660
we're not stealing 'em from their parents.

45
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.610
And that's one of the reasons why it's sick. The whole thing's sick. It's chaos.

46
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.970
So in one, one hand, on one hand,

47
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.170
I understand where a lot of people are outraged.

48
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:31.330
And I understand where they're coming from.

49
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.930
You shouldn't separate parents from the children in any way, shape or form.

50
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.690
But the way to fix that is not saying anybody who's on that team

51
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.520
and working for that administration should be chased by a mob of street

52
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.720
vigilantes. And you should encourage this. Mom, make a crowd,

53
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.240
get everybody together, make a crowd, make some noise,

54
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.200
let them know they're not welcome. Like, whoa.

55
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.720
<v 1>Well, isn't it isn't like who one of the,</v>

56
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.400
one of the problems with it is that we, now we have a little bit of a, a,

57
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.280
a slippery slope. Like we let's, you know,

58
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.080
I don't wanna play mob justice,

59
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.840
ping pong with you. Right. Because if I start playing that with you,

60
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.960
then that ping pong could potentially turn into a civil war.

61
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.841
<v 0>Oh yeah.</v>

62
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:20.670
Do you know there was a recent USA today poll that said 31% of America thinks

63
00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:21.910
that we're close to a civil war.

64
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.790
<v 1>Right now. Now that being said, and,</v>

65
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.630
and also people who like fantasize about a, a civil war.

66
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.790
I don't know if they've really thought it out all the way,

67
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.270
like what that looks like.

68
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.300
<v 0>I can answer that for you. They do definitely haven't right.</v>

69
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.660
So they definitely haven't.

70
00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:45.140
Cause if they did and they thought it threw and thought it was a good idea,

71
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.380
they're outta their minds. They're crazy. Or they're stupid.

72
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.580
<v 1>Yeah. But, but, but the, the real, I was really passionate about that in other,</v>

73
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.700
yeah, man. Well, I mean, because who, who wants to be in a civil war,

74
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.530
but the, the, the, the you for me,

75
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.610
when I see like that going down, um,

76
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.150
I, I see, I I've like come up with, like,

77
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.950
I didn't come up with, I got it from the doai Lama,

78
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.430
but I've come up with like a good little equation to,

79
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.790
to go back to mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, which is,

80
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.140
does this to reduce suffering. Right? So like,

81
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.940
and I don't think it, it reduces suffering and,

82
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.860
and these people who are really upset on both sides of the fence are

83
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:32.860
suffering. Like we're,

84
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.540
we're really looking at like a world where a lot of people are deeply

85
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.650
upset and deeply suffering and really, and really, really,

86
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.010
really freaking the out. And,

87
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.010
and as I've been watching this thing emerge on the

88
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.130
internet on Twitter,

89
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.370
where people tweet things that paint that,

90
00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:57.490
where you look at it,

91
00:04:57.491 --> 00:05:02.040
and you think it's almost as though you're living in another world than I am

92
00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:06.080
like the world that you're, you're talking about, man,

93
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.200
it's terrifying. Like it's scary. And it's like, it's,

94
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.360
it's really up.

95
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.160
And maybe like the reason I think that is because I started

96
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.560
doing LSD when I was 16. So when I was,

97
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.310
when I was sick 16, I,

98
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.150
I became brutally aware of the fact that

99
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.230
the current government and the past government was

100
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.910
repressive. And, and, and I, and something about that drug,

101
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.990
which I don't do anymore &lt;laugh&gt; cuz it's illegal. I was a crazy kid.

102
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.820
But something about that drug really shows you the

103
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.420
conditioning. Right?

104
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.140
And so I knew from pretty young age, I was like,

105
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.820
oh wow. I don't, I don't think the United States is,

106
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.520
is dropping bombs on other countries because of justice or some threat.

107
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.400
It appears to be that some people are making money off of this.

108
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.240
And I don't think these drugs are illegal because they're bad for you.

109
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.000
I think they're illegal because somebody doesn't want, um,

110
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.950
the heard to experience these states of consciousness,

111
00:06:17.951 --> 00:06:20.670
cuz it will make them more difficult to shear.

112
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.150
<v 0>I had this conversation with Hamilton Morris yesterday and he strongly disagrees</v>

113
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.230
cuz he's talked to the people actually in the DEA,

114
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.870
he's talked to the people in drug enforcement. Oh sure.

115
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.750
And he said that what really is happening is they have zero experience with

116
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:34.630
these drugs, but they know these drugs are illegal.

117
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.100
And so they pursue it as if it's a, a, a viable target.

118
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.260
And we talked about it in terms of like the real problem with law enforcement

119
00:06:41.261 --> 00:06:42.220
being that it's a game.

120
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.780
I've always said that like the real problem with cops is not cops.

121
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.980
The real problem with cops is human nature. This is a bad guy. I get a point.

122
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.980
If I take em out, you start looking for bad guys.

123
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.700
You start looking for bad guys that aren't even there,

124
00:06:53.701 --> 00:06:55.460
you start forcing situations. Yeah.

125
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.100
<v 1>Yeah. I know we get it becomes.</v>

126
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.370
<v 0>We yeah. Sorry.</v>

127
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.490
<v 1>Yeah, no, go ahead. We get into this a lot. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I,</v>

128
00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:04.290
and I don't mean the DEA. Like I've heard the exact same thing about the DEA.

129
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.730
Like they don't, they many.

130
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.730
<v 0>I don't even think people above them have experience with it.</v>

131
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.770
<v 1>Oh I'm I'm not even. So I'm not even talking about people above them.</v>

132
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.650
I'm talking about tendencies. So like if an individual has a tendency, right.

133
00:07:16.651 --> 00:07:21.640
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, uh, um, tendency. So a person has a tendency.

134
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.440
Then a group of people might have a tendency. For example, if I get a group of,

135
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.280
um, Swedish people together and I'd bring them to the world cup,

136
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.720
they're gonna have the tendency to cheer for Sweden. Right.

137
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.160
I'm gonna bet on that. I didn't gamble on that. There's a tendency. Right,

138
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:41.950
right. Right. My but boss sucks. He's a. Right.

139
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.070
Right. Then you think back to the way,

140
00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:46.430
all your other bosses acted and you realize like, wait,

141
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:50.910
there seems to be a tendency when people are in that position of power

142
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.910
to behave in a certain way. Yeah. Right. Yeah. It's.

143
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.910
<v 0>Hard, hard.</v>

144
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.790
<v 1>Job. So, so, but what I'm saying is,</v>

145
00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.660
is the person who's in the position of power or is that thing coming from inside

146
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:06.500
of them or is it that there's something like built in to the DNA of a

147
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:09.620
leadership position? They say that like in the same way,

148
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:10.900
like when you got a pregnant wife,

149
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.300
some new thing kicks in and I was reading about it, built in,

150
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:19.100
it feels like where it's like, I'm getting a security system. I'm like,

151
00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:22.490
you know what I mean, mean I wanna make her safe. I wanna make sure that like,

152
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.850
we're, we're saving money. We're like, you know what I mean?

153
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.170
I'm working harder than I've ever worked in my life.

154
00:08:28.171 --> 00:08:31.730
Cuz I wanna make sure that like there's plenty for her and plenty for the kid

155
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.970
and like something kicks in, there's a tendency there. Right? Right.

156
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.890
So what I'm saying is there seems to be a tendency.

157
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.480
See that happens when there is a, a,

158
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.080
a convergence of people in power, right. It starts behaving in a certain way.

159
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.280
It builds walls. It starts taking people to jail who don't belong in jail.

160
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.680
It dehumanizes essentially that's the tendency. Right?

161
00:08:57.681 --> 00:09:01.720
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so when you're taking a psychedelic and you look around and

162
00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:05.120
you realize, oh, I see the government though.

163
00:09:05.121 --> 00:09:07.560
It's filled with people who are wonderful.

164
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:12.440
There are people in the DEA who listen to your show and guaranteed love the

165
00:09:12.441 --> 00:09:14.000
show and are like, you're right, man.

166
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.190
I don't wanna force these laws or arresting people for a thing that is like

167
00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:19.870
being shown not only to be harmless,

168
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.390
but potentially therapeutic there's people in all branches of government.

169
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:27.710
And there's some people who just need a job and maybe there's some in there.

170
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.350
Well, it's some.

171
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.430
<v 0>People that want to bust crack dealers. Yeah.</v>

172
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.950
They wanna bust that are killing people that happen to also be drug dealers.

173
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:34.950
And this is part of the job.

174
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.680
<v 1>Right?</v>

175
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.300
So I'm not talking about the individual atomic structure of the power

176
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.460
structure. I'm talking about the sum, total convergence,

177
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.820
the gestalt of the thing, emanates certain behavior patterns. Right.

178
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.180
And those behavior patterns,

179
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.300
those behavior patterns have been going on for a very long time.

180
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:56.930
And so forever.

181
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.050
<v 0>Forever, as far as we know, right. There's always.</v>

182
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.290
<v 1>Been Kings. Yeah. So now I'm not saying like, therefore your fear,</v>

183
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.810
your terror is unjustified.

184
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.690
I just think maybe because of the garishness of the, uh,

185
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:14.050
current Amir administration compared to like Obama, who is like, you know,

186
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.520
we know what happened with Obama and, and an essay.

187
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.520
We know what happened with Obama and the drones. We know what happened. Well,

188
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:23.000
we don't know what all the that probably happened with Obama,

189
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.680
but we do know with Obama and,

190
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.000
and I remember hearing this and then looking it up and then looking it up again.

191
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.720
Uh, he apparently like deported. In fact, maybe,

192
00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:34.440
please find out if I'm wrong about this.

193
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:38.590
So I don't have to deal with 7 billion people calling me a for the rest of my

194
00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:39.210
life.

195
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.990
But apparently he deported more people than any than all

196
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.190
American presidents combined. His administration did. Right.

197
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.510
Deported more people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and so now Trump,

198
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.150
he he's at the beginning of the deportation race. Yeah.

199
00:10:55.151 --> 00:10:59.060
Like by the time he's done, he might have beaten a Obama score by a long shot.

200
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.820
I don't know. But the mean thing is what I'm saying here is like,

201
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.180
I think I've been aware of the fact that there is something wonky going

202
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.820
on and it's wonky in the most rotten brutal way.

203
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.620
It's wonky in the sense that it kills people.

204
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.050
It separates children from not just of immigrants, but of farmers.

205
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.450
Some people were growing marijuana and guaranteed,

206
00:11:23.451 --> 00:11:27.250
their kids are in foster care now and they're in jail. Right.

207
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.530
This has been going on and on and on and on.

208
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.490
I think maybe now what's great about the fear that we're seeing and the

209
00:11:33.491 --> 00:11:38.320
hyperreaction is if there is anything great about it is that people

210
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.720
are waking up to the fact that our government right now,

211
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.320
the American government is out of balance.

212
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.640
We've been at war for 90% of our history. Right.

213
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:54.520
And there's a lot of going on in there that doesn't need to be going on and

214
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:58.360
we're waking up to it. It's just, some people are like, they're waking up to it.

215
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:00.800
Like they were asleep and someone threw water in their face. Yeah.

216
00:12:00.801 --> 00:12:05.280
And they're like, holy. Holy. This is like, you know,

217
00:12:05.281 --> 00:12:08.280
this happened, this sounds condescending. I don't mean it to be.

218
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.840
But when I was like, like 18 or 17,

219
00:12:10.841 --> 00:12:13.430
looking at a dollar bill tripping balls,

220
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.950
looking at that green pyramid and the weird symbols, and then thinking like,

221
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:22.550
wait a minute, this, this is covered with a cult.

222
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.150
Symbolology all over it all over it. And then thinking like, wait a minute,

223
00:12:26.151 --> 00:12:29.590
wait, there's something, this should, this should,

224
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.590
this isn't really worth anything.

225
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:36.180
Like this is just pay paper and then setting it on fire, you know,

226
00:12:36.181 --> 00:12:38.820
just to do like the worst thing, like a uniting. That's a joke.

227
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.900
<v 0>Obviously, cuz it's illegal to set it on fire. Right?</v>

228
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.380
<v 1>Yeah. Of course it's a joke. I would never do that, man. No way. I never,</v>

229
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.740
ever in a million years would ignite currency, not with old glory,

230
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.460
not with old glory, not with the money, but I, I guess what I'm saying is like,

231
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.850
if there is something positive about, and I don't, I,

232
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.250
the mobs of people doing this or that, or the,

233
00:12:57.251 --> 00:13:00.250
or the hyper outrage almost as though,

234
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:02.210
like we're looking at an immuneant response,

235
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.090
like that's kind of going overboard. Yes. Right, exactly like that.

236
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.290
But if there's something positive in it it's that it seems that huge

237
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:15.760
swaths of people are becoming familiar with the machinations

238
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.680
of the American empire and understanding that here's how it's working right

239
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.240
now. And um, well.

240
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.070
<v 0>Not only that,</v>

241
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:28.680
like this illusion that it worked far differently when Obama was in office,

242
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.960
like have you seen that video or Obama was running for president and he started

243
00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:37.510
talking about to deal with immigration and the immigration policies. No,

244
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.670
it's a disturbing video because it's a Republican viewpoint.

245
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.430
He's the way he's talking about it.

246
00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:47.710
It sounds like someone running for a conservative position now. Right?

247
00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.510
It's not like this democratic socialist idea of eliminating ice. You know,

248
00:13:51.511 --> 00:13:53.390
there's a lot of people that their, their,

249
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.460
their idea is that immigra and customs enforcement,

250
00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:59.340
that those people are monsters and we should eliminate the position.

251
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.580
We shouldn't have it anymore and we should have open borders. Right. And those,

252
00:14:02.581 --> 00:14:05.900
those PE same people would love to have Obama in office. &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

253
00:14:05.901 --> 00:14:08.660
they would think that it would be great if Obama was here. Boy,

254
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.660
it was so much better when Obama was get back, play that video,

255
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.100
find the video of Obama. Uh, I think it was,

256
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.730
is I wanna say 2000 and just nine,

257
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.770
seven or seven or eight or something like that. Yeah. Something like that.

258
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.570
But it's one of those ones where you're like, whoa, wait a minute. What?

259
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.730
200 five, actually 2005. Um, you watch it and you go, what? Yeah.

260
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.690
Wow. Like this sounds like a Republican, like imagine let's just imagine. Yeah.

261
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.360
And imagine this is a young blonde white man.

262
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.600
Who's uh, saying this in 2018, right? Listen, this, listen, listen to his,

263
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:45.620
his position.

264
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.280
<v 1>All right, dude, with one of those like square mustach we all agree.</v>

265
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:53.360
<v 2>On the need to better secure the border and to punish employers who</v>

266
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:56.600
choose to hire illegal immigrants. Uh, you know,

267
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:59.440
we are a generous and welcoming people here in the United States,

268
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.720
but those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect

269
00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:04.280
the.

270
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.480
<v 1>Rule of law. Wait, can you pause that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</v>

271
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.310
May I ask for a pause? What's the date on that video? 2005.

272
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.190
That's for sure. The date on the actual upload flashback.

273
00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.630
<v 0>2005 Cent, uh, Senator Obama, humbl legal.</v>

274
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.230
<v 1>Immigration publish on January 31st, 2000. What does that? Seven. 17. Okay.</v>

275
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.230
Now here's the thing, man. His lips look, I I've looked. That might be.

276
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.790
I've looked up that Obama has deported more people than any American president,

277
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.460
but we have to be very careful these days.

278
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.980
Cuz if you look his lips aren't tracking. Oh, let.

279
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.900
<v 0>Me see. Let me see. Yeah. Go back and look at the.</v>

280
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.540
<v 2>They are showing disregard for those who are following the law. I see.</v>

281
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.660
See a little bit oh, simply cannot.

282
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.180
<v 0>Talking about yeah. Oh yeah. Does not tracking at all. Well, why don't you?</v>

283
00:15:45.181 --> 00:15:48.340
Well, some would know if that was a real CSPAN thing. Well, well.

284
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.220
<v 1>This, I think we need to need to better.</v>

285
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.170
<v 2>Secure the border and a punish employees.</v>

286
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.290
I don't think that choose to hire illegal.

287
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.050
<v 1>Immigrants. I'm I'm not saying this cuz I'm shocked the yeah.</v>

288
00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.130
<v 0>But it's just off, but it's the same words we all agree.</v>

289
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.223
<v 2>On.</v>

290
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.930
<v 0>He's saying the same words. Well, can we Google?</v>

291
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.770
Let's find a version of it where it doesn't do that.

292
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.730
<v 1>Yeah. Sorry. You guys these days, man. I like, we have to be be so like,</v>

293
00:16:08.731 --> 00:16:11.250
and this is a, we're gonna deal with even more like,

294
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.680
and also I'm a not saying like you would never do that. I'm just saying like,

295
00:16:14.681 --> 00:16:17.120
that looks a little fishy, but you can just look up.

296
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.080
Did Obama deport more people than you? That's what I was looking.

297
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.920
<v 3>Up before you asked me to find a video and I'm finding various problems in the,</v>

298
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:27.400
that statement or statistics. So ifnos has it,

299
00:16:27.401 --> 00:16:31.240
but they've changed it to a mixture instead of being true or false because the

300
00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:35.230
definition of a deport ation was changed at some point in the last couple years.

301
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.230
<v 1>The point is he deported a lot of people, you know? Like,</v>

302
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.390
I don't know like how many or I don't know. He wasn't.

303
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.870
<v 0>Justin truau he wasn't just open borders. Exactly. Letting everybody in.</v>

304
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.830
<v 1>But dude, well let's please find out if that clip was.</v>

305
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.430
<v 0>Actually said. I think we would know. We would know if that clip was.</v>

306
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.870
There's no way they would just let it slide. Right? If Obama never,

307
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.740
that there's no way they would just let that stay. I'.

308
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.300
<v 1>Just like to see one where it was synced.</v>

309
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.380
<v 0>Well, the, it would,</v>

310
00:16:57.381 --> 00:17:00.780
you would kind of know because that's a pretty famous clip and it gets used all

311
00:17:00.781 --> 00:17:02.220
the time to participate on.

312
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.140
<v 2>In these negotiations. She spans website.</v>

313
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.260
We all agree on the need to better secure. Okay.

314
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.100
<v 1>Sorry guys. What's.</v>
