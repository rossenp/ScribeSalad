00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>More interesting stories out of the last decade or so was, um,</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.460
this story that I read about these scholars in Jerusalem

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.470
that were connecting the story of Moses and the burning

4
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:16.950
Bush to the Acacia Bush and the Acacia tree,

5
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:21.150
which is rich and DMT. And they believe that, you know,

6
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:25.620
when you're talking about a story that was told through oral

7
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:27.810
traditions for who knows how many years,

8
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:32.760
and then written down in ancient Hebrew and then transcribed

9
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.680
and, you know,

10
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.050
and translated to Greek and Latin and all these days,

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.550
there's a lot lost in the mix.

12
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.800
And they believe that what that story might have been about

13
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.370
of Moses coming down from Mount Sinai,

14
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:54.660
with the tablets and having the experience with meeting God in a burning Bush,

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.310
that this is in fact was a dine methyl trip to me and experience maybe.

16
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.863
Yeah.

17
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.360
<v 1>It's a big, maybe I can say that. Um,</v>

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.100
if you go to the south of Mexico and Chiapas, there's a tree that grows,

19
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:14.430
there is a weed called mimosa hostility. Maybe you're familiar with it.

20
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.150
And this is so abundant that it's used to make fence posts.

21
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.880
All the fences on the side of the road are made of most Ostelis,

22
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.460
it's used as firewood to cook meals.

23
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.680
The air smells like DMT because people are using it as fuel all over

24
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:29.514
the place.

25
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.690
Not a single person that I spoke with was aware that it was psychoactive.

26
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.680
And these are people that are burning it all the time.

27
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.220
<v 0>Did they get high from it?</v>

28
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:41.760
Is there like if you were in a tent or something like that, and you were doing,

29
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.850
uh, a hot box sorta scenario, would you get high from it?

30
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.070
<v 1>I saw a note. Would you,</v>

31
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.320
it may be it's about 2% DMT, so.

32
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.200
<v 0>You'd probably have to get so sick from coughing.</v>

33
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.520
<v 1>And yeah, it would be a very, I mean, even just smoking pure crystal DMT,</v>

34
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.200
it can be very difficult for some people.

35
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:05.340
So my guess not to be like a wet blanket,

36
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.390
but my guess is not really. Um,

37
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.260
and that's a very strong source as strong as maybe there's, uh,

38
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.700
some Acacia is stronger,

39
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.700
but that's certainly comparable and that's something people are using to cook

40
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:19.890
food all the time and they're not aware that it's psychoactive. So.

41
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.260
<v 0>So was there a way,</v>

42
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:27.180
or is there a way for a person living thousands of years ago to somehow or

43
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:30.690
another extract DMT from something like the Acacia tree?

44
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.320
<v 1>Um, that's, uh, I actually spent some time thinking about that a while ago.</v>

45
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.080
It would be, first of all,

46
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:43.860
depends on how you define extraction if it were to, in like an Iowasca sense,

47
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:45.630
like a T of course. Yes.

48
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:49.050
But then they would need some sort of enzyme inhibitor to create the Iowasca.

49
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.460
If it were to create, uh, an isolated smokable form, again, you know,

50
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:56.970
you could just do like an aqueous infusion and then dry that out and maybe smoke

51
00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:01.600
that. But in terms of like a real extraction that would produce crystals of DMT,

52
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.170
I don't know what the non-polar solvent they would be using to extract a

53
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.090
freebase would be like butter or something.

54
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:08.830
And then how would you get rid of the butter.

55
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.120
<v 0>The process?</v>

56
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:14.590
Like if you're going to take a tree that's rich and DMT and extract EMT from it,

57
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.420
what, what do you have to use?

58
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.880
<v 1>Uh, have you ever done it before? No, I've never done it. Oh, okay. Well, it's,</v>

59
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.180
um,

60
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.860
it's a very generalizable and simple process that applies to almost everything

61
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:30.400
in chemistry. It's, you know, sometimes it's called an acid base extraction.

62
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.760
Most people that are in the DMT community go,

63
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.280
something they call straight to base. And the, you know,

64
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:40.510
the idea is that the side chain of the DMT molecule contains a basic nitrogen

65
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.050
that if it's protonated in an acidic solution,

66
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.440
then it's water soluble. And if it's deprotonated,

67
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.530
then it's only soluble in a non-polar solvent.

68
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.880
So what you do is you just de protonate the nitrogen with a base

69
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.270
potassium, hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide typically,

70
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.050
and then treat that aqueous basic solution with a non-polar solvent,

71
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:06.250
like NAFTA and isolate the NAFTA,

72
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.420
dry it out, and you have your material. And that applies to everything.

73
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:13.210
That's not a DMT specific process,

74
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:17.560
but that's what people do everything with the basic nitrogen. Now.

75
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.050
<v 0>What's the earliest history of extraction.</v>

76
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.640
<v 1>Do we will, you know,</v>

77
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:25.990
the first wave of DMT use in the United States was all synthetic. In fact,

78
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.590
DMT was discovered synthetically before it was ever found in nature.

79
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.900
The same is true of five MEO DMT how'd. They do that.

80
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.060
There was a Canadian chemist named Richard Hellmuth, Mansky, who,

81
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.950
um, I believe was looking at different alkaloids in strawberry plants.

82
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.690
And he was synthesizing references for these potential strawberry alkaloids and

83
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.231
made DMT.

84
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:50.380
So he didn't know what he had made other than a potential natural product found

85
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:52.360
in strawberries. And, um,

86
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.190
and then it wasn't until Sarah much later conducted self experiments with

87
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:00.910
injected DMT that people became fully aware of its psychoactivity.

88
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:04.480
And then people started finding it in plants. I mean, the 1950s were like, uh,

89
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.950
an early sixties were of course,

90
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:09.100
a fascinating time in psychedelic research because you have these convergences

91
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:12.730
of these amazing ideas. First, you have the discovery of serotonin,

92
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.330
which is like, you know, we take this for granted.

93
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:19.120
Now it's in television commercials, but this was of course,

94
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:20.220
something that no one knew about.

95
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.750
And suddenly they're finding this in all kinds of different animals.

96
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:27.590
Initially it was in the salivary glands of squid and, um, in different animals.

97
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.260
And then they're finding it in the human intestine.

98
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.170
Then they're also finding that all of these plants,

99
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.850
the people worshiped in various indigenous societies also contain

100
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:37.990
serotonin like molecules.

101
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.770
Then they discover LSD and find that that's maybe the most potent known

102
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.360
pharmacological agent at that time.

103
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.190
And it binds to serotonin receptors.

104
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:51.970
It activates a serotonin type response in isolated tissue.

105
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.830
So there's like this weird triple convergence of information,

106
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.660
potent amazing compound LSD is discovered.

107
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.020
Serotonin is discovered in all these different organisms and there's a kind of

108
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.760
pharmacological convergence between the two of them.

109
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:07.730
And then you have all these people worshiping serotonin molecules.

110
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.890
So there was a lot of enthusiasm at that time to figure all of this

111
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:13.724
out.

112
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.130
<v 0>So in terms of history, so we're talking to like somewhere in the 1950s,</v>

113
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.900
they started extracting TMT the use of it orally dates back far

114
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.580
longer than that because of use of Mao inhibitors and creating Iowasca.

115
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.940
But in terms of the first extraction,

116
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.250
we can kind of plan to smoke.

117
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.890
<v 1>Yeah. It might've been, even later, it might've been in the.</v>

118
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.240
<v 0>Eighties. Okay.</v>

119
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.290
So the idea that people thousands of years ago

120
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.220
were able to do something along those lines is probably,

121
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.700
probably not accurate because they're talking about a burning Bush.

122
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.380
That's why it's appealing to people, right?

123
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.390
The idea of Moses D do you think that maybe the understanding of sin

124
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.640
synthesis from the, you know,

125
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.460
synthesizing this from these scholars,

126
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.760
maybe they don't have enough of an understanding of chemistry?

127
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.390
<v 1>Well, what would be really interesting is to do an experiment,</v>

128
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.450
to see what were the materials that were available,

129
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:13.040
how would this have been done?

130
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.830
Would you have to use butter as your non-polar solvent?

131
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.090
How well would that work?

132
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:19.490
What would your butter preparation be done when you put it?

133
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:22.010
Would you take it rectally then? Is that how it would work? I mean,

134
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:24.080
you have to kind of, what would your base have been?

135
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.740
<v 0>Well, I think they were talking about it being something from, I mean, burning,</v>

136
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:28.760
right. A burning Bush.

137
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.250
Maybe it's just one of those things that sort of gets conflated, right?

138
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:35.600
Because you have people today that are very aware that people smoke DMT and have

139
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:39.350
these incredibly intense religious psychedelic experiences.

140
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.030
And then maybe they looked at the Acacia Bush and said, oh, the Acacia bushes,

141
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:48.110
rich and DMT, that's probably where the Moses story came.

142
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.570
<v 1>Right. Well, what's really interesting is, you know,</v>

143
00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:52.640
DMT has never been found in the human brain,

144
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.190
even though Rick Strassman says that it has been.

145
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.990
So a lot of people are constantly assigning altered states of consciousness to

146
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:04.340
DMT, but we can have these states without DMT. I mean,

147
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:06.110
maybe it's never been found in the human brain,

148
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:10.850
but also there's ethical and experimental issues with sampling fluid from a

149
00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:12.020
living humans brain. Right.

150
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.040
<v 0>And it has, they have founded in living rats. This is fairly recently,</v>

151
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.220
this is the Cottonwood research foundation. That's their, their,

152
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:24.050
their attempt is to try to prove that the pineal gland is a source

153
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.470
for DMT. We know the DMT exists in the human body.

154
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:30.170
We know that the liver produces it and we know that the lungs produce it.

155
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.060
We're not totally aware of whether or not there's anecdotal evidence that points

156
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:36.050
to the pineal gland.

157
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.630
<v 1>Based on the rat idea and based on the presence of certain enzymes,</v>

158
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:45.950
that could be responsible for it. But even if it is even if it is then what,

159
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.420
there's still a whole question of, how is it released? How is it distributed?

160
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.920
What receptors does it activate?

161
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:56.400
And is it even necessary as an explanation for altered states of consciousness?

162
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:58.980
Because there are other things in the brain other than DMT,

163
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.530
DMT has never even been found in the room, but there are other things, you know,

164
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:05.880
you have endogenous proteins that bind to the Kappa opioid receptor,

165
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:10.230
the same receptor that, um, is responsible for the effect of salvia, um,

166
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.330
things like that. They create responsible. I mean,

167
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:16.950
even carbon dioxide itself can induce a pretty strong

168
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:18.690
altered state of consciousness. Right.

169
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.580
<v 0>Which is why people like those psychedelic breathing exercises they're</v>

170
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.250
sort of, is it like hypoxic? Is that what it is?

171
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.630
What are they doing when they have those, um, the, what is it called?

172
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.400
There's a type of breathing exercise that induces psychedelic states

173
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.300
holotropic.

174
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.200
<v 1>Holiday.</v>

175
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.570
<v 0>Breathwork. Yeah. And that is the idea behind that, right?</v>

176
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:41.730
It increases the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood.

177
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.390
<v 1>I haven't seen a mechanistic explanation. Hm.</v>

178
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.420
<v 0>Yeah, I think that was, but it would.</v>

179
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.870
<v 1>It would make sense in an early LSD psychotherapy,</v>

180
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:54.360
one of the things that they would do before giving someone else to use it would

181
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:55.800
give them something called carbogen,

182
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.500
which was a gas that can paint carbon dioxide.

183
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:02.430
And they would look at their response to the carbon dioxide inhalation.

184
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:04.740
And if it induced a panic response, they would say,

185
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:09.030
maybe you're not psychologically ready for this LSD experience.

186
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.100
So that was, you're talking about a test. I mean, that was a very primitive,

187
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.460
early test that was used by psychiatrists to see if people were,

188
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.940
had the psychological fortitude to withstand the experience.
