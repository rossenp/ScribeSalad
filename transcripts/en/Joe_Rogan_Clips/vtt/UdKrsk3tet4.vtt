00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.700
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, those folks, those fine protests. There's.</v>

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.180
<v 1>A major American city. We're seven blocks that people have took over it.</v>

3
00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:11.870
And I had no idea what you were talking about. So that's great. Anything that I,

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.710
I don't watch.

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.250
<v 2>It. I envy you at all. I envy that, that you just do that.</v>

6
00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:17.930
You just shut everything down. Me. I,

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.180
every day I check what part of the world's on fire. I.

8
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.440
<v 1>Don't like hysteria. I don't like making decisions with hysteria.</v>

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.310
And I like, I, I, when I first became a dad,

10
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.290
the hysteria of other parents, I would just, I would be looking at them,

11
00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:36.740
but I wasn't listening because that's all,

12
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.900
that's what I was the tone of everything was saying, you know, that.

13
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.830
<v 3>He gets in fleet now.</v>

14
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.150
<v 1>And you'd be like, and then anytime you say anything positive about your kid,</v>

15
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.840
how would you kid? Seven weeks. Oh yeah. How is, ah, she's great. She's great.

16
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.680
<v 3>Oh, wait till seven one and a half weeks. It's like.</v>

17
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.490
<v 1>It's like, dude, maybe you suck at it. Yeah. How about.</v>

18
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.370
<v 4>That? Yeah. You sit sitting there with your legs trembling, right?</v>

19
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.020
All nervous and. Yeah.

20
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.310
<v 1>I don't, I don't like, you know, I'm already in the head.</v>

21
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.940
I'm already in the head. I don't need 24 hour news.

22
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.540
Never like who's that guy on Fox news. I always joke with Nick Tucker.

23
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.880
He's got great hair, but horrible points.

24
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.120
Like if his points were as good as his hair, which guy? I,

25
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.470
it looks like a Kennedy. I mean, he's just, he is the white guys, white guy.

26
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.510
He was talking about black people going.

27
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.510
And when they come for you and they will, they're gonna let you know.

28
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.140
It's just like, what are you Hannity? I don't know who he is. No,

29
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:34.450
it's not handy. Nanny was the guy who they put with that, that,

30
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.460
that like rooster at the end, a chicken, the end of his life looking.

31
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.270
<v 3>Guys like, here's your liberal dude and all my.</v>

32
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.520
<v 1>Relatives who are conservative. Like, I mean, look at him.</v>

33
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.900
So meek it's like this thing is cast like a show. Yeah.

34
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.200
<v 2>Who is that? God that he was with Henny and Combs Combs.</v>

35
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.890
And though the one guy looked like he was on death's door and he was the gray.

36
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.641
<v 1>Yeah. He was great.</v>

37
00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:58.610
And the other guy looked like a football hero astronaut with a square.

38
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.330
<v 3>Face. Nice hair glasses.</v>

39
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.210
He looked like Mr. Burns, right? Yes.

40
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.860
<v 2>And he had to do a spine. He had no, it wasn't strong argue or.</v>

41
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.860
<v 1>Oh, he was there. He was, he was the Washington generals.</v>

42
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.360
The other guy was the glow. I'm trying to stay at that, that conservative point.

43
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.220
And then you put on CNN,

44
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.900
you got all those nitwits with the situation room and all of that. This, this,

45
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.840
this, this is why I wish that there was a comedy club.

46
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.910
Cause there's a bit that's already come and gone was what I loved was when,

47
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.600
uh, uh, Colin Kaepernick, when he was taking a knee. Right.

48
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.700
All the liberals were just like, well, Hey man, it's just like his opinion, man.

49
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:48.410
You know, this is a time to listen, man. And then everybody on the right side,

50
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:52.370
shut the up and play football. You piece of. Don't disrespect the flag. Right.

51
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.410
And then drew Brees, tweet something conservative. And then all of a sudden,

52
00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:01.660
everybody in the right's like, Hey, this is just like his opinion, man.

53
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.900
And then everybody left, like you racist piece of. I'm going to cancel you.

54
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.680
They literally do this. Everybody believes in like freedom of speech,

55
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.520
as long as you're saying, what they want to hear is basically.

56
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.380
And that's why I hate both of those news channels.

57
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.190
I actually divisive.

58
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.200
It makes my blood boil.

59
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.180
When I walk into a house with people I know. And if they're watching CNN or Fox,

60
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:28.930
like I can't get past the like when people watch like the Kardashians,

61
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:30.580
it's like, why would you do that to your brain?

62
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.463
It is what it's like.

63
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.600
<v 2>I mean, it's very toxic. It's very toxic, both sides.</v>

64
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.720
And they, they, they never see any good points, but the other side is making.

65
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.780
<v 1>Video on the internet starts after the thing happened.</v>

66
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.160
And it's like, you're always like, it's like, you're getting eight episodes in.

67
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.180
And you're like, what the? It's like, you don't know. What's like,

68
00:03:57.181 --> 00:03:59.100
if you watched the last scene of jaws, you're like,

69
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:00.600
why the did he kill that shark?

70
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.650
There's enough sharks dying out there.

71
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.180
You didn't see that this thing was specifically targeting human beings and he

72
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:12.870
needed to do this. Right. How does that relate to the news?

73
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.780
I'm saying when you watch the news people don't like they,

74
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.680
they not filming what leads up to whatever confrontation happens. Okay.

75
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.540
So you're getting a very skewed. You don't know what happens.

76
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.460
What they're saying happens could be what happened or a bunch of other.

77
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.780
I don't, I don't understand how I'm supposed to watch something.

78
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.710
You know like this, this obviously, obviously like that,

79
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.850
Minneapolis was the most obvious that guy's a murderer.

80
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.230
And those other three guys sat around and just watched him do it.

81
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.270
Well guys calling out, I can't breathe.

82
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:50.820
And all of this and calling up for his mother was sickening.

83
00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:53.790
That guy's a monster, had the audacity of a shocked look on his face.

84
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.250
That guy's terrible. Right. But like,

85
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.430
what I'm saying is that thing had all of this.

86
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.450
He kind of got the whole thing. When they came up, you had the whole thing.

87
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.000
There's so many other, and I'm not just, I'm not talking about cop stuff.

88
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.160
I'm just talking about anything.

89
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.630
Taking a little piece of somebody's stand up routine,

90
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.740
or a politician says this or voted, he voted no on this.

91
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.970
And what it is is the that all, it's usually the that was attached to it,

92
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.460
which is something I don't understand with politics. Like,

93
00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:26.640
why can't you just vote on what you're voting on? Like,

94
00:05:26.641 --> 00:05:28.920
should we have clean water? Yes we should.

95
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:30.960
And then like the that's attached to it, but we still,

96
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:34.410
we can still dump toxic in here. And then when the guy goes to,

97
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.960
or the woman goes to run, it's like, oh, this,

98
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.690
this person voted against the clean water act.

99
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.400
<v 3>This is your tree hugger.</v>

100
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.100
<v 1>I'm Joe blow. And I approve of this. Well, here's.</v>

101
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.190
<v 2>A, here's a good version of that. Remember the Covington school case,</v>

102
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.881
that was a,

103
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:51.660
the kid had a Maga hat on and then native American was beating the drums.

104
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:53.100
And the kid was smiling, looking at them.

105
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.820
And they took it pretending that this kid walked up to this native American

106
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.360
beating the drums and was smiling in his face and mocking him.

107
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.140
What really happened is these kids were on a field trip for high school.

108
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.950
They're selling mega hats. The kids are 16. There'd be in.

109
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.470
They buy these hats and put on while they're just having fun.

110
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.500
But it's very little supervision while they're there.

111
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.080
These native Americans are beating their drums.

112
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:19.070
And this guy walks up to the kid and gets in the kid's face and is beating the

113
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:20.510
drum. Now CNN,

114
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:22.940
all these people went with his narrative of these kids were mocking him.

115
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.140
The kid just stood there smiling while this native American got in his face.

116
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.330
Did the kids starving.

117
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.070
<v 1>That those, you know, there used to be rules on ownership of media? Yeah.</v>

118
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.170
I think way back in the day was like a rule of sevens.

119
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:38.860
Like no one person could own seven. Okay. Any combination of radio TV.

120
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.840
Cause you can literally influence public opinion.

121
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.640
And that's why like I've watched. And I do 12 years ago,

122
00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:47.950
I went down the federal reserve rabbit hole. I became a,

123
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.800
the guy you didn't want to talk to about the federal reserve,

124
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.480
all of that share the plan is federalism, federal express. I want that island.

125
00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.790
Yeah. All of that. And like watching, I just,

126
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:01.990
I just feel like in the last,

127
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.070
I don't know how many years where it's just all of a sudden they stopped being

128
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:07.480
just sort of everything they were.

129
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.400
I think reporting was always perverted to some level. Um, and now it's just,

130
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.830
it's just, you're sort of watching like op-ed pieces.

131
00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:18.790
So I know this is somebody who doesn't watch anything and reads like, you know,

132
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.320
autobiographies of football players in the 1950s. So, okay. There's Covington.

133
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.700
<v 2>School kid case. They sued the kid sued and won. They, you know,</v>

134
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:30.460
the CNN painted him out to be a monster. They were getting death threats.

135
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.870
<v 1>And they did CNN, uh, issue a retraction. I don't.</v>

136
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.960
<v 2>Know what they did, but they paid him. I don't, I don't know what they are,</v>

137
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.920
but I.

138
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.340
<v 1>Don't, I don't like either one of those channels because of that. And it causes,</v>

139
00:07:42.341 --> 00:07:45.400
I think rational people like that guy,

140
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.330
the guy that the fat dude in the bicycle suit ripping those pieces of paper.

141
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.370
Are those girls hands? Oh yeah. Jesus, that guy that is the result.

142
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.490
I think of watching one of those channels, 24 7,

143
00:07:57.491 --> 00:08:00.100
and then going on Facebook and writing and capitals.

144
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.700
<v 2>Could you imagine if you were there watching that guy, rip pace, peaches,</v>

145
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.680
pieces of paper out of a little girl's hand like that,

146
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:07.270
that he didn't even know yelling at her,

147
00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:10.060
running up to her where the mother is yelling. You stop touching her,

148
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.320
get your hands off her.

149
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.740
<v 1>Oh, that was the mom. I thought that was a friend, whoever.</v>

150
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.250
<v 2>That was, it sounded like a woman. So like a woman yelling.</v>

151
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.050
<v 1>He was doing everything but growing. Yeah. And then it,</v>

152
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.580
because then it gets to the point of like,

153
00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:28.870
what is in your head that you're trying to defend? Like, well,

154
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.630
that's a guy, but then everybody vilifies the guy,

155
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:34.180
which I would rather sit down and talk to that guy and be like,

156
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:36.790
let me ask you this. When you watch that, you know,

157
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.020
Floyd video, like what is it that you see?

158
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.130
Because just yelling at semi canceled them and making them lose his job.

159
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.840
You just get to make the guy even more angry.

160
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.410
And he probably has grandkids that he's going to fill their head before four.

161
00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:51.244
He dies.

162
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.590
<v 2>On what's the solution. So don't talk to him.</v>

163
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.640
<v 1>I think that should be part of it. Like buddy, let's just sit down for a second.</v>

164
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.880
You were on a bicycle. You wanted to burn some calories.

165
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.850
You're obviously into it, by the way you're dressed. Okay.

166
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.910
You're enjoying America's great parks. Right?

167
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.410
You come across these kids, you know? Do you like kids?

168
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.690
Have you ever attacked a kid before?

169
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.650
It did just putting a piece of paper up with a point of view?

170
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:27.600
Like what ha what do you think led up to that level of a

171
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:31.800
response? Because I have to be honest, like we've all snapped and done.

172
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.490
I would like to think I have, and afterwards I'd be like, what the?

173
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.520
Why did I argue that? Why did I say that? Why did I do that?

174
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.150
And the only way to, uh,

175
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.510
kinda prevent from you being a again,

176
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:50.340
is you have to kind of walk back and look at it. Right? So going at the guy,

177
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:54.600
which I totally understand, because it was, it was so bad.

178
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:58.530
It was almost comical because he was borderline growling at them. And, uh.

179
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.490
<v 2>No, it was really bad. He didn't even get the paper from the girl,</v>

180
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.270
grabbed the girl, the girl clenched her fist down and held onto it paper.

181
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.080
<v 1>My favorite part was the sound of his, the bottom of his shoes,</v>

182
00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:13.970
that clip into the pedals. You sound like a little show pony.

183
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.490
He was trying to grow like a tiger. And he sounded like my pretty pony,

184
00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:23.090
like somebody should have been a Coleman, his hair. So,

185
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.800
and I was sitting there going look at this crazy old guy and uh.

186
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.130
<v 3>Okay. But I don't know how, I didn't think how old I.</v>

187
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.780
<v 1>Thought he was. But then he was like 60. I was like,</v>

188
00:10:32.781 --> 00:10:34.880
this guy is like only eight years older than me.

189
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.190
So he graduated high school like eight years before me. So like,

190
00:10:37.191 --> 00:10:38.840
this guy is almost part of my generation.

191
00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:43.610
Like what experiences did he have that he looks

192
00:10:43.611 --> 00:10:46.160
at this whole thing? Like, um,

193
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.130
you know, I mean, I'm not of that, that, that thing saying all cops are like,

194
00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:53.360
those guys. It's like, no, it's like,

195
00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:58.280
you have to get those guys off of the force. That's what I think.

196
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.480
So, um, I just don't understand, like,

197
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.290
and that was my understanding what they were putting up there was specific to

198
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:09.890
the Minneapolis case. So my thing is as a human being,

199
00:11:09.891 --> 00:11:14.690
how could you have issue with somebody trying to put something

200
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:19.370
up, you know, honoring that guy or something positive about that? Like,

201
00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:20.930
I that's what I was confused.

202
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.910
<v 2>You put up, I'm not sure what you put up.</v>

203
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.200
It was definitely about the George Floyd protest. You know,

204
00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:29.420
maybe I couldn't see what.

205
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.240
<v 1>Was written on the paper. And I just, I filled that in when I watched it,</v>

206
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.360
but I really couldn't get over the side of the shoes though. Really funny.

207
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.030
I just started walking faster with the bike.

208
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.690
It was almost like a great movie trailer for a horror film.

209
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.420
Yeah. No, but could.

210
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.640
<v 3>You have a 60 year old fat bike rider? No. That was your.</v>

211
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.850
<v 2>Daughter. Your daughter you're sitting there in,</v>

212
00:11:52.851 --> 00:11:56.260
that runs up to your daughter and he's grabbing the paper out of her hand.

213
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.380
He's running at her, grabbing the paper out of your why?

214
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.520
Why a woman's screaming at him to not touch her? Don't you touch her?

215
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.050
<v 4>Yeah. I mean imagine. Yeah. I mean, it's the only one response as a father.</v>

216
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.940
Yeah. Murder. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like murder.

217
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.940
<v 2>No. What do you like Mame?</v>

218
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.390
<v 1>I want him to remember that he did it. That's interesting.</v>

219
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.810
That's interesting. That's another level blown out ACL. And you go from there,

220
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.940
beat him with his stupid shoe. Why do people wear? I actually,

221
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.880
I actually had to look up why people wear those shoes clip in. I know they do,

222
00:12:35.881 --> 00:12:39.420
but I'm like, what is the advantage of that? Is there an advantage? I think,

223
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.600
I think it's when, when you're coming up this way. Oh, you can,

224
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.350
you can still pull with your legs. So you're getting more of an efficient, oh,

225
00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:50.610
that makes a motion. This guy is really, really into, uh, hiking,

226
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.620
biking and not putting paper on trees.

227
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.610
Don't put their dead relatives in their faces.

228
00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.830
<v 2>Just a man that would run up to a little girl like that and grab her grab paper</v>

229
00:13:00.831 --> 00:13:01.664
out of her hand.

230
00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.960
<v 5>There he is. Click, click, click, click that's before.</v>

231
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.100
<v 2>But that's before he grabs her Jamie. Yeah, back it up from the beginning.</v>

232
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.173
Cause this.

233
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.010
<v 1>Worries you with your martial art background,</v>

234
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.890
you got to be impressed with the way he's using his bike there. No,

235
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.410
he's sort of like trying to be a little herd, shy.

236
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:23.390
<v 2>Maryland. Takata. What is the St re one C right there. That's where</v>

237
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:29.060
a bison was caught on video, early attacking teenagers who were posting flyers.

238
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.270
Is that a teenager? It's a little girl. Is that really a teenager?

239
00:13:32.271 --> 00:13:36.260
She might be 13. He just runs up to her is yelling at her.

240
00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.610
<v 1>Lucky's towering. Oh my God. Look at her though. Good for her. She F.</v>

241
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.700
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. See that's I think, I don't know if that's a woman or her friend,</v>

242
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.100
but that girl's got balls or ovaries. I like to them a little skip.

243
00:13:49.101 --> 00:13:51.080
Step two. Well, he's running it,

244
00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:55.190
the guy with the camera and knocks him over the man achieved this goal.

245
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.090
<v 1>Okay. As much as you don't approve of what he was doing achieved his goal. No,</v>

246
00:13:59.091 --> 00:14:00.980
she's still got the paper now. I'm just, I'm choking.

247
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.130
<v 2>He grabbed her arm. Whatever happened to that guy.</v>

248
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.660
You got charged three charges.

249
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.780
<v 1>I don't know. But yeah, they promote my movie right there. Hang.</v>

250
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.690
<v 2>On. Staten island. What are the ads on demand everywhere Friday.</v>

251
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.890
<v 5>Yeah. I would be in the news.</v>

252
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:22.970
<v 2>Big, old orange jumpsuit on if that was happening to my daughter.</v>

253
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.830
Oh my God. Be a real problem. If I caught someone doing that.

254
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.810
<v 1>Like a Badger on that you,</v>

255
00:14:32.811 --> 00:14:36.020
your biggest problem would be, what do I use?

256
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.880
<v 3>I always think for half a second, like you would be, you don't say elbow.</v>

257
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.450
<v 1>What do I do? Choke him? What do I throw that spinning? He'll kick.</v>

258
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:49.310
I saw you doing it. If you ever hit me with that,

259
00:14:49.311 --> 00:14:54.230
I have to learn how to talk again. Yeah, Joe, it didn't happen.

260
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:58.100
It didn't happen to your daughter. Right? You just went to a dark place. There.

261
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.660
<v 3>I go there all the time. That's a real problem with me now. I do too.</v>

262
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:03.650
I go there all the time.

263
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.900
<v 1>I do think getting up, talking about at least protests.</v>

264
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:08.270
I think something really positive is going to come out of this because the fact

265
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:12.050
that so many white people are also pro in getting involved in it.

266
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:14.990
And so many cops were vocal saying that, you know, they shouldn't do that.

267
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:18.620
So I think something good is going to come out of this. I just don't agree more.

268
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.290
I really do. I do. And I hope so too. Cause it's,

269
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:26.360
it's been wrongful way too long. And I also hope that, uh,

270
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.420
that a bunch of other groups don't use this as a piggyback thing to then do some

271
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:35.630
other, which will then escalate. Well,

272
00:15:35.631 --> 00:15:39.470
make people who want things to stay the same,

273
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.770
they'll be able to shift focus of like, you know,

274
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:44.960
like how they try to make like the protestors and the writer,

275
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.290
like the polluters, the same people. Right. Where it's just, yeah. There's only,

276
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:52.040
yeah, you did that. And then at night you did this. No. Yeah. The way that,

277
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.570
so I don't know you're going to do it.

278
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.410
<v 2>Anyways. I think there's the, once the looting died down,</v>

279
00:15:56.411 --> 00:16:00.130
you see in peaceful protests that are very encouraging. I think it's great.

280
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.220
I really do. I mean that downtown LA one was amazing.

281
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.990
50,000 people filled the streets and no crime or very little

282
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:08.920
nothing I heard of.

283
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:13.450
It was just mostly people chanting and holding signs and they look promising.

284
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.450
Look, they kind of, the,

285
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.570
the thing that disturbs me is this idea that they should defund the police.

286
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.980
You can't get rid of the police.

287
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.640
What you need to do is spend more money and train them better and high,

288
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.540
have higher standards and do it the way you do the military where it's very

289
00:16:28.541 --> 00:16:32.500
difficult to get in. And you weed people out that are weak. Like that guy was a.

290
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.890
That guy leaning on that guy's neck like that, that guy's a monster.

291
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.090
There's no way that guy should.

292
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.710
<v 1>Run. It was being filmed too. And he just had no. Yeah. I mean,</v>

293
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.430
that's like hands in his pockets. Like he was just, you know,

294
00:16:45.431 --> 00:16:47.730
waiting for an Uber or something like that makes you think.

295
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.860
<v 2>Yeah, he's a monster. Yeah. And that guy had been doing that forever. You know,</v>

296
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.260
there there's new evidence that they work together and they fought, they,

297
00:16:55.261 --> 00:16:58.840
they argued about the way that cop was treating the customers.

298
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.510
They work together at security at the same club.

299
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:06.040
And that cop was a to people at the club and they argued about it.

300
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:11.110
So they had a personal issue and there's some people that want it to be elevated

301
00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:15.280
to first degree murder because of that, that he did it on purpose that he knew.

302
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.430
He knew that guy. Oh man. I mean, it's just, yeah.

303
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.290
They argued that when they worked together,

304
00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:24.100
apparently one of the guys that worked with them said that George Floyd was

305
00:17:24.101 --> 00:17:27.460
always telling that guy he's a. The way he treats customers.

306
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.090
Cause he would mace people and, that kind of stuff, pepper spray folks.

307
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.820
He just was the first guy to use violence right away. Yes. Escalate this.

308
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.820
He had a history of complaints back to 2006. My friend Joe Schilling,

309
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.320
the Kickbox I'm talking about him again,

310
00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:45.850
but his page is the most disturbing page right now because all he's done over

311
00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:49.350
the last five, six days is post videos of police brutality.

312
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.360
And it's police brutality on black women,

313
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:59.400
white women, white, old men, black, old men, young guys,

314
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.030
oh, it's this just police brutality over and over and over and over again.

315
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.120
There's a problem of racism in this country. For sure.

316
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.110
There's also a real problem with people that have the kind of power that cops

317
00:18:10.111 --> 00:18:13.560
have that are weak people that are, that are sociopaths.

318
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.080
And that's that's as much of a problem as any of this.

319
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.620
Yet you tack the racism onto it and you've got a horrible situation,

320
00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:21.870
but those people are psychopaths. They're they're monsters.

321
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.620
That guy did that go.

322
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.620
<v 1>Like I'm going to talk to a security guy. And he said,</v>

323
00:18:27.621 --> 00:18:32.540
the best guys are the guys that, that they deescalate it. Yeah. He goes,

324
00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:35.750
you don't. Cause he, this guy used to put together crews of guys to, uh,

325
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.270
I think it was for like rock concerts and stuff. And he said,

326
00:18:38.271 --> 00:18:41.750
you didn't want to get guys that wanted to fight.

327
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.500
You didn't want to have those guys because those guys would be a headache.

328
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:47.630
And every night there was going to be something and there was going to be

329
00:18:47.631 --> 00:18:49.340
lawsuits. Like what, what you,

330
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.900
what he was saying you ultimately wanted was nothing to happen. Yeah.
