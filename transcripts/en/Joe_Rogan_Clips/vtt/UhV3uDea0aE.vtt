00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. The mind.</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.490
<v 1>Forces the body into moving over and over and over again. You know,</v>

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.530
you do it to this level of perfection that you do

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.990
for a person like me who doesn't know anything about cards.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.390
I don't know anything about card tricks. I don't know how they work.

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.300
I can't shuffle. If you watch me shuffle, you'd laugh at me,

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.410
but I watch your hand movements. I'm like, oh.

8
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.630
<v 0>This is amazing. It's amazing.</v>

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.600
<v 2>Guys that I'm around that I wouldn't even pull a deck of cards out of my pocket</v>

10
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:36.650
if they're near me, because they're that guy that does it 13 hours. Yeah. Yeah.

11
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.700
Like, like the guy just told fascinating, but, but yeah,

12
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.170
but there's also different aspects of it. So like, you know, there's also guys,

13
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.880
I'm not going to go into details, but I met,

14
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.370
I feel like I shouldn't even say this, but it's fine. Cause it's fine.

15
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.560
So I met a kid once who moved to Las Vegas

16
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.410
when he was, this is a crazy story to.

17
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.243
<v 3>Tell.</v>

18
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.840
<v 2>That it's a good story. Okay. I won't go into details.</v>

19
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.390
So he moved to Las Vegas when he was 12,

20
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.120
he moved there because he wanted to meet a specific person who is considered

21
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.800
the best card sheet ever. Meaning the guy,

22
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.270
this is a guy that, the reason that Vegas has those,

23
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.050
instead of like the dealer peaking the, the down card,

24
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.780
they have to put it into a machine and push a button.

25
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.070
He's the guy that the movie casino was built around with the computer and the

26
00:01:36.071 --> 00:01:40.540
shoe. Like he was the, the best card she ever.

27
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.190
But among magicians,

28
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:46.720
he's like a phenomenon because he's working on moves not to entertain anybody

29
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.520
he's working on move. So he doesn't get his hands smashed up against the wall.

30
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.450
Binion's right. Yeah. So he's working on Mussa.

31
00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:59.880
He's not going to get killed survival. Yes. So

32
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.050
this kid at the age of 12 knows about him,

33
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.400
moves to Las Vegas and buys a craps table.

34
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.340
He puts the craps table, Tim and his mom, right as my single mother and him,

35
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.800
they live in this small apartment,

36
00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:20.440
very close to the man I was telling you about,

37
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.750
and this kid throws dice 15 hours a day on

38
00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:29.200
this crap, stable, by the way, their little bed is like under the table.

39
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.590
You know what I mean? It's a small space and it's a real crap stable,

40
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:33.520
like a nice one.

41
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.710
The only thing he does is repetitiously throw that and he can helicopter

42
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:39.640
spin the dice.

43
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.930
So you can't see them doing this if such force going around this way,

44
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:46.060
that when they hit the wall one die,

45
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:50.200
won't break the number and he can throw it exactly to this part of the,

46
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.050
of the table, missing this from across the table. So that one died locks.

47
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.170
And every time he can guarantee that number,

48
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.800
he did that every day for almost decade,

49
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:03.850
until he could throw dice better than any other human being in the world.

50
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.800
Then he went and got a job at one of the casinos that texts for car cheats and

51
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:12.370
worked in the craps tables. It's all he did.

52
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.580
And as soon as he turned 21, he went out,

53
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.780
travels the world and wins the exact amount of money that he wouldn't playing

54
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:24.760
craps where you're not detected, but, but you can live the exact amount. I mean,

55
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:29.490
I under, you know, probably under a million, probably a few million a year. So,

56
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.100
but I'm saying it's not like he's going in and getting a degree. It's,

57
00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:34.510
it's very smart and structured. Yeah.

58
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.360
And that's delivered places and he can throw dice.

59
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:41.640
Like I've never seen anybody throw dice. It's crazy. They take.

60
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.310
<v 1>People that are really good at cards. Like my friend,</v>

61
00:03:44.311 --> 00:03:47.340
Dana white has been barred from casinos because he wins.

62
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.220
<v 2>At black jazz. Probably just counting. I don't know what he's doing.</v>

63
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.223
He's counting.

64
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.240
<v 1>But they've, they've kicked him out of casinos. Cause he's won a lot of money,</v>

65
00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:55.680
but he's also lost a lot of money,

66
00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:59.250
which is bizarre to me that you can go to a place and do really well.

67
00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:00.960
And they're like, you're doing too well. You got to get out of here.

68
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.800
<v 2>It says mine, every table, we have the right to refuse anybody,</v>

69
00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:06.990
which is important. Do they do that with.

70
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.930
<v 1>Dice? Is the question I get the, how they would do that.</v>

71
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.890
<v 2>Do you want me to hear a dice? Because this isn't me doing magic. This is luck.</v>

72
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.940
Okay. Okay. So I don't believe it is. I don't like the way he paused,

73
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.300
but I'm serious. I know,

74
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.230
but I'm saying that because I'm trying to be convincing. Okay. So,

75
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.750
because I'm telling the truth, but anyway, I go to the palms, you know the,

76
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.320
yeah. Okay. And, um, they had a bet on the craps table called the fire bet.

77
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.040
And it was like a, uh,

78
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.500
a game where you have to hit all of the numbers open and close without crapping

79
00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:41.334
out.

80
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.140
So when I walk up to the table right away,

81
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.070
the pit boss and everybody, they make a big deal. Like you can't touch the dice.

82
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.640
And they're like I said, you can call up. I can touch the dice. Cause you know,

83
00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:57.360
they invite me. So I say, I can touch the dice. And uh,

84
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.880
cause I wanted to throw right. I don't want to just gamble on a rant. So anyway,

85
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.260
I, um, cause even though I'm not cheating, I still feel like, you know,

86
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:11.070
maybe I'll get, I have a little bit of an ability that's giving,

87
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.410
you know what I mean? Right. Not a cheating ability,

88
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:17.400
but maybe I'm a little better than a random person. Right. Got it.

89
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.620
So the pit ball, they make a joke and then the woman pit boss comes out.

90
00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:25.860
She says, well, if you take your shirt off, we'll let you throw the dice joking.

91
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.330
Right. So anyway, what I do is I bet for everybody at the end,

92
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.790
this I go to the low stakes table, always. So the high stakes tables,

93
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:35.790
that super bowl team right over there. And they're like, ah, they're all crazy,

94
00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:39.660
right? Like all excited with these big bet over here with this table,

95
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:42.570
we all have little bets, right. That I say,

96
00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:44.490
let's put a fire bet down for everybody.

97
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.730
So I put the fire bet down for every single person at the table,

98
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:51.930
including the dealers. I mean the pit bull, you know, the, you know,

99
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:54.990
with the deicing and uh, I'm throwing the dice,

100
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.670
thrown the dice and this goes for two and a half hours.

101
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.270
I keep throwing the dice. I didn't hit, I didn't crap out.

102
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.450
I hit sevens in between each number, which you can craps work.

103
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:09.140
So you have to roll like a five let's say, and then I'm like, oh no,

104
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:10.700
I need to roll another five.

105
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.030
Which is statistically much more difficult than a seven,

106
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:17.840
because seven is the most common number to come up. So if you roll a five,

107
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:21.170
you're like, oh that's hard. Cause you can only get a two, three or three,

108
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.380
two on both dice or a one, four or four one.

109
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.010
So you have a four at a 36. That's a one and nine.

110
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:30.650
So you're probably going to crap out before you get the number.

111
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:32.840
That's why the game is to their favor.

112
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.180
So I'm throwing the dice and it's two and a half hours

113
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:42.770
later and they stop everything and they're like

114
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.070
your fire, but just hit. And the table goes, what does that be?

115
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.560
They go, well, you all just won like 10 grand each. They all go.

116
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.650
Everybody's got, they gave you the taser. Everybody's going nuts.

117
00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.980
And we hit the fire bet would save now removed from the pals either way.

118
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:01.814
But it was,

119
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.470
it was a pretty unheard of like the odds of hitting that bet is pretty

120
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:11.090
rare, but it's just luck. Nobody should hit that.

121
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:14.990
Bet. I mean, statistically, it's unlikely and I wasn't cheating.

122
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.520
So yeah.

123
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.130
<v 1>So do they, but the question is.</v>

124
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.230
<v 2>For some reason I'm lucky with dice, right? But I'm not I, but I can tell you,</v>

125
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:29.140
I would be, if I was great with dice, I'd tell you that was great. By the way,

126
00:07:29.141 --> 00:07:30.520
I actually have a dye on

127
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.100
this story for this reason, but I do have a die of it.

128
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.870
Have you practiced with dice? Um, no. Yes, but I'm terrible at it.

129
00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:42.820
So I do have a duck.

130
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.750
<v 1>But it does make sense that if you look at what that is,</v>

131
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.010
that that's a physical thing. And then if you develop a touch,

132
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.060
you develop a feel, you do something over and over and over again.

133
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.060
<v 2>This is different, but here look, take the die. Okay. And, and, uh,</v>

134
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.560
can you like, uh, put it between your hand or whatever? Like, uh,

135
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:06.640
and can you mix it like that and then squeeze it when you're done or no,

136
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:08.170
keep it hidden, but put it on the table,

137
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:10.060
but make sure you can't see it and I can't see it.

138
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.620
So you greet like no one could see that. Right. Are you sure? A hundred percent.

139
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.470
Do you want to do it again? Try it again? Just no, because it could be weighted.

140
00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:21.580
So just, or you're done. You're good. You're good. Yeah. Okay. Uh,

141
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.330
say a number between one and six, like pick a number of to six. Okay.

142
00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:27.820
That five is what I said on the craps table. Right.

143
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.040
But I already know that it's a four

144
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.820
and the five is here. Face. Agree.

145
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.530
<v 0>How do you know that? That's uncomfortable.</v>

146
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:46.000
<v 2>Can you do that again? Probably not. You know what we'll do.</v>

147
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:47.890
Let's stop whenever you want. Yeah.

148
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.050
Cause it could be like a way to die by the way.

149
00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:52.000
That's how people cheat with dices.

150
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:56.400
They also take the dye and they flip it and they want it to be, you know,

151
00:08:56.401 --> 00:09:00.200
so it's like you throw the numbers. So you said you wanted a five, right? Yeah.

152
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.060
Go ahead. Yeah. It's five.

153
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.630
<v 0>That food away from me, man. Is that</v>

154
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.680
that's so weird. That must be a rush for you though. Just.

155
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.600
<v 1>To blow people's minds like that all the time.</v>

156
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.060

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.000
the stimulus is like that,

160
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.410
that fixation almost like the meditative thing that you're talking about. But,

161

but as a magician that is performing and trying to make TV shows,

162
00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:37.460
it's really difficult because you have to like keep coming up with new things,

00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:39.350
