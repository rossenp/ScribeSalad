00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.840
<v 2>So what about, uh, like, can we talk about it? I [inaudible].  Yeah, sure. So,</v>

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.840
uh, it's, uh, covered it, what they did in Mexico city and ivermectin, and 

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.673
seems to be a drug that not only treats it, but it will prevent you from getting it.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.390
<v 1>I think we need studies. We need legitimate studies and, uh,</v>

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.800
I don't know how that happens. Cause the,

7
00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:27.930
the problem with this argument in this conversation is, you know, you'll,

8
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:32.790
you'll have people saying I've used this on my patients like Dr. Pierre

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.310
Corey, who has been on this podcast. And, uh,

10
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.770
I 100% believe him and I support him.

11
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.470
And I'm not saying that he's not telling the truth. The problem is,

12
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.460
I think in order to state something emphatically,

13
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.910
like this is what we need to do. This is the best treatment we need studies,

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.980
right? This is the only way you find out and well, who's going to fund these.

15
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.490
And the problem is it's a generic drug.

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.180
It's a drug that's been around for 40 years, has a long history of use.

17
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.740
And also there's a difference between using it as a prophylactic.

18
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:06.210
So using it as a preventative measure, which is one of the things that, um, Dr.

19
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.110
Pierre Cory talked about on this podcast, I forget where they use this,

20
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:13.680
but it was, uh, this th th there was hundreds of doctors.

21
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.580
And then there was a percentage of them that used, uh,

22
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.590
ivermectin as a prophylactic.

23
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.520
And there's a percentage that did not the percentage that did not half of the

24
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:26.010
doctors, roughly or half of the healthcare workers got.

25
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:29.640
COVID the percentage that did use it as a prophylactic,

26
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.970
100% did not get it. Now,

27
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.110
I don't know if they got lucky. This is why you need a large study.

28
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.240
And it's a long-term study. Maybe.

29
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:43.170
I don't know what was their job different than the people who got it?

30
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:45.990
I don't know. That's the problem. So when I'm talking,

31
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:48.060
I'm a comedian in a cage fighting commentator,

32
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.250
and I'm talking about very important issues.

33
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.160
I have to hedge my opinions on these things.

34
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.060
<v 0>It's tricky, but it,</v>

35
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.550
but in an environment where people aren't allowed to talk or question things,

36
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.880
you know, um, well, for instance, um,

37
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.560
my doctor, so when I, uh, I got the vaccine,

38
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.900
I got to double and I got the Moderna because I have an underlying

39
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:14.220
health problem I don't want,

40
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.550
and I've talked about before and we talked about it, you know? And, uh,

41
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:21.030
so my doctor, because my people are like, why did you, you trust the government?

42
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:23.730
I know I don't trust the government. You trust big pharma? No,

43
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.800
I don't trust big pharma. I trusted my doctor,

44
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.460
my doctor who saved my life and said that because of your thing,

45
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.800
you should get it because we don't know how it's going to affect you and you buy

46
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.820
blah, blah, blah. So I got it. And then, you know, I just, the, you know,

47
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.490
the symptoms you get from it, uh, they never went away.

48
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.010
<v 1>For me. What were your symptoms? So.</v>

49
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.660
<v 0>I had, uh, body aches, flu, like fever. Uh, I had, uh,</v>

50
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.690
a joint pain. I had, um, a stiff.

51
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.360
<v 1>NEC, have you tried going in an ice bath for 20 minutes?</v>

52
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.480
<v 0>Sorry. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.313
<v 1>How long did it.</v>

54
00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.403
<v 0>Still cold?</v>

55
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.770
<v 1>I'm just warming up now.</v>

56
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.300
two hours in this pocket is w when you,

57
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.680
how long did it last?

58
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.810
<v 0>So on April 17th, I got the second jab and I just never got better. I was it.</v>

59
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.830
<v 1>Immediate before this? After the first job, did you have side.</v>

60
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.670
<v 0>Effects? Yes, but they went away and then the second jab, how long did they.</v>

61
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.660
<v 1>Last? After the first shot? I.</v>

62
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.490
<v 0>Don't remember, but a couple of days. Yeah, it was like maybe a week, I think,</v>

63
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:29.020
a week. And, um,

64
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.870
and then the second time they just never went away and I was like,

65
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:32.890
what is going on?

66
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.910
Cause I would get these waves of exhaustion a couple times a day.

67
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.970
And then my producer had the same step. After,

68
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.590
at the fifth week I had a stiff neck,

69
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:44.680
he got a stiff neck and my wife got a stiff neck and we all got the stiff neck

70
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:47.080
on the side. We would get the shot. So I got it on this side.

71
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.990
They got it on that side. And, um, I,

72
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.660
then I looked it up and it turns out stiff neck is a thing that people

73
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.670
experience from the jab. And I was like, oh,

74
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:57.940
I didn't know that they don't tell you that. And so that's common. I'm like,

75
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:00.700
okay. And then it spread to the whole neck. Okay.

76
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.910
Now my producer and my wife that went away, their stiff necks went away.

77
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:08.170
Mine didn't. So, anyway, so I go to, so I, I tweeted about it. I tweeted like,

78
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:11.140
Hey, this is just to let everybody know. This is what's happened.

79
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:15.910
This is my reaction to the vaccine. Yeah. And because, uh,

80
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.090
when people started to come on me, like call me anti-vax and you're that?

81
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.210
I'm like, no, I got the VAX. Right. I got it. I go,

82
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:26.470
when people have a reaction to an experimental vaccine that is not FDA approved,

83
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.320
you're supposed to not suppress the reactions.

84
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.130
You're supposed to ask people what the reactions are so we can make the vaccines

85
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:33.760
better.

86
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.620
<v 1>That's a thing that when Jen,</v>

87
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:40.180
sockies talking about misinformation online and combating misinformation,

88
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.710
she distributed misinformation because she said that it's approved by the FDA

89
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:46.600
and their gold standard. She said that she said that.

90
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.790
<v 0>It is not approved. When you go to.</v>

91
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.530
<v 1>Pull up, pull up, pull that up. Let's make sure that she said I'm 99% positive.</v>

92
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:55.870
She said that because I remember reading that going.

93
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.530
You can't say that when you're the white house, press secretary,

94
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.940
because that's not a true statement.

95
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.320
This is it's approved for emergency use authorization

96
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.280
because we're in the middle of a pandemic, right. That's an emergency. Yes.

97
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.070
But it's not an FDA approved.

98
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.840
<v 0>So when you go get this jab,</v>

99
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.290
they give you a piece of paper and on it in bold black letters, it says,

100
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:20.350
this is not an FDA approved vaccine. Right.

101
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.050
And they see that and I'm like, yeah, they go UK with that. Yeah.

102
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.300
I guess my doctor said I'm supposed to be here and sign it.

103
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.790
<v 1>Yeah. I, I found the, uh, transcript of it. I didn't find the video.</v>

104
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.360
Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the video,

105
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:39.310
but I definitely have read the transcript and I want,

106
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:43.390
I want this to be accurate because it's a big accusation.

107
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.640
This is what she said here. When someone asked about the business,

108
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.810
what is this from white house.gov. Okay. Um, so you know,

109
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:51.370
more than just the competition about vaccines,

110
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.260
the risk impact or [inaudible] uh, okay. Here it is. Um,

111
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.250
misleads the public by falsely alleging that M R N a vaccines are untested

112
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:02.210
and thus risky,

113
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.560
even though many of them are approved and have gone through the gold standard of

114
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:10.070
the FDA approval process, this right.

115
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.970
<v 0>True. So she's saying many of the M RNA vaccines, right?</v>

116
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.660
<v 1>There's only two that are MRN vaccines, that's messenger RNA.</v>

117
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:22.400
That is the Pfizer and the Moderna, there's the ones that we use in America. Um,

118
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.720
the Johnson and Johnson is a, it's an adeno virus of vaccine.

119
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.160
It's different as is the AstraZeneca. Right? The AstraZeneca,

120
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:34.760
I believe is very similar to the Johnson and Johnson. They're different,

121
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.350
but the.

122
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.531
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

123
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:40.760
the Johnson and Johnson uses the old technology and the Moderna and Pfizer,

124
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:42.680
they use those ones that was developed by DARPA.

125
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.660
<v 1>Yeah. But the point is, it's like, it's not FDA approved.</v>

126
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.610
<v 0>No, because that takes a while.</v>

127
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.550
<v 1>So if she's saying that, right, this.</v>

128
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.380
<v 0>Is that misinformation. It is.</v>

129
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.390
<v 1>Seems like if it says it, when you get the jab and it says it in bold print.</v>

130
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.960
And so your experience, even though you, you,

131
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.840
this is your personal experience and you did get vaccinated.

132
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.680
People are so rabid online. Oh my God.

133
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.790
It is the most divisive subject. I think ever since Trump,

134
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.660
it really is. It is a, is a nutty divisive subject.

135
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.630
And people just get furious about it.

136
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:25.160
And they're furious if anybody talks about any negative side effects,

137
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.420
even if it's accurate.

138
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.790
<v 0>I know. So, so I, I had tweeted about it just because I was,</v>

139
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.690
I wanted to see if other people had this experience and you know,

140
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:40.280
maybe it's just me. Maybe it's not. So I got contacted by lots of people,

141
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.730
uh, same experience. And I got contacted by a doctor.

142
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.270
Who's leading a bunch of other doctors, a group of doctors and studying this.

143
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:52.190
And they just submitted a paper on people about the vaccine, right? And so,

144
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:57.110
uh, he tells me over a DM, this is what we think is happening.

145
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.800
This is a spike protein. You're suffering from a spike protein thing and blah,

146
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:02.900
blah, blah, and go to see your doctor.

147
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:06.800
And hopefully your doctor will work with us and give me ivermectin and

148
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:09.320
fluvoxamine, and I'm taking for inflammation in my brain.

149
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.030
<v 1>You have inflammation in your brain.</v>

150
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.560
<v 0>That's cause it causes inflammation. So the spike proteins cause inflammation.</v>

151
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.680
And so they did some kind of blood test on me and they said, yeah,

152
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:19.850
you got the thing. Was.

153
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.590
<v 1>It a D dimer test? So it was.</v>

154
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.010
<v 0>Joe, you got me. But they said, you look you're, you are,</v>

155
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:29.060
you have the same you're right. Where a long haul COVID person is like,

156
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:33.260
whatever the markers were. I had the same thing you right there. And so my,

157
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.160
I go to my doctor and I start to explain to my doctor about what this other

158
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:41.060
doctor told me. And my doctor says, oh, I'm treating five people just like you.

159
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.750
And one of them is a neurosurgeon. And one of them is a nurse.

160
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.710
And they were afraid to talk about their symptoms because they were afraid to be

161
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.320
ostracized and stigmatized. And I'm like,

162
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:55.010
what a messed up situation we're in, in this,

163
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.250
when they politicize medicine, we're doctors and plus medicine,

164
00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.360
medical professionals are afraid to talk about their symptoms. That's horrible.

165
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.490
<v 1>It's also putting people in a position where big pharma is the good</v>

166
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:12.090
guy now, which has never happened before. And especially the,

167
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:16.500
the exact same companies that people were openly criticizing in the past

168
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.170
and showing, pointing out lawsuits,

169
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.630
they've lost hot for hiding information about test results,

170
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:28.260
about things that have happened during studies. And these,

171
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.000
these same people are now ignoring any, any possible side effects.

172
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.020
<v 0>That's nuts. So good. I mean, how do we make it better? How do we know?</v>

173
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.310
Maybe some people, I mean,

174
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.140
that suppression of data is not the way you improve a vaccine. Well,

175
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.350
the suppression of people's symptoms and data that is not, you know,

176
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:47.071
and in anything,

177
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:50.160
it's not how it works when a door that's how they want it to work because of

178
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:53.240
Trump. Because if you say it's just crazy, it is crazy.

179
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.190
Even that hydrochloric queen, right. That member drops to chloroquine,

180
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.060
hydro hydroxychloroquine, that Trump was touting. And they were like, he's nuts.

181
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.730
Cause he's touting it. I didn't know anything about, uh,

182
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.520
but then all of a sudden studies came out that say, Hey, no,

183
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:08.220
that actually has been helping. So now they have,

184
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:12.210
we have contrary contradicting studies, right? I just, it was a Newsweek.

185
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:13.200
I w I wasn't making it.

186
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:15.960
I didn't pull it out of some crazy thing of some establishment,

187
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:17.910
mainstream news thing. I'm pretty sure it was Newsweek.

188
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.810
And I tweeted it out and I said, Hey, can we stop now? Can we stop, uh,

189
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.670
politicizing medical science?

190
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.430
Can we get back to just doing medical science again? How much.

191
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.470
<v 1>How much damage did Trump do on that one? The one conversation.</v>

192
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.830
And he had me do something like cleaning something. Would.

193
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.500
<v 0>You do bleach.</v>

194
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.280
<v 1>Like so light, you could kill it with the light.</v>

195
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.690
It's going to be a miracle like that. One thing when people like, what the is.

196
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:49.740
Cause he was riffing. He has clearly, they didn't prepare for this.

197
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.800
He probably just got done eating a double cheeseburger. And he's like,

198
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.910
this he's the, you know, because.

199
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.490
<v 0>He's a salesman. He's just a big, bright, because.</v>

200
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.390
<v 1>He's so divisive. Like everyone is still, it's almost like,</v>

201
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.580
do you not? Like if you got in a fight with someone like maybe your neighbor,

202
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.390
and then you got in your car and there was a road incident and you're like,

203
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:13.590
get the outta here.

204
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.090
You're already so ramped up because of the fight you got in with your neighbor,

205
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.160
this is what the whole, country's like.

206
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.360
<v 0>That's a great.</v>

207
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.470
<v 1>Analogy. It's like,</v>

208
00:11:22.471 --> 00:11:24.450
it's like the whole country just got in a fight with the neighbor.

209
00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:26.760
Like he's putting his trash can on your lawn. Hey, you.

210
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.090
Keep them on your own side. You're a piece of. And then you're in your car.

211
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.700
And this is like, the whole country is like at eight out the door,

212
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.270
out the door in their car already at eight and a scale one to 10,

213
00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:40.380
they're already ready to go.

214
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.610
And so whether it's the vaccine or whether it's the border wall or whether it's

215
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:48.810
kids in cages or what the, whatever it is, everybody's so,

216
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.120
angry and ready to go.

217
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:54.700
And then you deal with the economic crisis that a giant percentage of the

218
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:58.000
country just went through over the past year and then losing loved ones to this

219
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.690
disease and all this chaos and all that.

220
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.550
And so many people who have never experienced like high levels of adversity

221
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.280
and all of a sudden they're confronted with it. If you've played it safe,

222
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:13.180
your whole life, you really never done anything risky, never taken any chances.

223
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:16.090
You've had a regular life with a regular job. You played safe.

224
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.051
And then all of a sudden,

225
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:20.380
now you're and you're confronted with a perhaps deadly disease.

226
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.230
It might take you out and you got all these other problems in the world.

227
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:25.900
And everybody's like, ah, and they don't have the coping skills.

228
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.970
They don't have the ability to handle these things.

229
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:30.280
And that's where we find ourselves as a country right now.

230
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.360
And it's weird because then you have that with the echo chamber aspect of social

231
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:35.050
media,

232
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.380
where everybody's just looking for positive reinforcement of their own ideas and

233
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.640
confirmation bias.

234
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.750
