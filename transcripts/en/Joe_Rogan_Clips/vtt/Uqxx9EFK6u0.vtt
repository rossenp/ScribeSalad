00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know, look, I, I'm kind of all for that. I mean,</v>

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.080
I I've seen this with politicians on the campaign trail.

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.120
Like they are so tight now in ways that they used to not be, well,

4
00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:17.480
you saw the Donald Trump thing, Donald Trump Jr. Where Trump junior was.

5
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:20.870
They didn't want him to do, they want him to do a Q and a, and he didn't do it.

6
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:24.510
So they, they booed him the right wing people, Uhhuh were booing 'em,

7
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:28.710
they're yelling out Q and a Q and a cuz they wanted to be able to talk. Oh,

8
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:30.150
I see. They wanted to be able to say something to him.

9
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:33.870
And these were people that were like far right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; far right.

10
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:35.870
People, they just didn't think he was being right enough.

11
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:37.670
Or he was playing the game wrong or he wasn't,

12
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.100
wasn't letting them complain to him. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's bad.

13
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.860
And, and, and politicians are, are, are aware of that now. And they're,

14
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:49.260
they're constantly aware that they're, they're on film everywhere.

15
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.420
And so they're, you know,

16
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.340
a thousand percent less interesting because they're they're, I mean,

17
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:59.900
I remember recovering campaign in 2004 and I was,

18
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.730
I saw Dennis Guin give us beat somewhere. And he was going from, I think,

19
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.530
Maine to New Hampshire. And I said, well,

20
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:09.130
can I get a bride back to New Hampshire? He's like, yeah, sure. So he, you know,

21
00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:12.210
takes me on the, the van. He like takes his shoes off.

22
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:13.770
He's like cracking jokes and everything.

23
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.730
And like eating UON noodles or something,

24
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.730
political candidates would not do that now. Right.

25
00:01:18.731 --> 00:01:22.560
They'd be afraid to be off the record with you. Right. You know? Right. Or, and,

26
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.920
and they, they're afraid to be around people and just behave like people,

27
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.400
you know, uh, which is, is not good.

28
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.440
I don't think it's the weirdest time ever to be a politician because it's,

29
00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:37.040
it's basically, you've got this one guy who made it through being

30
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.200
hugely flawed. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and just going, ah, locker room talk.

31
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.350
And everyone's like, well, yeah, it is locker room talk, I guess.

32
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.630
And then it works and he gets through and he wins.

33
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.550
And so you've got him who seem, he's like, he's so greasy,

34
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:52.910
like nothing sticks to him.

35
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.270
And then you have everyone else who's terrified of any slight misstep. Yeah,

36
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.220
totally. And, and you can't replicate the way Trump does this, you know,

37
00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:04.980
Trump, Trump is, he was born this way.

38
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:08.260
There's like a thing going on in his head. Like he is, you know,

39
00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.620
pathologically driven to behave in a certain way.

40
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.820
And he's not gonna be cowed by the way, you know,

41
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:17.380
people are of a social media cuz he just doesn't think that way. No,

42
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:20.340
you know he's and, but that's no one else is gonna behave like that.

43
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:24.730
What do you think about him and speed. What do you think about all that?

44
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:28.730
Does he take speed? You mean? Yeah. So did you ever see his speech after

45
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.890
super Tuesday? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. That's the one we was slurry. He oh,

46
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:38.650
was that, that was the one he was ramped up. He was very, I, I,

47
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.170
I just say watch that speech, you know, we're,

48
00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:42.810
we're not supposed to draw conclusions about,

49
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.120
but you know what might be going on pharmaceutically with somebody.

50
00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:50.880
But I would say just watch Donald Trump's performance after the results of

51
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.440
the super Tuesday rolled in 2016, let's hear some of that.

52
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.560
First of all, the Christie is hilarious. Watch Tillary speech.

53
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.280
<v 1>And she's talking about wages,</v>

54
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.240
I've been poor and everything's poor and everything's doing badly,

55
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.280
but we're gonna make it. She's been there for so long. I mean,

56
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.240
if she hasn't straightened it out by now,

57
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.080
she's not gonna straighten it out in the next four years.

58
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.000
It's just gonna become worse and worse. She wants to make America whole again.

59
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.080
And I'm trying to figure out what is that all about? Is.

60
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.470
<v 0>It, yeah. I mean, it just, I have to go back and look, but yeah, but he, he,</v>

61
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.270
he went on and on also the, the,

62
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.950
the Christie factor was really funny with that because he was looking at,

63
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.350
he's just sitting back there going, what am I doing?

64
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.150
&lt;laugh&gt; what am I doing with my life? Look at his face.

65
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.110
Literally he could see his, his brain wander. Well, how the did this happen?

66
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.870
I was gonna be the man. Like I was the president.

67
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.220
It was gonna happen for me. I could see it happening. I saw him in, uh,

68
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.620
in Ames, Iowa, um, basically standing alone in the park,

69
00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:51.740
waiting for people to try to shake his hand, you know? Yeah. It was pretty bad.

70
00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:54.660
Like you see that and, but yeah. Do you have a theory about Trump and speed?

71
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.460
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think he's on some stuff.

72
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.180
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I think first of all, I know.

73
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.770
So all many journalists that are on speed.

74
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.170
I know so many people that are on Adderall mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's very

75
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:06.970
effective. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it gives you confidence.

76
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.010
It gives you a delusional perspective.

77
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.450
Like you get a delusional state of confidence.

78
00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.650
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it makes people think they can do anything.

79
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:15.650
It's basically a low level meth.

80
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.240
It's very similar to methamphetamine chemically. Yeah, sure. And people it,

81
00:04:20.241 --> 00:04:23.680
yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; what is, tell me what it's like. Cause I haven't done it. Yeah.

82
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:26.320
I mean, I have done speed too. I mean, you know, all, all those,

83
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.720
all those drugs are. Yeah. They're they're like baby, baby speed, basically.

84
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.720
Yeah. You know, and you're, you're absolutely right. I think people who,

85
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.400
it's not good for a writer because writing is one of these things where

86
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.310
one of the most important things is being able to step by and, and,

87
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.390
and ask am I really, am I full of here? You know,

88
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.830
are my jokes as funny as I think they are like, right.

89
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.950
If once that mechanism starts to go wrong, uh, you know,

90
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:53.390
you're really lost as a writer, right. Because you,

91
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.910
you're not in front of an audience you're with yourself in front of a computer.

92
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.630
So, um, I don't think, I don't think speed is a great drug. I mean,

93
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.620
you get a lot of stuff done. Um, so that's, that's good. But,

94
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.860
uh, but yeah, no, I think there's a lot of people who are on it now. And,

95
00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:13.580
and also a lot of it's because kids come up through school and they're on it

96
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:17.740
too. Yes. You know? And they, they get used to it. So I, you know, I have kids,

97
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.780
I wouldn't dream of giving, giving them any of those drugs, you know?

98
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.570
I think it's crazy. Yeah. I did too. Did you, you saw the,

99
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.290
I'm sure you saw the Sudafed picture too, right? No. What was that?

100
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.410
Trump was sitting in his office eating a,

101
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.610
it was that famous photo where he is like,

102
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.290
I love Hispanics where he is eating a, uh, taco bowl &lt;laugh&gt; and Trump tower.

103
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.690
And behind him, there's an open drawer.

104
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:40.330
And in that open drawer is boxes of Sudafed and, um,

105
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.720
Sudafed to February. It gives you, yeah. I mean, you, it gives you a,

106
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.160
a low level buzz. And the, the th I mean,

107
00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:52.920
this is why I used to have to go to, uh, CVS to buy this stuff.

108
00:05:52.921 --> 00:05:54.880
You used to have to give your driver's, I guess you still do.

109
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.280
You have to give your driver's license cuz they wanna make sure you're not

110
00:05:57.281 --> 00:06:01.600
cooking meth and you're buying like 10 boxes of it at a time and cooking up a

111
00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:03.200
batch. Yeah. If you're like in a,

112
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.440
in a holler in Kentucky and you go in and get 2020 boxes of Sudafed,

113
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.440
I think pretty much people know what you're doing there. Yeah.

114
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.080
That's really funny. Did he, so he had a bunch of Sudafed behind him. Yes. Yeah.

115
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.590
In his box. And you know, there was that one order that, uh,

116
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.510
what was that guy's name again? Who had a, a whole,

117
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.910
he wrote a series of tweets, which he eventually wound up taking down,

118
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:29.070
by the way, Jamie, I can't find those tweets. Um, he wrote, uh,

119
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.150
a series of tweets that there was, uh, very specific Dwayne Reed pharmacy,

120
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.190
where Trump got, uh, amphetamines for, uh,

121
00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:40.620
something that was quotes called metabolic disorder. Kurt EALD fun fact.

122
00:06:40.621 --> 00:06:44.420
Oh Kurt. Yeah. 1982. Trump started taking amphetamine derivatives, abused them.

123
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.420
Only supposed to take two for 25 days. Stayed on it for eight years. Really.

124
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.220
Now is he full? So yeah,

125
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.860
Kurt EALD is an interesting,

126
00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:58.570
because he's written some really good books about finance. I, um, he wrote,

127
00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:03.330
he wrote a book about Enron. He wrote a book about, um, uh, Prudential.

128
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.330
It was real, really good. Uh,

129
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.290
and when I was starting out writing about wall street, I was like, wow,

130
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:13.010
these books are really incredibly well researched, but he had some stuff in the,

131
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.870
uh,

132
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.720
in 2016 where like that's an ample of something

133
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.080
as a reporter. I see that I'm like, well, where's that coming from? You know?

134
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.600
And cuz you, you, in journalism, you can't really, uh,

135
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.160
accuse somebody of certain things unless it's backed up to the nth degree.

136
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.640
So right. He had a couple of things that I, that I, you know,

137
00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:33.760
would be concerned about these,

138
00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:35.960
he took a leap mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't know. I mean look,

139
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.001
but that's what I'm saying.

140
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:41.710
Stepped outside of the journalistic boundaries of what you can absolutely prove

141
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.910
and not prove and took a leap.

142
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.070
And that's why I think he took down the Dway Reed pharmacy.

143
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.390
He didn't take it down still. Oh, it's still there as well. There,

144
00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:53.070
there was an oh, okay. There it is. There was another thing about a, um,

145
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.350
oh, he's got the milligrams per day. Wow. Where is this from?

146
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.900
I don't know. It's show it or anything,

147
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:02.980
but I believe he drug is got a copy of it from someone or he talked to the

148
00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:07.900
doctor or drug was dith Propan 75 milligrams a day prescription filled Dwayne

149
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.340
Reed on 57th street. Manhattan. Not that I know things. So, you know,

150
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.740
he's got the doctor's name too. There you go. Dr. Joseph Greenberg. I, uh,

151
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.420
counted with medical records. Oh.

152
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.730
House admitted to me only a short time for diet that he took it when he was not

153
00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:26.930
overweight. Oh, okay. And that's fine. He says, I counted with medical records.

154
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.130
They cut me off. Wow. Yeah. I mean, you know,

155
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:32.730
one thing I will say is that when you're,

156
00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:36.970
when you're covering stories sometimes, um, you hear things and, and you know,

157
00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:38.410
they're pretty solid, but you put you,

158
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.280
it's not quite reportable cause the person won't put their name on it or you

159
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:47.120
know, you're not a hundred percent sure that the document is a real document.

160
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.160
Maybe it's a photocopy. And that, that can be very, very tough for reporters.

161
00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:54.640
Cause they know something's true, but they, they, they can't right. They can't,

162
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.560
and, and social media has eliminated a barrier that we used to have.

163
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.360
We used to have to go through editors and fact checkers. And now, you know,

164
00:09:02.361 --> 00:09:04.960
you're on Twitter. You can just kind of, you know, right, right.

165
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.720
Or you can hint at something, you know? And I, I, I think that's,

166
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.400
that's something you don't want to get into as, as a reporter too much,

167
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.240
you know? Yeah. That's a weird use of social media.

168
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.230
It's like sort of a slippery escape from journalistic rules.

169
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.510
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You know, or, or you can,

170
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:27.150
you can insinuate that somebody did X, Y, and Z, or you can, you,

171
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.470
you can use terms that are a little bit sloppy, like, you know, again, like,

172
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.070
but it seems like they did admit that he took that stuff for diet. Yeah.

173
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:37.620
So if you have the, the white house, you know, spokesperson saying that they,

174
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:40.500
he took it for a short time for a diet, then you find that's a reportable story,

175
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:44.060
right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think when people get into that,

176
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.460
it's very hard for them to get outta that. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, that's uh,

177
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.020
the, the speed train and I've seen many people hop on it.

178
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.260
It's got a lot of stops. &lt;laugh&gt; nobody seems to get off. Yeah. Not,

179
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:59.010
not out with their teeth intact, right? Yeah. No, it's, uh, that's,

180
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:02.370
that's not a good, good way to awesome. He's so old. He's so old.

181
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:06.010
He doesn't exercise, he eats fast food and he's got so much energy. I am.

182
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.930
I mean, people wanna think he's this super person, you know,

183
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.130
but maybe he's on speed maybe. Yeah.

184
00:10:12.131 --> 00:10:15.730
Maybe he's just gonna collapse turnover and collapse one day or not.

185
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.800
Maybe you can go a lot longer on speed than people think.

186
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.600
Maybe if you just do it the right way,

187
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.280
but isn't that kind of the way history always works. It's like, again,

188
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.840
not to go back to the Russia thing,

189
00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:28.520
but all the various terrible leaders of Russia,

190
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.560
like they all died of natural causes when they were 85. Right.

191
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.640
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; whereas, you know, in,

192
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:35.800
in a country where people get murdered and died of industrial accidents and bad

193
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:38.030
health when they're, you know, 30 all the time. Right, right.

194
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.550
But the worst people in the country make it to very old age and, and you know,

195
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.790
and die in their alcoholics. And, and maybe that's a thing, right. Maybe, maybe,

196
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.950
you know, he has the worst diet in the world and maybe he's on speed.

197
00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:56.110
And maybe it's also your perception of how you interface with the world.

198
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.860
Maybe because he is not this introspective guy.

199
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:01.300
That's really worried about how people see him and feel about him.

200
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.660
Maybe he doesn't feel, you know, whether,

201
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:06.180
whether it's sociopathy or whatever it is.

202
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.500
He doesn't feel the bad feelings they don't get in there. Yeah. And the,

203
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.900
he doesn't have the, the stress impact. Right. Right.

204
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.180
And that's the thing about speed. Apparently it,

205
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.210
because of the fact that it makes you feel the illusional and it makes you feel

206
00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:20.210
like you're the man,

207
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.010
like you don't worry about what other people think losers who cares. Right,

208
00:11:24.011 --> 00:11:26.610
right. Yeah, exactly. Let's buy Greenland &lt;laugh&gt; you.
