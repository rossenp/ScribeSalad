00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know,</v>

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.120
I try to do a good job of bobbing and weaving and moving my head and slipping

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:06.954
off the center line.

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.620
<v 1>Kicks to you. Keep guys on the outside. You have a weird style, man.</v>

5
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.483
It's too close, man.

6
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.400
<v 0>Yeah, That's what it is</v>

7
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.600
to close back though. up.

8
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.430
<v 1>Did you start out from a, I mean, I know you have a wrestling base too.</v>

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
What did you, what did you start out with? What was your first martial art?

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.520
<v 0>I didn't have any, we, we, you know, the karate confirm like VHS tapes. I.</v>

11
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.270
You not, I have a family of this. I think there's 20 of us now. My dad,

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.410
my dad just had a newborn son. I. You not. He's 57.

13
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:43.260
The guy's out of his bird. Wow. But, uh, it just had any boy,

14
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.190
I haven't even met him yet. That's one. And uh, all the boys grew up.

15
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:49.020
We had these karate tapes, VHS tapes,

16
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:52.380
and we would imitate the characters and we'll be like, we're the drunken master?

17
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:54.540
Or we're the white tiger, white lion.

18
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.150
And we have to do their fight styles and what I lo kissed.

19
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.450
So we're still flexible and malleable, we don't break as easily.

20
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:02.730
So we just start beating the out of each other,

21
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:06.000
but we'd do like spinning backaches, jumping off the couches and like that.

22
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.640
And I think that might've trays, like, cause that was like,

23
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:12.030
we did that for years, but that was the most combat we did.

24
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:15.600
We didn't do any like wrestling, no, nothing traditional at all. Before.

25
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.000
<v 1>I ever got into martial arts, I used to do that. Same thing.</v>

26
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.520
I used to throw kicks with my friends. I didn't know what I was doing,

27
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.630
but it was fun. But yeah,

28
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:24.870
you like watch a Bruce Lee movie and start throwing kicks or some Chuck Norris

29
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:27.990
film or something like that. You learn how to do stuff by watching,

30
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.390
but you could also develop some terrible habits. Yeah.

31
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.880
But you don't look like you developed any bad habits. Like if I had to guess,

32
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:35.670
I would say you have a traditional martial arts background in what?

33
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.960
The way you throw kicks.

34
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.620
Like you throw kicks like a guy who started throwing kicks when you were really

35
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:43.440
young. Yeah. But they're right. You throw them.

36
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.510
<v 0>Right. Which ones would you say? Like all.</v>

37
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.470
<v 1>Your, your roundhouse kicks your front kicks. You have great front kicks, man.</v>

38
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.490
You're really good at keeping guys off of you. You have good movement, you know,

39
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:57.420
like you got a style, that's a unique style. Like so when,

40
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.130
when guys have to fight you, they go, oh,

41
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:02.700
this guy is going to be kicking at me from the outside. He moves a lot.

42
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:06.960
He bobs and weaves. It's hard to hit. You got a lot going on with your style.

43
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.823
It's very tiring.

44
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.463
<v 0>I was going to ask.</v>

45
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.780
<v 1>I was going to ask you that too.</v>

46
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.250
<v 0>Cause we.</v>

47
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.450
<v 1>Called that in your last fight.</v>

48
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:18.060
Like the third round you were kind of slowing down a little bit. I'm like,

49
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.380
imagine all the energy this guy's using because you're always bobbing and

50
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:25.350
weaving and moving and kick in and moving and kicking and moving and moon.

51
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:27.420
Joseph's just, you know, Bob and towards you and,

52
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.610
and just throwing traditional type, Bob.

53
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.570
<v 0>In his head too, you.</v>

54
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.100
<v 1>Looked at like energy output.</v>

55
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.490
Like how much more energy you must have put out in that fight than he did.

56
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.030
Just in terms of the amount of kicks you throw and the amount of jumping back

57
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:41.760
and forth and leaping in leaping out like this. That's all like.

58
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.680
<v 0>Well, Matrixx, it's a ton.</v>

59
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.890
And the good thing is credit to like the training that we do. You know,

60
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:50.220
we get the, I get the, the right work. I got that guy. I'm a Rob Davis, Chile.

61
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:53.070
Who's a freaking psycho. That guy does not get tired.

62
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:56.280
We call him the machine for a reason, the guy, he would finish sparring with me.

63
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.380
And I'm like, I did my rounds championship work. I'm done.

64
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.840
I'm just gonna get on bike or hit the pads, whatever it is or band work,

65
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.080
just to get a little extra cardio push and he'll be in there and grab two,

66
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:07.930
three, sometimes four more bodies to spar with. And I'm like,

67
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.700
this guy just doesn't stop. He's out of his bird. This is no exaggeration.

68
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.690
This guy is out of his bird. But it's the reason why my cardio I'm like,

69
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.420
you want to get your cardio top notch, get yourself a Mirage.

70
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.140
Get yourself one of those two. He's a man. He's a good dude. He's a good dude.

71
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.020
Sometimes too much of a good deal. I'm like, Marav I can carry,

72
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.030
I could carry my own wallet. You know, it was like,

73
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.580
he gets to the point like that. Like, dude, thank you. I appreciate it.

74
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:34.540
But you know, but um, yeah, it's, it's a very tiring style. Um,

75
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.900
but we do a lot of work and I do my own strength and conditioning just from

76
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:41.770
having a background in physical education and SUNY Cortland. So do your own.

77
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.190
Yeah. So I've been doing this since I was amateur like writing my own thing,

78
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:45.940
my own program.

79
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.840
Cause they told us how to like work on like isometric squeezes and different

80
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:53.320
type of like explosive muscle endurance workouts and stuff like static holes,

81
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:56.080
like holding all the on a polar Bard and going out to punches.

82
00:03:56.081 --> 00:04:00.370
So I put together a pretty decent program it's been working. I can't complain.

83
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.120
So.

84
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.020
<v 1>And when you do it, how do you design? It uses a designer for the entire camp.</v>

85
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.670
Like do you set it out every day?

86
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:10.330
Like where you want to be and do you adjust it depending on how you feel and

87
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:11.230
injuries? Like how do you.

88
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.760
<v 0>Exactly like that? So when I'm further out from the camp or not in camp at all,</v>

89
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:20.290
I'll do more lifting and I'll lift heavy and I don't really do like benching no

90
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:22.750
more. I think that like stupid for four fighters.

91
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:24.490
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I'm not going to bench,

92
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:28.240
press somebody off my back, you know? Um, I, I don't know whatever,

93
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:32.320
but I'll do that. And I'll just a training camp and just the, the, uh,

94
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:35.440
the programs when I get close to the fight and I don't mind to like sharing this

95
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.990
because I think guys,

96
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.990
they make it more complicated than what it should be. Like.

97
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:42.640
I sometimes I see all this crazy. I'm like,

98
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.510
I just don't understand the whole necessity behind any of that, but I'm no,

99
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.830
I'm no physical strength, conditioning, doctorate, or anything like that.

100
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.990
But from what I've seen, that works for me,

101
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.890
I just try to mimic everything that I feel in a fight and implement it into a

102
00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:01.270
workout. And I figure out which ways I can do that. Whether it's bands, pushups,

103
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:04.900
box jobs, wall sits, I do wall sits get ups with two plates.

104
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.380
So I'm sitting down on my butt and I'll do like a technical standup.

105
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.860
And I use the wall and I push up. So it's a lot of leg work, a lot of core work.

106
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.330
And two plates with two plates is up it's sometimes I come there and I do it by

107
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:20.950
myself in the morning, I go to Loma Mae by myself, 9:00 AM. And I'm like,

108
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.880
why am I putting myself through this? Like I can,

109
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.290
it could be so much easier and more simple, like just to do the other stuff,

110
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:28.660
like the plyometric stuff. And which is a little,

111
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.060
not as much impact on the body, but this is what I enjoy.

112
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.000
I think this was what translates to the fight because this is what I feel.

113
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.620
And I feel when I do this,

114
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:39.130
I notice a drastic difference from one sparring session to the next.

115
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.730
But to answer your question, like I adjust it, I'll do it.

116
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:45.430
If my legs are on fire and I feel like they're really beat up from sparring,

117
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.490
I'll do more upper body. And then if my feeling, my upper body is more beat up,

118
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:51.880
I'll switch it off to the lower body. And if I feel like I'm fresh,

119
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:54.550
like I had a good week, I'd maybe I did a spa, um,

120
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.100
on a Saturday and I'd come in and fresh on a Monday,

121
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.180
I'll hit it hard and do full body everything.

122
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:02.510
And I'll give myself five rounds of pushing it, but I separate it into rounds,

123
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.340
simulate the fiber round. So I do every single minute,

124
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:10.700
but I'll do about 40 40, depending on how far I am from, from the fight.

125
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.070
If I'm like just on a training camp, I don't want to kill myself.

126
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.660
I want to ease my way into it.

127
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.710
So I'll start like anywhere from like 30,

128
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.030
35 seconds to like 50 seconds and that ten second window or that other 32nd

129
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:25.760
window is my time to recover and get to the next station.

130
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.870
And I'll just wrap whatever I'm doing, burning out, burning out. I'll do, um,

131
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.220
the med ball between my legs.

132
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.620
I'll do the foam roll in my arms and I'll squeeze it.

133
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:34.790
And I'll assimilate the rear naked choke.

134
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:37.880
And I do it for two minute intervals and I'm just squeezing the out of it.

135
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.360
And obviously you can't do it, but you do it to failure and your arms get Ty,

136
00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:43.700
you switch and go to the other side and you switch your legs. You figure four,

137
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:44.780
it, you scissor the legs.

138
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.460
So you give yourself a different type of stimulation to your body to kind of

139
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:52.280
account for everything that you may possibly be in for the fight.

140
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:55.250
And you never know it was this fight. I did a lot of grappling,

141
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:57.890
but I also did a lot of punching because I thought to myself,

142
00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.780
they might be a chance.

143
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:03.800
I might be a possibility that I do not get paged to the ground. And I was happy.

144
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:06.710
I didn't force to take downs. Cause that would have fatigued me even more.

145
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.280
I was like, if it comes, it comes. But we did it. I did a lot of output,

146
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:13.580
just burning out the arms, getting that muscle endorse, kind of using the app,

147
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.480
Floyd Mayweather structure of a workout. Just get into the heavy back count,

148
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:19.850
like high punch count in, in a five minute round.

149
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.020
And I'll do that for a couple of rounds.

150
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:22.850
And we do that a couple of times a week.

151
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:26.090
And I think you implement that with the lateral foot work that we do in a cage

152
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:30.110
and just staying on your bike and having people like, like stalk you and like,

153
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.360
sh just not going crazy, but as a control,

154
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:35.510
like they don't punches like hooks or they throw in, um, a one, two,

155
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:37.490
and you got to like bounce side to side and get out the way.

156
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:38.450
So it was a lot of like,

157
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.930
I at least I think is practical for what you're going to actually see when you

158
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:44.150
get in a fight. And I think, sure enough,

159
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.820
a lot of the things we did pretty much happened in a fight. Just.

160
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.460
<v 1>Your toes, long squeezes. It is a great idea.</v>

161
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.390
I wasn't seeing is that something that comes up often in a fight where you maybe

162
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:55.250
got a gun, an arm triangle or something like that.

163
00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:57.650
And it's that close to whether you get it or he escapes.

164
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.550
It's like how much squeeze, how long can you keep it down? You know,

165
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:03.470
when you're caught in something and it's like,

166
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:05.540
you're almost tapping the guy let's go. You're like,

167
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.290
[inaudible] Long squeezes. Uh, like my friend Scott Epstein, Einstein,

168
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.270
he teaches at a 10th planet west LA.

169
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.280
He's always been a big fan of slow, slow workouts. Like he'll do,

170
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.420
chin-ups like this like super slow. I think that's what they call it super slow.

171
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.090
And he'll do, chin-ups like, he's doing a chin-up.

172
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:29.570
It might take him two minutes to do a chin up. Yeah. Where the entire time.

173
00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:32.240
So like when you're grappling with someone's like you're trying to squeeze it

174
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.770
upon them in that long-term squeeze endurance like quicksand. Yeah.

175
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:40.280
It makes sense because if everything is fast and exploding,

176
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.090
but then you get a rear naked and you have to like continue to compress or a

177
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:46.250
good team where you can squeeze.

178
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.490
<v 0>It's different. It's such a different, such a different field is kind of,</v>

179
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.670
it kind of reminds me. It is exactly like my Brian caraway fight.

180
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.040
Although I did do three workouts on the day of that before the fight,

181
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.170
even Matt told me in the backroom, he was like, algebra,

182
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.180
save some for the fight. I was like, no, man, I'm good.

183
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.390
And I was just going crazy. I was like, in my head, I'm like I did all the work,

184
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.790
but I, I just wanted to be so prepared.

185
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.710
Cause I knew it was the biggest fight of my life.

186
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:10.530
I knew if I beat him and finished him, I was probably going to get a title shot,

187
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.950
his Forno undefeated coming off three finishes. And I knew if I finished him,

188
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.490
I'm more likely going to get. And they lined me up too, because the next week I,

189
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.390
I went to Fox and I was supposed to talk about the Dominick Cruz fight versus

190
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:24.480
your I favorite fight, which I went, but the fight didn't go my way.

191
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.360
So it kind of had like a bittersweet taste to it. So do you.

192
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.970
<v 1>Think that had anything to do with the extra rounds you put in or the extra</v>

193
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:30.690
work?

194
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.010
<v 0>Talk to a hundred? A hundred percent.</v>

195
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.910
I think if I had just done my one morning shakeout, 15, 20 minutes,

196
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:37.950
it was what I do now. Just get the food,

197
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.320
move it through my system so that my body can get like,

198
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.140
just feel like it's more alive again. Like it does during training camp.

199
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.340
I think, uh, I think that fight easily done first round or even a second.

200
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.410
Cause he survived the first. But I think the second round,

201
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:52.050
I think I'd get him out of there, but it's just experience, you know,

202
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:55.050
learning and becoming more mature about the game and trusting your training.

203
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.420
<v 1>Do you think that has anything to do with you training yourself?</v>

204
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:00.660
Do you think that you, if you had a legit strength and conditioning coach,

205
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:01.830
who's monitoring your heart rate,

206
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:03.810
like are you monitoring your heart rate and all that stuff?

207
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.380
<v 0>No. I just started doing stuff with the pie center and I try to,</v>

208
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.130
because I saw that guy, Brendan Davis, he's he's for 45, a foot to beat.

209
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.780
And he's uh, he's up.

210
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.540
<v 1>East 1 35 now.</v>

211
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.020
<v 0>Which is insane to me. So I don't know how he makes it. That's what I said.</v>

212
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.900
So I'm like, dude, if I'm going to have to be fighting these giant guys,

213
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:23.790
I need to figure something out. I'm like they,

214
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.220
they explain how he was able to cut the weight.

215
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:29.070
Like he was running like 10 miles or something day a date,

216
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:31.620
which was insane to me. I know he was saying like, some of it was like walking,

217
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.900
but it's all about your heart rate, your resting heart rate,

218
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:37.770
where you burn the most fat and calories or whatever you want to call it.

219
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:38.550
He's so big.

220
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.310
<v 1>When I was standing next to him, I couldn't believe he makes 1 35.</v>

221
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.700
<v 0>It's insane. I, I was actually pretty upset. I was like, this guy,</v>

222
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.870
go back out to your way class.

223
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.760
<v 1>And didn't he say to me? Wait, I think I asked him what he weighed in the cage.</v>

224
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.100
I think he said somewhere around one 60. Yeah.

225
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.150
<v 0>I don't get that big.</v>

226
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.560
<v 1>What does he say? I'll look up. I'll check his bananas man.</v>

227
00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:01.740
He's he's so gigantic. And he's one of the like six one or something like that.

228
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.623
That's easy for them.

229
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.080
<v 0>Yeah. I don't want to find a guy. That's six one. You gotta, I gotta,</v>

230
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.740
I got the unfair advantage right now. You take your back out to 45.
