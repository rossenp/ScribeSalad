00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.920
<v 1>Yeah. I wish he really did say that, that line while, while he was president.</v>

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.240
Oh yeah, come on. I mean, that would be hilarious if you did that as president,

4
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.320
what would everybody do? Go, you're not allowed to do that, sir. Right?

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.160
You are right now.

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.800
<v 2>The president do not do not. Cus that's kinda like a,</v>

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.830
but I think that like when he tweeted at Kim Jong UN and called him little

8
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:25.350
rocket, man, that was hilarious. That was so funny. That was hilarious.

9
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:27.510
That was just plain funny. Well, he goes.

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.990
<v 1>Did you see the one tweet? He goes, I don't know why Kim Jong UN said I was old.</v>

11
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.110
I would never say he's short and fat. &lt;laugh&gt;.

12
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.550
<v 2>That's like a return to like a, it's like a comic. Yeah. That's like a,</v>

13
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.790
I don't smack the go to your work. It smack the Dick outta your mouth.

14
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.100
Like the exact same thing that worry. Yeah.

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.780
<v 1>That is it. That's so funny. But I mean, the fact that he just like, this was,</v>

16
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.900
this is the president saying this it's funny. Like it's hilarious.

17
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.340
But meanwhile, Kim Jong UN now wants to sign a peace.

18
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.340
<v 2>Treaty. They wanna meet. They're gonna meet. They're gonna meet.</v>

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.100
<v 1>Yeah. He DIDNT. Nobody wanted to meet with him before.</v>

20
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.300
I know everybody's like there's too.

21
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.890
<v 2>Dangerous. Oh, never call him short and fat. I would never,</v>

22
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.050
I try so hard to be his friend and maybe someday that'll happen. Yeah. See, he.

23
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.650
<v 1>He on you shows you the consequences of you with him. And then he.</v>

24
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.810
<v 2>Opens up the door, by the way, that's kind of what we do anyway. That's like,</v>

25
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:15.970
what friends do that? You like you on each other. And then you're like, dude,

26
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.610
I love you. It's cuz I, maybe.

27
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.360
<v 1>Someday that will happen. Oh, well I try so hard to be his friend &lt;laugh&gt; guy.</v>

28
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.240
Come on, man. This look, I'm not, there's a lot of things. This guy does wrong,

29
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.680
but he is entertaining. It's very entertaining. There's no,

30
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.200
never been a more entertaining president. Not even close. No,

31
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.960
he is the grand champion. Oh. Of being entertaining.

32
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.400
As long as he doesn't blow us up and he gets out without getting in the box,

33
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.510
like, uh it's it's highly possible. He doesn't make it outta this one alive.

34
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.190
But if he does, yeah, he.

35
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.350
<v 2>Gets through the whole thing. I think he's gonna be good. You think so?</v>

36
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.390
I think he'll be fine. Let, lemme say this.

37
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.790
Whether it lasts four years or eight years and look at all, these,

38
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.270
a lot of liberals are like what? Never, never, whether it lasts Trump,

39
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.430
never Trump. If it lasts four or eight years,

40
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.340
the one thing they'll that we will all say will look back on. We'll go, man.

41
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:05.174
That's crazy.

42
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.540
It took that thing for us to talk about a lot of things like the me too

43
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.740
movement. Yeah. Would've never happened if Hillary got office.

44
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.620
<v 1>Ever. Um, yeah, it would've sure. I don't think so.</v>

45
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:16.780
Harvey Weinstein got exposed. That's the Harvey Weinstein, but I.

46
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.900
<v 2>Think were, were tumble effects of what happened with him. I.</v>

47
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.220
<v 1>Agree too. But I think it all helped in together.</v>

48
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.530
<v 2>I I'm just saying like, I bet you,</v>

49
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:28.890
the Harvey thing wouldn't have been so real that Hillary got in.

50
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:31.490
Cause cause all the liberals that condemned all the liberals,

51
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.090
like all the liberals that called out people like Harvey and everyone in our

52
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.050
business, they would've been so gleeful of this Hillary thing,

53
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.410
I think that would've still been like, uh, well we'll covered it up.

54
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:42.050
Like we've been doing for the it's not, it's not,

55
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.760
but it's not like it just started it's going on. Why now? Why they.

56
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.120
<v 1>Suppress stories before? Because they, they got these people to suppress.</v>

57
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:51.400
I don't, I just didn't think the power of social media is just.

58
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.480
<v 2>Expanded. I think, I think the timing was perfect with Trump.</v>

59
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.040
I think I'm just saying like, I, I think so too.

60
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.800
I think those things led to it just being like right. That's it.

61
00:02:57.801 --> 00:02:59.440
We have to do something about, I think it was definitely a factor,

62
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.280
but I bet you, it wouldn't have happened so fast with Hillary.

63
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.520
I bet that would've been a longer road. Oh yeah, dude.

64
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.480
I don't know because liberals would've gotten exactly what they wanted. The.

65
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.840
<v 1>Only way it would've been a longer road is because Weinstein supported Hillary's</v>

66
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.280
campaign. That's.

67
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.280
<v 2>What I'm saying. That is possible.</v>

68
00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:13.080
They're all part of the same because there was.

69
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.960
<v 1>A lot of photos of them together of him with Obama. Dude. He's got photos with.</v>

70
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.863
<v 2>Everybody.</v>

71
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.750
<v 1>Yeah. Him just hugging up on all these people that call him a monster now.</v>

72
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.110
Yeah. Doing the thumbs up. They're all.

73
00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:26.390
He's a God like Meryl Streep saves a God.

74
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.510
<v 2>Yeah. A godsend. That's the same thing.</v>

75
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.950
But that's the same thing with Trump though.

76
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.630
Like how many celebrities you see with pictures of Trump? It's hysterical.

77
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.430
People are die. Hard liberals that are like,

78
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.190
they asked me to the apprentice buds and.

79
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.660
<v 1>All that.</v>

80
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.700
They asked me to do the apprentice when I was doing the sec can round a fear

81
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:41.020
factor. Fear. No.

82
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.853
<v 2>Way.</v>

83
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.340
<v 1>I don't wanna live in New York for three months. &lt;laugh&gt; that's you?</v>

84
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.700
My kid was one of my, my youngest kid was very young. Who was gonna be on the.

85
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.820
<v 2>Show? I don't know. You have no idea.</v>

86
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.900
I would love to see who you would've gone up with. Dude.

87
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:54.580
Would've been so Dennis Rodman, noncompetitive.

88
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.660
<v 1>I would've been highest. to have a good time.</v>

89
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.090
I would've tried to come up with a good idea. And if it did and work out.

90
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.050
<v 2>Yeah, yeah. But you would've won. That's why? Cause you didn't care.</v>

91
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.650
What are you gonna do? Yeah. The people that care that's who that's, who loses?

92
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.010
I.

93
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.850
<v 1>Don't know, man. I cared so little that I probably would lose.</v>

94
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.330
<v 2>I think you'd win. I probably would barely win, win, paying attention.</v>

95
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.250
The person that's like, nah.

96
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.330
<v 1>But don't you have to be good at business. I'm terrible at business. Like.</v>

97
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.730
<v 2>You see some of the people on that show, they just they're all wing it.</v>

98
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.920
Don't no, I mean like who they cast on it. They w it it's like whoever they get,

99
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:21.240
this is.

100
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.800
<v 1>I've seen literally 13 seconds of that show and it's all clips you're fired.</v>

101
00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:25.200
You're.

102
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.400
<v 2>Fired. Got fired. That's the best clip you're fired.</v>

103
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.600
<v 1>You're fired. I just, I don't get you're fired. I just did.</v>

104
00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:33.760
Just didn't seem like a fun.

105
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.560
<v 2>Job, Joe. I wish you came on. You're fired. I would add McDonald's with.</v>

106
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.040
<v 1>You. Hmm? I don't eat that.</v>

107
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.510
<v 2>I do eat yours. Eats.</v>

108
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.430
<v 1>Fried chicken with fork and knife, dude.</v>

109
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.670
<v 2>That's this he's a, he's a comic act. He is a comic act.</v>

110
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.830
&lt;laugh&gt; he is a cartoon.

111
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.710
<v 1>He's an odd human that's for sure.</v>

112
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.830
Do you think he's gonna run again a hundred percent.

113
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.670
<v 2>Right, dude, he's gonna win again. A hundred percent. He's gonna win again.</v>

114
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:57.430
Yeah. Wow. And I'm not saying like,

115
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:01.460
of course there's people that are probably like. Do you know what is his dude?

116
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.620
I.

117
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.800
<v 1>Just,</v>

118
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.500
you need to come to my Boyle hearts gallery and see my never Trump exhibited

119
00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:10.100
that was burned to the ground by Mexicans. How ironic Nazi.

120
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.300
<v 2>Coffee. I just think, I think he's gonna win again. I just do.</v>

121
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.980
I think unless the Democrats can pull something together in the next year and a

122
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:18.700
half, two years to someone that actually is like a formidable component. Well.

123
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.300
<v 1>My activism is going to prevent that.</v>

124
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.650
<v 2>I just, I just think he's gonna go again. He.</v>

125
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.570
<v 1>Might. I see. Especially if some look,</v>

126
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.450
if he's smart and he clearly is a very clever man, if he's a clever man,

127
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.490
it's entirely possible that he's got one round in the chamber for like right

128
00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:42.880
around six to eight weeks out before the election.

129
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.200
One thing where he like,

130
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.400
lets something happen or goes down and he has the perfect solution to put out

131
00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:53.440
that fire, man. He's good to go. They plan that stuff, man. Totally man.

132
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.440
<v 2>They absolutely it's people working on it right now.</v>

133
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.520
The moment you get into office, they're trying to keep you in office. And.

134
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.520
<v 1>Sometimes people die. sometimes people die. People die. Yeah.</v>

135
00:06:03.521 --> 00:06:07.160
Sometimes people die and he is just, Hey, what are you gonna do?

136
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.000
What is this president? Joseph Marines ago? What'd he say? He wants.

137
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.880
<v 3>Soldiers in space. He wants to create a space force.</v>

138
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.573
<v 1>Oh what.</v>

139
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.550
<v 2>Dude. Yeah. What did he say? Let's shoot up. The traditional.</v>

140
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.670
<v 4>Strategy for space recognizes that &lt;laugh&gt; space is a war fighting</v>

141
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.270
domain. What? Just like the land, air and.

142
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.430
<v 1>Sea. I don't like the way he says this. They.</v>

143
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.030
<v 4>Even have, and sea space force. They even have us space, space force.</v>

144
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.920
We have the air force.

145
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.900
<v 1>Space, space force. We have the space force. We have the army, the Navy,</v>

146
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.500
we have the Navy and a space force.

147
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.820
So what he does is he has a bunch of buddies that make spaceships.

148
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.260
So what he's gonna do is they make a deal, make a nice deal, make a nice deal.

149
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.140
We sat down,

150
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.140
we cut a nice deal and they're gonna take another $4 trillion and pump it

151
00:06:55.141 --> 00:06:56.740
into the space force. And then they're gonna,

152
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.130
they are gonna wear like Luke Skywalker outfits. Right?

153
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:03.650
They're all gonna wear some sort of crazy space suit. That looks dope. Yeah.

154
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.970
And we're gonna be all on board. Yeah. Space, warm space board, dude. Tight.

155
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.890
Can you imagine if we start seeing like overhead, like we're in the sky,

156
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.290
a button with like at a,

157
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.850
in a night sky and you see like rocket chip flying back and forth. So cool.

158
00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:16.490
Part of that.

159
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.800
<v 3>Uh, the Tesla thing, so cool. They were showing the us air force,</v>

160
00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:24.320
some maneuverability thing, whatever that was like the last hour of the,

161
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.060
the test,

162
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.600
the experiment was showing them something that they could do that wasn't really

163
00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:29.760
being talked about. Cause the.

164
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.880
<v 2>Elon must shoot in that car in the space is so funny. Trump.</v>

165
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.640
<v 1>Must make so many people nervous in other countries like this,</v>

166
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.480
like just have him talking about it. Space will,

167
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.430
are just this just talking so flippantly.

168
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.630
<v 2>I think a lot of, a lot of people in not other countries like him,</v>

169
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.430
I think they're, I think they're enamored by his,

170
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.430
his just complete disregard for rules. I think people love that.

171
00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:51.870
He just doesn't give a. You.

172
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.150
<v 1>Think so? I think, I think so. Totally.</v>

173
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:56.550
Most countries are terrified that guy know is running America.

174
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.990
<v 2>I think like our friends do, but I think the,</v>

175
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.660
the majority of the other countries that don't give a about us are like that.

176
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:05.100
Guy's great. &lt;laugh&gt; I think our friendly countries, you know,

177
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:08.300
like England I'm sure is like, he's a nuisance, you know? But I think,

178
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.180
I think countries that don't give a about us are like that.

179
00:08:10.181 --> 00:08:11.740
Guy's hilarious that guy's a weirdo.

180
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.740
<v 1>Space war. Imagine we had space war with Russia.</v>

181
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.820
<v 2>It would be, that would be awesome. It'd be a great movie. Like.</v>

182
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.730
<v 1>How do we stop a war from breaking out? Who, who,</v>

183
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.890
who was gonna stop a war from breaking out? Nobody it's like,

184
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:26.370
it seems like they just keep pushing each other.

185
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.410
Like someone's gonna throw a sucker punch. Yeah. It's gonna happen. Oh.

186
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.970
<v 2>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Talk to &lt;inaudible&gt;. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah.</v>

187
00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:33.804
And then finally.

188
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.250
<v 1>They're in the hallway. They're pushing each other, right?</v>

189
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.850
No one wants to step to the left. We keep.

190
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.920
<v 2>Hitting one or two books of each other's hands.</v>

191
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.680
<v 1>Yeah. And it's always right there. It's always right there.</v>

192
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.120
<v 2>Then finally someone takes the hit. Yeah.</v>

193
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.040
<v 1>I mean it could easily happen with some little banana Republic. Right.</v>

194
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.160
That could start it off.

195
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.040
Some crazy dictator in Venezuela or some totally could send a missile

196
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.200
at some other dude and him up. And they're like, oh, is that we're doing now.

197
00:09:05.201 --> 00:09:07.960
And then we back this company and then the Russians back, the other guys.

198
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.240
And next thing you know, at old JS a millionaire and we're in a war.

199
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.510
I mean, which the we're so weird about war. It's like,

200
00:09:16.511 --> 00:09:20.270
we accept the fact that war exists. But only when it's not near us.

201
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.870
Not really interested in war, that's close. Can't be here.

202
00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:26.150
Like we have war in Afghanistan. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But that's inevitable.

203
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.310
But war over here is like, no, no way, no way. None of my land. You can't,

204
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.110
we don't. But if we're gonna have war over here, I.

205
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.860
<v 2>I hope we can contain it to like, you know, like North Dakota,</v>

206
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.900
somewhere where I'm not near. Yeah. Some.

207
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.820
<v 1>Weird spot, some.</v>

208
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.820
<v 2>Spot where we're like, dude, fight in the middle where there's not a lot.</v>

209
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.300
<v 1>Of go over the spot. You can have that area go fight right here. Yeah.</v>

210
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.780
If we fight right here, it would be good.

211
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.580
Would be the one like we all designated. This is the place we meet.

212
00:09:48.581 --> 00:09:52.780
We each other up what's date. Huh? Connecticut. Connecticut. Yeah, for sure.

213
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.100
Nobody would cry. Nah,
