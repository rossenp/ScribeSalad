WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>No crazy. You know, um, we were talking about Alex Jones.</v>

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.660
<v 1>Platform. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.640
<v 0>I mean, it seems to be like across the board,</v>

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.170
like there, it's almost the weighted for apple. It seems like.

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.640
And when apple pulled them from iTunes, then you know, YouTube, uh,

6
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.310
danced with it. Right. They'd given him some strikes.

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.180
It was really recently like within the last couple of months. Yeah.

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.050
Facebook had given him some strikes and YouTube gave him some strikes and people

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.850
were like, Hey, you know, there was some, I felt like almost like unfounded,

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.010
um, speculation that they would remove him from the platform.

11
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:44.550
Like they're an African and remove him. That's crazy. That's too far.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.990
And then all of a sudden, boom, everybody in one fell swoop,

13
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:53.040
Spotify, Spotify remove him. They were going to, they did right.

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.030
I tunes removed him. But there's a loophole though that somebody,

15
00:00:57.031 --> 00:01:00.180
I saw an article today where people want nothing but less than total

16
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:03.420
destruction, uh, I, that apple, uh,

17
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.340
attacked Alex Jones and got rid of him.

18
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.570
But they offered him a safety net in the form of the app that he has on their,

19
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.130
their app store. That they're still,

20
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:13.350
so they're trying to take that down to like take down. Yeah.

21
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.020
<v 1>His, his show became instantly way more popular. Oh, I'm sure. So,</v>

22
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.680
and the unintended consequences, I try to tell people that, uh, you know,

23
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.620
I'm not defending Alex Jones, I'm defending, you know,

24
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:27.320
the principle of freedom of speech. You know,

25
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:30.620
people who are convicted of killers who were on death row,

26
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.810
they still get their freedom of speech.

27
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.970
You're allowed to print articles and they're allowed to have,

28
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.770
you know what I mean? They're still allowed to, well, he's allowed.

29
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.220
<v 0>To no, I mean, he does, he hasn't been silenced. He has his website,</v>

30
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.470
but he could put his show out on his website.

31
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.890
He can host it from his website and it could all be fine.

32
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.770
But these major media companies, now,

33
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.930
they just decided we've had enough. We don't want this on. And here's the thing,

34
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:57.110
like, I don't know what he said, that,

35
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.320
that they w that was the straw that broke the camel's back.

36
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.740
It seemed like it's not a recent statement that he said, let's.

37
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.970
<v 1>Just go to the court transcripts and we'll figure out, oh,</v>

38
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.540
there wasn't there wasn't a co oh, there was no hearing or nothing.

39
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.190
There wasn't a judicial hearing. There was no, come on. They do. They just want,

40
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.150
they, they let some JAG off billionaire in the middle of the night on a whim.

41
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.540
do this. Is that what happened?

42
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.030
<v 0>Do you think that's what it is that was some billionaire?</v>

43
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:23.450
Or do you think it's the middle managers and the PR you know,

44
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:28.100
the executives at all these giant tech companies that just decided, okay.

45
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.060
<v 1>Um, I don't know. It's, it's definitely, uh,</v>

46
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.260
the government tells Facebook, uh, what to do a lot of times. Right?

47
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:38.450
And so they bow to the government all the time.

48
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.470
Cause they don't want to be regulated. So, uh, that's why they just,

49
00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:45.290
they just started having hearings with, that's why they had those hearings.

50
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:47.810
Should we regulate Facebook? Right. Those.

51
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.540
<v 0>Hearings by the way, were bizarre.</v>

52
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.960
It was like a guy pretending to be human. You know,

53
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:57.590
it was like some sort of a robot or an alien, the way he would sip water,

54
00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:00.640
he would take like this and like who sips water.

55
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.360
It was like a guy spitting dip into a glass. He would go like this.

56
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.040
It was the weirdest little sips.

57
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.490
Someone should make it compilation of Zuckerberg, sips of water.

58
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.560
That.

59
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.990
<v 1>Guy who makes the compilations of your show. He does a good job.</v>

60
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.490
He does a funny job on those Zuckerberg impression.

61
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.773
Okay.

62
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.560
<v 0>No Senator, no, sir. There, watch this. Watch that sip.</v>

63
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.350
Give me another one of those. Oh, there is one. They have them,

64
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.060
there is a drinking water copulation.

65
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.290
<v 2>Course. Oh my God. Watch.</v>

66
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.640
<v 0>Him sip. Who sips water like that. It's like, he has to think about it.</v>

67
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.380
Yeah. Act normal. Be human humans, drink water, drink the water.

68
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.090
How slowly he tilted.

69
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.100
<v 1>That glass and him and the guy behind him have the same color.</v>

70
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.640
<v 0>Mm mm that's. That's the guy that they're going to shoot in the head.</v>

71
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.310
<v 3>Keeping eye contact while he's drinking the water. It's kind of weird.</v>

72
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.290
Just trying to, at least you just won't be disrespectful.

73
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.930
<v 2>This is fantastic.</v>

74
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.620
<v 0>That that whole thing was so strange. It was so.</v>

75
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.020
<v 1>Or guide to, uh, to keep,</v>

76
00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:13.050
to protect us from fake news and tell us what's real news. And, uh,

77
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.310
and you know,

78
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.520
who has integrity and what doesn't then a guy who made a couple of billion

79
00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:19.410
dollars off of stolen idea from his friends. I mean,

80
00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:22.440
I think that's the perfect guy to say. That's a true story.

81
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.160
<v 0>Is that what he actually did? Yeah, I think so. That's in the movie, right?</v>

82
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.520
That was in the movie. That's what I know. I didn't see the movie. Oh, okay.

83
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.430
Yeah. I know the story though, was that he ripped people off.

84
00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:36.480
That it wasn't his idea, but he was the one who figured out a way to wrestle it.

85
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.720
Yeah. Uh, I don't know, get rich as.

86
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.180
<v 1>But this is, uh, TB wrote an article on the second,</v>

87
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.910
uh, August 2nd about this. And um,

88
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.110
there's been a lot of people being the platform from Facebook that you don't

89
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:56.940
know about. Like this isn't like, okay. Uh, okay. So, um, here's,

90
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.440
here's what he's they shut down lots of other sites at the behest of the

91
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:04.020
government and Israel like the, and the Atlantic council.

92
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.850
So pages like black elevation, they got shut down a page called bind,

93
00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:12.780
full being. They got shut down. Uh, Facebook also wiped out,

94
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:14.640
no unite the right to it,

95
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.480
which is a page appearing to advertise a counter rally on the upcoming unit

96
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.820
anniversary of the violence in Charlottesville.

97
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.220
So they shut that down to Matt Taibbi.

98
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.590
Let me just give you a quick quote from his article.

99
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.300
He says Facebook was helped in its efforts to wipe out these dangerous memes by

100
00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:33.120
the Atlantic council on whose board you'll find confidence,

101
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:37.290
inspiring names like Henry Kissinger, CIA, chief, Michael Hayden,

102
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.430
former acting CIA had Michael Morel and former Bush era Homeland security,

103
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:43.320
chief Michael Chertoff.

104
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.370
These people now have their hands on what is essentially a direct lever over

105
00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:50.520
nationwide news distribution. It's hard though,

106
00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:53.970
to state the potential mischief that lurks behind this union of internet

107
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:58.340
platforms and would be government censors at,

108
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.500
can I just read you one more paragraph? Cause this is,

109
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.060
this is exactly what we're talking about.

110
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:07.040
He says it is already a scandal that these defacto private media regulators have

111
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:11.810
secret algorithmic processes that pushed down some news organizations in favor

112
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:12.261
of others,

113
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:16.670
which they do witness the complaints by outlets like alternate truth dig and

114
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:17.031
others.

115
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:21.110
That big platforms have been deemphasizing alternative sites in the name of

116
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:24.530
combating fake news. But this week's revelation is worse.

117
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.490
When Facebook works with the government and want to want to be star chamber

118
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:32.630
organizations like the Atlantic council to delete sites on national security

119
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:34.550
grounds using secret methodology,

120
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.870
it opens the door to nightmare possibilities that you'd only find in dystopian

121
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:43.820
novels. So he goes on and it's, it's awesome what he says, but, um,

122
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.510
we would have more.

123
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.330
<v 0>Comfort if they would. I mean,</v>

124
00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:49.060
there's no like one of the things that they're doing is they use that blanket

125
00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:50.050
term hate speech.

126
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.340
<v 1>So by the way, so now they're, they're trying to put a bill,</v>

127
00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:57.730
have you heard about this in Congress to make police a protected class of

128
00:06:57.731 --> 00:07:00.910
people? So if you say about them now it's considered hate speech.

129
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.300
Did you know that? Yeah. They're trying to make peop yes.

130
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.690
The police would be considered hate speech. So they would.

131
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.490
<v 0>Just retroactively arrest NWA. They could, but it was a cop killer. Remember?</v>

132
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.383
Right.

133
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.830
<v 2>Cop killer.</v>

134
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.380
<v 1>Now, if you do have a rally that's against the police,</v>

135
00:07:17.381 --> 00:07:21.430
that's a hate rally and they can take your YouTube channel down.

136
00:07:21.431 --> 00:07:25.060
If you said hate stuff about the cops and stuff. So that's where we are.

137
00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:28.990
Hate speech, the. How come I'm not allowed to hate, by the way,

138
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.180
I hate Nazis. Can I say I hate Nazis. I hate the KKK. Can I say I hate them?

139
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.433
That's hate speech.

140
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.300
<v 0>Aye. You strongly dislike the KKK. You can strongly dislike something.</v>

141
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.610
<v 1>When I was a kid, I hated the Dodgers.</v>

142
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.720
I know it's speech because I was a Cubs fan and the Dodgers always kicked out

143
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.060
it's fish. Yeah. Hate speech.

144
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.010
<v 0>Is a strange blanket term. Almost like drugs, like drugs is caffeine,</v>

145
00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:58.570
but it's also heroin. You know, it's like drugs. I don't understand what it is.

146
00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.410
There's hate out.

147
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.690
<v 1>There. So what, so what's wrong. So by the way, I.</v>

148
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.670
<v 0>In a bad way of expressing things like hate speech is it's,</v>

149
00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:10.300
it's not a good descriptive because I agree when you, when you stop,

150
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.020
what does it entail? Like, you know, I had a conversation with a woman, uh,

151
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.060
at YouTube about Sam Harris and, um, uh,

152
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.480
Douglas Murray in a podcast where they had had, um,

153
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:27.130
a conversation and someone put it on their YouTube channel in their playlist,

154
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.870
just put it in their playlist. And they got a community guidelines. I asked,

155
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.790
I asked why and the woman said very cleanly. It was hate speech. And I said,

156
00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:39.280
what are you talking about? I go, did you listen to it?

157
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.800
Or is it two intellectuals?

158
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.830
So there's two public intellectuals discuss discussing immigration.

159
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.780
And some of the problems that Europe is having right now,

160
00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:49.720
and you decided that that's hate speech and you don't even know what they said,

161
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.320
but that, but the fact that she so confidently described it in that way,

162
00:08:53.321 --> 00:08:56.880
sort of it sort of embodies what this problem is,

163
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.400
is that they have these blanket terms.

164
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.030
They were out to throw on problems and there's a million other fires to put out.

165
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.370
So there's no more need to put any more consideration to this.

166
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.960
This guy has a problem. This is problematic. This is hate speech, shut it down.

167
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:16.040
<v 1>And people don't realize how bad it is feral you do. Cause you know this story,</v>

168
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.670
but people go, oh good for Alex Jones. He shouldn't be able to do that stuff.

169
00:09:19.671 --> 00:09:21.110
What he's doing, not good. I'm like,

170
00:09:21.111 --> 00:09:25.460
do not understand that this is the shot across the bow.

171
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.950
That if they can do this to Alex Jones, that they're coming,

172
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.550
I've already been trashed by the establishment media, by the Washington post,

173
00:09:31.551 --> 00:09:32.384
by CNN.

174
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.380
I've already been equated to pedophiles and those kinds of things and conspiracy

175
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.230
theorists. And I put in articles with Alex Jones. They've done it to me.

176
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.010
So because I tell the truth about the war, right? And so.

177
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.020
<v 4>Uh, the.</v>

178
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:49.010
<v 1>Antidote to bad speech, if you really hate what Alex Jones is doing,</v>

179
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.560
the antidote to bad speech is not censorship.

180
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.460
The antidote to bad speech is more speech. If you think of what speech,

181
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.250
if you think what Alex Jones is doing, needs to be debunked,

182
00:09:58.251 --> 00:10:02.600
create a Facebook page called to bunking, Alex Jones and debunk him. You know,

183
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.550
Kyle Kalinsky does that kind of stuff all the time.

184
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.340
People do that stuff all the time. That's how you convert.

185
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.640
If you're afraid of an idea, you don't shut down the idea.

186
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.640
You expose the idea. But.

187
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.270
<v 0>If you have a private platform and you own this and you start a business and</v>

188
00:10:17.271 --> 00:10:22.040
your businesses putting up YouTube videos and you decide that someone is

189
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:25.160
putting up something that's hurtful and damaging and racist,

190
00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:28.310
and it could be used to attack large groups of people.

191
00:10:28.311 --> 00:10:32.960
And then you see like all the craziness that's been connected to the

192
00:10:32.961 --> 00:10:36.740
alt-right movement. And you associate that with this individual.

193
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.700
Do you have to keep that on your platform? I mean,

194
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.890
there's no regulation right now. It's not like.

195
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.280
<v 1>Public utilities, right? It should be though. That's my point.</v>

196
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:50.450
My point is that 70% of the people get their news from Google and Facebook and

197
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.080
there are monopoly, right? So they have monopolistic powers and he presents,

198
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.880
yeah. That's that was a, that was a stat I read today. So you can't,

199
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.060
uh, it's like, well, I don't know if I believe it. Hey, they took,

200
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.850
they took stress. Yeah. They took distress.

201
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.350
<v 3>Stress.</v>

202
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.720
It's a lot it's if it says 45% of the people get it straight from Facebook,

203
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:12.890
that means 150 million people are on Facebook every single day.

204
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.080
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I think that's not accurate. No, but I think that's right. Well, we,</v>

205
00:11:17.081 --> 00:11:17.680
we don't.

206
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.513
<v 3>That's three people in this room.</v>

207
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.330
Aren't so that's the three people right here that.

208
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.180
<v 0>Aren't. But I get my news from Google. Well,</v>

209
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.360
I have that Google app on my phone and every,

210
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.930
every day I go to it in the morning when I'm taking a and I go over like,

211
00:11:29.931 --> 00:11:33.230
what's crazy today what's happened. Oh, new Porsche coming out.

212
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.680
One sentence like that. Sasha Baron Cohen do one sentence.

213
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.360
Let's see what they said. I just.

214
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.280
<v 3>Looked at that's what it said. 45%. I get it from, from a Facebook too.</v>

215
00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:45.920
Is it a Gallup poll? It was it according to their stats.

216
00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:48.120
And I went back to read another rolling stone article to find out where,

217
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.680
and it's a bunch of like a Facebook article selling advertisements,

218
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.600
trying to find the data. So even.

219
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.820
<v 1>Even, even if you quibble with those, you,</v>

220
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.730
we can't deny like Alex Jones cannot now go, well,

221
00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.280
just go to the other YouTube there. Isn't in the residential.

222
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.200
You hate just go to the other Facebook there isn't another.

223
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.950
So we have to recognize that the way we are organized as a society,

224
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:13.360
that the town square is now owned by corporations who that need to be regulated.

225
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:14.980
Right? Like if like before, you know,

226
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:18.550
when at and T was the phone carrier for everybody, they couldn't go.

227
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:21.280
I'm not going to give Alex Jones a phone service because I don't like the

228
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.120
saying, right? So, you know, we, you can't deny services, somebody,

229
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:26.970
all that stuff. It's not really.

230
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.010
<v 0>A valid comparison because the phone service wasn't distributed information to</v>

231
00:12:32.011 --> 00:12:35.040
people, right? The phone service is just a method of communication.

232
00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:38.610
It was just a utility with what he's able to do through, uh,

233
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.230
info wars is if you've got them on your platform, he's gonna say some things.

234
00:12:43.231 --> 00:12:46.590
And he's going to use your platform to say some things that, you know,

235
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.390
might not be true. It might be crazy.

236
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.270
So you gotta decide like when does it become a problem?

237
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:54.210
And I think where they drew the line was Sandy hook.

238
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.160
<v 1>Here's what I say, Joe. Uh,</v>

239
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.690
we need to treat these as public utilities because they are right Facebook.

240
00:13:00.691 --> 00:13:03.450
There is no alternative. There is an alternative to YouTube.

241
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.940
We need to regulate them. It's a long overdue by the way.

242
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.290
And they are monopolies there. It's obvious to everyone that they're monopolies.

243
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:11.280
But you know, when you,

244
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.450
when you invent something called WhatsApp and then Facebook buys it for $20

245
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.810
billion, there's a monopoly. There's no way. There's no way to,

246
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.360
to compete with these people. So these are monopolies.

247
00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:26.030
They need to be regulated and people that need to be protected. And it, it,

248
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.050
that's how, that's where we need to go.

249
00:13:28.051 --> 00:13:31.560
Because right now we're leaving it up to the whims of a billion. Like you say,

250
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:31.801
Hey,

251
00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:35.490
if Alex Jones really did some that was wrong and he should be taken off or his

252
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.300
free speech should be a bridge for it, do it. Let's see, go,

253
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.240
go to a court or go to a thing or go, people go, well,

254
00:13:42.241 --> 00:13:46.440
he docks his people and he is, if doxing is illegal, he should be prosecuted.

255
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.040
If that's what happened, but you shouldn't take away. Did he docks people?

256
00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:51.990
That's what they're saying. They're saying he's died. He'd won it.

257
00:13:51.991 --> 00:13:55.830
He docs to people from Newtown or whatever, uh, from the school shooting.

258
00:13:55.831 --> 00:13:57.180
So that's what they're talking about.

259
00:13:57.181 --> 00:14:00.120
The individuals that he gave their addresses and their names.

260
00:14:00.121 --> 00:14:02.460
That's what they are saying that he died. Let's.

261
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.980
<v 0>Find out if he actually did that, because that sounds cool.</v>

262
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.680
<v 1>I, I I'm S I don't know if he did, but.</v>

263
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.570
<v 0>Saying what he actually did. This is what's crazy. I keep hearing that he,</v>

264
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:17.490
um, promoted the idea that Sandy hook was a

265
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.360
false,

266
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.100
it was false and that it was a false flag and that these were all actors.

267
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.540
Right? I don't know if he actually said that. I think what he actually said was,

268
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.530
I don't know if that happened. I think that's what he actually said.

269
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.640
And people are saying, well, that's promoting the idea that, that it was a hoax,

270
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.700
but I want to know if that's what he really said. See,

271
00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:41.070
I don't know if that's even the case. Cause I've heard it.

272
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.990
I've heard it written that he promoted the idea that Sandy hook was a

273
00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:50.280
conspiracy, but they're not quoting the, when they say that there's no quotes,

274
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.440
there's no hook was a hoax. Those kids were actors.

275
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.650
Those kids are not dead. I don't see that anywhere. Right.

276
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.750
But they keep attributing that to him.

277
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.570
<v 1>Quotation. But again, if this, if there was some kind of process due process,</v>

278
00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:06.790
we could go back and look at the transcript. And we would know.

279
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.850
<v 0>Not only that if during this whole time where he's being tried,</v>

280
00:15:09.851 --> 00:15:13.300
he was still labeled to be on YouTube and have his videos.

281
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.860
He could show in his videos that he didn't say that he could show what he

282
00:15:17.861 --> 00:15:21.700
actually said and tell you what he actually said and show clips.

283
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.080
He can't do that anymore.

284
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:27.040
So now the narrative is completely in the hands of the mainstream media,

285
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:27.903
a hundred percent.

286
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.170
So the Alex Jones narrative is being taken 100% out of his hands.

287
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.820
And now it's in the mainstream media. And now there's Sandy hook, denier,

288
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.840
conspiracy, theorist, right-wing lunatic, all these different things,

289
00:15:40.841 --> 00:15:44.350
which may or some of it. I mean, Alex, pretty nuts.

290
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.740
<v 1>It's my, my, my point is, uh, we've had nuts people with,</v>

291
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.420
I still have that when I was a kid. Joe,

292
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:53.980
maybe you remember Johnny Carson used to go about the national Inquirer. Yes.

293
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.630
Do you remember that? And it was a big deal.

294
00:15:55.631 --> 00:15:58.480
He would stop his show and I'm putting my foot down about this.

295
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.290
They still have the national and nobody said, take it out of the supermarkets.

296
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.131
Nobody was like,

297
00:16:03.131 --> 00:16:06.610
we got to ban that newspaper because we can't handle the ideas from this

298
00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:09.190
newspaper. They're still right. There you go to Ralph's they're right there.

299
00:16:09.191 --> 00:16:10.630
They're the last thing you see before they leave.

300
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.090
They're right at the eye level for kids. Nobody.

301
00:16:13.091 --> 00:16:15.490
What says take away the national inquiry. I went to Facebook.

302
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.670
They still have a Facebook page. National Inquirer. Yes.

303
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.830
So is the world news daily and you know what?

304
00:16:20.831 --> 00:16:24.780
The first news news story was that came up on the world. News dailies was, uh,

305
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.430
a, a British man can only dedicate through his mouth.

306
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.790
That was the first story that came up. The first story,

307
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.360
you don't have to look for it. British red deprecates case through his Bob.

308
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:34.690
And I'm like.

309
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.500
<v 2>Dude, this is, this is like south park. Yeah. And it's.</v>

310
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.560
<v 0>Not like you want them to be taken down as well. But it's,</v>

311
00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:44.400
what's interesting is like world news daily and star magazine,

312
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.040
all those they've sort of been, they're a joke. Like, you know, it's not real,

313
00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:51.580
you know, the Inquirer's not real, but we know that, but it's not. It's,

314
00:16:51.581 --> 00:16:54.130
it's just, somebody is buying those, nobody's buying those. Right.

315
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:54.993
But are they buying,

316
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.140
are they kind of buying them fun and somebody watches professional wrestling

317
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.740
here. It goes. Lawsuit, quotes, Jones sayings. Yeah.

318
00:17:02.741 --> 00:17:06.550
So Sandy hook is a synthetic completely fake is,

319
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:11.410
is a synthetic completely fake with actors in my view,

320
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.940
manufactured. Okay. I would show the video January,

321
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.450
right? January 13th, 2015.

322
00:17:19.451 --> 00:17:24.040
The lawsuit quotes Joan saying. Yeah. So Sandy. Yeah.

323
00:17:24.041 --> 00:17:28.090
So Sandy hook is a synthetic completely fake with actors.

324
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.550
My view manufactured. Um, yeah. You,

325
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:33.910
yeah.

326
00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:37.210
<v 1>That you actually nail that impression. I spent a lot of time with that dude.</v>

327
00:17:37.211 --> 00:17:40.690
Drunk. There's a he's um, like that's, that's.

328
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:44.620
<v 0>A real problem saying something like that. It's crazy. But he's he's look, he,</v>

329
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.820
his whole business is saying things that are sometimes right.

330
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.610
And saying things that are sometimes absolutely wrong, you know? And,

331
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:58.020
and that's, and it's all wild and it's all globalists.

332
00:17:58.021 --> 00:18:03.000
And you ever see that song that they did where these guys took his actual words

333
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:07.830
and rants, but then they have like this like emo song singing the words.

334
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.030
No, it's genius. When we get pulled over off of YouTube, if we play that,

335
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.360
let's find out if we get yanked for this one. Cause it's brilliant because it's,

336
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:16.590
it's a parody, but it's.

337
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.180
<v 4>So it's so Indy folk song. Yeah. You said email's fine enough. There's.</v>

338
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.990
<v 0>Two indie folk emo you know, some low testosterone music.</v>

339
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.420
<v 4>Play. Listen to this, listen, listen, listen this. And that's.</v>

340
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.830
<v 0>Why we're just under doing simple things,</v>

341
00:18:30.831 --> 00:18:33.290
pointing out that we're meant to be in nature and be natural.

342
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.920
And this is where we find the source that God made to transcend the new world

343
00:18:36.921 --> 00:18:39.710
order. And that's why they want to try to keep us out of it. Watch this

344
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.290
[inaudible] Oh, you're taking the audio off

345
00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:59.990
Alex Jones,

346
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.940
rants as an indie folk song for people that are just listening to this.

347
00:19:04.941 --> 00:19:09.560
You got to Google this because we removed the sound from YouTube. Oh,

348
00:19:09.561 --> 00:19:10.394
okay.

349
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:11.810
<v 2>Hey babies.</v>

350
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:16.100
<v 0>You want to eat babies? We love saying we want to eat babies. I have the one.</v>

351
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.820
<v 2>Video. That's just what you just said. I have Hillary good, not village.</v>

352
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.543
[inaudible]

353
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:46.603
this

354
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:51.320
post smell like sulfur.

355
00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.500
This is song literal fab, Pyre, pot,

356
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:01.723
belly, goblins.

357
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.290
Come on. Oh, well my God

358
00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.773
[inaudible]

359
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.570
I, you know, I think.

360
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.340
<v 0>There's something, there's something about his struggle right now.</v>

361
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.350
That's representative of the chaotic world that we live in,

362
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.550
that, that he does have this giant voice than he does is they have this giant

363
00:20:37.551 --> 00:20:41.480
following and that it is this, this is actual words,

364
00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:44.420
come out and song like that and are so hysterical.

365
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:49.150
And that they think that somehow or another yanking,

366
00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:52.150
this guy off all these platforms is going to like remove it.

367
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.460
Do they understand the Streisand effect?

368
00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:57.550
Cause this is just going it's there's going to be another way.

369
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.330
But what's the Streisand effect. Barbara Streisand had a house in Malibu,

370
00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:05.920
just giant house. And he took pictures of it and she went ape and you know,

371
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:07.750
complained to all these, you know,

372
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.080
newspapers and complained to the police and everything that they're taking

373
00:21:11.081 --> 00:21:14.620
photos of her house and get the outta here. This is Barbara Streisand.

374
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.370
And because of that, it became a giant story that Barbara Streisand is.

375
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.560
If someone's showing her house and they're like, wow,

376
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:23.530
it must be a hell of a house. Where is it? And then there it is.

377
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.090
The Streisand effect is a phenomenon.

378
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.750
There's the house whereby an attempt to hide, remove or sensor.

379
00:21:28.751 --> 00:21:32.650
A piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the

380
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:36.880
information more wildly, usually facilitated by the internet. Okay. Yeah.

381
00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:40.623
<v 2>[Inaudible] no, I thought you guys</v>

382
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.160
[inaudible].

383
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.300
<v 1>But on print again, people may make the false equate. Oh, you're defending Alex,</v>

384
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:55.230
Joe, I'm not defending, you're defending free speech. I'm defending free speech.

385
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.160
And I understand the argument that, Hey, it's a private corporation. I get that.

386
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.870
I get that. But if you took a look at the bigger picture, the should be,

387
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.110
everyone thinks the internet should be a public utility. I mean, most people do.

388
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.230
And that's what they're upset that they're not treating it like a public utility

389
00:22:10.231 --> 00:22:12.960
Obama administration did. They decided to at the last minute.

390
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.870
And so if you think the internet should be a public utility,

391
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.440
I think YouTube and Facebook should be a public utility also.

392
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.860
And there's th there's an opening for.

393
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.750
<v 0>Other people to make their own YouTube, like make a version of it.</v>

394
00:22:27.751 --> 00:22:29.640
If you have sufficient capital.

395
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:33.060
<v 1>Right. She don't and there's and if you do start it, they'll just buy you out.</v>

396
00:22:33.061 --> 00:22:33.270
Like,

397
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.960
like I just showed you the example of WhatsApp with they give you 20 night with

398
00:22:36.961 --> 00:22:39.410
$19 billion on whatever they paid for. It was some crazy.

399
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.880
So that's a just eat up their competition right now.

400
00:22:41.881 --> 00:22:44.760
We need a Teddy Roosevelt to come along and break up all these monopolies.

401
00:22:44.761 --> 00:22:49.320
It's never going to happen. Uh, the end of the empire is coming. So here's.

402
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.310
<v 0>The question like, is there a valid parallel,</v>

403
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.080
a valid comparison? Like,

404
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.220
are there people that have things that are more hateful that are on YouTube that

405
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.570
have been de platformed?

406
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:05.070
Is it the influence that he has that that's terrifying?

407
00:23:05.071 --> 00:23:09.720
Is it the fact that he's a figurehead for this kind of stuff?

408
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.290
Is that what it is like that he's the,

409
00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:17.070
this whole info wars movement is in some people's mind that figure

410
00:23:17.071 --> 00:23:21.750
head for this pro Trump thing that they're trying to stop and silence. Like,

411
00:23:21.751 --> 00:23:22.170
what is.

412
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.320
<v 1>It? I don't know. It's very curious that it all happened at the same time.</v>

413
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:29.790
Right. And because there's a, there's a, um, in 1996,

414
00:23:29.791 --> 00:23:33.240
there was a law passed that actually, um,

415
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.230
insulates the platforms from being sued. Did you know that? So like.

416
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.480
<v 0>So if someone puts up something and.</v>

417
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.360
<v 1>So like say he puts something up that leads to someone getting killed right on</v>

418
00:23:42.361 --> 00:23:46.040
Facebook, you can't Sue you can't Sue YouTube, you Sue Facebook for it.

419
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.120
That's in that 1996 law. Um, so there's that.

420
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:52.190
So I get that they're a private company, but again,

421
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:56.060
they have to have the protection of the law. They have Congress protecting them.

422
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:57.860
So they have a certain, that's a certain,

423
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:02.270
that's a type of regulation you're regulated from you. Can't Sue them. Right.

424
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.530
So I'm looking for this tweet by Glenn Greenwald. That really,

425
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.200
because if we're going to take down, uh, here, I'll find it. I'll find it. Um,

426
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.500
here it is. He says, um,

427
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.490
there's been a tactic of censors for centuries.

428
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:23.540
They start with someone who is so utterly hated and marginalized that everyone

429
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:28.190
is blinded by their hatred for the first censorship target that they cheer and

430
00:24:28.191 --> 00:24:33.050
forget that they're endorsing a principle and power that will then expand.

431
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.150
And so right now they came for the Jews right now, we're allowing, uh,

432
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.020
the whim of billionaires in the middle of the night to decide who gets to be on

433
00:24:42.021 --> 00:24:45.920
these monopolistic platforms and who doesn't. If there was 10 YouTube,

434
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.860
no one would care, but there isn't, there's one YouTube.

435
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.960
There's one Facebook and they are monopolies.

436
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:52.490
And that's the world we live in right now.

437
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.520
And that's why they are doing whatever the government wants them to because they

438
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:57.170
don't want the government to regulate them.

439
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.410
That's why he went there and was sipping the water like that and trying to make

440
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:03.620
eye contact and be nice. Cause he doesn't want them to regulate him.

441
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.040
He'll do it for I'll do Julian Assange in 2010 gave a speech,

442
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:10.280
which I saw recently on a plane where he predicted this. He was like,

443
00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:13.040
the corporations are an extension of the government and they will do the

444
00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:16.190
censorship in the future. And that's exactly what's happening right now.

445
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:17.590
The thing is the government.

446
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.700
<v 0>Is censoring Alex Jones.</v>

447
00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.400
Cause I would think that the government that's in power currently would want to

448
00:25:21.401 --> 00:25:24.400
keep Alex Jones in position. Cause he's a supporter of Trump.

449
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.490
He's a supporter of, you know, why.

450
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.160
<v 1>Does, so why does, why is Trump going after Julian Assad?</v>

451
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.320
Just because he's afraid he'll expose him someday.

452
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.460
Why is he allowing the CIA to do that? To go after Julian massage?

453
00:25:36.461 --> 00:25:39.760
And do you know that just shows you how the journalists are in America because

454
00:25:39.761 --> 00:25:41.740
not one of them were standing up for Gillian and signs.

455
00:25:41.741 --> 00:25:45.370
And they're all pretending that when Trump says mean things about Jim Acosta,

456
00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:50.470
that somehow that's this unbelievable violation of our freedom and our press.

457
00:25:50.471 --> 00:25:53.210
And he's got you son of a. You don't care.

458
00:25:53.211 --> 00:25:55.660
If you cared about freedom of the press,

459
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.660
you would say something about Julian Assange. And no one is saying,

460
00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.670
what lie has Juliana sons' ever printed? Nah, never, never, never.

461
00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.050
What did Juliana sons do?

462
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.910
He revealed that our election was being rigged by the democratic party,

463
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.570
not Russia, but by the democratic party. And that is a sin. You can't commit.

464
00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:16.810
You can not tell the truth about the powerful and that's what's happening right

465
00:26:16.811 --> 00:26:21.040
now. And uh, you know, he, he revealed the CIA in, in, um,

466
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:25.720
has all those spine techniques that they can get your TV to listen to you,

467
00:26:25.721 --> 00:26:29.410
your phone, uh, vault seven, all that stuff he revealed.

468
00:26:29.411 --> 00:26:31.840
That's why they want to get him. But I, and Trump, you know,

469
00:26:31.841 --> 00:26:36.670
I just think that Trump is just, you know, he's not really clued in,

470
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.260
right? He's lets other,

471
00:26:38.261 --> 00:26:41.680
he's glad to let the generals do the job and his underlings.

472
00:26:41.681 --> 00:26:43.320
He doesn't really want, he wants paint,

473
00:26:43.321 --> 00:26:46.440
broad strokes and lets everyone you want to kill Julian sons, go ahead.

474
00:26:46.441 --> 00:26:48.690
I don't give a F that's. I think how he feels,

475
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.280
I don't think it's his plan to do it,

476
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.110
but everybody else underneath him wants to do.

477
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:55.230
And certainly the intelligence community and everyone forgets this.

478
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.760
Chuck Schumer went on Rachel Maddow show like two years ago and right out in

479
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:03.480
public said that Trump is making a mistake by crossing the intelligence

480
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:05.220
community. Because when you mess with them,

481
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:10.080
they have six ways to Sunday to mess with you back. Holy. And nobody cared that.

482
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:10.560
He said that.

483
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.890
So what he's saying is the president should be afraid of unelected, spooks,

484
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.940
unelected bureaucrats. These, they should be each should be afraid of them.

485
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.470
That is. And no one went what,

486
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.620
what the F could you imagine saying that about Barack Obama? Hey,

487
00:27:22.621 --> 00:27:25.440
Barack Obama better be nice to the CIA. They're going to F with him.

488
00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.140
<v 0>As an elected official. Yes. Someone does elected officials saying that almost,</v>

489
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.130
almost sanctioning it.

490
00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:31.910
<v 1>Yes.</v>

491
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.970
And then we have Eugene Robinson in the Washington post writing an articles,

492
00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.900
begging the deep state to undermine about Trump's foreign policy.

493
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.770
Did you see that article? Yes. Pulitzer prize winner.

494
00:27:42.771 --> 00:27:44.870
First they spend all their life denying.

495
00:27:44.871 --> 00:27:48.500
There is a deep state and then new gene Robinson writes an article begging the

496
00:27:48.501 --> 00:27:52.100
deep state to defy president, uh, president Trump. Why is that?

497
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.850
<v 0>So blinded by ideology that they don't see the consequences of this story.</v>

498
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.850
<v 1>Unintended consequences. And here they are and they're coming.</v>

499
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.020
They've already come for me. They're already coming for the left. This is how,

500
00:28:03.021 --> 00:28:06.470
this is how this works. So again,

501
00:28:06.471 --> 00:28:10.340
that's why I warn all my friends about the Russia gate nonsense. Chomsky said,

502
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.400
if you care about the people meddling in our election,

503
00:28:13.401 --> 00:28:15.320
Russia would be the last place I would look.

504
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.760
The first place to look is concentrated capital. That's what dictates,

505
00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.080
who are going to be our government.

506
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.260
That's why we don't have the things the rest of the world has because we have a

507
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.260
capital has captured our government,

508
00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.390
which is why we don't have Medicare for all,

509
00:28:29.391 --> 00:28:30.830
which is why we don't have free college,

510
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.400
which is why we don't have an infrastructure plan, which is why we're in a wars.

511
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.280
Meanwhile, people have the country's poor, low income.

512
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.430
63% of the country can't afford a thousand dollars emergency.

513
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:44.210
And a quarter of all kids are in poverty in the richest country, in the world.

514
00:28:44.211 --> 00:28:47.210
Joe, what do you call a system that takes the richest country in the world and

515
00:28:47.211 --> 00:28:51.770
renders half of its population, poor or low income. That's a failed system.

516
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:56.210
And that's what we're living in right now. And it's failing worldwide. Now.

517
00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.250
<v 0>If you were someone like Google though, or, uh, who owns YouTube,</v>

518
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.600
or if you were iTunes or any of these platforms that have Spotify,

519
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.880
when you get an overwhelming volume of complaints about someone

520
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.230
who's in the news right now,

521
00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:17.300
because the fact that Alex Jones is being sued by the Sandy hook parents.

522
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.450
This is what started this all off because it means to people.

523
00:29:20.451 --> 00:29:24.470
This is so gracious. These poor parents lost their children.

524
00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.610
And here's the sky.

525
00:29:25.611 --> 00:29:29.510
It's horrible saying that it's fake and that they don't want that on their

526
00:29:29.511 --> 00:29:30.141
platform.

527
00:29:30.141 --> 00:29:34.340
So would you think that they should just delete the episode that has that,

528
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:39.350
that says that, should they do that or should they allow that episode?

529
00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.380
<v 1>The stream? I, so, uh, here's this there's a solution. If, if there's,</v>

530
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:49.060
if he did do something in a video that is illegal, uh,

531
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.340
take that video down until it gets adjudicated,

532
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.900
you don't see platform a hundred. You don't give him the death penalty.

533
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.620
<v 0>Right. So, okay. What about like storm front?</v>

534
00:29:58.621 --> 00:30:01.800
What have you got like some white supremacist group that's calling for violence

535
00:30:01.801 --> 00:30:04.830
against people. You do, you take them down? I.

536
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.510
<v 1>Think you would, again, you would have to.</v>

537
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.100
I would like to see in some kind of adjudication, you know, again, I, the blank,

538
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:11.760
good policies.

539
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.380
<v 0>And things saying things like hate speech.</v>

540
00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:17.760
<v 1>So interpretation. And by just a week ago, mark Zuckerberg was defending it.</v>

541
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.970
He was defending that, that we have Holocaust deniers on our platform,

542
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.170
Holocaust deniers, Joe. And that's not fake news. That's not going to,

543
00:30:24.171 --> 00:30:25.950
you're not going to take that down. Like I just told you,

544
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.860
they have guys deprecating out of their mouth. They have this, they,

545
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.910
they ha they have the, the, the, the, uh, the national Enquirer.

546
00:30:32.911 --> 00:30:36.510
They're still cool. So this is a very squiggly line, Joe. And again, there's,

547
00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.950
there's no board, there's no adjudication. It's not transparent. Transparent.

548
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.830
<v 0>It's not rational either. This is not, this is not a rational debate.</v>

549
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.020
<v 1>Uh, let me just the sheer,</v>

550
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.530
let me just give you one more thing about what he says when, uh,

551
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.060
this is Matt Taibbi.

552
00:30:51.061 --> 00:30:54.540
He says the sheer market power of these companies over information flow has

553
00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:55.920
always been the real threat.

554
00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.820
This is why breaking them up should have long ago become a national priority.

555
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:00.893
Instead,

556
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.470
as was obvious during the Senate hearing with mark Zuckerberg earlier this year,

557
00:31:04.471 --> 00:31:09.420
politicians are more interested in using then curtailing the power of

558
00:31:09.421 --> 00:31:14.250
these companies. The platform for their part will cave rather than be regulated.

559
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.980
The end game clear, couldn't be clearer.

560
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.160
This is how authoritarians marriages begin.

561
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:23.970
And people should be very worried. They should be worried.

562
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.270
<v 0>They should be worried, especially if this does escalate.</v>

563
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:32.190
I understand that people who believe that he's a

564
00:31:32.191 --> 00:31:34.440
Sandy hook denier, and they read those words.

565
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.260
They don't want him to have a platform.

566
00:31:37.261 --> 00:31:39.540
They don't want them to be able to spread that hate. And they understand,

567
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:41.010
I understand that they would feel like,

568
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.220
imagine being one of those parents and you lost your kid. And you're, you're,

569
00:31:45.221 --> 00:31:49.820
you're seeing this guy on TV or on YouTube saying, it's all fake. It's,

570
00:31:49.821 --> 00:31:53.700
it's outrageous. And it's repulsive. I agree. It's offensive. And I get that.

571
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.190
But I think it's.

572
00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.670
<v 4>It's, it's very dangerous.</v>

573
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.280
<v 0>It's very dangerous to silence people that may or may</v>

574
00:32:05.281 --> 00:32:09.480
not have any other recourse in terms of like,

575
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.860
he doesn't have the ability to defend himself.

576
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.220
He doesn't have the ability to make a video about it unless he puts it on his

577
00:32:17.221 --> 00:32:19.800
own website. And then who's going to watch it like this,

578
00:32:19.801 --> 00:32:22.170
the stuff that they're doing with YouTube, it's just.

579
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.810
<v 4>It's a slippery slope.</v>

580
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.710
<v 0>You know? And especially when they use these terms, like hate speech.</v>

581
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.200
They're not like, when you say, like, what are they saying?

582
00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:35.220
They saying that he violated their terms, correct? Yes. So what is,

583
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.030
what are those terms that he violated and what is the specific violation?

584
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.590
Like what are the words that he said where you were like, enough is enough?

585
00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:43.763
And if that's the case,

586
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.850
how did you let him get away with saying all this other for years and years?

587
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:50.510
And w when, when do you draw this line? Like just that video that we played,

588
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.960
you know, they smell like sulfur, they eat it. They want to eat babies.

589
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:57.960
They're screaming. I love Satan. And they one, he babies like, whoa,

590
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.940
where does the line get drawn? I just, I don't, I don't think,

591
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.900
I don't think that should be up to subjectivity.

592
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:10.730
I think that should be a, a very, very hard question.

593
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.370
That's answered with very clear facts.

594
00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:18.520
<v 1>You should have an adversarial judicial process with an impartial judge or jury.</v>

595
00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:19.210
Right. And how.

596
00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.040
<v 0>Would you even get someone impartial instead?</v>

597
00:33:21.041 --> 00:33:23.200
They have in-house decide decisions.

598
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.640
<v 1>Well, you heard that. I mean,</v>

599
00:33:24.641 --> 00:33:27.670
you heard Matt Tabby does delineate the people who are involved in this stuff.

600
00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:31.150
And by the way, Facebook's taken down pages of people who are Palestinians,

601
00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.940
because the Israeli government tells them to, and they knew it.

602
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.600
Do you know about that? Right? I had heard about that. Yes. Yeah.

603
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:40.090
So there that's them doing the bidding, the government says,

604
00:33:40.091 --> 00:33:42.640
take a doll can take a dollar. They don't get the free speech. Okay.

605
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.620
Cause I don't want the government to get mad at me.

606
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.990
Cause we're making so much money right now.

607
00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.370
I don't want the government to get mad at us.

608
00:33:48.371 --> 00:33:49.930
That's what Facebook and you do was doing.

609
00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.120
<v 4>See if I.</v>

610
00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.400
<v 0>Would like that. If someone, you know,</v>

611
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.620
I'm not saying that no one should be taken down.

612
00:33:56.621 --> 00:33:58.870
If someone's calling for the death of all black people and like,

613
00:33:58.871 --> 00:34:01.270
maybe this is not a good place to give them a platform.

614
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:06.280
But I feel like the problem that I'm having with this is these

615
00:34:06.281 --> 00:34:09.340
things like air quotes, hate speech,

616
00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.850
because I told you that they said that about Sam Harrison, Douglas Murray.

617
00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:17.590
Now that is crazy. So when does it stop being hate speech? Like when,

618
00:34:17.591 --> 00:34:20.920
when do you draw the line? When it's, is it mildly offensive?

619
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:23.650
Is that hate speech? Like, where's it go? Where does it go go?

620
00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.220
<v 1>Were you allowed to hate people? I don't understand why I don't get that.</v>

621
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.130
Do you get this? I'm not being a Dick. I honestly,

622
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.400
why aren't you allowed to hate things? Right. Well, I don't,

623
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:34.930
I understand that calling.

624
00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:36.940
<v 3>For action, I think is the.</v>

625
00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:41.410
<v 1>Call for action. Might be, I mean, I guess it's a legal term, right? Um,</v>

626
00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:42.520
this is not legal.

627
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.980
<v 0>Term though, that when they blanket things with hate speech,</v>

628
00:34:44.981 --> 00:34:48.880
like we were saying, like calling something, a drug, this is an illegal drug.

629
00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:53.320
Well, what if caffeine becomes an illegal drug then? Is that the same as meth?

630
00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:55.300
It's clearly not. There's different things.

631
00:34:55.301 --> 00:34:59.500
So when you say hate speech and you also lumped Douglas Murray having an

632
00:34:59.501 --> 00:35:03.870
intellectual conversation with Sam Harris about immigration, you lump that in.

633
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:04.120
Well.

634
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.470
<v 1>That's the kind of what I'm talking about.</v>

635
00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:08.950
And so did you know that right before 4th of July, there was a newspaper.

636
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:13.180
I think it was in Texas. And so they wanted to, for the 4th of July,

637
00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:15.700
they wanted to post the declaration of independence.

638
00:35:15.701 --> 00:35:18.550
So they posted the first half of it. Did you know about this?

639
00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:23.680
Facebook gave him a strike for hate speech, hate speech. They gave him a strike.

640
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.120
And so now they're like, they were like, that.

641
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.090
<v 0>Was an algorithm though, right. That picked up some of the phrases and.</v>

642
00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.160
<v 1>Phrasing in there about slavery and stuff like that.</v>

643
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.920
And them being animals or something like that. I don't know.

644
00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.660
Something like that. I'm not sure what it was, but,

645
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:39.000
and then the newspaper said now afraid to post the second half of the

646
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:42.000
declaration because we'll get a second strike and they might pull our whole

647
00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:46.170
page. Yeah. So th again,

648
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:50.250
they released that strike. Correct. So, so yeah. So what is this pill?

649
00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:54.620
What is this idea that I need a nanny state to protect me from ideas? Well,

650
00:35:54.621 --> 00:35:55.070
I think they're.

651
00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.860
<v 0>Worried about the power of propaganda and it's just,</v>

652
00:35:57.861 --> 00:36:00.920
they don't know exactly what the consequences of suppressing that power

653
00:36:00.921 --> 00:36:04.670
propaganda are. I think that's, that's really the primary issue there.

654
00:36:04.671 --> 00:36:09.500
Worry that a guy like Alex Jones already has this massive following is what

655
00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:14.150
he's done by calling Sandy hook fake may, may be awful. I believe it is,

656
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:18.830
but is it enough to completely de platform him? And how,

657
00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.540
how are they, how are they justifying?

658
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:24.830
<v 1>And if it was, let's say it was, let's just say you and I agree that it is okay.</v>

659
00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:30.650
The shouldn't shouldn't there still be some kind of a process. There should be.

660
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.950
That's what I'm saying. It shouldn't be, even if we agreed. And again,

661
00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.170
I hate that. I hate it as much as you hate it,

662
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.720
I'm with you and that people are going to, I know Joe,

663
00:36:38.721 --> 00:36:40.580
last time I was on your show, I said, I said,

664
00:36:40.581 --> 00:36:42.800
people are going to take what I'm saying right now and twist it.

665
00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.070
And that's exactly what they did to me last night. So I'm sure people did,

666
00:36:46.071 --> 00:36:48.350
who took it and twisted it. I don't want.

667
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.660
<v 0>Going to elevate. You don't have to name names, but what did they do?</v>

668
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.110
<v 1>They said they twisted what we were. So when we were talking about Seth rich,</v>

669
00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.370
they twisted. And I said, you know,

670
00:36:55.371 --> 00:36:57.740
all I did was cover it on my show until this day.

671
00:36:57.741 --> 00:37:00.590
People still say I was pushing it. I do a new show. I covered it.

672
00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.590
But even discussing it, and even you can't even describe, like,

673
00:37:03.591 --> 00:37:05.630
it couldn't cover it, couldn't discuss it. And that,

674
00:37:05.631 --> 00:37:07.040
and so that's exactly what happened.

675
00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:10.130
How many cut me saying that and cut some other stuff and put it together.

676
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.890
And I was like, son of a, but you still, what are you going to do? Right.

677
00:37:12.891 --> 00:37:17.750
So what are you gonna do? So, um, so I just want people to know this is, again,

678
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.480
I'm just as offended as everybody I'm saying,

679
00:37:20.481 --> 00:37:24.920
we need to have these things be public utilities for a lot of reasons. And that,

680
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.250
um, you know exactly what Matt Taibbi said, what the,

681
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:31.370
the end game here is very clear and they want to be able to censor people.

682
00:37:31.371 --> 00:37:34.400
They want to be able to sensor and of the first people are going to come after

683
00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.130
his left-wing organizations, they're gonna come after black lives matter.

684
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.960
They're coming, they've already come after left. He's like.

685
00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.450
<v 0>Why do they think they're going to come after black lives matter?</v>

686
00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:44.840
<v 1>What do you mean there? They hate speech against the police. You kidding me?</v>

687
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.510
They already said they're controlled by the Russians who.

688
00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.900
<v 0>Dang, who is they saying that? And who's they gonna come after them?</v>

689
00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:51.734
What do you mean by that?

690
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.250
<v 1>Well, the FBI will infiltrate them there. I'm sure they already have, you know,</v>

691
00:37:55.251 --> 00:37:58.070
how that works. So you know how all that stuff works.

692
00:37:58.071 --> 00:37:59.780
So that's how that stuff works. And, um,

693
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.050
and then just credit them and then they,

694
00:38:02.051 --> 00:38:04.310
they will commit violence in their name and say, oh, look,

695
00:38:04.311 --> 00:38:06.650
black lives matters are violent. No, that was a cop doing it, you know?

696
00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.840
And then, you know how that, that's what happened up in dapple. You know,

697
00:38:08.841 --> 00:38:12.320
that's the kind of stuff they do up there. And then that gets your provocateurs.

698
00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.820
Exactly. Right. So by.

699
00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.710
<v 0>The way, I learned about that from Alex Jones.</v>

700
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.130
<v 1>So that's the problem with Alex Jones. He's right about stuff.</v>

701
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.550
<v 0>Sometimes. Well, he was way more right about stuff in the past,</v>

702
00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.320
Alex himself. And I've talked to him about this says he's drinks too much,

703
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:28.730
and he's getting too crazy.

704
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:32.390
He needs to go on a diet and exercise and start getting his life in order.

705
00:38:32.391 --> 00:38:35.980
And he takes things too far sometimes. And he thinks she takes out of the rails.

706
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.100
He goes off the rails. Like he, he and I had a conversation,

707
00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:42.670
but he got mad at me for saying that I didn't think George Soros was a Nazi.

708
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:44.770
And so he had this whole thing.

709
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:48.970
We ranted Ray and then we talked back and forth and he apologized. And,

710
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:54.100
you know, he said, I sometimes take things too far. I'm talking to aliens.

711
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.833
Um, I didn't say that,

712
00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:01.030
but I think he recognizes that sometimes he's just caught up

713
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:05.170
in that cycle of outrage, that cycle of outrage. It's just,

714
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:09.130
there's no room for, for like,

715
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.930
there's no room to step back.

716
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:16.120
And to sort of reset is it's just constant outrage constantly

717
00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:16.960
under attack.

718
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.170
And then there's these words that get thrown around that sort of lose their

719
00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:25.000
meaning, like globalists, you know, and shills and, and,

720
00:39:25.001 --> 00:39:29.290
and, you know, and this, this sort of like attitude that there's, this,

721
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.360
there's this cabal of evil that is trying to

722
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.670
take, take over the world. And at one point,

723
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.860
Alex had this idea that they were going to try to kill off most people.

724
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.410
And you remember that I heard about,

725
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:49.510
there was this idea that they wanted to a youth and I, it was genocide.

726
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.373
They wanted to,

727
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.320
they wanted to break it down to what is the word where they talk about doing

728
00:39:53.321 --> 00:39:56.590
that to talk about reducing the population.

729
00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:01.090
There's like some sort of a conspiracy theorist term of reduction of population

730
00:40:01.091 --> 00:40:05.080
to sustainable number of super evil geniuses that could live forever.

731
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.180
And they wanted to get it down to like, you know,

732
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.590
500 million people worldwide that can live for a million years or some crazy.

733
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:17.140
But I think that that's that whole cycle of like

734
00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:22.000
constant outrage and everything's a conspiracy and you

735
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:25.210
get just whack whacked out and caught up in it.

736
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.850
If you go back to Alex's earlier videos,

737
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:32.890
I met Alex in 98, I believe. And back then,

738
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:37.360
Alex was, he was going after George W. Bush when George W.

739
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.310
Bush was running for president. And he was saying that this guy is, he's a,

740
00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:46.930
he's a puppet. And that he's a puppet of the CIA. And, you know, and, and he,

741
00:40:46.931 --> 00:40:47.231
you know,

742
00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:51.460
he supports genocide and he was showing up at campaign rallies and they were

743
00:40:51.461 --> 00:40:55.360
arresting him. He was anti right wing. I mean, he was,

744
00:40:55.361 --> 00:40:58.360
he was anti what he thought was this globalist agenda.

745
00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.120
He also infiltrated Bohemian Grove.

746
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.310
When everybody thought that Bohemian Grove was nonsense,

747
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:04.930
there's nothing really going on. He's like, no,

748
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:08.800
these really rich people are getting together with heads of state and foreign

749
00:41:08.801 --> 00:41:11.860
dignitaries. And they're dressing up like Druids.

750
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:15.580
And they have an effigy that they burn in front of the owl. God Molek,

751
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.330
and people are like, he's crazy. Then the release is the video. And like,

752
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.140
oh my God, they really do do that. Like he did some good work.

753
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.070
The world trade organization protests in his, his video,

754
00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:30.820
nine 11 a road to tyranny, right after nine 11,

755
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:35.570
he releases this video that shows that the world trade organization protests

756
00:41:35.571 --> 00:41:39.920
were infiltrated by these agent provocateurs who were most likely government

757
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:43.820
agents with government agent boots on, by the way, shows this in the video,

758
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:47.840
they smash windows. They're all wearing masks and light things on fire.

759
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.480
Then there are, they all hole up in one house.

760
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:53.900
They negotiate with the police and they're all eventually released.

761
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.450
This is all done under, I mean, he proved all this.

762
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.780
He showed all how this is going. Like, look at these peaceful protestors.

763
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.700
Then the consequences of that.

764
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:06.710
They established a no protest line at the WTO where you couldn't go by

765
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.850
with a pin on,

766
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.830
if you tried to get through with a pin that said WTO with a red line through it,

767
00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:16.550
they told you, you could not wear that pin. You can't come through here.

768
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.980
This is a no protest zone. And he's like,

769
00:42:18.981 --> 00:42:21.560
this is the consequences of this kind of censorship.

770
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.630
And this is how they establish the censorship.

771
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:28.190
They make it seem like your organization is violent and dangerous by introducing

772
00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:31.580
violent, dangerous elements in the, in the form of an, uh,

773
00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.980
undercover police officers or military,

774
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:37.400
they smashed windows tip over newspapers stands,

775
00:42:37.401 --> 00:42:41.690
and it was create chaos so that the government has to come in because now we

776
00:42:41.691 --> 00:42:43.040
have a violent situation.

777
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:47.750
So then the military comes in and arrest protestors and silences the protests.

778
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.990
So they don't look embarrassing in front of all these people from foreign

779
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:54.610
countries that are coming here to the world trade organization. I just,

780
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:55.240
I didn't know.

781
00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.580
<v 1>He showed that, but dude, he look, he's not.</v>

782
00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.970
<v 0>Wrong. Always. It was more right back then.</v>

783
00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:05.560
He was also more sane back then his, he was more measured and more calm.

784
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.070
It wasn't this. He didn't have the big moon face back then either.

785
00:43:09.071 --> 00:43:10.330
And he wasn't drinking as much.

786
00:43:10.331 --> 00:43:13.780
I don't think in the screaming and the spitting and, and, you know, you ask him,

787
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:17.590
he'll say, well, I'm just overwhelmed by the sheer volume of corruption,

788
00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.980
all the that he sees every day. Look, do you remember?

789
00:43:20.981 --> 00:43:24.910
He was crying when Trump bombed Syria, he was crying.

790
00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:29.320
Cause he was crying that Trump us. You know? I mean, he,

791
00:43:29.321 --> 00:43:33.940
I really genuinely believe most of the time that he means, well,

792
00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:38.590
the, the, the thing is we look for conspiracies everywhere.

793
00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:41.770
Like everything, that's a conspiracy, you're off track.

794
00:43:41.771 --> 00:43:44.830
And I don't think there's anyone there that can sit down and go, whoa, stop,

795
00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:49.120
hold on. Let's examine this in a factual way. Let's stop.

796
00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.650
Cut the hyperbole out.

797
00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.890
And let's look at what the facts are and where are we getting these facts?

798
00:43:53.891 --> 00:43:56.500
And why do we think this is happening? Why do you think this is fake?

799
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.680
Cause that sounds crazy to me. No, one's there to do that.

800
00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.360
If someone was there to do that,

801
00:44:01.361 --> 00:44:06.220
I think he probably would be stopped and would examine things and would balance

802
00:44:06.221 --> 00:44:07.300
out, you know,

803
00:44:07.301 --> 00:44:10.090
like one of the reasons why I wanted to have him on my podcast when I did is

804
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.940
because I wanted people to see the Alex that I know cause people like,

805
00:44:12.941 --> 00:44:14.470
how could you know that guy? I'm like,

806
00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:18.790
look at how he is when I get them high and we get drunk and he's laughing about

807
00:44:18.791 --> 00:44:22.330
stuff and talking about interdimensional, child molesters and all that. Like,

808
00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:26.200
this is what I wanted everybody to see. Like this is Alex Jones. He's a fun guy.

809
00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:31.030
It's just that that is not a good position to be in where

810
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:35.880
constantly looking for conspiracies, everywhere you go and you might nail a few,

811
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.490
but then you might call out a bunch of them that are fake,

812
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.730
which not just negates the ones that you nailed,

813
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.480
but negates everything you say as soon as you're one of those guys that

814
00:44:45.481 --> 00:44:49.080
everything's a conspiracy. And then the dead kids, aren't really dead.

815
00:44:49.081 --> 00:44:52.350
And everyone's an actor. And like everything that you say, that's good,

816
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.340
they're going to stop.
