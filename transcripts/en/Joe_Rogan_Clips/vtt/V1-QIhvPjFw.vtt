00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.320
Is it amazing to you as somebody who spent so long thinking about other worldly

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.080
visitors that now they're releasing all this information and no one really

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.840
cares? Well, the world is in such chaos. No one cares. No one cares.

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.160
I couldn't care if it happened during the middle of the Obama administration and

6
00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:22.110
everything was going great. It would be giant news. And what, uh, is the news,

7
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:24.990
even that the Pentagon just can't account for all these unidentified flying

8
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.710
objects. Yeah. They don't know what they are. Okay.

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.750
There's some of 'em that could easily be drones because they're not moving at

10
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:32.230
spectacular speeds. Right.

11
00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:35.310
They're just sort of like hovering over aircraft carriers.

12
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:36.230
Those could be drones.

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.750
They could be some new style of drone or some new kind of technology that maybe

14
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.740
some foreign government has,

15
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.860
but there's other ones that were spotted by air force

16
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.540
pilots and then tracked.

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.940
And they have detailed data on the speed of

18
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:57.220
these things. They have video of these things going. What,

19
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.420
what appears to be thousands of miles an hour instantaneously Excel

20
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.450
with no visible propulsion system, no heat, signature.

21
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.210
They don't know what the this is. Yeah.

22
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.930
And this is from 2004 off the Nimitz commander, David Frager,

23
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.850
who was a fighter jet. Pilot is like, like rock solid credentials.

24
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:17.450
You can't. Yeah. And I've talked to the guy,

25
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:19.090
I had him on my podcast and even better.

26
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.240
He was on Lex podcast and Lex didn't even better up.

27
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.960
And I didn't talk to him for two plus hours about this.

28
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.400
And the guy's incredibly credible. That thing. Whenever he was tracking,

29
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.000
went from the Nimitz, tracked it. They tracked it on radar.

30
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.880
They tracked it with, um, their, uh, the, the onboard sensors, the,

31
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.480
the, the things they use for targeting enemy crafts.

32
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.230
They tracked this thing from the Nimitz.

33
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.270
It went 80,000 feet above sea level to 50 feet in

34
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.230
a second. That's crazy. They don't know what the it is.

35
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:56.910
They don't know what it is. They know that it was jamming their radar.

36
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.870
They know it was jamming them. And,

37
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.030
and then it moved when it took off and in same rates of speed,

38
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:04.860
they couldn't even watch it. It, it just it's gone.

39
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.380
And then it re reemerged at the cat point,

40
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.340
the cat point is the predetermined location where the jets are supposed to

41
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:15.300
scramble to right during this exercise. So it's literally saying,

42
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.740
I know where you guys are going, right. You're going over here. Right.

43
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.580
Whatever the it is, who knows. But does that mean that it's from another planet?

44
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.850
No. It could be something insane technology that the military's developed

45
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.770
that we don't know. It could be dark because there,

46
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.850
there ha have you seen that where the military there's patents for UFO

47
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.010
type. See if you can find what those are because they're developing,

48
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.250
or at least they're,

49
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:45.200
they've attempted develop some sort of gravitational drive that would

50
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.393
indicate that.

51
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.240
At least there's been some thought about developing a craft like that. Now,

52
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.280
if you put a person in one of these things and you shot,

53
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.560
'em off thousands of miles, and now they turn into jello. Right. But who says,

54
00:02:57.561 --> 00:03:01.320
it's a person who knows. We got a Rover on Mars right now, taking pictures.

55
00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:03.360
There's a helicopter attached to it. Right?

56
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.480
You got high resolution photographs from Mars. Here it is.

57
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.000
Doc show Navy got UFO patent granted by warning of similar Chinese

58
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.880
tech advances. This is what I'm saying.

59
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.240
Patent document indicates that the us and China are actively,

60
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.990
actively developing radical new craft.

61
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.830
That seem eerily similar to UFOs reported by Navy pilots. Now,

62
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.323
if they're,

63
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.430
if this is like on paper somewhere where they're trying to get patents,

64
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.590
and they're telling you that Chinese, the Chinese, uh,

65
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.270
the military already has something like this.

66
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.540
What we're getting is years later, right?

67
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:44.780
They've been probably developing like this reject forever.

68
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.620
So they probably have some sort of working thing that can move

69
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.980
in extraordinary ways.

70
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.740
We are not gonna care until there's a Mars attack style raid on the white house.

71
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.860
Like that movie attack. Yeah.

72
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.890
If you are not gonna cut you don't land with Ray guns and start blasting people,

73
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.370
I don't even give a like, no, one's gonna care. We're real weird with it now.

74
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.730
Yeah.

75
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.370
I I've always said that if aliens are real earth is the Tijuana of outer space.

76
00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:13.950
You're not kidding.

77
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.970
And they come down here when they're up and they wanna see a show. Yeah.

78
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:19.290
That's exactly right. And then they, they're not trying to, no,

79
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:22.920
one's trying to safety. You want no, no. Nobody's thinking about it. Yeah.

80
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:25.640
It's a place that you go and they mention it in a movie. Yeah.

81
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.760
Every now and then you see a donkey show. Yeah.

82
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.880
Robert Rodriguez features it in a vampire movie and then you get out of there.

83
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.640
It, it, it's interesting.

84
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:35.600
It's the one conspiracy that I've never gotten into that much because there's

85
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.220
just the,

86
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.990
the information is so tough to come by that I've just always said,

87
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.670
if it's, I, I, nothing would surprise me. Nothing would surprise me.

88
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.950
There's something going on. There's something going on. But what that,

89
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:50.510
something is remains to be seen.

90
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.870
Have you seen that video that men in black that walk into, they walk into this?

91
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.550
Um, it's just two very tall, weird dudes that walk into like a, uh,

92
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.780
hotel and then leave Jamie, you could find it easily.

93
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.300
And it's just these guys that were supposedly like, you know,

94
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.260
something weird happened. And supposedly there are guys that come in,

95
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:14.660
like after something weird happens and like shut it down.

96
00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:16.220
And they both very tall and very,

97
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.500
and I don't know if it's fake or I don't think it is fake though,

98
00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:21.340
but I don't know. It could be fake. Where, where, where can one find this video?

99
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.050
I it's on YouTube or something. Jamie could find it's the real men in black.

100
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.250
It's like the real, you know, whatever, you know,

101
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.090
supposedly there was something that happened where I don't know

102
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.330
somebody went in after it, like somebody had to go respond to something.

103
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:43.320
And these two, like weird looking dudes came in very strange.

104
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.120
There's gotta be a men in black. If there are, if we know about,

105
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.080
there's gotta be some, uh, part of the government that deals with that.

106
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.680
Well, there's two schools of thought, right?

107
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.480
One school of thought is that the government is way too incompetent to ever keep

108
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.240
anything from anybody. That's not true. That's not true. Right.

109
00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:03.920
And there's other schools that thought where you're like, no, they there's a,

110
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.440
a perceived Buffon.

111
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.160
That's attached to some level of government because there's a lot of people in

112
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.760
government that are idiots. Right. But at like,

113
00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:15.760
there's a lot of people that work at ups that are idiot idiots. Yeah.

114
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.990
But if you get highest levels of the organization, they know what they're doing.

115
00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:23.630
Yeah. I mean, if you're gonna send to the highest levels of the CIA or the NSA,

116
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.750
you're gonna probably be brilliant. Right.

117
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.390
What are the odds that you're not right? You're probably gonna have a deep,

118
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.310
deep, and a good person, the best people,

119
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.910
but you're gonna have a deep understanding of, of what's going on of yeah.

120
00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:38.180
Foreign policy and how to manipulate things.

121
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.020
And did you not find the men in black video?

122
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.580
<v 1>Not really. I found something, but it was like all it was animation and stuff.</v>

123
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:44.580
It wasn't really like a hotel.

124
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.300
<v 0>So, no, I don't know if it was a hotel.</v>

125
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.460
It was just two guys that walked in and then left and they looked.

126
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.500
<v 1>Very strange. The video I found is a,</v>

127
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.940
it's like a description of events of like that happening. I didn't find it.

128
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.340
Okay. Actual video. I'm.

129
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.130
<v 0>Looking well, it's always been one of those things, a part of UFO folklore,</v>

130
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:04.010
right. That these men and black folks. Yeah. They look oddly fake.

131
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.210
They look like fake looking skin. You show up. Yeah. But that's what I would do.

132
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.490
If I was gonna go interview some guy about, uh, UFOs, you know what I would do?

133
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.450
I'd put like weird white makeup on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And dress in a black suit.

134
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:19.120
And I'd ask him strange questions while wearing and sunglasses. Yeah.

135
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:22.240
And I have him freak out. Why not? Why not with him? Yeah.

136
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.680
Why not leave him to the point where what he's gonna tell all his friends is so

137
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:29.760
crazy. No, one's gonna believe it. Well, that's part of, I think what,

138
00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:31.960
what a lot of it is. Well, imagine if you have a,

139
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.080
an aircraft that's shaped like a pyramid. Right.

140
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.560
And you're flying it over Philadelphia. Yeah. Here it.

141
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.400
<v 1>Is. Okay. That's all it is. I don't know what.</v>

142
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.030
<v 0>This up. Yeah. Dudes wearing suits. It is to me that proves it. Yeah.</v>

143
00:07:42.031 --> 00:07:45.790
What is that? Proves it to me. What does this say?

144
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.310
That proves it to me. What is the, uh, Niagara falls show canceled?

145
00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:52.144
What is that.

146
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.053
<v 2>Immediately?</v>

147
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.790
Okay. What does he say?

148
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.900
Point we have perhaps most conclusive evidence of the real men in black hotel

149
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.753
in Canada.

150
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.460
And the manager was a little disturbed when his bellboy informed him that the

151
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.540
previous day the hotel had been visited by two tall men dressed completely

152
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:17.900
in black, who demanded to speak to him. Maybe.

153
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.810
<v 0>There were Johnny Cash pants. The is, I mean, so they're just men.</v>

154
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.090
This is what's ridiculous about conspiracy theories.

155
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.370
Those are two guys wearing suits, have eyebrows. I have a suit.

156
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.570
Do you have a suit? Yes,

157
00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:31.650
but I don't think they have eyebrows now that what is this?

158
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:33.810
They had no eyebrows. Oh, see, that's what I would do.

159
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.410
I would shave my eyebrows or put some makeup on over 'em so that I look like a

160
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:42.440
weirdo and then make them uncomfortable when they're telling their friends, man,
