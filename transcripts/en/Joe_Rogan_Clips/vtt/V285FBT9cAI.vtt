WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Do you, are you Jeremy? I'm sure you're aware of this.</v>

2
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.800
The footage from the, the Mexican air force. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:09.440
Very aware of that. What do you think about that?

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.480
<v 1>Well, again, it's, it's IR footage, which is really interesting.</v>

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.200
They actually got the cameras for drug runners, right? So you,

6
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.120
you can see in the infrared. So it's beyond the observable. You know, I, uh,

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.070
I myself have not, uh, detailed, looked at the footage, however,

8
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.630
FLIR experts and people that work with NSA have looked at it for me. And they,

9
00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:30.510
these are not lights in the distance.

10
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:34.790
These are craft very similar to what commander favor talks about without

11
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.470
plumes, without heat signatures, you know,

12
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.020
nontraditional field propulsion systems. We don't have that. And.

13
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.540
<v 0>I thought they tried to, uh, is this it right here?</v>

14
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:46.860
Is this some Mexican air force footage? Yeah.

15
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.420
<v 1>So they tried to say these were lights on,</v>

16
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.580
on like an oil rig out in the water that's Bindi bond. Yeah. They tried.

17
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.500
<v 0>To say it was a fire and an oil. Right?</v>

18
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.220
<v 2>The, the 2004 talk to the Comcast video of the year was the Mexican air force</v>

19
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:02.610
tracking like six. So literally right after our incident, &lt;affirmative&gt; I come,

20
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.891
you know,

21
00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:06.370
we come back and I think we were getting ready to go to Fallon and I'm I'm I had

22
00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:09.650
Comcast and the homepage comes up and there's this video. And I go, holy cow,

23
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.690
that looks like what we chased. Mm. And it was like six of these things.

24
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:14.770
And they were tracking 'em in the same area, too, right off the coast.

25
00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:15.770
Ensenata and.

26
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.090
<v 1>It, it's not as rare there. There's now admitted an increased frequency. The,</v>

27
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.960
a Pentagon spokeswoman finally went off script.

28
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.960
I was tracking the scripts for the last two years of what Pentagon spokespeople

29
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.400
say about commander favors experience.

30
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.840
Someone went off script last week in the New York times.

31
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.160
And she admitted there's an increased frequency of near misses because of these

32
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.800
AAVs anomalous aerospace vehicles. So it, it's pretty astounding.

33
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:42.000
We're getting all these kind of revelatory moments in these little seeds that

34
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.910
these are not ours. We don't have this. Even Elon doesn't have this. I mean,

35
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:51.710
this is a propulsion system, unlike anything we have. It's amazing.

36
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.910
It's gravity propel.

37
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.630
<v 0>Now that Gibo footage. Yeah. When it said that there's a fleet of them, mm-hmm,</v>

38
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.550
&lt;affirmative&gt; how far away are those guys where you're seeing you don't see the

39
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:04.700
individual objects, you only see angular spot. Um.

40
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.220
<v 2>Well, the pod is, you know, when you get pretty narrow, it'd be like, you know,</v>

41
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:09.500
if I put three people around you,

42
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.340
I can look at you and not see the other people. So that's what the pod is doing.

43
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.820
But the radar is seeing everything. Cause it's a, it has an, a, a radar on it,

44
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:18.540
which is an active, electronically scanned array.

45
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.620
So instead of like the radars we had, which did the mechanical, you know,

46
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:23.300
doing this like old school,

47
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.610
this thing is just a panel that sits in the front of the airplane and through

48
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.690
beam sharing or beam shaping, it can move and it can look all over.

49
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.090
So we used to have what was called track wall scan.

50
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.210
So we would be able to track a target while we're still scanning.

51
00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:38.730
This thing has scan wall. It, it scans while tracked. So it, it literally,

52
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:40.970
if it sees you, if the radar sees you,

53
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:42.610
it has basically a weapons quality solution,

54
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.000
and it can do that on multiple targets is that's how, that's the same way. The,

55
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.000
the spy radar, the ecosystem system works on the cruisers.

56
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.480
It can track multiple targets and have weapons quality on all these different

57
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:55.400
targets while it's still scanning a volume.

58
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.600
<v 0>So in that image, you're seeing one individual object, but there's other.</v>

59
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.360
<v 2>Objects. Yes. The radar is seeing the object that the pod is looking at,</v>

60
00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:07.360
where they're talking. And when you hear the video, you hear the, the pilot say,

61
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.440
dude, look at the SA page. There's, there's a whole fleet of them.

62
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.160
So what they're seeing is the, the, the pod is looking at the main,

63
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:15.880
that's the bigger object that the gimble,

64
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:17.320
the thing that's rolled tight on the screen,

65
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.430
and there's five smaller things in front. So this thing's just sitting there.

66
00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:22.470
And then they kind of, he said, they turn around on the,

67
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.750
on the radar and start going the other way, while the pod's looking at this guy,

68
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:26.670
just kind of rotating.

69
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.230
So like a mothership and smaller aircraft could be something along those lines.

70
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.870
Is there video of those smaller Aircrafts or just the video of the one large

71
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.950
one? No. The only thing they have is the, the, the targeting pod. Uh,

72
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.020
I would highly doubt,

73
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.940
even if they had the video that they're gonna release the radar video because of

74
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.933
classification levels.

75
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.020
<v 1>Are you able to tell, um,</v>

76
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.060
the story you told me about what was underwater with your, your other buddy?

77
00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:51.620
Because is that okay?

78
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.860
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So it's amazing. You know,</v>

79
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:57.340
people come outta the woodwork when they figure out you've had this cuz now

80
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:01.930
they're, they don't feel alone. So I was working, I, I worked, I,

81
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.730
I still do it, but I was doing oil and gas at the time, uh, on a, on a contract.

82
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.450
And one of the guys, the story came out and he was a Navy helicopter pilot.

83
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.970
And he comes in, he, he comes in, he goes, can I talk to you, man? I go,

84
00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:16.330
what about he goes, dude, I got, I gotta talk to you. I said,

85
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:19.970
what do you wanna talk to me about? He says, dude, do you know your UFO? He,

86
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.400
he said, yeah. He goes, I had a similar experience. I said, what's that?

87
00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:26.480
He said he was flying ch 50 threes, which is a big lift,

88
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.440
heavy lift that the Marine Corps uses. And the Navy uses it for certain things.

89
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.680
And when they go off of, for the east coast, they do a lot of shooting off of,

90
00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:35.120
at the time it was off of Puerto Rico.

91
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:37.440
We had Roosevelt roads that they ended up closing. Um,

92
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.160
but he was flying out of there. And you know,

93
00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:44.310
you got super clear Caribbean water and they have these things that are called B

94
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.310
QMS. They fly around. And then when they're all done,

95
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.950
cause they'll fly towards the ships and the ship can sorry about that.

96
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.310
They can track with the radar. And then they also do in the,

97
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:56.150
like the ships or submarine shoot torpedoes they're they're called telemetry

98
00:04:56.151 --> 00:04:57.030
rounds. So they have,

99
00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:59.750
they gather all the data on what the torpedo or is doing underwater.

100
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.420
And then they blow Alice and this thing will come to the surface and float and

101
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:06.020
then they go pick 'em up and then they can extract all the data out of em.

102
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.460
So they do it for both. So he said,

103
00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:10.660
the first time they're out and they're gonna pick up this B Q M.

104
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.740
And those things, when they're flying,

105
00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:14.860
they're done a parachute comes out and they gotta go. They hook it up.

106
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:18.340
The Helo drops the swimmer in the water. He goes and hooks this whole thing up.

107
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:19.820
And then they hoist the whole thing up and fly back.

108
00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:23.130
And then they extract the data. So he says, he's sitting in the front, you know,

109
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:25.330
in helicopters, there's, you know, a C 53,

110
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:27.330
you can actually see down by your feet, you know, just like typical,

111
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:29.930
like you go to Hawaii and ride. So cuz you can see when you're touching down.

112
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.930
So you got really good visibility out of those things and you can stick your

113
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:35.810
head out the window too, cuz you're just kind of hanging out. He says,

114
00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:37.530
he's going on there? And they're getting this thing hooked up.

115
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:39.770
And as he's looking down, you know, cuz they're,

116
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.320
I don't know what 50 feet above the water he's sees kind of this dark mass

117
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:46.400
coming up from the depths and they starting to hoist the,

118
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.600
the diver up and he's got, they've gotten the B QM and as they hoist it up,

119
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.120
he says, and he's looking at the sink going, what the hell is that?

120
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.000
And then it just goes back down underwater.

121
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.720
It just like once they pull the kid in the, the B QM outta the water,

122
00:05:57.721 --> 00:06:02.320
this object descends back into the depths. So he thinks, well,

123
00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:05.200
that was pretty weird. So he goes out, he says, not too long later, you know,

124
00:06:05.201 --> 00:06:07.200
a few months later he's out and he's picking up a torpedo.

125
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.520
So he says they got the,

126
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.480
they hook the diver up on the winch and they're lowering him in and he he's

127
00:06:12.481 --> 00:06:15.200
looking down. He sees this big, massive, he goes, it's not a submarine.

128
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.190
He seen submarines before, once don't you see a summary and you,

129
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.550
you can't confuse it with something else. This big object, you know,

130
00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:23.550
kind of circularly says is coming up from the depths.

131
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.190
And he starts screaming to through the Intercom system to tell him,

132
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:29.750
to pull the diver up. And the diver's like few feet from the water.

133
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.790
So they reversed the win and the dives thinking what the hell's going on and

134
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.670
he's getting pulled up. And all of a sudden, uh, he said,

135
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.580
the torpedo just got sucked down underwater and the object just descended back

136
00:06:41.581 --> 00:06:45.580
down into the depths and they never recovered the, the torpedo Jesus.

137
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.380
And this happened in the late nineties, late, mid to late nineties.

138
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:52.700
I think it is. I could probably get in touch with him and ask him.

139
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:55.620
And he told me this story. And I'm like, how do you report that?

140
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.890
&lt;laugh&gt; you come in and go, well, where'd the torpedo go?

141
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.650
It just got sucked down. It just went down, you know?

142
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:03.370
And then you get to people that attributed as, ah,

143
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.050
something happened when it flew ball and it just took on water and sank and he's

144
00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:09.610
like, it didn't sink. He goes, it literally looked like it got sucked down.

145
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.730
The only reason they didn't,

146
00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:14.970
they talked to him when they did the New York times stuff, they talked to him.

147
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.560
But it, because the incident was from the nineties, they didn't want to,

148
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:21.880
they wanted something, you know, newer. Mm. Um, so they did not include it,

149
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:23.840
but I know they talked to 'em about it. Now.

150
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:25.480
What was the other footage that we were looking at?

151
00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:28.280
There was the first footage that Jamie pulled up that wasn't the Gibo footage.

152
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.840
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. That was, oh, the go fast, the go fast. What is that?

153
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.200
That's uh, it actually looks more like a tic-tac, but it's they saw it, uh,

154
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.240
going across the water and they're, they're, they're just grabbing a lock.

155
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:41.550
So are seeing this with their eyes and he gets the FL to lock on it.

156
00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:42.910
And that's when you hear the kid go, I got it.

157
00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:46.270
Cuz he gets the auto track and it's just something screaming across the surface

158
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:50.430
of the water. So, and this is in the same area. This is east coast. Yeah.

159
00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:52.710
This is the same timeframe as the gimble video.

160
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.070
<v 1>So the idea that these are birds or the idea that this is a radar glitch,</v>

161
00:07:57.071 --> 00:08:01.380
or somebody said pilot era like clear blue day commander, FRA has nerves.

162
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.380
I mean that kind of thing that people have said on your show to you that,

163
00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:08.860
you know, this, these are explanations that make sense. Who said that? Um,

164
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.980
I don't want to say their names. A Midwest. Yeah, sure.

165
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.500
<v 2>Min mint believes everything.</v>

166
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.860
Like every single thing that's ever happened has a rational explanation for.

167
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.370
<v 1>It's. So it's so that, you know, the probability that, you know,</v>

168
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:23.970
all the radars went off at the wrong time, commander FRA you know,

169
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.170
had nerves that all the other pilots up there with him that, you know,

170
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:30.530
this thing shot off like a, like a can like a gun instantly like that,

171
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:33.090
that was somehow perfectly coordinate.

172
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.530
That's a conspiracy that that's a fabrication probably Al's razors.

173
00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:39.610
The events happened exactly. Like were being told.

174
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.160
<v 2>Yeah. For us it was, you know,</v>

175
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:45.600
and I'll go back to the beginning of the story of, you know,

176
00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:48.640
the other pilot who was brand new. She had been in the squadron for

177
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.480
four months, five months. So she's pretty junior.

178
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.360
She used to working on her initial quality airplane and um, you know,

179
00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:00.080
so she gets the, you know, we get the real world vector and it's like, okay,

180
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.840
real world vector. Cool. I'm gonna get to do something real exciting.

181
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.200
Then you see the, the water and you think, oh,

182
00:09:06.201 --> 00:09:09.200
something's sinking cuz it's kind of that shape of an airplane. You know,

183
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.240
that cross type. So now it's, oh crap. Now it's search and rescue.

184
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.190
We gotta go down and see, you know, cuz there's people, you know,

185
00:09:16.191 --> 00:09:20.150
and we are sympathetic and to the tic TAC.

186
00:09:20.151 --> 00:09:24.350
And as soon as the tic-tac it's like, you know, holy, what is that? You know?

187
00:09:24.351 --> 00:09:25.750
And when you get, uh, you know,

188
00:09:25.751 --> 00:09:28.430
some people get very emotional when you talk about it. Um,

189
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.310
because for me it was like, eh, you, you know,

190
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.071
for her,

191
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:39.060
when you talk to her or she has a disdain for

192
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:41.580
some of the leadership that didn't tell us that these things were out there,

193
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.541
you know,

194
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.460
they here now we're getting vectored because we were the first time the manned

195
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.780
airplanes had been airborne when one of these things showed up that no one even

196
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:49.660
gave us a brief that, Hey,

197
00:09:49.661 --> 00:09:52.020
we're seeing these object out here for the last two weeks. They're just kinda,

198
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.970
you might want to know they're out there and they never told us no one knew

199
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:59.450
these things existed besides the radar operators and the radar operators didn't

200
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:03.330
know what they were. They just knew they were seeing blips, you know? So,

201
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.410
and there's a lot of stuff that, you know,

202
00:10:05.411 --> 00:10:09.410
that it flew around and it came around me and it didn't do any of that stuff.

203
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.090
It's, &lt;laugh&gt; the story that I gave you. It was just relatively benign. Um,

204
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.560
but it was, you know, it's, it's an interesting experience. So these.

205
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.880
<v 0>Incidents that they reported were taking place before you saw your,</v>

206
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.920
that tic-tac encounter. Yeah.

207
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.760
They were taking place over a period of how many weeks?

208
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.920
<v 2>Two weeks, two weeks we went out the beginning of the month for the,</v>

209
00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:33.920
this two week at say period. Um, we pulled in for Thanksgiving,

210
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.840
but other than that,

211
00:10:34.841 --> 00:10:38.110
we were out till think December 20 me first is when we pulled the ship back in,

212
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.510
um, besides pulling in for the three days at Thanksgiving. So yeah,

213
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:42.430
for the two weeks prior,

214
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.870
so this was on the 14th and we went out at the beginning of the month.

215
00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:47.430
So about two weeks they had been watching these things come down, go up,

216
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:50.830
come down, go up. But it was always when we were not flying,

217
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.150
which is really probably like the midnight timeframe until early in the morning,

218
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.580
the next, you know, until due the next day. And then we just happened and to go,

219
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.660
and if you think about it, you know, I laugh, you know, if,

220
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.700
if there was some little green man flying around in that TAC,

221
00:11:03.701 --> 00:11:07.060
he probably got back to the mothership and got yelled at for being seen &lt;laugh&gt;,

222
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.540
but you're like, oh my God, you let him see you. Um, so
