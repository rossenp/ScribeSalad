00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. We have this, you know,</v>

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.480
sort of uncharted territory of social media.

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.960
There's not like a lot of documented history of use.

4
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:12.760
So we can go back to a hundred years of people using social media,

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.880
and this is the way to do it healthily. And this is the way to, you know,

6
00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:18.760
there's, there's people that are just tweeting all day.

7
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.960
<v 1>Long. Yeah. It's.</v>

8
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.670
<v 0>Just an experi day and going crazy, pulling their hair out, taking pills barely,</v>

9
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.590
barely getting by in this life and just tweeting all day long. Yeah.

10
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.370
<v 1>It's weird.</v>

11
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.430
And you've got people who have different and then you've got people who just

12
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.110
post 10 selfies a day, same, same picture, same face.

13
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.260
And just go. Yeah, there's some, it's generally when in,

14
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.580
but there's some people's profiles you can go and it's just,

15
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.700
you go on their Instagram page and it's just all just their face, same face,

16
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.660
same pose. And, or multiplemultiple times.

17
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.660
<v 0>A day, just their butt over and over and over again. Do.</v>

18
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.540
<v 1>You see that video clip where the girl had the selfie stick and she's,</v>

19
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.500
she's trying to get a photo of her own butt with this, with a selfie stick.

20
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.300
She's like on.

21
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.260
<v 0>A deck chair. I've seen that. And she's yeah,</v>

22
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.890
that's hilarious that someone took a picture of her doing it.

23
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.490
So her is straight up in the air and she got the selfie sick up like that.

24
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.810
Oh my God. She's trying to get that perfect angle. Oh, I.

25
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.290
<v 1>Was like, wow. That's the 2019.</v>

26
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.570
<v 0>Thirsty, thirsty people are so thirsty. They want like so badly.</v>

27
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.570
Yeah, it.

28
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.560
<v 1>Is. It is very weird. And then you've had people who have died cuz of it.</v>

29
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.840
<v 0>Oh yeah, sure. I don't grand canyon people keep falling off the grand canyon.</v>

30
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.080
Oh really? Yeah. Falling to their.

31
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.320
<v 1>Death. Yeah. People falling off buildings. There was uh, that couple where the,</v>

32
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.393
there she is.

33
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.960
<v 0>Bam. &lt;laugh&gt; she doesn't even have a selfie stick. Oh, it's not</v>

34
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.000
still loving our generation. Who posted that? It's not bar. Oh no. She, yeah,

35
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.710
she has got the selfie stick bar. Stoolol she has got the selfie. Oh,

36
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:45.110
she does have a selfie stick. Oh, she put it on the selfie stick.

37
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.510
&lt;laugh&gt; look at that dirty. See, see she right there.

38
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:50.790
She's got her arm up and then she's like, not good enough.

39
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.030
Let's get that selfie stick out. Oh my gosh. My God. That is so hilarious.

40
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.110
It's strange. But imagine if that's your daughter, you're like, no.

41
00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.790
<v 1>It.</v>

42
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.830
<v 0>Is really strange because have I done? Cause.</v>

43
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.020
<v 1>I it's both exposed people for what they are,</v>

44
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.100
but it's also changed people's behavior. Yes. Like, you know,

45
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:12.900
people do things now that you just wouldn't even something as simple as taking a

46
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:13.200
picture.

47
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.140
<v 0>Of your food. Well, here's something that never existed before. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:18.980
I'll show you something. This is a, a move that women do.

49
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:23.060
Where did I put my phone? &lt;laugh&gt; oh, oh my God. I lost my phone. Oh no.

50
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.450
It's probably in my car. Oh, well, no. Yeah, here it is.

51
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:30.050
Hold on in my purse. My man purse, man purse.

52
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.370
This is something that you see now that you never saw before. Ready?

53
00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:34.204
Here's the look.

54
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.250
<v 1>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

55
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.490
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; that chicken neck. Then the girls do,</v>

56
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.850
trying to get the right angle. Gotta get the right side. Nobody.

57
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.960
<v 1>Used to do that before.</v>

58
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.920
<v 0>No. Right. That's a new thing. That's a new movement of your head. Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.360
<v 1>Taking photos of yourself is a pretty new concept. I remember in my space,</v>

60
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.400
people used to do it in the mirror, in the bathrooms,

61
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.640
in the bathroom and stuff like that. Right.

62
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.480
<v 0>Right. And that's when they first got thirsty. Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.440
They first start seeing six packs and nice asses and people are.

64
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.863
<v 1>Yeah. It's just weird.</v>

65
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.560
I just wonder what the effect will be in a couple decades,

66
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.000
to be honest with you. Coincidentally.

67
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.000
<v 0>My space is also right around the time that white people started</v>

68
00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:12.880
figuring out they like big asses.

69
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.240
<v 1>Something's happened with that. Hasn't there.</v>

70
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.720
&lt;laugh&gt; I was talking about this with one of my friends.

71
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.950
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; look, go back to like the Duke's a hazard. Yeah. Okay.</v>

72
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.790
This is what I was talking about the other day, Catherine Duke.

73
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.550
She was like one of the hottest women on the planet earth in like 1980.

74
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.470
And she's a beautiful lady with an as, as flat as this table.

75
00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:36.110
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; she probably never did a squat. Yeah. Ever. And uh,

76
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.900
nowadays that won't fly. You, you, yeah. You can't get by,

77
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.940
you can't get by without a big caboose.

78
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.900
<v 1>It's weird. It's um, part evolution, part diet part. I don't know.</v>

79
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:50.460
Doctors, doctors, &lt;laugh&gt; a lot of doctors, squat, squat, you know,

80
00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:53.140
going to the gym has become a lot more mainstream though in general. Hasn't it?

81
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.720
It certainly.

82
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.740
<v 0>Has, but there's a lot of gals out there faking dunk. Yeah.</v>

83
00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:00.570
There's a lot of gals out there with some plastics shoved in their butt talks

84
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:04.730
area and ready for this dun dun dun as cancer.

85
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.563
There's uh,

86
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.650
a whole group of humans that are experiencing cancer in

87
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.130
their because of as implants,

88
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:18.450
really the same kind of cancer that many women get when they get breast

89
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:23.080
implants. Oh, it's not a hundred percent of them, but it's,

90
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.360
it's, it's relevant. Like there's an issue.

91
00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:30.640
There was an article written about it recently that women are starting they're

92
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:30.841
start.

93
00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:35.440
Doctors are starting to find the same types of cancer that some women get,

94
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.160
cuz you know, everyone's body reacts differently to everything.

95
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.480
And there are certain risks that you take. If you,

96
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.590
you get some sort of an implant in your body that your body rejects it. Yeah.

97
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.590
Or that it causees cancer. So women are getting cancer of their, man.

98
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.230
That's a rough cancer, bro.

99
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.030
You gotta go in there and scoop out chunks of your butt and maybe you die.

100
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.150
Oh man, maybe you die.

101
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.470
It's not worth it because you weren't willing to do squats. Yeah.

102
00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.710
Just do squats. That's the thing you can do squats.

103
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.140
It's like if a guy has a little, little Dick, all right.

104
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:05.340
And there was a machine that let you build your Dick up.

105
00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:08.820
There would be a line around the block for that machine. &lt;laugh&gt; all right.

106
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.900
I mean, everybody would be on that Dick machine,

107
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.060
but women have a way to build their up. It is a real thing.

108
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.740
You can do squats and dead lifts. You can run stairs,

109
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.610
can do squats and deadlifts and you will get a big firm, man. It works.

110
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.370
You know, you're not gonna get a JLo unless you've got those hips.

111
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.450
<v 1>Yeah. That's have you seen the, when guys do the, um, like the,</v>

112
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.290
the sixp pack implants or of course you must have seen like sin,

113
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:38.130
you know syntthal and stuff where they, where they yeah.

114
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:41.290
Inject the oil into the, into the muscles, muscles swell up. Yeah.

115
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:46.040
People do crazy. People do some strange, some really strange stuff.

116
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:48.560
The six pack one is the weirdest though. Yeah. Because it's just,

117
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.280
it's it's just there all the time. Yeah. Even if they, yeah,

118
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:55.120
but it looks weird. Cause some, even if you, they,

119
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:59.680
even if they gain weight and the rest of their body is kind of flabbby you still

120
00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:02.000
just got, it looks like a ninja turtle. That's what it looks like.

121
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.200
Yeah's &lt;laugh&gt; it's &lt;laugh&gt; it's like by.

122
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.840
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; that's the perfect way to describe it. Yeah.</v>

123
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.200
<v 1>God. Yeah.</v>

124
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.240
<v 0>It looks like B AB implants over his keg. It looks.</v>

125
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.920
<v 1>Like a bow Bower from Mario, you know.</v>

126
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.830
<v 0>Show me that in a large version. Jesus Christ.</v>

127
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.923
<v 1>That's weird. Right.</v>

128
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.710
<v 0>That's so crazy because that guy's fat.</v>

129
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.630
<v 1>It just doesn't look right.</v>

130
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.590
<v 0>Wow. That's so weird. Yeah. And that's definitely fake.</v>

131
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.550
It's not only that guy just does a ton of setups. No.

132
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.470
Cause he is got a barrel chest, but he doesn't have any, any pecks,

133
00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:38.180
which is weird. Who is that says celebs.

134
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.980
<v 1>I think this guy was on big brother in the UK.</v>

135
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.180
<v 0>Okay. Yeah. I don't know. And he definitely got an AB implant. Yeah.</v>

136
00:06:42.181 --> 00:06:43.780
That's AB implant fact. Yeah. A.

137
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.180
<v 1>Hundred percent. Uh I'm pretty sure. Yeah. I don't know.</v>

138
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.420
I'm pretty sure that numbers implant. Yeah. This says shows off plastic surgery,

139
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:50.120
plastic.

140
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.460
<v 0>Abs go back to that image that you were just at before. Uh,</v>

141
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.850
go back to where you just were. No scroll down. No, no, no. On the other side,

142
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.410
scroll down the, the boxer right there. The lefthand side. Yeah.

143
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.650
That guy was a boxer above it. Right there. That guy hadeck implants. Okay.

144
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.570
That was a boxer. Witheck implants and like crazy plastic surgery face. He, uh,

145
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.650
we, we, we watched a video of him before he was fighting in Mexico.

146
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.440
He had like fixed Fu Heights. Oh yeah. In Mexico. Remember that? Yeah.

147
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.480
This guy had like fake everything, like fake,

148
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.040
fake chest and fake muscles. And it's.

149
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.480
<v 1>Just so weird cuz it doesn't even function. Oh my God.</v>

150
00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:29.120
Cause it it's so strange though. Cause it doesn't even,

151
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.600
it doesn't even function. Yeah. Right. If you had big arms or arms,

152
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.040
arms that look big, pumped up with synthol or whatever,

153
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.480
but then they're not even strong or.

154
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.870
<v 0>Right. And then the problem is, look at that neck, grab a hold of that neck bro.</v>

155
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.630
You ain't, you ain't defending any chokes, sir. That, that is a tiny neck.

156
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:49.150
Oh.

157
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.671
<v 1>That, that, that,</v>

158
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:53.270
that one there that before and after really shows on the left the abs.

159
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.830
<v 0>Oh yeah. Go to that far left. Yeah, you.</v>

160
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.470
<v 1>Can. That really shows the wow.</v>

161
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.540
<v 0>Wow. That's credible. Yeahcredible my.</v>

162
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.780
<v 1>God. But what's weird is because your abs only look like that.</v>

163
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.260
If you're leaning. Like if you're, if you're flexing them. Yes.

164
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.860
But when they do that, it's like that all the time. All the time.

165
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.260
So it just, it just doesn't.

166
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.020
<v 0>Look. Right. Well, look at that. That's incredible. This.</v>

167
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.740
<v 1>Is different. This is abdominal etching. So it's not an implant,</v>

168
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.340
but like sculpting in some way with something,

169
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.810
a guy did also lose weight between those two pictures.

170
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.930
<v 0>You. Yeah, he certainly did.</v>

171
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.890
He certainly dropped his body and it looks like his arms and chest got bigger

172
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.490
too. Yeah. He leaned out. I'm not buying.

173
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.330
<v 1>That one. Yeah. One might be just,</v>

174
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.770
and then that you got that sythal guy up there. I don't know people do.

175
00:08:31.771 --> 00:08:34.250
Some people do some strange things. The thing is a woman.

176
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:39.010
<v 0>Can get things done like boobs and no one cares guys, look,</v>

177
00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:43.560
she looks hot. Hmm. But if a guy's got like a sock in his whoa, whoa.

178
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.200
Oh that girl we're looking at a girl who has fake implants of her,

179
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.320
her abdomen,

180
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.320
her abdominal muscles that are so obviously fake that they're over her ribs.

181
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:54.841
Yeah. Yeah.

182
00:08:54.841 --> 00:08:58.360
Like those muscles are literally over the ribc cage where they don't even

183
00:08:58.361 --> 00:09:03.320
belong. No. Hmm. That's nuts. No. Look at your face too steroids much.

184
00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:03.560
Yeah.

185
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.640
<v 1>So you can see like look at. Yeah. So look at that guy.</v>

186
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:08.000
You can see when he's sitting mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; go to that. Guy' left.

187
00:09:08.001 --> 00:09:10.120
Like he's the abs are still &lt;laugh&gt;.

188
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.800
<v 0>Oh my God. That's so ridiculous. It just doesn't look fat is too, bro.</v>

189
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:16.790
You gotta lose what? Wait, if you gonna rock a fit. That's.

190
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.030
<v 1>So lazy. It's an eightack.</v>

191
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.030
<v 0>Too. That's so lazy. See abs are a weird one.</v>

192
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:24.110
Cause if you really desperately wanted abs everybody can get 'em if you just

193
00:09:24.111 --> 00:09:28.950
work hard enough. Yeah. You know, abs it's not like what, what is that?

194
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.030
Jesus Christ the guy's ABSs and then a weird swelling underneath it's

195
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.780
yeah. Just go to the, it says flesh Fanny pack. Yeah. But that's his,

196
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.700
what is that? I don't know. I don't know. Sorry. I just,

197
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.740
what is thatdistracted that's just a weird picture. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

198
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.860
But guys with fake things that like get no respect &lt;laugh&gt; you know what I mean?

199
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.140
Like a guy with a fake Dick, like get out of here,

200
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.850
a guy with fake packs kick go away. What does this, what he, whoa.

201
00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.970
Injected into his ball. The ball. He, oh my gosh. Man.

202
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.210
Dies after injecting silicone into his testicles for sex cultt game.

203
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.930
Okay. Yeah. That fellow had issues,

204
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:12.290
but like dudes with fakepecs and guys would fake muscles.

205
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:13.370
Like nobody wants to see that.

206
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.810
<v 1>Nah, just go to the gym and eat. Right. It does work.</v>

207
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.120
<v 0>But imagine if there really, if there was a Dick growing machine, you know,</v>

208
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.440
like a squat rack for your Dick &lt;laugh&gt; boy,

209
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.880
boy would there be a line, but.

210
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.560
<v 1>After wouldn't it just become like, that would just become the new norm.</v>

211
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:32.680
If everyone, yeah. Girls would be.

212
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.520
<v 0>All stretched out. Everybody have a giant hog, but you know what?</v>

213
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:35.801
<v 1>I don't,</v>

214
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:38.990
I don't actually think most people would use just like most people don't go to

215
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:39.950
the gym. I mean,

216
00:10:39.951 --> 00:10:43.470
you've already got this option to increase your muscles and make yourself look

217
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:44.510
better. And most people don't do it.

218
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.630
So I'm not convinced that if it took actual work and effort,

219
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.990
I don't actually think the majority of people would do it. I think.

220
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.870
<v 0>You're a hundred percent correct. Yeah. Yeah. If it was difficult,</v>

221
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.190
it was hard work. That's why people want these operations.

222
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.790
All they have to do is go to the doctor's office.

223
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.300
Then doctor's gonna take care of everything. Mike, I'm gonna put you under.

224
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.620
And when you wake up, you're gonna have a hug of a lifetime.

225
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.780
You're gonna have the giantpecs and a full sculpted sixp pack.

226
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.500
And synthal stuffed muscles. There's one video.

227
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.700
This guy that's Brazilian, dude.

228
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.180
He who's got these syntthal muscles and he is dancing and it looks like he's got

229
00:11:16.181 --> 00:11:17.770
water balloons all over his, I know he, you.

230
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.850
<v 1>Talking about, you know, the video' talking about crazy.</v>

231
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.290
<v 0>Yeah. Like the, the,</v>

232
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.650
the body dysmorphia where people just don't see what other people see,

233
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.850
like the same as anorexic mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and the same as you know, I,

234
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.690
I guess bodybuils have that same issue. Like a lot of really enormous.

235
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.890
Bodybuils still feel like they look small.

236
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.330
<v 1>Yeah. It's it's weird, man. It's it's weird.</v>

237
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.920
Like I just think if you wanna change your body, you wanna change your physique.

238
00:11:41.921 --> 00:11:45.400
You wanna feel better. You wanna feel more confident. There is a way to do that.

239
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.030
Yes.

240
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:50.680
That doesn't involve paying tens of thousands of dollars or taking massive

241
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.560
health risks or getting cut up or anything like that. Just go to the gym,

242
00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:00.320
lift train. I, it works. Yes. It, it really, it really does work.

243
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.680
Not everyone's gonna be able to reach some elite level, but you know,

244
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.240
everyone can.

245
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.520
<v 0>Look better, man. Everyone can look better. Yeah.</v>

246
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.320
The people that have sympathy for people with physical deformities mm. You know,

247
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.950
issues that you just can't grow muscle or something's wrong with your body or

248
00:12:15.951 --> 00:12:19.110
you have a disease like that. Yeah. I get it. Then for those people,

249
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.750
I do truly hope that science comes up with a solution. Mm.

250
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.750
And then through some sort of CRISPR type engineering they're able to.

251
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:33.300
<v 2>Thank.</v>
