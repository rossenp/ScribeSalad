00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 1>Experience. You know what be, be nice to find that that's for sure,</v>

3
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:07.050
but I believe, I believe Bob. I do,

4
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:09.450
and I believe Barney and Betty and I believe Travis. I.

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.440
<v 0>Want to believe all of them.</v>

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.800
<v 1>I believe the, I believe the Allagash guys. Why would, why would they do this.</v>

7
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.880
<v 0>Full of? Where I love to lie. They love attention. They love crazy stories.</v>

8
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:21.930
People love telling you their psychic people love believing in astrology people,

9
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.520
but people believe in Bigfoot.

10
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.200
I think that there's a lot of people out there that want fantastic things to be

11
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:31.740
real, including me. It's exciting. It's way more exciting than.

12
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.760
<v 1>It is entertaining. That's why I love the whole substance of my problem.</v>

13
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.160
The thing is that these people were severely damaged.

14
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:41.760
Like Barney hill was damaged. The Allagash boys were damaged.

15
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:44.400
Travis Walton were dumped psychologically damaged by these,

16
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:45.510
by these experiences.

17
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.940
<v 0>We don't know. I mean, they might've been damaged already. This might've been,</v>

18
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.950
yeah, this might've been something.

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.350
<v 1>And you've seen Betty interviewed doesn't she come off as she does someone who</v>

20
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.333
was extremely crowded.

21
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.900
<v 0>She does. She does. So does Barney, the Betty and Barney hill.</v>

22
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.050
So they're an interesting couple because they were an interracial couple.

23
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.290
What year was this that this happened?

24
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.660
So they were dealing with all sorts of pressure.

25
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:14.100
This is during the civil rights movement and they were, you know, uh, some,

26
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.300
you know, they were pretty, it was, it was not the,

27
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.030
what you would expect for people that were calling out and trying to get

28
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.270
attention and the way, you know, the way they describe this,

29
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:25.680
it resonated with people.

30
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.580
<v 1>I was having nightmares and rashes and they had to come to some medical</v>

31
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.140
conclusion about it and they consult.

32
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.240
<v 0>Your friend consistent. The story was extremely.</v>

33
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.270
<v 1>It wasn't any, they consulted a friend at the air force, uh, you know,</v>

34
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:39.900
who they knew when they came to Ben Simon in that? No, it's a,

35
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:42.570
it's a fascinating story. There's this, you know, it's just,

36
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:46.650
it's just in a way as again, it's, it's, it's very, very, very entertaining.

37
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.330
And how did.

38
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.190
<v 0>You get involved in this? Well.</v>

39
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.820
<v 1>My mother, uh, worked for the, uh,</v>

40
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.680
ministry of munitions and supply in world war two, uh, for the minister.

41
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.980
And she was, uh, uh, suborn to work with the, uh,

42
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.050
aircraft production, uh, for the hurricane. She was in charge of, uh,

43
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.680
working with, uh, getting the hurricane fuselage is built in Canada for, for,

44
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.890
for the, for the hurricane fighter plane. So she was, you know,

45
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:16.680
in the world of aviation and in 1947,

46
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:18.780
she was walking down sparks street in Ottawa.

47
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.110
And she looked up in the sky and she was sort of said,

48
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.940
something told me to look up. And she said,

49
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:26.100
she saw what looked like a Christmas tree ornament,

50
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.080
just winking above the street, about four or 500 feet winking on and off red,

51
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:34.560
green, white, red, green light. And she thought that's odd, you know?

52
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:37.350
And then she looked at it and she did it just zipped off in the sky and

53
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.770
disappeared. And around the house, after that point,

54
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.650
we always had articles. There's an article,

55
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.930
there's a cover of life magazine with Marilyn Monroe,

56
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:49.350
talked about flying saucers as their cover of look magazine with Elizabeth

57
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.810
Taylor at it catalogs the Barney and Betty Hill incident.

58
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.700
So whenever one of those articles come up,

59
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.470
she always had that at home for me to read. So I kind of, I was interested at,

60
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.590
from, from them and I've had four sightings myself quite vivid.

61
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.400
The first one was in Martha's vineyard. I was four in the morning. Uh,

62
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.500
I got up to take a leak on the balcony there.

63
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:10.810
And I looked up in the sky and about a hundred thousand feet up.

64
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:15.460
I saw two glowing disks flying in echelon formation. You saw this,

65
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.300
I saw this. I was, uh, was I'm in my thirties. Yeah.

66
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.410
And so I go, I look up and I see these things and they're moving, man.

67
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.340
They're going from horizon to horizon 20,000 miles an hour. And I,

68
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.010
I I've been in an F five. I've had it in my hands.

69
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.120
I've been in a [inaudible] I know helicopters. I know aviation. I know meteoric.

70
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:36.340
Bowlines I know what's not a meteor. And what is,

71
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:37.810
I know what's a helicopter and what is,

72
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.910
I know what's the moon and Venus two glowing, glowing round objects,

73
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.110
a hundred thousand feet, maybe 20,000 miles an hour.

74
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.750
They do it because they went across the sky, like just in a zigzag formation.

75
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.360
So if I screamed at my wife, my friends, they got up,

76
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:55.300
the three of us saw it and I said, you know,

77
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.060
and they all knew it was something unusual. That was my first sighting. Okay.

78
00:03:58.061 --> 00:03:59.980
Now who knows? Okay. Meteoric bull ride.

79
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.940
There are many people that can dispute that. That wasn't real, but I,

80
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:05.740
I know what I saw. I know what my friends saw. I know what my wife saw.

81
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.020
Those things were moving. They were glowing, fast.

82
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.780
They were flying in formation and they were doing, uh,

83
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:14.230
enough speed to get from basically the right side of my eyes,

84
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:18.640
to the left side of my eyes really fast. The second one was, um,

85
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.310
I was, uh, I was in a, so that's, so that's four. I count those two as two.

86
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:27.400
And then the, the, the, the second one that I saw. So the one, two,

87
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:30.790
the third one I saw, I was, uh, I was in Montreal, Canada,

88
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.080
and I was on the 23rd floor of the queen Elizabeth hotel.

89
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:38.110
And this would have been when we were doing patrol, uh, in Canada,

90
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.180
the patrol tequila promotion. And that was it.

91
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.540
Would've been in the early two thousands. And, uh,

92
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.930
and I looked up and, uh,

93
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.020
beyond the window there and I saw this one,

94
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:54.730
it just looked like an on air mattress turned over on its, you know, with,

95
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:59.050
with the, with the bubbles on the bottom was huge. It was 150 feet, long,

96
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:03.970
50 feet, wide gray. It was a gray rainy day in Montreal,

97
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.350
broad daylight. And here was this thing at the 23rd story of the hotel.

98
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.010
And I'm looking at it and it moves slowly down on St. Catherine street.

99
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.840
And I'm thinking, where are the wires?

100
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:16.720
Where are the wires where it's gotta be a balloon. It's gotta be,

101
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.990
there's no Thanksgiving day parade here. What, what, what is that?

102
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.970
And my friends are with me. What is that?

103
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.500
And it come along and just parked outside the window. We looked at it,

104
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.660
big gray thing with these bulbs underneath,

105
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.140
and then it slowly turned and we saw the full length of it.

106
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.580
And then it went around the corner.

107
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:37.150
We ran out in the hall and we just watched a drift kind of sideways off over the

108
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.140
St. Lawrence river and disappear. When I fall, you know,

109
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.630
the people take pictures of those. No, we didn't get any pictures.

110
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:47.650
And I don't know who else saw in the 2000,

111
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:51.310
like to see five or six, something like that. Um,

112
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:54.010
and then the other people report it. No, I don't know. I should,

113
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.590
I should've checked and seen in Montreal with the local Newfoundland.

114
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.860
I think they have a representative up there, but, uh, it was vivid.

115
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:04.340
We all saw it. And then they, uh, the fourth one that I saw,

116
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:08.090
I was on my motorcycle, leaving town to go, uh, at Kingston, Ontario,

117
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:10.610
where I lived there and I was driving out of the farm gate. And, uh,

118
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.010
and I saw there's a power line that runs on the opposite farm there across the

119
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:17.780
road. And I saw this winking red light,

120
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:22.190
just moving slowly along the top of the power pylons. And I thought, well,

121
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:24.470
you know, helicopters, they do that kind of work where they,

122
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.320
where they string power lines, but they don't really do it at night.

123
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.830
I thought that's gotta be a chopper, a hydro chopper, like a hydro company,

124
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:34.370
chopper watching the power lines, checking for faults, or I dunno, I was,

125
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.660
and it goes along like this and I'm watching it. I stopped the bike, you know,

126
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:39.494
and I'm like,

127
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.160
and then it stops and makes a right angle turn and comes right at me.

128
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.490
And so I turned on the Iowa police motorcycle. So I turned on my wig wags,

129
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:46.730
you know.

130
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.920
<v 0>Like that police motorcycles, cars.</v>

131
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.260
<v 1>Police, motorcycle, police equip well.</v>

132
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.820
<v 0>Oh, are you a cop, Tom Edward magic getting pulled over by a blues brother.</v>

133
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.613
<v 1>I've actually,</v>

134
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.400
I've actually had the experience of actually pulling some people about it

135
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.473
anyway.

136
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.403
<v 0>Sure.</v>

137
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.180
Why'd you pull them over your sheriff while I was at preserved deputy sheriff

138
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.583
downtown.

139
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.710
<v 1>And reserve a reserve, the reserve, I must say,</v>

140
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:15.410
but I served under the first African-American sheriff and Heinz county,

141
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:19.040
Mississippi and its history. Anyway, back to my sighting, the thing comes along.

142
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.550
I will put it on the, the wig wags and the bike, and it stops above me.

143
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:27.380
And it turns on a light and I'm going, it looked where's the rotor wop.

144
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.150
Where's the, where's the wash. Where's it. Come on.

145
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.270
Or the helicopter at 3000 feet, you can hear it. This thing's like three,

146
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:35.480
400 feet above me. I'm looking at the thing. I'm thinking, where's the wash.

147
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:37.760
Where's the, where's the, it looks like it looks like helicopter.

148
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:41.750
It's gotta be a helicopter. Do I see a canopy? Do I see rings, rotors, nothing.

149
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:45.080
Just, just a mass of kind of metallic and lights.

150
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:47.180
And it just shines this light light on me.

151
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:50.540
And I turned the lights on the bike on and then turn them off.

152
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.860
And then it winked the light off and it just drifted out over the field and just

153
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:56.930
drifted off like that. So.

154
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.690
<v 0>So you've had three different and then one.</v>

155
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.200
<v 1>Night, well, one night I was in bed. I was in night in bed with my wife.</v>

156
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.670
It was in the 1987 or so. And, uh, I bought,

157
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.880
I woke bolt upright at three in the morning. I said, I gotta go outside.

158
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:12.800
I got to go outside. They're calling me, they're calling me.

159
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:15.920
They want me to see, they want me to see. And she says all, go back to sleep.

160
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:20.420
So I went back to sleep next day, all over the radio, upstate New York,

161
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:25.160
they talked about a big pink spiral in the sky that it appeared

162
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:29.060
to upstate Northern Northeastern Ontario and upstate New York.

163
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.540
And they were saying, oh, it was a Chinese rocket. What out?

164
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:34.730
A bottle rocket or the Chinese center? Rocket.

165
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:37.970
This was the explanation that the media and the government was giving at the

166
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:41.900
time. So those are my experiences right there.

167
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.760
<v 0>And, and that's how you got hooked. And.</v>

168
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.200
<v 1>Then, and then an interesting thing,</v>

169
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:49.310
same thing happened where I was doing a show, uh, called, uh,

170
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.620
out there beyond belief. And we were doing it, uh, over there for,

171
00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:57.090
for Bonnie hammer over there at, uh, at the sci-fi channel.

172
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.180
And it was an interview show where I talked to Doug,

173
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.770
Meldrum the Sasquatch expert and, and all kinds of talk to Doug. Yeah.

174
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.130
I believe him. I believe him. He's passionate about it. I don't see why he,

175
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.890
he's also a scientist. I talked to all those people, but the,

176
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:14.370
the day that I had Steve Sasquatch is a real, yes, I do. I believe,

177
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:17.910
I believe that there's gotta be, there's just, uh, do you know, uh, uh, uh,

178
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.850
Gabrielle Reese, the Olympian. Sure. Got her run the podcast.

179
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.530
She talked about her Sasquatch expense.

180
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.140
<v 0>No. Now I need to talk to you really good.</v>

181
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.250
She's so gigantic and beautiful. I would imagine that Sasquatch wanted to breed.

182
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.130
<v 1>Well, that's why apparently it shook a camper. That was she,</v>

183
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:33.730
she was up in upstate a.

184
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.120
<v 0>Super athlete.</v>

185
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.300
<v 1>She was attacked. Her camper was attacked by when she tells that story. Yeah.</v>

186
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.100
But where was I about the, I was,

187
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:44.170
why don't we go back to the Gabrielle re Sasquatch?

188
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.020
I had interviewed all kinds of people on this show.

189
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:47.610
<v 0>I have the day that.</v>

190
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.900
<v 1>My show was supposed to be a Squatch. It was supposed to be a yeah,</v>

191
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.160
but it was supposed to be a show,

192
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:56.160
a saw on scifi channel and interview show where I'd interviewed everybody,

193
00:09:56.161 --> 00:10:00.240
you know, uh, uh, all the people in the, in the field of cryptozoology and that

194
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.470
[inaudible] science fiction and theory and UFO's,

195
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:07.380
and I had Steven Greer and Steven Bassett on that same day.

196
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.970
<v 0>Steven Greer on the show too.</v>

197
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.630
<v 1>Okay. So I interview Steven Bassett and I'm about to interview Greer.</v>

198
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:17.550
And I get a call at about like noon at our noon break and

199
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.500
they call, and they say, your show's canceled.

200
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.830
We want you out of the studio by the end of the day. And, uh,

201
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.720
we're not going to air anything that you've done. Steven Greer,

202
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.320
Steven Bassett, Steven Greer, the UFO show. It gets canceled that day.

203
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.740
Now maybe Ms. Hammer made a decision, you know, talk shows.

204
00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:38.100
Aren't really our thing. Or Ackroyd's not really what we want on our network,

205
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:42.240
or I don't know what she called by someone or why, what, why,

206
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:47.010
why that day when I was going to do this vivid, you know, UFO, uh, show,

207
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.190
uh, that was going to go out on the, on the, on the air eventually. Why,

208
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.790
why then did it get canceled? Those postings? How were the ratings? No,

209
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:56.640
we never, we never got to air. I did 26 of them and whenever.

210
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.170
<v 0>It never got to air,</v>

211
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.980
so you just filmed them and it never did you guys do any wacky ones where they

212
00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:06.390
got the film and like, what are these crazy doing? Was there any of that?

213
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.200
Um, like if you were a nonbeliever,

214
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.630
non UFO enthusiast.

215
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.060
<v 1>The interview show, I didn't show any footage. I just,</v>

216
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.040
I just interviewed just talk to people. Yeah.

217
00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:20.310
So the day of my UFO show that I was going to be my big Steven Greer and Steven

218
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:21.780
batshit show, he got canceled. So.

219
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.060
<v 0>But do you think that they would listen Saifai is all about those shows? I mean,</v>

220
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.940
I watched an episode of Saifai where there's a bunch of people that claim to be

221
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:33.210
trapped in a cabin in Maine because werewolf's were outside.

222
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.690
It's just like it's they're into non, they don't do talk shows.

223
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.140
I did a show on Saifai talk show called Joe Rogan questions,

224
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:44.160
everything where were last, not very long, but part of that was my idea.

225
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.690
I didn't know. You worked for Bonnie.

226
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.650
<v 1>Worked for.</v>

227
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.420
<v 0>Bonnie hammer. It was different people.</v>

228
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.180
<v 1>She's one of the smartest executives in the industry.</v>

229
00:11:51.181 --> 00:11:55.890
And I don't doubt that she'll be running NBC someday or all of universal,

230
00:11:55.891 --> 00:11:58.410
but I, and I just, I just, I would always like to know what happened.

231
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.990
Did someone call you Bonnie and say, you know, don't bring this.

232
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.570
<v 0>Up now. I don't, no. One's going to call people about UFO.</v>
