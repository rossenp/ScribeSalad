00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.770
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 1>Experience. You know, it's like they think that about football helmets too,</v>

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.570
that they would actually be a safer game.

4
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:09.690
If they couldn't clash heads with a helmet on that, they wouldn't do it.

5
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:10.650
They wouldn't play like that.

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.910
<v 0>That's just not true with them. Clashing skills. It's not safer.</v>

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.673
<v 1>Sure. Matches.</v>

8
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.740
But the idea is that the only reason why they play that way is cause the helmets

9
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.140
and the foot shoulder gear. If you took that stuff away,

10
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:23.190
they wouldn't play like that.

11
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.250
<v 0>And the day they had, they barely had any pads and, you know,</v>

12
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.450
thirties or forties or whatever,

13
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.400
when they were playing with those little tiny helmets.

14
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.780
<v 1>Oh, that game, if you were an outsider, like if you didn't know how big it was,</v>

15
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.351
like,

16
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:37.620
if you didn't understand anything about the cultural significance football and

17
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:40.410
they showed you all the brain damage and they showed you what it is,

18
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:42.030
you'd be like, oh yeah, make that illegal.

19
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.000
<v 2>Yeah. Probably if anything should be illegal, stop.</v>

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.290
<v 1>Doing that. Kids will run into each other. They'll smash heads.</v>

21
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.280
<v 3>The concept of defensive offensive line. Just the idea of as the funniest thing,</v>

22
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:56.370
Susie say go just clunk heads with another unit.

23
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.910
<v 1>Of course we don't want it to be illegal. And it's a fun thing to watch.</v>

24
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.770
And it's a great way for some guys to make a load of money and weigh the risks

25
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.633
versus the rule.

26
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.270
<v 0>It's a bunch of middle-schoolers are snapping their necks and Michael will never</v>

27
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:10.104
play football.

28
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.120
<v 2>We're going to stop. They could,</v>

29
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:14.910
then they could illegalize MMA with that justification.

30
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.770
<v 0>'Cause we, we punching and kicking is so inherently violent.</v>

31
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:23.460
That's where we see it as being this violent act, right? That it's we go,

32
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.310
oh fighting. That's like crazy. That's the most violent sport,

33
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.870
but it's so much less of a dangerous sport than football football.

34
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:35.010
These guys are just running head first at each other. And every one of them,

35
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.310
every one of them has major, major issue.

36
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.360
<v 2>Blindsided and football. You know,</v>

37
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:42.240
you'll have your eye on someone and then you get head to head taken out from

38
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:46.770
someone else that doesn't happen as much in MMA. But I mean,

39
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.770
when people get like head kick knocked unconscious,

40
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:51.090
that's not good for your brain.

41
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.790
<v 0>No, but how often are football players being concussed,</v>

42
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.230
just smash each other and then they get up and they just do it again. And again,

43
00:01:58.231 --> 00:01:59.064
and again.

44
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.660
<v 2>They're a little bit stricter, I think on like, if you get a concussion, they,</v>

45
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:05.820
they won't put you back in at least the way they used to, like when I was a kid,

46
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.410
but it's still.

47
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.680
<v 0>But I think fighters are what getting concussed once every F you know,</v>

48
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:14.550
once a year, if they're getting knocked out once a year, I mean, you know.

49
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.200
<v 1>But there's also sub-concussive trial. It seems to be the problem with CTE.</v>

50
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.250
It's not just the knockouts. It's just the thumps over and over again,

51
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.660
over and over and over and.

52
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.310
<v 0>Training sparring, these guys.</v>

53
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.930
<v 1>So think that's the real problem.</v>

54
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:29.870
That's why also soccer players are getting it right.

55
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:31.230
Soccer players are starting to get CTS.

56
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.370
<v 2>What's worse, like getting like a Conor McGregor, one punch knockout,</v>

57
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:39.060
or fighting Nick Diaz and just getting like butter for five.

58
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.730
<v 1>Rounds. Probably you're probably better off getting one punch.</v>

59
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.010
<v 3>Knockouts. The.</v>

60
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.880
<v 1>Better than you. Probably better off getting dropped.</v>

61
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.430
<v 0>I'm getting beat up by Nick Diaz for 15 minutes to suck.</v>

62
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.510
<v 3>It. Wasn't the initial argument about MMA being safer than boxing is that it's</v>

63
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:55.800
not so much. So, you know,

64
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.320
with the gloves being bigger and boxing and all that stuff,

65
00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.560
that's actually worse because.

66
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.140
<v 2>You're going to keep taking too many shots count as well.</v>

67
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:04.450
You can get knocked down and then get up and go, right.

68
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.630
You be concussed and like, all right, keep on fighting. Um, whereas in MMA,

69
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:09.190
they'll stop it. If you, if you're not defending.

70
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.500
<v 1>That's probably definitely better. Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.140
The thing about eight counts and 10 counseling,

72
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.080
but people have gotten off the deck and had amazing performances.

73
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:19.090
So you'd ever want to stop it. Like, look at Tyson.

74
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:22.810
Fury gets off the deck twice against Deontay Wilder and MMA,

75
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:25.390
that fight would have been stopped. Right? So it's like one of those,

76
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.850
particularly the last round, when he dropped him,

77
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:30.700
he would have definitely punched him a few times and he would have been out cold

78
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.110
cause he was flat on his back, um, in MMA,

79
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.140
that would be the end of the fight. And we are lucky.

80
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:43.090
It wasn't cause he got up like a superhero and even won the rest of

81
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:44.890
the round. He outbox him for the rest of the round.

82
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.360
He survived the initial barrage and then started catching him as he was coming

83
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.390
in. And as Deontay was being reckless, he caught him one time, like stung him.

84
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.220
And you're like, holy, he's winning this round.

85
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:58.570
Now that he's winning the rest of the round after getting almost obliterated.

86
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.090
So there's an argument that that's better, the crazy.

87
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.170
<v 2>Entertainment value.</v>

88
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.220
But the crazy thing from the CTE like perspective about boxing to me is that

89
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.490
people will get hit and then they get hit and grab someone.

90
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.520
Cause that's just everyone's instinct and they grab them and then you have a

91
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:15.670
little record goes, no, no, no, no, no, no. Keep, keep punching the heads.

92
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.760
Like don't do anything to avoid from hitting. No, no, no, no. Step it back out.

93
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.090
And then they, and that in MMA, you'll see a lot, someone get hit and then,

94
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:22.301
you know,

95
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:25.690
they get into a clinch and you get a few minutes in a clinch where they're kind

96
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:27.940
of like, okay, I'm not taking all the damage right now.

97
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.910
<v 1>But the smart thing about that is that's how you're supposed to fight.</v>

98
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.420
Like you're giving people options to defend themselves. It shouldn't be,

99
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:37.030
you can't defend yourself other than punching back.

100
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.040
That seems like it seems kind of crazy,

101
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.790
but I could grab them and just stop these punches. No, no, no.

102
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.260
Against the rules and what kind of rules do we have? Like,

103
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:46.210
you can only beat me up if I let you beat me.

104
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.080
<v 2>That was one of the points that they dance around for an half hour.</v>

105
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.160
But do you remember the original?

106
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.270
There was like Gracie videos that they'd make an early UFC and what they used to

107
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:57.190
say all the time was, and it's so true.

108
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.700
It was so interesting is that if two boxers just have a street fight,

109
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.710
they're going into a clinch.

110
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.460
And it's probably going to end up on the ground at some point because the ref

111
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:10.450
has to break up a clench over and over and over again to make boxing happen.

112
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:11.284
Like even when,

113
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.960
even when you're a professional boxer and you don't know anything about

114
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:16.720
wrestling or grappling, you still end up grabbing the other guy.

115
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.763
Cause that's just like.

116
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.980
<v 1>The only time that doesn't take places will one guy knows how to strike and the</v>

117
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:24.640
other guy doesn't and you see a lot of those videos online where two dudes

118
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.800
decided to get into some sort of a street altercation.

119
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:30.730
And one guy actually is like a boxer and clap and he catches the guy and the guy

120
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:33.370
falls and bounces his head off the concrete out cold.

121
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.890
There's a bunch of those that's bad. That's different.

122
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.230
See the thing about the Gracie jiu-jitsu is like,

123
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.330
you've got to always be aware of this. People like that out there.

124
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.660
There's there's always guys who can punch you in the face and if they know how

125
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:44.410
to wrestle too,

126
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.720
and they can keep you away and just keep punching you in the face,

127
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.700
you better know how to take them down.

128
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.040
<v 2>The. Did 2019, do you have,</v>

129
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.890
[inaudible] going to look at their ears. You gotta look for little signs.

130
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.030
<v 0>Look in their eyes, shake their hand.</v>

131
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.650
<v 1>Skinny necks. Aren't getting choked as far as a skill.</v>

132
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.180
<v 0>Like definitely a.</v>

133
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.840
<v 1>Weird time for fighting. You know, it's like, and we, we both,</v>

134
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.600
I like both kinds. I like just stand up only fights.

135
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.260
I like watching those and I liked mixed martial arts fights, but I think like,

136
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.090
uh, Terrence, Crawford's coming on next.

137
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.120
And I think watching someone like him box,

138
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.350
like when you see the skill level that that guy has at stances,

139
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.900
doing all kinds of befuddling people getting their range,

140
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.110
figuring them out and then just teeing them up with perfect timing.

141
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.090
Like that's almost only possible that kind of artistry, if there's no wrestling,

142
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.480
right? There's no leg kicks. If there's only the boxing, that's the only way.

143
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.650
See that like that,

144
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:42.560
that kind of like beautiful comedy cause otherwise you would do other too.

145
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.010
You would leg kick. You would try to take them down. And that. So like the,

146
00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:50.120
the level of dominance that a real Floyd Mayweather,

147
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.270
a real world champion boxer has with their hands.

148
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.170
It's hard to really appreciate until you see it live. And you know,

149
00:06:57.171 --> 00:07:00.200
like what you're seeing, like if you're in, in the, the building with a guy,

150
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.640
who's beating somebody up on their sparring, it's like, you're oh, like this is,

151
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.770
you guys are playing two totally different games.

152
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.150
<v 0>Boxing. It's like, I literally look at boxing as like very much a sport.</v>

153
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:15.860
And I think MMA is the closest thing that we have to competitive

154
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:18.980
fighting a hundred percent. That's sort of like the difference it's, you know,

155
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.720
all things considered. It's still not fighting.

156
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.510
You can't grab somebody's balls and yank them off their body and bite their

157
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:27.230
nose. I know just being able to [inaudible].

158
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.630
<v 1>You couldn't bite and you couldn't. I gouge hit him with a.</v>

159
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:30.853
<v 0>Trash can with.</v>

160
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.620
<v 1>And he can't be you can't fish hook. And then,</v>

161
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.450
but you used to be able to punch the ball.

162
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:39.990
So it was a great video of Keith Hackney fighting Joe song. Joe sawn got,

163
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.270
got him in a headlock and Keke fact, and he's just hammering his deck. I mean,

164
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:48.770
full blast over and over. And you see like, Joe, sons' like going into shock.

165
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.850
<v 2>It's a few of them. And he's like, I'm not letting go of this choke the fourth,</v>

166
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:54.860
fifth Dick punch. It's like, this.

167
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.620
<v 1>Is all over man. He does a drained.</v>

168
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.820
<v 0>Was he who was had, was it chemo? Was he head budding, hoist grace</v>

169
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.210
dude, that was brutal.

170
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.640
<v 1>Rudel. There was a lot of head button back in the days,</v>

171
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:11.180
it was an effective weapon and it makes us like, oh, that's awful.

172
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:14.120
But small finger locks with all these other bones,

173
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.190
how come you're allowed to hit with these bones?

174
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:17.390
But you can't hit with that bone.

175
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.580
<v 0>I would rather be headbutted by a guy that I don't give a there's no,</v>

176
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.020
there's not much technique. Head headbutting.

177
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.140
I would rather be head about it than be head kicked by a dude who knows how to

178
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:27.500
headcase.

179
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.930
<v 1>Can you think there's no tech, but there really is.</v>

180
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.550
There's guys that spar and they fight and left way and left the ways a

181
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:39.290
type of, uh, Moya tie where they put ropes, uh, over their knuckles.

182
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:42.980
That's the only thing they have and they're allowed to headbutt and it's some

183
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.690
wild. And they do headbutt combinations on the pad. Like, they'll do a tap,

184
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:51.910
tap bang. They'll like use their head and train it. Wow.

185
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.770
Learn how TV and find that left the way.

186
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.500
W E I T L U T H D. You know,

187
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.830
who does commentary for it is our friend, Robin black. He does, uh,

188
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.480
he does commentary for less way,

189
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.170
but this is a brutal form of boy where you're allowed to head,

190
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.920
but they cause they already elbow. And I think they, you know, they're thinking,

191
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.950
well, if I can knee and if I can do all these things, why can't I head?

192
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.630
But it's right there. He's faces right there. Well, you remember what, uh,

193
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.800
what Mark Coleman used to do?

194
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:23.550
Like he got a full season before the headbutts were illegal, dude. He would,

195
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.050
he would smash people with the headbutts.

196
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.450
So here we'll get this dude with this combination. Watch that.

197
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:31.440
So this is a Robin, Robin black breakdown. When he, he goes,

198
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.770
this dude goes off to the side, pushes the dude's head away,

199
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.310
and then immediately comes in with a perfect head. But boom,

200
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.910
just slamming him in the face on purpose with the top of his head.

201
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:45.420
So he's trying to hit like his eyes and his nose and the soft tissue.

202
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.300
He's trying to hit that with the hard part of his forehead that.

203
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.970
<v 3>I think that will do a lot more damage than a fist.</v>

204
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.850
<v 1>But again, he only works one out of every thousand times, man. No, no, no, no.</v>

205
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:01.170
This guy does it a lot. And if you do it this way, the way he's doing it,

206
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.850
you taking a really hard part of your forehead and you're smashing against a

207
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:10.170
soft part of the eyes and the nose. This part of your forehead is hard as,

208
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.640
man. Most guys who break their hand in fights break their hands off of the head,

209
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.590
especially boxing.
