WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.080
<v 1>Experience this concept of things,</v>

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.520
just sort of falling into place. I'm, I'm a big believer in that too. Yeah.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.320
What, what is that though? Is that you getting out of your own way? Like what,

5
00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:15.280
what is that? Is.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.920
<v 0>It isn't that 70% of it? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.990
I'd say it's 70% maintenance of what can I do

8
00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:26.590
to do my part, to stay out of the way. And then the other part,

9
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.590
I always think of it as like this little, super thin, uh,

10
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.030
invisible thread, but you can feel the tug and you just kind of,

11
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.110
you have to be really gentle and you have to pause when agitated and you have to

12
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:43.660
go for it. And you're gonna like, there's four walls in here,

13
00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:44.940
which one has the map behind it.

14
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.260
You it's that one and you knock down the wall and it's there, you know?

15
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.420
<v 1>Yeah. What is that though? That's a.</v>

16
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.260
<v 0>Synchronicity. Yeah. Uh, intuition.</v>

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.780
<v 1>But labeling it is very dangerous cuz it's so filled when with woo.</v>

18
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.420
And so it's, you know,

19
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.610
there's so many people that are hooked that have like made a career out of sort

20
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:09.450
of like labeling it and sure. Defining it or teaching you how to get to it.

21
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.010
And it's.

22
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.690
<v 0>Great cuz it's the commodity that you can't capitalize on. Yeah. And yet,</v>

23
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.210
if you don't show proof of its existence, you, you can't even,

24
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.480
you shouldn't even be qualified to speak on it. I don't know. It's.

25
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480
<v 1>The big, I don't know. But when it happens,</v>

26
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.120
whether it happens with love or with friendship or with a career or with a path

27
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:33.600
you're taking, you just know while you there's a smile, there's an inner smile.

28
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.800
Like yeah, this is it. Well put I found it, this is it. This is,

29
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.240
I'm supposed to be doing this. Here we go. Here we go.

30
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.630
<v 0>Yeah. And I really feel you, it's so funny at this point in my life and being,</v>

31
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.790
you know, kind of middle aged and all that. Well,

32
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.070
I know I'm gonna fly around the world and I'm gonna sell some soap.

33
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.990
And I know I have a new project and I know I've just retired my Jersey on this

34
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:58.190
12 year journey I've been on. And uh, and how do I want to start? And,

35
00:01:58.191 --> 00:01:59.950
and it came up, how would you like, I go, yes,

36
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:02.590
that's exactly what I'm going to do. I want go,

37
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.340
I have the Joe Rogan experience and,

38
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.420
and kick off this year and this season and this new chapter by doing

39
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.940
what I love, which is a,

40
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.380
an interview is we're looking at each other and it there's a give and take. Um,

41
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.340
but to answer the question, it can be, antiliactic like anything. I mean,

42
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:23.420
this is surreal, you know, I never, I mean,

43
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.050
have you seen you around a little bit,

44
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.090
but I feel like I know you cuz I see you all the time and I listen

45
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.810
to you and I'm a, I'm a, a martial arts nut and

46
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.680
yeah, isn't it. Sometimes you, it, when you,

47
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.160
when you get outside of the fortunate,

48
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.630
interesting creative of experience you're having,

49
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.510
you kind of go like it's very dreamlike. Yeah.

50
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.430
<v 1>Yeah. My whole life's a dream. Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.310
<v 0>Except for the ramifications. It's the ramifications. &lt;laugh&gt; those for real.</v>

52
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.470
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; those come back and bite you in the. You're like, yeah,</v>

53
00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:02.000
this isn't a dream at all. This could, this is dangerous. Yeah. I used to,

54
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.760
I remember the first time I met Phil Hartman, uh, I,

55
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.360
I was stunned that I was actually like sitting,

56
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.280
we were at a table read and I was sitting across from, and I'm like, how the?

57
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.200
You're a famous guy. &lt;laugh&gt; like, you're a really famous guy.

58
00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:16.480
Like I've seen you in movies, man. Yeah.

59
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:21.030
Like you've seen you on television here, you right there. How weird, you know?

60
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.670
And it, it seems it's very hard to, to be normal.

61
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.430
And then after a, while it that becomes normal. And then the,

62
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.630
the fact that it becomes normal becomes surreal.

63
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.950
And then it really feels like a dream. Like when I, I meet people like you,

64
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:40.620
like we've just met an hour or so ago. And yet instantly I feel like I know you.

65
00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:44.740
Yeah. Yeah. It's very strange. But you also, you're not full of. You know,

66
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:48.540
when someone's not full of, it's pretty easy to get to know them.

67
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.500
You say something, I say something back go, oh, I know how he works.

68
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.140
I see what's going on in there. This is a actual human. Here we go.

69
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.700
We're talking. This is a good litmus.

70
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.570
<v 0>Too, because you watch your show pretty. And I just love it too.</v>

71
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:03.050
Cuz in your show, you literally, you just, you start,

72
00:04:03.051 --> 00:04:06.450
it's a rolling start with you every time you come into the show and you're

73
00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:10.570
already kind of thinking about stuff. So it's, it feels very,

74
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.290
uh, organic. And part of me, even this morning was like,

75
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.050
I hope he looks into my eyes and doesn't see a complete and utter foolish frog.

76
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.040
&lt;laugh&gt; you?

77
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.080
Because I would probably believe him if he mirrored that back to me. Oh no,

78
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.400
that's.

79
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.240
<v 1>A, that's a danger, right? Yeah. If someone,</v>

80
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.840
if you respect someone and they think you're a idiot, you're like, oh no,

81
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.880
I might really be a idiot.

82
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.320
<v 0>But there's been times when in just being myself,</v>

83
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.160
someone who I respect has looked at me and said, what are,

84
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:40.360
what are we talking about? Yeah. What are you even saying?

85
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.470
And you remember that? Cuz it kind of yeah. It, it stiff armss.

86
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.430
<v 1>You. But part of those are good cuz it realize,</v>

87
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:48.910
well you were probably off on a stupid tangent. Yeah.

88
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.070
And that's part of being a person, you know, part of being a person is like,

89
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.470
I don't know what the next word out of my mouth is gonna be right now.

90
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.750
No one ever does. Unless you do. And if you do is kind of weird.

91
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.900
<v 0>Some people are poker, players respect some people that are that. Um,</v>

92
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.220
because there's a,

93
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.220
an ability to maybe it's fear based. But I,

94
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.580
I always appreciate people who, you know,

95
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.660
as people like their icons are big shots or that they hold a certainesteem and

96
00:05:20.661 --> 00:05:25.410
all of their they're very simple. It's like mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yes, yes.

97
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.810
We should fix that. Sure.

98
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.450
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah, sure. Is my favorite. Sure.</v>

99
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.290
<v 0>Okay. On it. Yeah.</v>

100
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.330
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. No periods either. Like you don't have time to make a period.</v>

101
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.330
It beats.

102
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.130
<v 0>The all caps texts. Yeah. Oh, I don't.</v>

103
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.050
<v 1>Like those at all those people weird. Although CT Fletcher,</v>

104
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.520
he sends me all texts. I, I love him, but he's shouting at everything.

105
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.760
Everything is a shout. Yeah.

106
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.960
<v 0>But yeah, the surreal part is, um,</v>

107
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.160
I think part of the reason I'm still so interested, not just in,

108
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.240
in life, but also, you know,

109
00:05:57.241 --> 00:06:00.120
getting to do what I do is I'm a fan.

110
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.760
I love movies. I love creativity. I love music. I love,

111
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.280
I love culture.

112
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.080
And the fact that I actually have a place in it while I'm observing

113
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:15.040
it and digging it is like it's, it's,

114
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.653
it's an honor.

115
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.510
<v 1>Well, that's a beautiful perspective. And that shows in how you,</v>

116
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.110
how you, how you carry yourself.

117
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:27.190
And it shows in the work that you do that you do appreciate it. You know,

118
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.430
one of the saddest things is someone who's in an amazing position who doesn't

119
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:36.030
appreciate it. And, and that, that drives other people crazy too.

120
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.580
Like Prema donnas drive people crazy for a variety of reasons.

121
00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:44.540
But one of the big ones is you don't appreciate how fortunate you are. Like,

122
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.500
and people love when people appreciate good fortune and appreciate a,

123
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.220
a well-earn position and are, you know,

124
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.210
engrossed in a beautiful life of something that they've really joy and

125
00:06:58.211 --> 00:06:59.810
something that really inspires them.

126
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.010
<v 0>Well, I, I need to, I need to be kept,</v>

127
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.650
uh rightizedd cuz I can easily fall into self-seeking and

128
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:12.810
depression and self pity and judgment and, and all that stuff. It's kind of a,

129
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.930
it's a bit of a default, but I spend enough energy and I've I've had enough, uh,

130
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:23.160
help over enough years to actually just say, oh, that's,

131
00:07:23.161 --> 00:07:27.240
that's just awful destructive behavior.

132
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.720
You're entertaining in your head.

133
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.440
<v 1>You know, bad patterns. Just bad thought patterns. Yeah. Yeah. We,</v>

134
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.600
I think we could all fall into those.

135
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.400
I'm I'm ruthlessously self critical and it's,

136
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.990
for me sometimes it's very hard to step outside and, and just,

137
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.670
just take a pause and, and, and,

138
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.710
and recognize that not everything's gonna be right the first time you try it.

139
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.710
You know, I think that a lot of people that are really great at things,

140
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.270
it's one of the things about them is that they're not very satisfied with their

141
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.070
work. Like they're always looking to improve it.

142
00:07:58.071 --> 00:07:59.460
They're always looking for be better.

143
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.500
And then that can start that cycle in their head of self-loathing and an

144
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.380
anxiety and anger at their,

145
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.540
at their performance or their work or whatever it is. Yeah. And,

146
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.300
and then that can lead to depression that can lead to just self hate. Yeah.

147
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.460
<v 0>And what are your, uh, tolerances? Like,</v>

148
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.020
I'll be the first to tell you, like, you know,

149
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.570
just or movies or movie doing Tropic thunder or one of the first, you know,

150
00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:24.970
Ironman movies. I was like, I'd go over to the Mon. I'd be like,

151
00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:29.250
play that back again. That was so good. &lt;laugh&gt; dude, let me see that again.

152
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.490
I need confirmation. Yeah. Cuz it's always a miracle. You stayed in frame,

153
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.530
you got the line, right. Your eye line was right. The lighting was right.

154
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.800
The sensibility us. Right. And you just look at it and you go, oh,

155
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.360
you know, it's like, I don't know, for me,

156
00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:48.240
it's like the playback of the perfect Superman punch Ko.

157
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.360
And just go show me that again. Yeah. Um,

158
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.080
or when we were shooting Tropic thunderer I had a little, uh,

159
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.040
teaser clip for Ironman,

160
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.120
but it wasn't coming out until the next year and we were gonna go to ComicCon

161
00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:06.120
and I, so I got to see it and show it to people and they're like, oh, I, I,

162
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.480
I think that's that movie's gonna do pretty good.

163
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:11.160
And then when we went to ComicCon we saw it,

164
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:15.310
but it used to be like that with music too. Like I write music,

165
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.670
I haven't for some time,

166
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.550
but you would write something and then you'd just listen to it on the loop cuz

167
00:09:19.551 --> 00:09:23.990
you go, wow. That's not, I know that I was here and I did that,

168
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.350
but it feels kind of inspired and yeah. And you wanna get all that stuff,

169
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.390
but yeah, self critical's important.

170
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.540
As long as it doesn't bleed out into and over the edges and just

171
00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.140
make everyone rush you're miserable.

172
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.540
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; right. Again, get outta your own way. Yeah. Again, I mean, that's uh,</v>

173
00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:43.860
one of the, the many tenets of life learn how to get outta your,

174
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.500
your own way with everything, including with creative endeavors.

175
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.340
It seems like that, that thing that you said about music,

176
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.620
most people who write things or create things, say that that it's,

177
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.050
you, they know they're doing it. Like if you make a great sculpture, you know,

178
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:00.970
you're doing it, but where is it coming from? Like what is,

179
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.810
what is the idea that manifests itself into this perfect thing that you could

180
00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:09.810
step back and look at? And it seems surreal that how did I create that? Did I,

181
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.650
I don't know if I did. I mean, I definitely made my fingers move,

182
00:10:12.651 --> 00:10:16.720
but I don't know if that's me who wrote that music who pooped performed it.

183
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.440
I know you did,

184
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.760
but there's a thing inside you that sort of like tunes in to this, uh,

185
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:28.120
this energy of, of ideas. And then it comes through you and again,

186
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.960
you kind of have to get outta your own way while you're writing something.

187
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.640
And then when it comes out, it's a weird feeling. Yeah. It's not like,

188
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.750
like if you hammer in the, into a board, you are very aware. You did that.

189
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.990
You're very aware, but there's something about the creative process. That's not,

190
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.110
you're not totally there. It's weird.

191
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.710
<v 0>Yeah. It, because it is you and it isn't you. Right.</v>

192
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.310
And what is you even mean? I love it. Well,

193
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:59.700
you always hear it too in sports. It's like, you know, oh, you know, uh,

194
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.980
you know how to go today, Federer? Oh, I was out of my mind.

195
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.860
I was not in my mind. It was a beautiful day. And I think you saw the results.

196
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.340
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. You know? Sure. Fluid.</v>

197
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.900
<v 0>Effortless, poetic.</v>

198
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.940
<v 1>Well fighters. Talk about that all the time that like,</v>

199
00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.340
especially a counter shot,

200
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.250
like they land something and they don't even have any idea they're gonna do it

201
00:11:21.251 --> 00:11:23.490
and they did it and then it, it caused the knockout. Yeah.

202
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.690
It's their training manifests itself in this one special,

203
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.050
beautiful moment where bang, this thing happens.

204
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.330
And then they see the guy drop and they're like, holy. Oh yeah. And then they,

205
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:38.010
they walk away and it's the work it's it's there's so many

206
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.760
is involved. Right? There's so many moving pieces.

207
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.120
You have to be working on your own mind to learn how to get outta your own way.

208
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.280
You also have to be like really engrossed in whatever the activity is that

209
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:50.960
you're doing, like obsessed in love with it, passionate about it.

210
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.720
And then you have to have the discipline to show up and actually do the work.

211
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.000
There's so many different moving PE and it all has to be managed and it's not

212
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.360
solid. It's like a, it's like a raft on the ocean. It's moving around.

213
00:12:02.361 --> 00:12:05.640
You're always trying to like figure out how to keep it, keep it moving and,

214
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.080
and functional. And it always seems unmanageable.

215
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:11.120
And after it's overoverload it was like, Ugh. Oh. Did that even work?

216
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.310
<v 0>Yeah. Call it the fater board. Ah, yeah. That weird thing, you know,</v>

217
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.030
how do you get it all.
