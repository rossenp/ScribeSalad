00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Before we go any further, we should give you credit.</v>

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.200
You're the reason why all this started. You are the original pod father, the,

3
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:12.240
the legitimate one. Like if there's a lot of people claiming that. Yeah.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.680
You're the guy who made the very first podcast.

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.120
You even came up with the name of it.

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.320
<v 1>Right? No, I didn't come up with the name who came,</v>

7
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.360
who came up with the name of it? Well, let me go back to, to the big,

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.150
because actually the technology of podcasting was invented in 2000.

9
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.790
So before anyone was podcasting before there was an iPod, interestingly. Hmm.

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.470
Um, I was living in Amsterdam at the time. And, um,

11
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.310
I was working with Dave Weiner who had, who really invented blogging.

12
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.910
And he had created this RSS syndication format and he had

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.220
software where you could blog and then an aggregator kind of like, you know,

14
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:47.500
Google reader at the time. And you could, you know, read blogs.

15
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:50.500
And it was kind of like a two-way communication thing. It was interesting.

16
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.740
And a lot of people were starting to use it. And in Amsterdam,

17
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.500
they had cable modems rolled out everywhere and cable modems was sold at the

18
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.450
time as always on internet. It wasn't fast. It was, was just on.

19
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.490
You didn't have to dial in, which was, oh my God, this is great. You know,

20
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.050
this was a huge improvement.

21
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.970
&lt;affirmative&gt; you't have to kick someone off the phone line, all of that. Yeah.

22
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.810
Um, so the, um, sorry, the, um, the,

23
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.490
the experience of multimedia was.

24
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.320
Like you wanted to hear a song or play a video. It was like click weight,

25
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.240
weight, weight, download weight, you know,

26
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.120
it would probably download and then open up a, some kind of player.

27
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.080
And then it was not an experience. There was nothing,

28
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.720
nothing there that made sense. So, and I always wanted to broadcast on the unit.

29
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:38.120
That's always been my thing from the moment I saw it. Um,

30
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.480
so I came up with this concept of the last yard. So what,

31
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.430
what if you had a little thing running on your computer in the background that

32
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:49.190
would know if there's something you wanted, let's just forget the,

33
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.990
how it knows part. Um,

34
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.030
it would download it and it would tell you that there was something new when it

35
00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.710
already had it on its local hard drive.

36
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.950
So you remove the whole weight experience, cuz you don't know,

37
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.340
you don't know that this computer's been downloading something you've want it.

38
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.020
It just tells you, oh, it's here. Which is, you know,

39
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.940
it's not abnormal in media. You know, the six o'clock news,

40
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:12.740
most of it's produced before the actual broadcast. So, um,

41
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.460
I took this idea to Dave and I said,

42
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.380
we need to come up with something that can download a media file that I program

43
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.101
somehow,

44
00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:25.890
like this is gonna show up and then it downloads it and only tells me

45
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.090
when it's there and I can click on it. It plays immediately. And it,

46
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.570
it took some convincing. He didn't exactly understand what I was saying.

47
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.210
He probably thought a MTV guy, get the outta here.

48
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.850
In fact that's exactly what he thought &lt;laugh&gt;. And uh, uh,

49
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.440
and then I actually demonstrated to him what I wanted to do in his software.

50
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.320
And he said, okay, I'm gonna do this,

51
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.560
but only on the condition you never, ever, ever use my software again,

52
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.400
because that was horrible. What you just did.

53
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.560
And so we created the enclosure element in RSS.

54
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.400
And so for two years we were doing back and forth, you know,

55
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.680
like movie files and stuff and oh, click and it would open up.

56
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.560
And the experience was good until I saw my first iPod friend of mine

57
00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:11.360
said, oh, look at this. I'm like, oh, this is the,

58
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.160
the white one with the big click, click click, the big wheel on it.

59
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.800
That was a good one. Right? They got hot, you know, after a while, like big,

60
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:21.190
hard drive. And I looked at it and went, this is not a, a,

61
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.030
a digital Walkman. This is a radio receiver. Cause I had one, I had a Sony am,

62
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.030
radio Trent receiver, which is, you know, little solid state thing. I'm like,

63
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.670
this is a radio. This, this can receive radio programming.

64
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.870
And so I said about again with my fantastic programming sales skills, uh,

65
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.260
to make a, a little application and you, the iPod at the time,

66
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:45.060
you still had to sync it to iTunes.

67
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:48.380
That's how you got music onto it back in the day. Um,

68
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.500
and so you could put a,

69
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.700
an MP3 file into a blog post basically, but it was a special attachment really.

70
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.300
And so this program would just be looking all the time. Is it something new?

71
00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:03.890
Is something new? Oh, there's something new, download it, then click trip it.

72
00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:06.090
So that it's synchronized to the iPod.

73
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.210
And it worked now not being a programmer. Um,

74
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.290
actually Kevin Marks, the guy was working at apple,

75
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.930
sent me a version of the script that actually worked. That was helpful.

76
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.530
And I said about creating a radio show,

77
00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:22.640
which we didn't have the name podcast yet. Um,

78
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.400
and I wanted to be able to talk to developers,

79
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.040
software developers who could create receivers. So, you know, we had, um,

80
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.280
ipoter, ipoter X, uh, ipoder lemon, all the, all these different applications,

81
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.920
which kind of did the same thing. And because I was talking to developers,

82
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.190
I called it the daily source code.

83
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:45.870
So I did every day and source code is kind of what the developers work in.

84
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.830
And I was really talking to them like, okay, well, the guys over in New Zealand,

85
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.511
they, you know,

86
00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:53.150
they've created this version of the app and it's really working well.

87
00:04:53.151 --> 00:04:57.350
And we discovered all kinds of crazy. Like you subscribe to a feed.

88
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.420
Um, uh, because when no one had thought it through, we were trying to download,

89
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.940
you know, everything you had in that feed all at once.

90
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.740
So I was trying to download 50 episodes and we still had kind of always on

91
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.620
internet. So everything would crunch and die.

92
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.900
And this just kept building and building.

93
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:18.260
And other people started doing these and we called them saliliqui and little

94
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.290
bundles of joy and all kinds of really dumb names. And the, uh,

95
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:25.850
Danny gregir guy who was just listening. He said, oh, this, this,

96
00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:29.330
this is a podcast. And the name stuck, ah,

97
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.770
now Ben Hammersley from the guardian years earlier

98
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.050
had actually used the term podcast, um, somewhere in an article,

99
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.720
which lo was no podcasting at the time, but he envisioned that and,

100
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.680
and called it podcast. So I a while. So he's the guy.

101
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.960
So he's the guy who named it. He used the term, but I would say Danny,

102
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.360
Gregard really named what we were doing at the time. So, so,

103
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.560
and that's when I didn't name myself, the pod father,

104
00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:02.520
where people started calling me that, um, and it just grew from there.

105
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.200
And that went really fast before I knew what the BBC was calling and the

106
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:09.920
interviews here and there I'm like, holy, something's blowing up here. Yeah.

107
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.040
And it wasn't until, uh, the,

108
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.190
a big moment was I got a call from Steve jobs and he says, well,

109
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.270
actually it was Eddie Q you know, who's big man on campus there. Now he says,

110
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.590
can you meet with Steve? I'm like, lemme me check my calendar. &lt;laugh&gt;. Yeah.

111
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.590
So it was in, uh, where's the D three conference like San Diego, I think, um,

112
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.470
went there and I met with him for an hour and it was wow. And I had,

113
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.100
I' met a lot of interesting busy dude. My,

114
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.540
my best meeting to date had been Quincy Jones where I got drunk with him for an

115
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:47.140
hour on the live radio show. Oh yeah. That was fantastic. Wow. Um,

116
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.820
and so here's Steve jobs in the flash. Now,

117
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:53.940
the first thing I notice is he's got a weird list that I' not really heard

118
00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:56.340
before. Really? Yeah. It's like, well, okay.

119
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.410
So he hides it when he do as those maybe, maybe when he is projecting. Yeah.

120
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.690
But he was much more personable and it's just the two of us, but first he's,

121
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.090
he's mad, he's off and he's yelling about, they up wifi. And,

122
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.810
and I learned later &lt;laugh&gt; that his, uh,

123
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.690
his plan always for the iPhone was to not be a cell phone,

124
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.240
but to use wifi networks around the world and whoa. Yeah.

125
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.840
And because, you know, Cisco, whoever had changed the,

126
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.560
the way wifi works and the way the authentication works,

127
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:31.800
that it really wouldn't be that seamless, but that was his, his vision. And,

128
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.680
you know, so I actually, I thought to myself, dude,

129
00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:37.320
you should probably calm down. This is gonna make you sick. Um,

130
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.270
and then he was talking about, oh no, Eddie Q says, uh, yeah, you know,

131
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:45.550
the R AA called. And, uh, they got a problem with the, with how we're able to,

132
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.150
um, you know, record sounds on the Mac, you know,

133
00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:50.390
breaking any kind of encryption. And I said, ah,

134
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:53.590
that's actually kind of important because in order to record stuff,

135
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.470
we're using like audio hijack pro and all these,

136
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.900
all these different kinds of tools. And I said, mom, I hope,

137
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:02.460
hope they don't do that because it's kind of important for production.

138
00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:06.780
And Steve went, it. Tell 'em to themselves. This is tools our guys need.

139
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.300
I'm like, oh, okay. &lt;laugh&gt; and then he said, Adam,

140
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.620
I'd like to put podcasting and iTunes. Are you okay with that? I'd like,

141
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.420
are you kidding me? Yes. I'll give you my director.

142
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.210
I built a directorory of podcast. I'll give you that to start it off.

143
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.370
Absolutely. And then, uh, uh, it was kind of funny.

144
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.210
So then maybe what, what year was this? 2004, something like that.

145
00:08:30.211 --> 00:08:34.130
I think, yeah. 2004, 2005 timeframe. And then, uh, Jamie,

146
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:36.130
maybe you can find it if you want. It's a pretty funny video.

147
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.480
So he announces this on stage playing my eye podcast where I just

148
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.160
rail on the Mac. &lt;laugh&gt; it's if you can take a look it's, it's pretty funny.

149
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.680
It's like, it's the one video that, that really legitimizes me, uh,

150
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.280
in the world of podcasting. Thank you, Steve. I really appreciate it. Oh yeah.

151
00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:55.800
You got, you gotta check this out. This is hilarious stuff for.

152
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.000
<v 2>Well, I, you could, you could try to sell podcasts,</v>

153
00:08:58.001 --> 00:09:00.200
but the whole phenomenon is so great. It's free. Okay.

154
00:09:00.201 --> 00:09:03.040
And I think what we're gonna see is an advertising supported model emerge just

155
00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:06.120
like free radio. Here's another Adam Curry is, uh,

156
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:08.680
one of the guys that invented podcasting and, uh,

157
00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:11.880

Watchs your daily source.

160

<v 3>Code show number one.</v>

161
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.990
<v 4>An 80 something remarkable is happening here.</v>

162
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.590
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers. Who've managed.

163
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.230
What you can hear since radio was invented,

164
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.030
it's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

165
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.380
<v 5>With $16 million worth of airplane, strapped my</v>

166
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.580
and the next generation radio content in my ears. We don't need no stinking.

167
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.300
I like to think I' flying into the future. You podcasting.

168
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:53.500
<v 3>It's Adam Curry. That's right. It's show number 180 and it's Friday everybody.</v>

169
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:58.290
Thank God. I've actually had to restart the show.

170
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.890
Three times. My Mac has been acting up like a and I dunno, what's going on.

171
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.050
I think it's, uh, something to do with, uh, the file system.

172
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.273
<v 2>Okay. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

173
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.650
<v 1>He knew exactly what he was doing, bro. I'm telling you,</v>

174
00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:15.930
he knew he knew exactly. Oh, he had to I' he a clip that he didn't know.

175
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.880
I love Kara Swisher. &lt;laugh&gt; with her mouth, just like what's happening.

176
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:23.840
That's hilarious. And then, um, he, he sent me an email later and he said,

177
00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:27.320
I'm gonna introduce you to, um, uh, some people in venture capital, uh,

178
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.600
Kleer Perkin, Sequoia capital, which I kind of took as the thank you. Um,

179
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.040
and I went on to raise, you know,

180
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.030
a lot of money from those companies to build my, uh, podcast network. What,

181
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.590
what was the first, like, what year was your first podcast?

182
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.310
The first one that you released? Well, so that was 2003, I guess, 2003. Wow.

183
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.150
So did what was going on before you, was there anything,

184
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.390
was there any other well, people have been putting, uh, well, we had real, uh,

185
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:55.350
video and real audio. If you remember, that was kind of like the low, low grade,

186
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.980
uh, streaming off. And, um, but this really made, um,

187
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.660
it did two things. I mean it solved the bandwidth problem for downloading.

188
00:11:04.661 --> 00:11:08.820
That was the first and now that's no longer an issue of course, but it, it, um,

189
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.820
put the subscription model into place mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and because, uh,

190
00:11:12.821 --> 00:11:17.180
neither I or Dave wineer have ever patented any of this. It's completely free.

191
00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:21.170
And, and so no one owns it. And that was, that was the mission.

192
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.490
I'm very proud of that. That's beautiful because you know, otherwise,

193
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.210
if someone like, you know, Spotify is now trying to buy podcasting, uh,

194
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.770
by buying up all these networks and they'll make it exclusive. And granted,

195
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.890
they're trying to switch from a music company to an audio company,

196
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.840
but ultimately look at all the applications that are out there that are really

197
00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:45.280
good. People love 'em, you know, the apple, uh, podcast app. I use overcast.

198
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.640
I like that a lot. There's, you know,

199
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:50.880
tons of different ones and it's all because there's an open standard that no one

200
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:54.200
can control and Silicon valley loves controlling. In fact,

201
00:11:54.201 --> 00:11:55.200
apple loves controlling.

202
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.360
This is one of the few things apple has done that isn't a walled garden,

203
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.320
locked into apple stuff. It's.

204
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.480
<v 0>Interesting cuz they're not even monetizing it. No.</v>

205
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.400
<v 1>Um, and you know, they, they,</v>

206
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:10.800
they have many different ways they could do stuff or they could help. But, um,

207
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.510
I don't know why I D why they're not, um.

208
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.870
<v 0>I think it's an oversight.</v>

209
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.390
I think they thought for the longest time that it was just this thing that

210
00:12:18.391 --> 00:12:22.150
people did, that was no big deal. And then it's become so enormous,

211
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.710
but they still have this Mo this model that they're operating under that it's

212
00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:27.350
just, they're just aggregating, could.

213
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.950
<v 1>Be. I mean, and what was interesting is when they started off,</v>

214
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:33.580
they immediately started to highlight, uh, NPR per programming,

215
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:37.460
which I'm not I'm, I'm, I'm grateful for I'm, uh,

216
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.780
w GB H in Boston, uh, did a lot with, uh, putting their first programs,

217
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.780
uh, making those available as podcast. Uh, but kind of the, um,

218
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.580
the beauty of the,

219
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:56.170
the amateurism of podcasting got down a little bit and it was all BBC NPR,

220
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.450
radio, PBS radio. Yeah.

221
00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.490
<v 0>Radiolab. How you doing?</v>

222
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.770
<v 1>Yeah. It's a little too much for me. The Radiolab.</v>

223
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.170
<v 0>I love Radiolab, but I, I know what you're saying. It's very produced.</v>

224
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.650
It's very like, people answer questions for the guest instead,

225
00:13:10.651 --> 00:13:13.610
like you they'll cut in. So what he said was this, and you're like,

226
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.400
why just let him say it right. Well,
