WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
<v 0>Right thing. Let's go back to that. Cause it that's all people don't.</v>

2
00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:04.680
We ne we glossed over it. I did.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.640
<v 1>A great segue there, man. You did first time I've ever doneeg&lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.400
<v 0>The 12 to six elbow strike. Was it? Because this is what I've always said.</v>

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.640
And I, I believe you're the one who told me this,

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.120
that when the commissions were talking about techniques,

7
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.910
they had seen like those karate guys and ESPN at one o'clock in the morning,

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.070
breaking bricks with their elbows. And they're like,

9
00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:28.590
there's no way you could allow that strike because that strike it's would be too

10
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:30.790
deadly. Was that what happened? Close. Close.

11
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.830
<v 1>The, when we talk about commissions, the, there was only a,</v>

12
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.950
a couple of commissions at the writing of the unified rules,

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.820
as far as when we came, you know, at a degree that was back in April of 2001.

14
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.700
All right. And New Jersey, I started talking about the UFC was not the first,

15
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.980
you know, uh, show in New Jersey to go there,

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.140
but New Jersey after they had the IFFC and then the UFC,

17
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:56.540
and then they had a couple other small shows,

18
00:00:56.541 --> 00:01:00.620
ring of fire starts to come in and everyone has their own rules.

19
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.130
The UFC had have their own rules. IFFC had their own rules ring.

20
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:05.130
A fire wants to do their own rules.

21
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.610
And New Jersey was that we can't have these people coming in and giving us what

22
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:12.090
their rules are. We, if they, if we're gonna do this as a sport,

23
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.330
we're gonna do this under our rules. And okay,

24
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.890
what we're gonna do is we're gonna bring people together to create those rules.

25
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:25.080
People that you know are ley, know what, who they really invited other than,

26
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:27.280
you know, I think you had the Mohegan son,

27
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.360
as far as the tribal commission come down, they were part of it.

28
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.600
New Jersey has a commission and you had mark Rattner on a conference call.

29
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.800
He was not there, but it was promoted this before.

30
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.520
<v 0>Rattner worked for the UFC. This is long before mark was working for the.</v>

31
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.790
<v 1>Nevada city, was working from the Nevada state athletic commission.</v>

32
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:44.830
He's the executive director.

33
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.030
And they bring in all of these promoters and the promoters were king of the

34
00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:53.590
cage. Terryreock you had Dana white lorenzofertita

35
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.430
John McCarthy, Joe Silva, and Jeff Blatnik from the UFC.

36
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.790
You had people from pride, Yuki condo, and, uh,

37
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.940
condo or ever in, uh hadeki. I can't remember his name. And you had Paul Smith.

38
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:09.940
You had a couple, but that was it. That was the people there.

39
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.860
And the people that were really talking the most were,

40
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.580
was me and a doctor named Dom Colletta from New Jersey.

41
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.220
He was brought in as the medical advisor for the state of New Jersey.

42
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.050
And when it to elbows, they, they, they tried to get rid of elbows.

43
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.130
That was their big thing. And I was,

44
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.930
I was sitting there trying to combat what they were saying,

45
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.570
because even in New Jersey, at the time they had mu tie.

46
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.970
And so they had elbows that were allowed in this form. I said, look it. And,

47
00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:43.970
and Jeff and I had put together a CD at the time, you know,

48
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:48.280
you had CDs with CD rom. Yeah, there you go, man. Make it on computer. And, uh,

49
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.040
it was cuz I knew they were gonna attack throws because that was what made Larry

50
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.920
hazard. You had TDO, Ortizs flat Evan Tanner.

51
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.760
And he picks him up in a body lock and he brings him down and he knocks him out

52
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.240
and Larry hazarder went like his heart started going. He's like, oh,

53
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.720
we don't like that. And so I knew they were gonna attack throws.

54
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.160
And so I took with Jeff put together all of these throws from the

55
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.440
1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Here's all your throws from Judah.

56
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.510
Here's all your throws from greeckle Roman re and God bless carrellin because he

57
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:25.830
picks people up and drives 'em on their head and it's legal. Okay.

58
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.150
And I had all these throws from freestyle wrestling. Greeckle Roman wrestling,

59
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.950
judo with all of these Olympic athletes,

60
00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:35.670
picking somebody up and them falling on their head, being tossed on their head.

61
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.380
And that's what saved the throws and were what we came up with was

62
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.010
look,

63
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.740
what we don't want is someone being able to control another human being and

64
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.700
purposely make a 10 spike out of them and try to drive them down onto the mat

65
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.780
on top of their head, a pile driver. Exactly.

66
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.300
So they like Bob SAP did to Arro in pride, in pride,

67
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.170
in different his neck up for a long time. Yes. And that's, you know,

68
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:05.170
maybe forever. That was what we were looking at.

69
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.650
And so that's how we came up with, you know, no spiking and spiking.

70
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.170
I knew what it was because I worked out the language there cuz I was sitting

71
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:16.130
there saying, well, hold on, time out. You want to, you want,

72
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.650
I'm the one that's gotta come up and say, this is legal. This is not.

73
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.160
So we do this. If someone takes and you know, a guy shoots a lazy double,

74
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.600
he sh brings his head to the center,

75
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.960
picks him up his legs either go straight up or you know,

76
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:32.280
his legs are out like this and you purposely hold him there and try to drive him

77
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.440
straight down. That's a spike. That's illegal.

78
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.280
If I take and I pick you up as a splex and I bring you up over the top,

79
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.550
I can bring you as long as there is an arc to it.

80
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.590
Any arc makes the throw legal.

81
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.830
So rampage Jackson picks up Ryan Bader and spins him and brings him

82
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:51.710
down straight on his head,

83
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.710
legal and it makes it quick and easy for me as the referee, I see the arc,

84
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.733
it's legal.

85
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.470
I don't see an arc and I see him holding him and bring him straight down.

86
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.260
Now I know it's illegal.

87
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.060
And so I was trying to make things as easy as I could when it came to the

88
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.900
elbows, what they were trying to do was take away all elbows. And I go, look it,

89
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:15.300
you have elbows in Mui tie elbows. Every time you take something away,

90
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.980
you are changing the sport and making it to where it's harder to actually

91
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:25.650
have act because you take away elbows. I grab wrist.

92
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.690
And if I'm good at grabbing wrist, I can hold wrists for a while. And,

93
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.370
and I can't do anything.

94
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:35.090
I've gotta pull my hand out where if you grab my wrist and I'm John Jones and I

95
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:37.530
take, and I roll that elbow over and boom, and bring it down,

96
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.050
you let go of my wrist because you're being attacked.

97
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.480
And so they looked at it and said, and the Tom Colletta being the doctor said,

98
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:50.440
he goes, look it, yeah, I understand what he's saying. And he said, I,

99
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.520
I have a problem with one.

100
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.720
And it came fromgan McGee versus a guy named Brad, Gabe, uh,

101
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.960
Brad Gabriel from the IFFC the very first show they had G McGee. You know,

102
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.160
you remember six foot 11, you know, at the time in this show, about 335 pounds.

103
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.360
And he's fighting a guy named Brad Gabriel, who's 6 1, 210, 215 pounds.

104
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.270
And G you know, Brad Gabriel is trying to get a hold of again, just to survive.

105
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.390
Andgan is taken his arm and he's boom, boom, boom.

106
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.550
And he's bringing it straight down on top of Brad Gabriel's head.

107
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.430
And then he gets his back and he does the same thing,

108
00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:31.110
like the old Brazilian style of bringing shots to the back of the head.

109
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.510
And he said, he goes, I I've, I can't have that. He said, I've seen,

110
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.260
I've seen the and break big blocks of ice like that. That's a dangerous elbow.

111
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.113
We can't have that.

112
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.780
And I started to combat it and lorenzofertita looks at me and he goes, John,

113
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.180
let it go. It's stupid. Wow. And I go, yes, sir. Boss.

114
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.260
And I backed away from it. And so that became, so that's the 12 to six elbow.

115
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:54.260
That's the 12 to six elbow.

116
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.130
And the whole thing with the whole positioning of it, 12 to six,

117
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.290
I came up with that there saying, all right, let me just make this clear this.

118
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:06.250
So we're saying that my hand comes straight up and straight down.

119
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.210
That's what's illegal. So 12 o'clock to six o'clock.

120
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:13.010
But if I'm inside control and I bring my arm like this, we're okay with it.

121
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.930
And they go, yes. And one to seven's. Okay. &lt;laugh&gt; one to 7, 11 30 to,

122
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.560
you know, all that stuff, sort of 1130 pushing it, you're pushing it. But,

123
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.520
and the, the problem was, see, I was there. I understood everything.

124
00:07:27.521 --> 00:07:31.080
And I came out and started teaching classes and stuff. And it,

125
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.480
if you listen to me, you knew what it was. But other than that, you're getting,

126
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.160
oh, there's a paper written.

127
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.510
And so you're reading the paper and it says no down elbow strikes and

128
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.870
that's not what the rule was. Right. So we had actually had, you know,

129
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:46.110
season two of the ultimate fighter,

130
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.270
Joe Stevenson is gonna end up he's in the semi-finals.

131
00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:51.310
I had done his earlier match. He had fought, uh,

132
00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:55.630
Marcus Davis and I'd went over the rules with him. And so, you know, when,

133
00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:58.550
when we talk about going over rules with fighters, there's a lot that I say,

134
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.100
you know, people think that, you know, you know, no, don't, don't pull hair.

135
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.300
Don't do the, you don't do that, but I'd gone over things.

136
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.420
And I explained to him, yes, he, cuz he asked me, he says in the guard,

137
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.540
can I do this elbow? Absolutely. From the guard,

138
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:13.860
you can do it from the guard because you're doing it from six to 12. Exactly.

139
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.340
Well, you're doing it. It's nine to three, three to nine,

140
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.890
whatever you're on your back. Right. And he goes,

141
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:25.610
and he's gonna fight in the semi-finals and he's got herb Dean is his referee.

142
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.530
And herb tells him, no, you can't do that. And he goes,

143
00:08:28.531 --> 00:08:31.370
butja McCarthy says I can do it. And he goes, no, you can't do that.

144
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.530
And so I got, well, and this is the problem with MMA as we have it.

145
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:39.530
Mm herb says, no, Joe comes out to me and he says, Hey,

146
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.760
you told me that I could do this. I said, absolutely. You can. And he goes,

147
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.000
herb Dean just said, I can't. I go, I'll take care of it.

148
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.800
And I go to herb and I said, Hey,

149
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.440
did you tell Joe Stevenson that he can't do this elbow strike? He goes, yeah.

150
00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:53.720
He goes, that's illegal. You can't do that. I go, Joe. I, I said, I, sorry,

151
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.720
herb. I go, what do you mean? It's illegal. I go, it's 12 to six.

152
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.880
I go, his hand's not coming straight up and straight down. And he goes, yeah,

153
00:09:01.881 --> 00:09:03.520
Johnny. He goes that's if the clock's on the wall,

154
00:09:03.521 --> 00:09:06.160
but if you're on your back and your clock's on the ceiling, he goes,

155
00:09:06.161 --> 00:09:10.360
that's 12 to six. Oh Jesus. Oh, this is what happens. And I, I looked at him.

156
00:09:10.361 --> 00:09:13.240
I said, her, when in the, have you ever seen a clock on a ceiling?

157
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.310
&lt;laugh&gt; and 's why I haven't, but it makes sense. And you have these officials,

158
00:09:18.311 --> 00:09:22.670
but it's not enhanced by gravity. Hello. But it's still it's even with.

159
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.790
<v 0>Gravity. Yeah. It doesn't make any sense matter.</v>

160
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.750
<v 1>Right now I can tell you why haven't even changed because of doctors and fear.</v>

161
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.790
The no one wants to be the one to change it. Look at,

162
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:34.510
look at all the controversy we had when we changed.

163
00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:36.820
Just the bit that we've changed so far. Right.

164
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.620
And that was one of the things we, we wanted to change. The hand touched.

165
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.860
We had it. Yeah. And I'll talk about that if you want. Yeah.

166
00:09:41.861 --> 00:09:46.220
But we had it in there and the doctors for the ABC said, Nope,

167
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.220
we don't want to touch that.

168
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.180
So right now they can tell you what was their rationale? Their rationalees,

169
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:54.380
they don't understand it. And they're afraid to say they are,

170
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:58.930
they look at the SP and they look at it from a different view than you and I,

171
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.370
as people that are a part of it. You and I as fans, any of that,

172
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.650
they look at it from, well, right now we've been doing this for,

173
00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:11.770
we'll say, 20 years, 15 years, wherever you're at,

174
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.850
how long they've been doing it.

175
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.480
And we haven't had a problem having that as being a legal, right.

176
00:10:16.481 --> 00:10:19.640
So as soon as we bring it into, okay, now it's legal.

177
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.400
And we have a fighter that supposedly gets hurt by it.

178
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:25.480
And now they come after us saying, well, before it was illegal,

179
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.280
you guys made it legal. That's why I got hurt.

180
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.760
And that's what they're trying to avoid. They don't,

181
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:32.920
they're looking at litigation and they're looking at saying, you know what,

182
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.760
why bring that in? There's no point. It's so frustrating.

183
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.550
<v 0>That's totally.</v>

184
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.030
<v 1>That's a very frustrating. But right now I will tell you,</v>

185
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.950
the university of Auburn is doing a study for us about

186
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.710
elbows and the power behind each different type that we're having them do,

187
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.550
being that one up and down. So I've already had,

188
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.590
I used to do things with sports science,

189
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.220
and they've already done that a test for me. So I know what it is. Right.

190
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.940
But we'll have a university having a test. And so now it's gonna come out.

191
00:11:03.941 --> 00:11:07.420
That elbow strikes that all these elbow strikes that are allowed are all much

192
00:11:07.421 --> 00:11:10.060
more powerful than that elbow strike. Well.

193
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.820
<v 0>Not only that, but, but forget about power because you know,</v>

194
00:11:13.821 --> 00:11:15.620
you could take whatever, you know,

195
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.450
dominant Cruzs most powerful technique and then use Francis and Ghana's Jack

196
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.050
&lt;laugh&gt;. So are we,

197
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.690
are we just saying that you can't have power cuz that doesn't make any sense at

198
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:26.630
all? Ex well.

199
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.370
<v 1>No, because see that's what the whole thing is with that elbow strike. Right?</v>

200
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.050
It's so powerful. But what about a kid? It's not exactly.

201
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.970
<v 0>It's nothing compared to a, like a wheel kick person, a back kick. I, I try.</v>

202
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.080
<v 1>To get people to understand, you know, being a hunter,</v>

203
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.880
you have an idea of ballistics. Okay. And it's like,

204
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.000
and people get in this whole thing about, you know,

205
00:11:47.001 --> 00:11:50.080
girls and guys and fighting and stuff. And I, and I try to tell 'em look it,

206
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.560
you cannot expect Demetrious Johnson to have the power

207
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.080
of a Francis nanono or steeping milchi okay.

208
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:02.400
Or steeping music or Daniel corme or let's go down lower. George St.

209
00:12:02.401 --> 00:12:05.640
Pierre giant heavy. He has 125 pounds.

210
00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:08.080
We'll say the night that he's fighting a hundred thirty five hundred thirty nine

211
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:12.790
pounds of weight right behind it. He is a 22 caliber. Right? Okay.

212
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:13.910
I'm not saying he can't hurt you,

213
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.030
but he's not gonna drop you because he just doesn't't have his size.

214
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.550
And you have certain genetics, not genetics,

215
00:12:22.551 --> 00:12:25.150
certain components that are coming into play because.

216
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.350
<v 0>Like the Joseph benavvita's fight, look at what Joseph was.</v>

217
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.830
<v 1>Doing for brings it in more power based upon movement of</v>

218
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.780
right. He can drop somebody precision timing, but he,

219
00:12:35.781 --> 00:12:39.780
he can drop somebody with a kick because there's more weight and more power

220
00:12:39.781 --> 00:12:41.700
behind it. He can drop somebody with a knee.

221
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.300
But when we look at lighter weight fighters, we're gonna get people,

222
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.700
human beings are put together, basically the same. Okay.

223
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:52.220
Obviously there's this guy can take a shot. This guy. Can't okay.

224
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.210
That's out there.

225
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.650
But if you're a fighter and you get used to accepting damage,

226
00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.890
accepting punishment,

227
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.970
you can accept a lot of things to a certain point where that person's

228
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.890
speed and power come together to create a velocity that will put anybody

229
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.023
out.

230
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:16.120
And that just comes with strength and weight and size because the

231
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:19.360
22 caliber bullet is not like the 45 caliber bullet. Yeah.

232
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.040
<v 0>And no matter who the athlete is,</v>

233
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.560
the downward elbow is not going to be the most powerful strike in their arsenal,

234
00:13:24.561 --> 00:13:29.520
unless there's just some downward El elbow wizard &lt;laugh&gt; and there might be

235
00:13:29.521 --> 00:13:33.200
a few of those guys out there. I mean it's and the, the tie world,

236
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.590
there might be some guy who does one of those Tomahawk elbows. Yeah.

237
00:13:36.591 --> 00:13:40.270
That just has a vicious one, but P for those guys,

238
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.430
for this few and far between. So tell.

239
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.230
<v 1>Me how that elbow is gonna be stronger than a guy with a rolling thunder kick</v>

240
00:13:46.231 --> 00:13:48.110
with his heel hitting somewhere on top. It's.

241
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.070
<v 0>Not gonna be, or it's in barbbos a wheel kick. Hello, yeahs.</v>
