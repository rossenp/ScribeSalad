00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.130
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.190
Now the blowback from this has been very intriguing, you know, as an outsider,

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.700
like looking at it for when I first heard about it, you know, I thought, well,

4
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:13.230
this mean angry, man.

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.190
Must've written some things saying that women's socket tech or they suck at

6
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:18.060
this. And you know,

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.720
and people are reacting to this blatant massage monistic tribe that

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.120
are ascribed that I, uh, was, was hearing about what, when I read it,

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.360
I was so confused. Cause I was like, where's the mean stuff?

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.490
Like where is this?

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.370
And you also think that the other thing that was really confusing was it,

12
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:39.030
some people were reprinting it without citations. Right.

13
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.570
Did that freak you out? Like when you were being misrepresented?

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.180
<v 1>Yeah. Especially when people would say, oh,</v>

15
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:48.090
it was so unscientific because it didn't have citation. Right.

16
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.530
And that was their entire argument.

17
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.380
<v 0>Who did it, who printed it without scientist citations.</v>

18
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.440
Cause some major publications, re-published it?

19
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.060
<v 1>Yeah. I think it was Gizmodo or motherboard or something. Why the.</v>

20
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.470
<v 0>Would they do that without citations? That seems so unreasonable.</v>

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.940
And so we're going to responsible.

22
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.630
<v 1>I think a lot of these companies just have certain narrative that they're trying</v>

23
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:13.680
to push. Yeah. And so like even, you know,

24
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:18.480
I've tried to talk to a lot of these reporters and I'll give hour long

25
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:20.340
interviews with some of them.

26
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.380
And at the end they'll just write the same sort of article of like,

27
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.000
oh yeah, he's just a massagist.

28
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.340
And so I think even if I can convince the individual journalists,

29
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.350
they are under pressure by their boss to

30
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.180
write a certain type of article.

31
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.230
<v 0>God, what a weird world we're in right now when it comes to that,</v>

32
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.470
because I was looking for something that could be,

33
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.430
could be like evidence of massage. The only thing that I could find,

34
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.220
and this is a very mild criticism, is that you were saying,

35
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.480
I believe used the term neurotic that women were more likely to be.

36
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.050
<v 1>Neurotic. Neuroticism. Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.820
<v 0>That's one where a lot of women go, well, this guy. That's it.</v>

38
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.630
That's all. I mean, but what did you base that on?

39
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.160
<v 1>There's the psychological big five personality traits</v>

40
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.100
and neuroticism is just one of them. Right.

41
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.270
But that's the actual term that they use and it's sort of unfortunate that

42
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.163
that's a term.

43
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.790
<v 0>Yeah. It's that one I feel like maybe could have danced around that.</v>

44
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.310
Yeah.

45
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.990
<v 1>That's it? I think it's just, I was too much into the,</v>

46
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.880
like I've seen the word so often that I didn't really associate it with neurotic

47
00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:43.870
and negative.

48
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.700
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I I've seen a bunch of your conversations.</v>

49
00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:53.050
I've listened to you talk to Ben Shapiro and a couple other folks. And uh,

50
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.820
you know, your thought process is very reasonable and very well sorted out.

51
00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:02.410
And another thing that I'm not hearing anybody is how you wrote a whole page and

52
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:06.880
a half describing all the different ways that

53
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:11.650
women could be more involved in tech or you can encourage more women to tackle

54
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.690
it. This is not the work of a massage therapist.

55
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.680
This is the work of someone who's carefully considering an issue and looking at

56
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:22.510
it from a very, what, what I felt like, um, and correct me if I'm wrong,

57
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.520
but that you felt frustrated that you were looking at something that

58
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:29.410
was, uh, that people,

59
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.710
the way they were approaching this was they weren't looking at it for what it

60
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:33.340
was.

61
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.960
They had kind of decided how they were going to describe it and

62
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.970
how they were going to deal with it.

63
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.290
And it wasn't really based on facts or reality and certainly not on science.

64
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.970
And you sort of felt frustrated by this and you decided to try to interject with

65
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:51.640
as much of the current science as you could,

66
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.550
that could possibly explain choices,

67
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.650
not why women are bad at it. Not why were they, why they shouldn't be in it,

68
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:00.730
which is what I kept reading.

69
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.710
But more that why women choose to go into certain professions?

70
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.300
What could be the impediment and what we could do to maybe encourage more women

71
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:15.250
to do it, instead of doing this sort of a blanket style

72
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:19.420
diversity where you just like, oh, we need two of these. And we do two of those.

73
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.260
Right. Which is what I, I seem to think that they were doing. Is that,

74
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.010
is that a good assessment? Yeah. By the way, this will never trend on YouTube.

75
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.550
We might get 5 million hits. It'll be, I mean, that's a real problem too.

76
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.360
Like there's a lot of censorship when it comes to these sort of conversations.

77
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:39.040
Like they would rather look at me who looks like a meat head and look at you and

78
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:42.310
go, oh, well, these guys are just talking about women for an hour.

79
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.650
You know what I mean? Right. I mean, do you feel that.

80
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.070
<v 1>Definitely. And I you'll be labeled alt-right now and.</v>

81
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.530
<v 0>I've already been labeled. All right.</v>

82
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.240
It doesn't matter how many left-wing positions I support. I look. All right.

83
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.730
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Which is obviously like sexist and.</v>

84
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.520
<v 0>Short misogynist, racist, all that stuff. Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.330
<v 1>Well, but I mean just labeling us because we're white men or something.</v>

86
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.730
It certainly will because that it's.

87
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.150
<v 0>Yeah. It's, it's prejudice. Yeah. I mean, I mean, it really is,</v>

88
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.170
but people don't mind prejudices in that regard, you know,

89
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.340
they only like they don't,

90
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.580
they have an issue with prejudices when it comes to what they feel like are

91
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:25.480
disenfranchised or marginalized people,

92
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.890
but white people them. You know, he can't, you know, that's the thought process,

93
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:32.260
right? You can't be racist towards white people. So like,

94
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.020
what are the most egregious things like one of the most ridiculous things they

95
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.020
were trying to push when you were at these classes or meetings.

96
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.400
<v 1>So, I mean,</v>

97
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.590
besides the fact of just certain things in our hiring process that

98
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:46.060
would favor certain people,

99
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.160
which would create negative stereotypes for people just in general.

100
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.600
So like I,

101
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.350
one thing about stereotypes that they don't realize is that people will

102
00:05:56.351 --> 00:06:00.200
automatically stereotypes no matter what, and it's based on their environment.

103
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:04.760
So, and we see this with affirmative action too, in academia,

104
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:09.530
where if you create a sort of situation where peop, uh,

105
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.310
portions of the population are performing differently,

106
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.700
then you'll automatically create the stereotype that, oh,

107
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.620
maybe all the Asians are smart and all of the other minorities aren't as

108
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:23.930
smart in this college, right?

109
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:27.410
Because you needed a 1600 to get in.

110
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.320
If you're Asian and you need lower otherwise.

111
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.980
And so you'll automatically create that stereotype.

112
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.290
And that's negative for everyone because, you know,

113
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:41.000
it creates this tension between the groups and they self-segregate because of

114
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:44.600
that. While if you just put everyone in the same level,

115
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.340
then they'll just intermingle and it'll be great. And so,

116
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.660
you know, that has its negative consequences and it may be illegal,

117
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.290
which is what I was trying to, uh, say in my document.

118
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.600
So that aspect, I think is bad, but then also, you know,

119
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:07.550
once you think that, oh, all of this is because of sexism.

120
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.350
And even though we can't really see overt signs of sexism, like, oh yeah,

121
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:14.060
you're a woman, therefore you're bad.

122
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.570
And no one is saying the sexist slurs or anything,

123
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.980
then it must be some low level bias that we all have.

124
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.390
And that's why they're pushing all this unconscious bias and microaggressions

125
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.770
and just increasing everyone's sensitivity to, oh,

126
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.300
you said something that could be interpreted in this one weird way.

127
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.910
And that might offend someone somewhere.

128
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.800
Therefore you should never say anything and it's really stifling.

129
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.850
<v 0>Well,</v>

130
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.710
I think we would all agree that we would all be better off if

131
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:51.980
we treated people nicer. You know, if we,

132
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.060
if we didn't have racism, if we didn't have sexism,

133
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:57.980
we just appreciated people for their qualities.

134
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.930
And just could be very objective about that. Um, but when you're,

135
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.100
I would imagine that when you're running a company as large as something like

136
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:11.330
Google, you kind of have to put fires out before you even see smoke. Right.

137
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.380
And like you,

138
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.940
the writings on the wall when it comes to criticism today and

139
00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:21.380
anything that, that people can point to when it, you know, when it's,

140
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.550
whether it's, um, a percentage of women, the percentage of minorities,

141
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.310
whatever it is, where that they feel like is off. I mean,

142
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:32.870
people will write articles about this. It can damage your stock profile. Right.

143
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:33.470
I mean, it can,

144
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.370
it can like companies can take a hit on the stock market because of an article

145
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:40.330
that someone could write about a lack of diversity. Like, oh geez.

146
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.800
They all lack of diversity. I th th that's a real issue.

147
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:43.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.930
And there've been reports of companies that'll have these diversity programs and

149
00:08:47.931 --> 00:08:52.550
then blackmail companies, if they don't take them. So say,

150
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.080
you know, they'll start complaining because you know,

151
00:08:55.081 --> 00:08:59.400
all of these companies are the same and that they have about 20 to 30% women.

152
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.280
So they could do the same attack against anyone.

153
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.640
And so they blackmail companies say, oh,

154
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.050
you need to do these, these certain programs. And if you don't,

155
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.050
then we'll start doing external pressure on you.

156
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.040
So who are the companies that are blackmailing them? Uh, yes. For the groups,

157
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.060
at least from what I've heard. And this is all second hand is, uh,

158
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.680
a lot of the programs that,

159
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.330
so they'll hire contractors to perform some of the diversity programs.
