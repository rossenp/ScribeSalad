<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.240
<v 2>Nobody know thought I was gonna lose, except for one guy,</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.160
one guy actually said I can beat him, but he didn't tell me.

4
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:14.400
He forgot to tell me &lt;laugh&gt; so I didn't take him for granted.

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.280
I took him for granted. And so I always went through routines, warming up,

6
00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:20.360
getting ready, mental.

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.070
We weigh in five hours before a match from then on you ate and drank a little

8
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:28.710
bit and then focus, focus, rest, focus, focus.

9
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.870
I was doing interviews with wide world sport,

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.270
right during the national finals. And I wasn't the talker.

11
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.660
Like I, I could talk pretty good now because I learned to talk.

12
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.700
But at that time off the mat, I couldn't talk to anybody.

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.700
And so when they put a mic in front of me and they wanted to know about,

14
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.660
Hey, can you just say this? Say, Hey, I'm Dan Gable.

15
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.460
<v 0>Come watch me next week on wide world of sport.</v>

16
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.650
As I finish my career, 180 2 and oh,

17
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.650
and I hadn't wrestled the match yet. And so I,

18
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.890
I was supposed to say that, but do you think I could say that? Hell no,

19
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.930
I couldn't say that I kept stutter not saying it. And they kept redoing it.

20
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:23.120
So finally, after about 15 takes, they wrote it a out on big cards.

21
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.360
And so I took about seven takes with that one.

22
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.480
I think I got it done in about 22 takes, but then I, when I got it done,

23
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:32.600
it wasn't good either. They just finally said, oh, that's good enough.

24
00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:36.320
Get outta here. So I turned I'm on deck,

25
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.480
I'm on deck. So they already went through the 1 18 1 26, 1 34, and I was 1 42,

26
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.870
you at that time. So 1 34 is just, uh, wrestling.

27
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.870
And I always warmed up for, you know, a good 45 minutes to an hour.

28
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.950
So I hit a quick, warm up and went out in that match. And I,

29
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.550
and I didn't realize there was gonna somebody that actually thought they could

30
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:02.790
beat me. &lt;laugh&gt; you know, and even though before I always did the routine,

31
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.080
I went through it,

32
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.460
but I'll tell you what you skip once you're vulnerable for only time in my life,

33
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.860
that within a minute into the match,

34
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.220
I could hear the crowd a minute into the match.

35
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.500
I could feel how I felt.

36
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.020
And I was feeling tired and weak. I mean,

37
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.730
I never knew how you felt in a rusty match until the match was over.

38
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.290
And once it was over. Yeah, sometimes I felt good,

39
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.930
but sometimes I felt weak and tired,

40
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.370
but I didn't show it because I didn't think about it. I didn't know it,

41
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.930
but the one time he didn't prepare and the guy thinking that he could go with

42
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:47.920
you. I, and he could, you know, you,

43
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.240
you, you take on everything. So you take on way more than just your opponent.

44
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.880
And so I talked myself into wrestling after minute one,

45
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.640
I kept saying, I gotta, I gotta keep going. I gotta keep working hard.

46
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.560
And so I got a early lead, just a quick first take down,

47
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.760
but I kept feeling how tired I was and I kept hearing the crowd.

48
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.840
Why do you think you were so tired? Cause I didn't warm up.

49
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.320
I was doing talking. I was not focusing on my match and had concent,

50
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.990
no warmup had that much of an effect on your conditioning. I used to be a,

51
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.310
a pretty well, even today, as you get older, you notice how,

52
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.710
if you don't warm up and you hit something really hard, you get,

53
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.750
you get exhausted. Now it's probably kind of like that. Uh,

54
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.980
usually what I did for warmups is probably with within a half hour of my

55
00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:43.620
match, I would get match heartbeat,

56
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.140
rate up and go for three or four minutes that way.

57
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.420
So not, no one get real tired,

58
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.260
but then after that you'd probably have a little drink and get ready to go.

59
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:58.220
What would you, what would you do for a warmup? You had a very specific routine,

60
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.130
pretty much, pretty much, um, you know,

61
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.970
stretching and jogging and then actually wrestling,

62
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.370
actually wrestling pretty hard and uh, to, to where you would actually sweating.

63
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:12.210
Good. And, and then, uh,

64
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.090
I actually got to the point where if I had a lot of time before my match,

65
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.120
I would actually go take another the shower. But usually when you're with the,

66
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.640
the fourth guy out or something, you just kind of stayed loose,

67
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.720
but you didn't really. And then right before your match again,

68
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:29.800
you might get your heart rate up again to, uh,

69
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.360
cuz your heart rate didn't really go down below a hundred probably and you

70
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.640
needed, and in a wrestling match, you was probably going up to 170, 180,

71
00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:39.120
you know, stuff like that. And,

72
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.190
but you wanted to have your heart were rate up to your ma that match pay heart

73
00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:45.750
rate for not seven or eight minutes, cuz that, you know,

74
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.830
you're gonna be not gonna recover quick enough. You still be tired.

75
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:49.664
You wanna be tired.

76
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.190
So you'd get it up there and spike it up and down for two or three minutes.

77
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.030
And it's hitting some really good execution of wrestling holds.

78
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.150
We do hand fighting a lot of hand fighting and that hand fighting can really,

79
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.340
uh, can get that heart rate up and pushing and shoving and hitting some, uh,

80
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.100
live techniques where the guy was letting you do it,

81
00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:11.780
but you're doing it at live pace. And you do some sprints and do some tumbling,

82
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.260
gymnastics tumbling, but in this match, no warm up at all.

83
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.540
When I got done with the 22nd take of the, of the, of the, of the, uh,

84
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.770
and I was the, I had that match to warm up. So I,

85
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.850
I probably had 10 minutes instead of, uh, my normal 45 minutes or so,

86
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.890
but I thought I was still ready and,

87
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.970
but it was something outta my control actually. And it took, took me over,

88
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.480
but I did talk my way into, uh, cuz I got I ahead.

89
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.560
But then I got real far behind.

90
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.480
I mean I was behind by six points and then I got ahead by

91
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.480
uh, two or three points and that was right towards the end of the match.

92
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.800
And then there was a flurry could have went either way,

93
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.800
but the referee went his way and that's the way it is. I mean,

94
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.920
it's just, it's just that's calls.

95
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.140
<v 1>Does that haunt you to this.</v>

96
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.360
<v 0>Day? Oh, of course it haunts me, but guess what?</v>

97
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.790
I needed that loss.

98
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.710
I really did that loss took me to unbelievable Heights that I

99
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:26.750
would've never had without that loss.

100
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.190
What's unbelievable is if you ask the guy that beat me, Larry Owings,

101
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.150
he said, if I had to do it over again,

102
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.950
I might have lost that match on purpose or not even on,

103
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.380
on purpose just because I didn't know how to handle it.

104
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.980
I wanted to be an Olympic champion. I wanted to be a world champion,

105
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.900
but when I won that match, there was so much hype.

106
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.740
I didn't know how to handle it.

107
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.780
He said even broke up my marriage &lt;laugh&gt; he was married.

108
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.780
I guess that's what he claimed.
