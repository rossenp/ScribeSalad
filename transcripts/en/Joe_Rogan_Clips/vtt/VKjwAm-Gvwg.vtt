00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.480
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now you get through this, right?</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.000
You write your book and you get in this,

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.360
this rowboat journey had the rowboat journey been done before.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.560
<v 1>So the rowboat before, um, there's a storied history of ocean rowing.</v>

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:20.160
So ocean rowing, um, you know, uh, sure. The Polynesians. Yeah. I mean,

6
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:24.870
it goes way back, but even at kind of as a sport, um, and, uh, you know,

7
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:27.550
maybe the polar community wants to do this more formally,

8
00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:30.350
but there's something called the ocean rowing society that has, you know,

9
00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:33.710
the records of different rows going back over time. Um,

10
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:37.070
there's this race across the Atlantic, um, that happens called the taser ocean,

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.540
uh, taser whiskey, ocean race, um, across the Atlantic from, um, from the,

12
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.380
or is it go from, from the Canary islands to the Caribbean, every, uh,

13
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:47.780
winter that happens. So ocean rowing, I mean, it's a subculture,

14
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.740
it's a small subculture. Don't get me wrong, but it happens. Like it's a thing,

15
00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:53.180
you know, there's, there's boats, there's races, there's competitions,

16
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:55.060
but has anybody gone to no one that path? Yeah.

17
00:00:55.061 --> 00:01:00.060
So Drake passage had never been rode fully and completely before there was

18
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.330
a guy. Um, who's legend as well. Um,

19
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.490
I wish I wish he was still alive. Cause I love to sit down more than anything.

20
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:10.730
This guy's name's N Gillette, um, a true, true like explor. I mean,

21
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:13.250
he actually got, um, killed, uh, in the late nineties,

22
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.610
I believe when he was climbing in the Himalayas or in Pakistan. Um, he got shot,

23
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770
um, by someone who came through the camp. I don't know the whole story.

24
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:21.730
It was super sad story, but he's done all of these projects, you know,

25
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:23.160
before or social media and stuff like this.

26
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:27.800
This guy was out there doing these badass things and he made this boat, uh,

27
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:32.320
called the sea tomato and he took it down to Chile, um, to try to kind of do a,

28
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:34.560
what was like kind of a hybrid row and sail.

29
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.960
And so he has a sailing mask on there. He's got,

30
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
or he's got four guys with them. They try it the first season.

31
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:43.190
They actually can't even launch their boat off of K KPOs.

32
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:44.310
They wait a whole other year.

33
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.350
And then the second year they launched a sea tomato, um, under sale. Why,

34
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.230
why do they have to wait a year? Because the weather, I mean,

35
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:54.590
Drake passage is we'll get to that, but it is gnarly, bro. Like, it is like,

36
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.670
I mean, people, you know, as you say, going around the horn,

37
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:57.710
people say that in sailing,

38
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:01.910
like Cape horn is known to just be like just treacherous, brutal water as the,

39
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.060
to these oceans kind of coal lie. And these huge standing waves come up.

40
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.980
So a whole season, they sat down there with the robot and didn't even launch it.

41
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:10.780
Then the next year came back, him and four guys, how.

42
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.900
<v 0>Smalls the window where you can make it across.</v>

43
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.980
<v 1>So, uh, basically the best time of year to do it would be December, January,</v>

44
00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:20.420
because that's the Southern hemisphere summer. Um,

45
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.700
and so the temperature's a little bit warmer. You've got longer days.

46
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.650
We purposefully, he did it over the, um, summer or the summer Solt.

47
00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:27.890
So December 21st, you know,

48
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:30.450
that'd be June 21st for us in the Northern hemisphere. Um,

49
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:33.250
the longest day of the year, we still had night, um, you know, few days,

50
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.010
a few hours of darkness every single night,

51
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:38.290
but we at least had the longer days because once it gets dark and there's waves

52
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:42.050
coming at you from every single direction, I mean, it is scary, man.

53
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.680
This is it, this a Drake passage,

54
00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:48.440
obviously I've seen from a bigger boat than mine, but you know, oh that.

55
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.560
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; can I see what it was like in your boat? Do you have a.</v>

56
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.200
<v 1>Video? You must video boat. If you pull up my that's insane.</v>

57
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.240
If you pull up my Instagram, uh, how many people die out there? I mean, it,

58
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.240
I don't know the numbers, but um,

59
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.720
well a plane crash happened the day we were leaving and 38 people died in a

60
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:08.640
plane crash in Drake passage, as we were about to depart on our it's a whole,

61
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:12.400
that's a whole other whole other crazy story. But, um, but you know,

62
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.000
there's definitely, there's shipwrecks out there.

63
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:17.120
There's boats that have gone down. There was a, a cruise ship.

64
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.710
I think that went down in the two thousands, um, in Drake passage,

65
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.390
in Drake passage. Yeah. And a cruise ship.

66
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.510
I hope I don't get that story completely wrong,

67
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:27.030
but I'm pretty sure a big boat went down I in the last 10 years or so,

68
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:29.310
what the is a cruise ship doing there? They go to Antarctica,

69
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.790
see that they do the, an, they go to the Penn Antarctica.

70
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.310
So actually there's quite a few, uh, cruise ships. Um, yeah, so here here's me.

71
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.180
Uh, oh, so it's actually fairly calm times. So I mean, some of the times,

72
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.780
if yeah, you got some swells, but I mean, you'll see this next part.

73
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.180
So this is me in the tiny little cabin. Um, I mean,

74
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.660
waves coming over the crashing, the, so where's the cabin and the,

75
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.460
the where closest to us. Yeah. Closest to us is the little cabin I was in.

76
00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:57.740
That was just one of us in there. And this is, uh,

77
00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:00.450
so this is us putting out something called the sea anchor. Um,

78
00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:03.570
that's when the waves got so big or the wind and swell was against us so much

79
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:04.570
that we couldn't row anymore.

80
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:06.690
And it's like throwing a parachute that basically like,

81
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:10.370
kind of tries to hold you in place. Um, I mean, you look at this coming up,

82
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.730
what is it? So it's like a huge parachute,

83
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.970
basically it's in the water and you put it in the water and it fills with water

84
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.410
and it holds the boat into place. I mean, not very well, even in this,

85
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.440
if we volume up, it's me basically, uh,

86
00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:24.760
talking about how we're getting pushed back in the wrong direction,

87
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.000
but we can't even, we don't have the strength to row against it anymore. Um,

88
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.320
just getting hammered. Um, but the, how far did it push you back?

89
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.320
I think that time it pushed us back like, uh, 15 or 20 miles. Um,

90
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.880
so you lose 15 or 20 miles of progress. Yeah. And that one,

91
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.710
that was the longest ya, I believe on it for 26 hours.

92
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.030
And so what happens is like you saw on the boat,

93
00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:46.630
there's three people rowing three people in the cabins, any given time.

94
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.710
And the cabins are tiny when you're even with the, you know,

95
00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:50.790
one person on one side, like I was two on the other side,

96
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:52.630
like you're like smashing there, like a sardine,

97
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.310
but then when you put the sea anchor out, no one's rowing anymore. And that,

98
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.190
you know, open decking, it's like really dangerous to just be sitting out there.

99
00:04:59.191 --> 00:05:02.500
So we all try to get in the cabins, but like this Iceland dude,

100
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.900
who's the captain fi Paul, I mean, he's like amazing row, you know, six foot,

101
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.980
two broad shoulders, whatever. All of a sudden,

102
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:11.940
the two of us are jammed inside of like the smallest Silicon compartments,

103
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:14.500
like two feet around three feet wide by three feet tall.

104
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.460
We're like spooning each other. We're wet. Whoa, we're cold.

105
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:20.660
We're in there for 26 hours that time. Like how did you guys poop?

106
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.850
So if you look that sweet, yeah. That this one shows kind of the wave,

107
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.130
the big swell, I'm the, I'm the one in the back there. And, uh,

108
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.330
I'm sitting right next to really fancy toilet,

109
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.650
a little something called a five gallon bucket. &lt;laugh&gt; oh, that,

110
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:38.850
who did you pooped in a bucket? Pooped in a bucket shot too fancy. Yeah. And,

111
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.640
uh, then, then the fish can snack on that, but you know, obviously get,

112
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.840
not only were we spooning under sea anchor smashing these little things then,

113
00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:46.840
and oftentimes those other,

114
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:49.160
the other guys in the other compartment were either three. Um,

115
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.200
three of them were inside the compartment at a time and one would be sitting

116
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.800
out, um, and taking shifts or they sometimes smash four in there. Um,

117
00:05:55.801 --> 00:05:58.680
but I mean, they're like literally on top of each other, so we got close,

118
00:05:58.681 --> 00:06:01.560
but then also, obviously there's no space on the deck. So it's like, Hey man,

119
00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.600
just turn your head away. I'm gonna be, you know, pooping a,

120
00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:06.200
basically a foot away from you while you row into this bucket. Like.

121
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.033
<v 0>Don't mind me,</v>

122
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.360
those mountain houses will create some horrible smells on your body.

123
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.760
&lt;laugh&gt; I've had those mountain houses while hunting.

124
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.110
They're rough &lt;laugh&gt; especially for me. Cause I don't need a lot of like,

125
00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:19.830
there's just, it's all like, you know, it tastes.

126
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.910
<v 1>Good though. They do tastes good. Yeah. Especially.</v>

127
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.510
<v 0>When you're in the middle of the ocean. I bet they're delicious.</v>

128
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.830
<v 1>I loved them. Yeah. Yeah. They're really good. That, that,</v>

129
00:06:25.831 --> 00:06:28.190
and the bars I was happy with with the eat was good, but uh.

130
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.750
<v 0>When you're halfway out, there was any point in time where you're like,</v>

131
00:06:30.751 --> 00:06:33.670
what the is wrong with me? Why am I doing this? Yes.

132
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.700
<v 1>100 Per set. So one of the things like, you know, people have asked me was,</v>

133
00:06:38.701 --> 00:06:41.660
you know, solar, Antarctica crossing harder in the row, whatever. And it's like,

134
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:42.341
they're very different.

135
00:06:42.341 --> 00:06:45.500
But one of the things that was so brutal about this Antarctica in the crossing

136
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.180
was, was a lot colder than the Drake passage row.

137
00:06:48.181 --> 00:06:49.740
It was about average temperature.

138
00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:52.740
When we were out there was probably like in low thirties, you know,

139
00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:57.460
dipped below a few times, but the ocean temperature, like I said, 32, you know,

140
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.370
33, you know,

141
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:00.930
just above freezing there's icebergs in the water and we're getting close to it

142
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.050
and you're just getting splashed the entire time. So from like minute, one hour,

143
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.130
one leaving Cape horn, we are soaking.

144
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.090
<v 0>Wet. And what kind of equipment are you wearing?</v>

145
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:14.370
Like what kind of gear are you wearing that keeps you from getting really.

146
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.840
<v 1>Cold? So we, we started out, um, in just this quart, X is a thick,</v>

147
00:07:18.841 --> 00:07:20.320
like sailing Goretex basically.

148
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.440
And that worked pretty well for the first few days,

149
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.240
but one of the other cool innovations, um,

150
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:28.600
that Fiat thought of having done so much ocean rowing is he was like, dude,

151
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.400
the only way this is gonna work is if we have some sort of dry suit is just too

152
00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:36.000
cold, but you start looking at dry suits and you're like, you could never row,

153
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.470
you can't be functional, like wearing like this like crazy, a dry suit. Right.

154
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.030
And so he basically says he, he spends the year.

155
00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:47.150
One of the things that he did is he found this like Polish manufacturer and we

156
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:48.950
all got our bodies measuring, you know, twentys five,

157
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.390
six different measurements and all this,

158
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:54.070
and basically created these custom dry suits that were a lot thinner than a

159
00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:56.070
typical dry suit, but kept us dry,

160
00:07:56.071 --> 00:07:58.350
but also allowed us to have the mobility on the OS.

161
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.340
And it was really built for the sitting position and the leg, you know,

162
00:08:01.341 --> 00:08:04.700
the leg press and the arm motion and all that of rowing. Um,

163
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:08.220
so it was awesome innovation. And we got just, I mean,

164
00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:12.500
thank God we have those cuz we were getting soaked. I mean, we were getting so,

165
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.140
so, so soaked out there and in the 90 minutes you would think like, oh,

166
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:18.620
in the 90 minutes, quote, unquote rest phase you would get in there, you know,

167
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.290
maybe change clothes or something like that. No, absolutely not like the,

168
00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:25.090
we had these suits on we're soaking wet, we'd get in the cabin.

169
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.010
We were all sharing like one sleeping bag.

170
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:29.170
Like I had just one sleeping bag that fi and I were alternating.

171
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.010
It's soaking wet after the first day. Yeah. There's just like,

172
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.930
it's basically like if I showed you what it looked like last day, you'd be like,

173
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.650
I wouldn't sit in there for one minute, let alone like try to sleep.

174
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.880
And there's like, no pillars like wa like the brown O on the bottom,

175
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:42.520
like inter just like, you know,

176
00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:45.440
it's the smells from us living in and out of there for this. I mean,

177
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.760
it was grimy and wet and cold, but these suits, um, suited us pretty well.

178
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.840
The one thing that was great, you know, obviously we were clipped in for safety.

179
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.400
So we were clipped into basically these ropes that you saw on the edge of there.

180
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:59.480
So if we were gonna get knocked off, um, the boat, hopefully we would, you know,

181
00:08:59.481 --> 00:09:02.120
be able to clipped in or the boat itself actually fully self. Right.

182
00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:05.280
So if it rolls over it, hypothetically rolls back over the top.

183
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:09.440
We had some close calls, but we never fully rolled it. Thank God. Um,

184
00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:12.920
but we did test that, but one of the things about the suits is the suits, um,

185
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.360
basically have like neoprene, boot,

186
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.510
it's all like one kind of one piece like you would have in a dry suit,

187
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.350
which was awesome for keeping us, you know, safe and dry.

188
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.830
But I didn't take the suit off for the last six or seven days at all.

189
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.110
And so when I finally took the suit off my feet,

190
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.350
like you think about your fingers getting like, pruny maybe like, you know,

191
00:09:32.351 --> 00:09:34.710
in a swimming pool for a couple hours or hot tub or something like that.

192
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:39.020
Like imagine, imagine seven days of wet and cold and sweat.

193
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.980
And like all the things like when I took the suit off,

194
00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:46.340
like I almost threw up on the ground cause it was just like gnarly festering

195
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.780
skin. And like, like skin was ripping off of my feet. Like it was nasty.

196
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.380
How long took you to recover from that? Um, uh, I don't know exactly.

197
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.770
It's hard to put the point on like, oh, I'm recovered,

198
00:09:57.771 --> 00:10:00.570
but definitely took a few weeks to just kind of get everything back, you know,

199
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:05.170
that's the stability back in the body mind and all of that. So, uh, yeah. Yeah,

200
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.130
it was, uh, it was interesting for sure.
