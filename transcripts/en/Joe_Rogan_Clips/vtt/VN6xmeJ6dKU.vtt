00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How are we friends again? Yeah. Okay, good.</v>

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.930
Good. Oh yeah. I forgot you. Drugged him. Forgot that,

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.080
dude. I'll tell you right now. Is your wife over it? No. No.

4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.860
<v 1>My kids aren't an overt either and that really broke my heart.</v>

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.230
She buy him stuff. You she'll buy him stuff. No, no, no.

6
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.220
Let it breathe until they, one day they find your funny and they're like.

7
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.740
<v 2>That might not happen. It might buy him stuff.</v>

8
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.130
<v 1>I told Joe in the green room, I decided to forgive Ari so that the people,</v>

9
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:39.020
I hate know how much I really hate them.

10
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.860
<v 2>I liked that. That was a good one. I like what you said, do stuff out of spite.</v>

11
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.110
No. Yeah, but it's like to let people know,

12
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.840
like this guy drugged me in front of my kids and I still forgive him.

13
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.470
And his house was a part that mattered.

14
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.010
<v 3>Don't listen to talk about it. Let's talk about it.</v>

15
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.850
<v 2>Yeah. I understand that.</v>

16
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.200
<v 1>I had to come to a moment.</v>

17
00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:01.250
I had a spiritual healer come to my house to do with your mind energy.

18
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:05.930
I talked to Tom about it. Um, and uh, she cleared the house,

19
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.470
our new house for all the tender bad energy. And then she said,

20
00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:12.560
I see some darkness in you. Oh boy. I told Joe about it.

21
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:17.510
I was dealing with darkness in my head about just OCD. And I went, all right.

22
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.190
What is it? And she picked you out in a heartbeat. And I went, I have not,

23
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.350
I haven't forgiven him podcast. No.

24
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.060
<v 4>I called you. And he's like, I'm over it. And then I'm like,</v>

25
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.520
you're still not over it. It wasn't even really spiritual.

26
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.380
<v 2>Healers. Listen to this podcast a lot.</v>

27
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.830
<v 4>So what, so what? She said, airy Shaffer. And he was like, yeah.</v>

28
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.540
<v 5>It's army ship here.</v>

29
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.380
<v 2>She said, do something to Bert Chrysler.</v>

30
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.130
<v 1>Okay. She said, it's it's if you,</v>

31
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.300
I I'm forgetting the exact words. I know. Cause I'm a little strokey. But uh,

32
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.940
but um, something about bringing Jay more up, it was about fuse.

33
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.650
I'm a up and deal with that tomorrow.

34
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.240
It was, uh,

35
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.310
it was, uh, if you, if you love him, you gotta fix,

36
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.230
help fix his karma, this bad karma for him. And I thought I do.

37
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.450
I, I can't, I can't write you off. I there's too.

38
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.140
<v 4>Thanks. Straight. Every time I was on a hike, I was like, my girlfriend's like,</v>

39
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.960
why am I my friend?

40
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.390
I'm still not friends with him and heart.

41
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.950
<v 1>It was, she said, if you, as he, you got to fix his karma.</v>

42
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.870
If you care about him. And I was like, I do,

43
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:31.520
I can't not have conversations with them.

44
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.090
Your conversations are too important to me seeing you in,

45
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.910
in New York when I go to New York and spending time with you was too important

46
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:41.640
to me. And I know you, I know you so well. And I know that you're you're.

47
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.370
I said to someone, I think I've maybe said to Tom, I said, he he's a great guy.

48
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:47.480
He's just a bad person.

49
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.220
And it's like, it's like, he's he didn't, he didn't. And it was like,

50
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.970
you didn't mean to, you never meant to hurt me at all. And I was like,

51
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.930
and I talked to Joe and Tom about this at nauseum. But I was like, I, I,

52
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.870
I can't, I can't, man. I'm not in a place to look for new friends. I got him.

53
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.020
He's one of my friends, the.

54
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.230
<v 2>Thing that's beautiful about this.</v>

55
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.700
We're here in 2019 in any other business,

56
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.980
if you drugged a Pete and you did so publicly and that it was

57
00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:24.150
discussed publicly, and yet you were on my podcast. Two weeks later,

58
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:28.860
we were howling about it. We got high.

59
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.970
We were smoking weed. And just laughing about the fact that you drugged him. It.

60
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.670
<v 4>Was hard because it was serious, but it's also super not serious.</v>

61
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.520
<v 2>We were having a good time talking about it.</v>

62
00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:42.090
And then we were also talking about how no one's kicked you out of the comedy.

63
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.880
It was never even a thought. There's no, not a second.

64
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.650
Like where you're not getting booked anywhere.

65
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.160
Not a second where you're you're ostracized. It's like,

66
00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:53.250
this is the last frontier for savages.

67
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.500
This is the last frontier for people that are doing wild, crazy, stupid.

68
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.440
And that is one of the wildest, craziest,

69
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:05.100
stupidest things you'd do is drug someone when they don't know your drug.

70
00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:09.480
And I mean, it's like a, it is the line stepping of all line stepping.

71
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.810
And we're like, ah, I talked to Joe lines, worked out,

72
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.680
Joey Diaz had the funniest take on it. Joey Diaz called me up and he goes,

73
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.630
listen to me, this Burton, Ari thing. He goes, all his family. He goes,

74
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.860
he's head. He's not going anywhere. We're not getting rid of him. I go,

75
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.250
we're not getting rid of him. And he goes, exactly. I go, I'm not saying we are.

76
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.320
He goes, I know you're not. I go, okay. And he goes, look, he up. I go, okay,

77
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.880
you up. I'm not saying anything like J Julie's like arguing calls you up.

78
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.320
He'll call you up arguing. Like, like he's arguing with somebody out away.

79
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.570
He what he's family. I definitely agree with you. I'm like, I'm not,

80
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.560
I'm not arguing you. Yeah.

81
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.640
<v 1>He called me like two days after he was like, I just answered the phone.</v>

82
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.410
He goes, you got to forgive him. And I didn't say a word. And I was like, I go,

83
00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:01.560
I'm going through some right now. [inaudible] go through your, Cox. Okay.

84
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.980
Do what you gotta do. You gotta forgive him. He's a good guy. You know that?

85
00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:05.460
You know.

86
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.290
<v 3>That now he's got a bit about it. Yeah. Now he's in New York. It was killer.</v>

87
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.680
It's.

88
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.660
<v 2>Killer. It's killer.</v>

89
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.730
<v 4>I, uh, I, I, uh, I thought we might, I thought I was like,</v>

90
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.170
oh, we're gonna do this podcast. And I was like,

91
00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:23.160
I thought we might talk about this. I kind of wrote down some feelings. Oh boy.

92
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.000
<v 1>You're lying right now. I'm not, no, he's not.</v>

93
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.420
<v 4>Also, well, some fruit in a felony. If you guys want some</v>

94
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.030
[inaudible].

95
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.580
<v 2>Don't tell anybody. Don't show the fruit. Okay. That's a lie.</v>

96
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.350
We're just joking folks. And the DEA agents or who would it be?

97
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.350
Oh. Agriculture. Yeah.

98
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.480
<v 6>Agricultural people. Um.</v>

99
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.870
<v 1>If you tell me they're all in Spanish, I'm going to jump.</v>

100
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.390
<v 2>Over this table. Wait and hope music. It's all in Spanish.</v>

101
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.560
Can you play this theme.

102
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.530
<v 4>Of the book? Oh, are you a Spanish? Sorry. Can you translate?</v>

103
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.003
<v 7>I got pee. Go ahead.</v>

104
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 4>Okay. Kay. Redrow Brent,</v>

105
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.173
my dearest.

106
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.540
Ma'am me.

107
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.430
And Portella let me start being [inaudible]. [inaudible]

108
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.440
can you just let him read what you wrote and translate it? Yeah, it's better.

109
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.780
If we can do that double space, misspelling it to see.

110
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.130
Oh, wow. What is it.

111
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.730
<v 8>Before? I just mentioned the birdie boy, world tour.</v>

112
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.420
All right, dear Brent. Uh.

113
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.010
<v 6>What's in our friendship is important. Um,</v>

114
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.680
friendship is more important.

115
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.860
Don't know that Tom

116
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.800
is, is occupied with the fried pizza.

117
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.600
<v 4>This is important to me as Thomas with deep fried pizza with deep fried pizza.</v>

118
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.463
Great.

119
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.010
<v 6>It's more important to me than fruit.</v>

120
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.430
<v 2>Don't show it on camera. That's a felony.</v>

121
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.020
<v 6>More important to me than, uh, Joe's, um,</v>

122
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.200
obsession with a killing.

123
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.760
<v 5>Animals, killing defenseless animals,</v>

124
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.250
beautiful animals in the woods.

125
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.660
<v 2>Or you up with those horns.</v>

126
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.830
<v 5>More. Alright, there you go. There you go.</v>

127
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:32.710
See if I can remember this.

128
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.310
<v 2>Let's speak from the heart. Okay. Just, just, just say it.</v>

129
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.100
You don't have to read it. Just tell him how you feel. Furniture.

130
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.440
<v 4>It was more important to me than anything. Even more important than</v>

131
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.750
is important. Tom is deep fried pizza, more important than Tom than

132
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.950
Joe is killing animals. More important than,

133
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.450
oh, this was some of this is really mean. Don't do that.

134
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.660
<v 2>Just tell him, just put that down and it's telling me, sorry,</v>

135
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.310
but I wrote some funny stuff. Oh, okay. Okay. Um, friendship.

136
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.850
<v 4>Is more important to me than like, than allies is a whole.</v>

137
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.520
Don't do this. Don't do this. I would not read that.

138
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.933
We're friends.

139
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.440
<v 3>We're your friends. We love you. We love you.</v>

140
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.710
<v 2>Look at the face of Brody. I wrote one.</v>

141
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.033
<v 4>Um,</v>

142
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.150
living without you will be worse than Tony Hinchcliffe living without the mural,

143
00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:41.890
above his bed of him blowing Joe Rogan as Jeff Ross pucks him in the.

144
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.560
I don't think he has that. He does have that.

145
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:48.100
I've seen in this apartment who painted it. So you read.

146
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.320
<v 1>This in Spanish and you pulled the plug.</v>

147
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.313
That's all it was coming up.

148
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.430
<v 8>Okay. Let me tell you the fallback.</v>

149
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.420
<v 4>Was going to happen. The point is all I wanted to do was I like playing pranks.</v>

150
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.240
I will give you what you said, Joe. It's just sticking the heart.

151
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.160
I like playing pranks. I like doing fun stuff.

152
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.700
And I thought the same thing I did with Louis Gomez, where I'm like,

153
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.370
he had this great announcement for skank Fest. And I was like,

154
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:17.040
I'm going to ruin that. And I'm going to do it by like promoting it.

155
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.230
And I thought, I'll give you what you love doing,

156
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.700
which is great content for your fans.

157
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:22.950
I know you're never going to leave set podcasts, but like never,

158
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.710
it was the best podcast,

159
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.590
top 20 podcasts of all time of any podcast. Yeah.

160
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.210
And I thought I'll give that to you. I'll have a fun time with my friend.

161
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.060
I didn't know all the fallback was going to happen. I know your friends,

162
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:38.820
your two kids were going to come home and say, you know,

163
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.470
I got raped that you got raped.

164
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.810
<v 8>By Ari, which I don't know why. Here's my Arnaud. Why do you wait for it?</v>

165
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.650
You have better stamina and strength than me.

166
00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:47.570
Why they wouldn't think that you would rate me?

167
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.990
<v 7>That's a good point. Kids are intuitive.</v>

168
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.820
<v 4>Maybe they saw something in you that I don't see a fanciness or something,</v>

169
00:09:55.821 --> 00:10:00.050
but I don't know. So this is go read it, go back to reading.

170
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.700
Why didn't I fun? I thought I have a prank that I'm like,

171
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.170
I'm I had thought the prank first, I'm going to dose somebody in a podcast.

172
00:10:14.171 --> 00:10:18.770
I'm gonna give them acid or Molly. And I was like, who can I do it to? You know,

173
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.460
I thought of Louis Gomez first, but I was like, he's an unknown. He's worthless.

174
00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:26.540
And I'm on our, I don't like him that much. And then I, yeah.

175
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.400
And then I thought it has to be a good friend.

176
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.270
You can't do it to an like a semi friend. It has to be someone who parties.

177
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.160
So it can't be these two faggots.

178
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.550
<v 8>It hit me the, the machine. I know.</v>

179
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.870
<v 4>The machine. So I was like, I will do that with Bert. That was my thought.</v>

180
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.300
And I know people are telling you that. I thought you a week.

181
00:10:50.301 --> 00:10:53.930
That's the furthest thing from the truth. I thought you were fun, but I,

182
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.570
if you forgiven me, but I won't do this. Sometimes.

183
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.220
<v 2>People do something and they just,</v>

184
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.050
they have it in their head that it's going to be okay.

185
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.900
And they don't understand how other people are going to perceive it.

186
00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:05.780
And it's not, it's not that they did it with bad intentions.

187
00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:08.360
It's just that they up. And I didn't want, I didn't.

188
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.020
<v 4>Think about like having to run interference with me. You can show your wife.</v>

189
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.883
It's like.

190
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.850
<v 1>I'll tell you right now. I had a hard enough time. The biggest thing that,</v>

191
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.880
that me up about it. Yeah.

192
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.400
The biggest thing was, was that amazing fruit?

193
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.280
Was that when it happened? Yeah.

194
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.010
I knew I was going to have to take care of you. Like I knew,

195
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.950
I knew that I knew that all the implications of what was about to trickle down,

196
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.670
and that was the one thing where I was like, why,

197
00:11:39.671 --> 00:11:41.570
why would you make my life more complicated?

198
00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:46.010
And I told you on the phone and by the way, no one said this other didn't me.

199
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.970
I said this to myself. And I've said this to Joe a million times is that,

200
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.070
that moniker of like, you think I'm weak.

201
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.880
It's my biggest thing of like people to go in my head. And I,

202
00:11:56.881 --> 00:12:00.160
I would go, I know Joe, doesn't say that, no, Tom doesn't say that.

203
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.590
And I know you don't say that, but in that moment, I was like,

204
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.460
is he doing what these enemies do to me? Where he just thinks, oh,

205
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.730
he's some weak comic disrupts his shirt on the advantage of your good nature.

206
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.890
Right. And, and that w and that was the thing.

207
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:14.170
And when you S when I was on the phone with you, I was in Connecticut.

208
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:18.400
I was with Shane in the car. And I told you that. And you said, oh my God,

209
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:20.770
I would never, I would never think because I share that with you.

210
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:22.690
Probably I'm sure I was share it publicly now.

211
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:27.670
But she had posted with you privately your response. I knew you didn't.

212
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.280
I knew that's why you didn't do that. And I was like, all right,

213
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.600
I can get past this, which was a big thing for me to go. I can get past this.

214
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.700
And then it took a little bit to just go still mad though. No,

215
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.200
I, a certain point, I thought it's just a reward. Like,

216
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.270
does Ari bring more to my life than that one stupid moment

217
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.070
right now? And I said, yeah, he does bring a lot to my life already.

218
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.740
You don't know that. I don't share that maybe enough with you,

219
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.300
but you bring on a lot to my life. And, and, and, uh, all you guys do. I mean,

220
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:05.470
you guys are, this, our friendship means a lot. It means a lot more to me.

221
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:06.780
Maybe that means to you guys. Sometimes it.

222
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.100
<v 2>Means a lot to me too, man, does, this is this podcast that we do,</v>

223
00:13:11.101 --> 00:13:14.640
these regular podcasts. We do some of my favorite. They're so fun.

224
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.310
<v 1>Yeah. The chat thread, dude, I'll tell you.</v>

225
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.830
<v 2>Text threads. It's awesome. Great. Oh my God. Don't eat that.</v>

226
00:13:22.831 --> 00:13:26.120
It's illegal. The agriculture is going to come here. They have a helicopter.

227
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.060
<v 1>But yeah. Um, and, and I mean, if we're being set on the other.</v>

228
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.830
<v 3>Word, both, you're like Donnie helicopter here, agriculture</v>

229
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.180
it's contagious. Both.

230
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.790
<v 1>Of these guys were, I don't know how I have to share this.</v>

231
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.080
Both of these guys were very,

232
00:13:43.081 --> 00:13:46.800
very valuable to me in that moment where I was super vulnerable.

233
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.800
Both of them had a moment where it was fun.

234
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.350
And then a moment where they called me and they were concerned.

235
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.600
<v 2>Yeah. When, when you told me during the podcast, when we first did the podcast,</v>

236
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.030
I'm like, what happened to it? Oh, just wait. Like,

237
00:14:00.031 --> 00:14:03.090
you didn't even want to talk about it until that's when I knew it was serious.

238
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.970
<v 4>I still don't know. It was fun until it was like, and then Tom's like,</v>

239
00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:08.730
what the is wrong with you? It's like, and I was like, wait, is this, there is.

240
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.570
<v 2>No other business. If you were working in HR at a,</v>

241
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:20.040
at a network and you guys went on the Christmas party and he drugged somebody,

242
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.010
that's the end of your career, man, free.

243
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.710
<v 6>Drugs, free drugs, free drugs to someone. Yeah. But they didn't. But yeah, yeah,</v>

244
00:14:27.711 --> 00:14:30.330
yeah, yeah. It would be, I knew he was really upset about it too. You know?

245
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.680
And yeah. When.

246
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.630
<v 4>You told me afterwards, you're like, oh, he's really up. But I.</v>

247
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.770
<v 6>Also wanted really badly for you guys to make up. Yeah. I spoke.</v>

248
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.840
<v 3>To both everyone. Both of you, both you guys did.</v>

249
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.680
<v 4>Yeah. Tom called me and he was like, Hey, I saw you. I called you every day.</v>

250
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:48.090
Trying to like, you call me every day. Everyone take my call. And Tom was like,

251
00:14:48.091 --> 00:14:48.924
Hey, I saw you call him.

252
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.520
<v 1>I just knew that it was wrong.</v>

253
00:14:50.521 --> 00:14:52.550
It was wrong for me to answer because I didn't know what to say to you.

254
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:56.690
And I was, and I was, I wasn't right in the head yet. And I was like,

255
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.960
I was like, I'm not, I'm really angry, but I'm not mad at like mad at him.

256
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:03.530
Does that make sense? Yes. And I was like, I feel victimized by no,

257
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:05.480
I'm not a victim. I know that this is going to be fun.

258
00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.960
I call Whitney and I talked to Whitney about it. Like, how did she say,

259
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.750
you know, call the police? No, no, no. We were, we were in the green, in the.

260
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.060
<v 4>A felony. I'm like, you think I'm the only felony. You have to have a committed,</v>

261
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.150
oh, hello. Hey, put that down. Don't film it. We.

262
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.200
<v 1>Were in the backstage at the comedy store or in the back bar.</v>

263
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.650
And we saw David spade and Whitney.

264
00:15:26.651 --> 00:15:30.190
And I told him when I was on high on Molly and I was having a great,

265
00:15:30.191 --> 00:15:31.630
it was probably, it was, I was having a blast.

266
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.860
<v 4>David spade there. And you're like, oh, I've got a great story for David spade.</v>

267
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.410
I've always been sexually attracted to him. And this is my moment.

268
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.720
Whenever David spade.

269
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.990
<v 1>I can hear you say that. Now, when I heard you say on the podcast,</v>

270
00:15:43.991 --> 00:15:48.550
I got mad at you. I was like, I was like, ah, it's so up, man. It's so up.

271
00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:51.370
There's so many complex moments in this where you're right.

272
00:15:51.371 --> 00:15:53.980
You're totally right. David spade was back there and me and you were back there.

273
00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:55.090
And I was like, I got drunk by Molly.

274
00:15:55.091 --> 00:15:58.330
And then he brought it up on his show and he's like, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

275
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.750
And even the podcast, I was like, I was conflicting. So I go,

276
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.600
this is super compelling content.

277
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.160
<v 8>But you said, I'm so mad at you for doing this, but I see it now.</v>

278
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.430
This is the best podcast. But I was like, uh, and.

279
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.800
<v 1>In, in retrospect I was like, I can't release it.</v>

280
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.980
I don't want to be the guy that people come on my show and they go,

281
00:16:17.981 --> 00:16:22.240
I'm going to drug him in that time. Only thing. But, but, uh,

282
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:24.760
I talked to Whitney and Whitney was like, Whitney.

283
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.750
Oddly enough said exactly what Joe said and said, this is really,

284
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.240
it's not right, man. It's not right.

285
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:35.020
It's you shouldn't be drugging people in front of their kids. She was like,

286
00:16:35.021 --> 00:16:35.950
I'm sorry, I didn't say that.

287
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.250
I didn't say that to you in the green and the thing, I didn't know how you felt.

288
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.670
And that's how Joe felt. That's also a Tom felt is that like, I didn't,

289
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.040
I didn't know how I felt. So I brought all these energies of like,

290
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.580
I got drugged and then everything's on the table and everyone's like, oh,

291
00:16:48.581 --> 00:16:52.060
I got to figure out your emotions. And I hadn't figured them out yet.

292
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.180
I gotta be honest with you, man.

293
00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.100
When you lean on friends and you come out of a place like that and you go in a

294
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:01.060
weird way, I was like,

295
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:06.100
I F I feel a lot closer to the four of us after that. And I'm like.

296
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.280
<v 2>I'm definitely not glamorous. He dragged us all together.</v>

297
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.800
He brought us closer to the metaphorical wet. Yeah. And the funny.

298
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.820
<v 1>Part is I was like, I was like, he wanted to kill sober October,</v>

299
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.040
but now he's got to do it for the rest of his life. Cause he, he didn't win.

300
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.800
We're always going to do so Rocktober.

301
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.160
<v 3>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Every year, every.</v>

302
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.390
<v 2>Year, how you dragged them in front of his drug? Me in front of my children.</v>

303
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:34.810
First.

304
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.890
<v 8>Of all, what truck it's MTMA it's used. So roofie.</v>

305
00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.210
<v 2>Up his brain for like weeks. Yeah. I'm still doing the deal with those CDs.</v>

306
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:46.850
[inaudible].

307
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:47.470
<v 8>I rolled him.</v>

308
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.160
<v 6>And I think you could do this. Right? You could chloroform it.</v>

309
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.920
That would be a fun. Get that online. That's a drugging.

310
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.530
That would be that's a drug. That would be a good one. Don't do that.

311
00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:01.380
<v 4>Anyone at home doing MTMA um, is it, your friend is five HDP.</v>

312
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.251
I told Burt,

313
00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:06.780
but he was not in a place where he's going to trust.com that has five-ish

314
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:09.180
dipping in it. Five-inch DP will equalize your mood.

315
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.450
And I meant to bring it with me and I didn't and I up hard.

316
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.550
I pride myself on the dosing people the right.

317
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.200
<v 0>Way. And um.</v>

318
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.910
<v 8>I, you learned nothing. It's like pockets.</v>

319
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.240
<v 4>I remember this day, I was like, I was we're feeling like really good.</v>

320
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.300
We're feeling really good. I did feel really good during the day.

321
00:18:26.301 --> 00:18:29.510
It was a fun time. We were watching sunny sunset over.

322
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.950
<v 1>Here. Joey tells his head.</v>

323
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.600
There's nothing more beautiful in on my deathbed. When you get that six,

324
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.400
seven seconds of memories of your life.

325
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.960
I hope I see Joey Diaz like Jesus Christ, like Buddha, just going listen,

326
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.470
Cox Shaka. If you would have had a stroke, it would already happened.

327
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:46.820
You're going to be fine.
