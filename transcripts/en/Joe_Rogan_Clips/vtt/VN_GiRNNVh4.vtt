1
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.150
<v 1>That's something. Get,</v>

2
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.720
get yourself to a physical therapist And get an MRI and then spinal

3
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:46.550
decompression, the whole deal you can science-based absolutely. He goes,

4
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.060
what do you think about chiropractors? And I go, so I say,

5
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.190
I think chiropractors are. And then, uh, he goes really? I go, yeah, I go,

6
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:58.040
I've just had bad experiences with it.

7
00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:59.660
And then I've read some things about it being.

8
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.860
And then I got home after the podcast and I smoked a joint.

9
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.880
And a lot of times when I smoked pot, I feel bad about some of the things

10
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.920
I rarely do. Do you it's I, I, I smoke more than the average scientist.

11
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.180
My boyfriend is a director of R and D at a pot.

12
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.020
<v 2>Lab. Oh yeah. So there's, there, there is some.</v>

13
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.570
<v 1>Pot kicking around on a regular basis.</v>

14
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.640
<v 0>Well, we get it free from a bunch of people.</v>

15
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:28.730
I have to tell people it shows I'm no disrespect to people that offer it to me.

16
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:31.490
I'm like, please don't give me any pot. I can't take your pot.

17
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.290
I have too much pot w wait, we have a similar problem. Um,

18
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:39.710
so anyway, I smoked the pot and then I go, God, maybe I'm a Dick.

19
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.300
Maybe that was rude Saint.

20
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.730
Cause I know people that are chiropractors and I know they're nice people.

21
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:46.250
And I know they mean well, and I'm like, okay, maybe I'm a Dick.

22
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.700
I think that's accurate. I think they mean, well, some of them sure. Yeah,

23
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.360
I think they're wrong. But they mean, well, so, um, I go,

24
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.620
maybe I was being a Dick.

25
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.540
So then I Google chiropractic and then I started reading

26
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.400
and I spend hours and hours reading about the history of CA

27
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.600
I'm going to say this in air, big air quotes, chiropractic meds.

28
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.353
<v 3>Holy.</v>

29
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.000
<v 0>Not only do I and not feel bad now, now I'm angry at all it,</v>

30
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.710
and this is to all you people.

31
00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:23.360
And I've got a and messages from chiropractors that I'm sure nice

32
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:26.720
folks. And they're really upset because they liked this podcast.

33
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.780
And they're like, you know, you're, you're on my business. And you said,

34
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.790
you have to understand. I it's, I'm sure a lot of you are mean, well,

35
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.140
I'm sure a lot of you do well,

36
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:38.720
I'm sure a lot of you try really hard to help your patients. And I'm,

37
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.720
I'm sure a lot of you incorporate a lot of other stuff like massage

38
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.140
and cold laser and real science into your therapies.

39
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.320
But the original, the origin,

40
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.210
the original guy who created chiropractic medicine was a complete

41
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.400
total artist just right here. This,

42
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:01.330
this character.

43
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 1>Daniel David Palmer. So it.</v>

44
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.630
<v 0>Started as a magnetic healer in Davenport, Iowa.</v>

45
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.910
I mean the whole thing is a hundred percent and horseshit. And I mean, we.

46
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.850
<v 1>This article that we wrote, we sent this through a, I mean,</v>

47
00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:16.800
normally my articles, they go through at least, you know,

48
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:20.220
two editors give or take this one we put through, I believe three editors,

49
00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:23.790
a fact checker and our lawyer to make sure that we were Bulletproof on it

50
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.740
because we wanted to make sure that we, you know, that,

51
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.010
that we didn't say anything that could get us sued. Uh, basically.

52
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.280
And a lot of the information from this came directly from his book,

53
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:36.450
from his own books. So we weren't taking anything out of context.

54
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.450
One of the quotes on how chiropractic started,

55
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.580
came directly from the book and he, after, um, after cracking, uh,

56
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.100
a half deaf person's or a deaf person's phone.

57
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.760
<v 0>That was the, that was what Jamie just had pulled up in that article.</v>

58
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.350
Pull it back up, Jamie. So you could see that. Yeah.

59
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.270
<v 1>He claimed that he cracked a deaf person's back and restored his healing or his</v>

60
00:03:57.271 --> 00:04:00.630
hearing. Now a couple of things could have happened here. Either one,

61
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:04.620
there was no actual medical consent given because this person was deaf. Uh,

62
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:08.640
so I'm not sure how, uh, how that came about, uh, two,

63
00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:11.760
he didn't actually restore the hearing because there are no nerves in the spine

64
00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:16.290
connected to your hearing, uh, or, you know, three, this guy is just lying.

65
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:19.200
Like there's, there are a couple, you know, and we're not sure what happened,

66
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.540
but he, like, there are still, and, you know,

67
00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:23.490
chiropractic could have done a few things with this.

68
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.620
They could have disavowed what happened and said, you know,

69
00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:29.220
we still have a system by which we can really try to relieve pain through spinal

70
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:32.670
manipulation, but no, there are still articles out today, uh,

71
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.690
from chiropractors today that try to claim that yes, indeed.

72
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.180
He did restore hearing because I'm mostly like, no,

73
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:42.120
could you guys just maybe back down on some of the nut of your claims,

74
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.740
because there, there is some,

75
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.730
some minor evidence that you can relieve back pain,

76
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.570
lower back pain with spinal manipulation. And there are, there are, uh,

77
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.850
chiros that are trying to be science-based with this,

78
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.530
but the history of it is so ridiculous and they try to back down on nothing and

79
00:04:58.531 --> 00:04:59.670
that's not how science works.

80
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:03.900
Science works with the newest evidence and it tries to figure out what's real

81
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:08.190
and what's not. And they try to double down on all the craziest stuff.

82
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.030
And I think there are Kairos that are trying to fix the field maybe and say,

83
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:15.120
you know, spinal manipulation can help with back pain,

84
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.710
but that's not what this claims.

85
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:18.990
It claims that you can fix everything in the body,

86
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.860
through these vertebral subluxations that have never been shown what is a

87
00:05:22.861 --> 00:05:25.740
subluxation? So there are a couple there's,

88
00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:29.340
there are two terms being used here and chiropractic uses it incorrectly.

89
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:32.630
And in medicine we use it correctly. So a subluxation, the,

90
00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:35.910
the actual medical term means that a joint pops out halfway.

91
00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:38.970
So you have a dislocation, which is a complete, uh, you know,

92
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:43.320
separation of a joint basically. And a subluxation is a partial dislocation.

93
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.770
I know because they happen to my shoulder. There they're a fun party trick.

94
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.570
I'll spare you. Uh, but a subluxation in the chiropractic sense,

95
00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:54.090
they use this medical term kind of incorrectly.

96
00:05:54.091 --> 00:05:57.920
They say that your spine can be somewhat out of joint basically.

97
00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:00.290
And it causes all your health problems.

98
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:03.530
Like your pancreas is malfunctioning because your spine is out of alignment and

99
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:05.600
it's, that's never been proven to happen.

100
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:10.340
And they claim that they can put you into a state of health by massaging your

101
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.240
back.

102
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.940
<v 0>Right? And here's, what's important about this.</v>

103
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.290
This was created out of thin air by a guy who was a quack.

104
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.580
The origin is not based on years and years of medical

105
00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:25.480
research. None of this, all of this came from the 18 hundreds,

106
00:06:25.481 --> 00:06:27.790
from a guy who was completely full of. Yep.

107
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.790
<v 1>And he was, he was a magnetic healer now magnetic healing.</v>

108
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.040
Like you can still see at the store,

109
00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:36.070
these little like knee braces that have magnets in it, guys, save your money,

110
00:06:36.071 --> 00:06:38.380
just get a regular old knee brace. If you feel any,

111
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.190
any relief from one of those magnetic braces, it's just from the brace.

112
00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:47.170
It's not the magnets. Yeah, exactly. Placebo effects are. I mean,

113
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.060
the, the placebo effect is a real thing. You can get some relief from that, but.

114
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.590
<v 0>Which may also account for some of the pain relief from chiropractic medicine.</v>

115
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.510
<v 1>Absolutely. I mean, they're doing exactly like they're,</v>

116
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.610
they're doing some massage along with what they're doing.

117
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.160
<v 0>And some of them, because massage actually helps.</v>

118
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.970
<v 1>And there,</v>

119
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.530
there are studies that show people who go to a massage therapist or a massage

120
00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:12.790
practitioner tend to get more relief than people who go to, uh,

121
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.230
to a chiropractor. So please go to a massage therapist, go to a, uh,

122
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.120
to a physical therapist. Those are,

123
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.270
those are your science-based practitioners chiropractic.

124
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.510
It started out of and it stayed directly in.

125
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.810
<v 0>Like there's no reason that anybody would have from this</v>

126
00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:35.000
guy, from this one original guy who created it, this guy who,

127
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.070
a magnetic healer who came up with this somehow or another it's slipped through

128
00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:41.770
the cracks. I mean, that's what this is. I mean,

129
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.610
they're running around calling themselves doctors. So this guy said to me,

130
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:49.630
one of these guys who got angry at me, I've gotten at least two dozen,

131
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:53.290
maybe angry messages from chiropractors. But one of them, the guy said,

132
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.970
does a podiatrist go to medical school? Well, the they go to podiatry school.

133
00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:58.930
Not only that they take,

134
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.070
they have a medical residency that they have to do for three years. They D they,

135
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.810
they actually go to a hospital to work in a hospital and they put dietary

136
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.350
is like an actual science of studying the foot.

137
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.570
<v 1>And some of them are, I could be wrong on this.</v>

138
00:08:13.571 --> 00:08:15.220
Someone go ahead and please fact check me.

139
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:17.350
I believe some of them are pediatric surgeons.

140
00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:20.770
Like they have to know all the anatomy of the feet in order to treat actual foot

141
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:24.670
conditions. They are like, these are part of the medical system, uh,

142
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.090
chiropractic works kind of separately and on theories that, uh,

143
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:32.050
that have never been proven to work. They can't even do imaging like half.

144
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.770
I believe something like half of chiropractic clinics don't even have x-rays.

145
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.970
So how can they show you a hundred percent for sure that what they're claiming

146
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:43.060
is happening in your back isn't happening. And I read, I mean,

147
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.870
these are statistics that I found straight from chiropractic websites from their

148
00:08:46.871 --> 00:08:50.920
organizations. Um, and I, I had this, uh, referenced in the article.

149
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:52.900
I just am blanking on which place had this,

150
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:56.370
one of the chiropractic boards that does large-scale surveys, you know,

151
00:08:56.371 --> 00:09:00.240
within chiropractic, uh, about half. There were a lot of places.

152
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.760
A lot of people I'm sure said to you, but my chiropractor is good.

153
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:05.910
My chiropractor doesn't do the stuff. And a lot of my friends said that too.

154
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:07.290
They said, no, they just crack my back.

155
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:09.390
They don't try to sell me any supplements.

156
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.530
About half of chiropractors do the stuff. They do the extra,

157
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.190
the extraneous wellness stuff. So when, if you have a 50,

158
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:21.990
if you're playing Russian roulette and you have a 50% chance of getting a, uh,

159
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.840
or getting a bullet, are you going to do that? No, like that's,

160
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:28.320
I don't want a 50% chance of having a doctor. Who's like, well,

161
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:31.470
maybe your cold's really a German. You know, maybe it's a Bulla.

162
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:35.280
I don't want the doctor. I want the guy who knows what he's talking about.

163
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.210
And this is what you're getting with chiropractic. You're getting a doctor.

164
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.470
And it's even.

165
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.990
<v 0>If you're doctor isn't,</v>

166
00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:44.300
this part of the problem is that they call themselves doctors.

167
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:49.550
I didn't know until this year or until when I was checking in on this,

168
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.180
they don't go.

169
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.360
<v 1>To medical school. No, they go to co chiropractic schools. Now,</v>

170
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.320
one of the biggest chiropractic schools in the country is a Palmer chiropractic

171
00:09:57.321 --> 00:10:00.980
college. And that's named for DD Palmer, the guy who launched,

172
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.860
launched this bevy of on us. And he.

173
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.240
<v 0>And after that guy, then the guy who claimed to heal the deaf guy, one.</v>

174
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.340
<v 1>Of one of my, now this is crazy. So it worked.</v>

175
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.040
This is going to be a fun story by fun. I mean, horrifying.

176
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:15.470
One of the guys I went to undergrad with, uh,

177
00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:18.260
went to Palmer chiropractic college. Now the acceptance rate,

178
00:10:18.261 --> 00:10:22.910
a hundred percent tuition, $34,000 a year to learn how to crack baby spines.

179
00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:24.110
Now the guy I went to college.

180
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.620
<v 0>With, you said, baby's fine. Some people do it. Some.</v>

181
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.980
<v 1>Do. Now it is a growing field in chiropractic.</v>

182
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.870
<v 0>This one guy said, this is hilarious. He said,</v>

183
00:10:32.871 --> 00:10:37.370
you're saying they crack baby spots. It's a gentle manipulation. Like why? Yeah.

184
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.150
Here's the thing. Why, why the are you manipulating babies?

185
00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:43.520
There's no evidence whatsoever that that helps babies.

186
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.680
The babies aren't complaining about back pain.

187
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.060
<v 1>Here are the two things that I've heard. One is, uh, is that it's so gentle.</v>

188
00:10:50.061 --> 00:10:54.170
It wouldn't even bruise it tomato skin, then why are you doing it? Why now?

189
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.890
The other thing they say is because they can pay, they can charge parents.

190
00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:01.550
That's why the other thing they say is, well from doing that, you, because,

191
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.540
and this is this, Hmm, this infuriates me so much. Um,

192
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.680
they say from manipulating the spine, because the spine has, you know, in,

193
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.090
within those bones,

194
00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:14.960
they had the spinal column and the nerves control everything in the body.

195
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.850
And so from, from simulator, stimulating the nerves, you can give the infant,

196
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:24.140
all the immunity, it needs to not need their vaccinations.

197
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.610
And that's when I get really, oh yeah, they claim this. Hold on. Who's who's.

198
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.320
<v 0>You got to say, be real specific.</v>

199
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.370
He wasn't claiming that by manipulating a baby, they don't need vaccines. The.

200
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.640
<v 1>This is now, this is, I understand this is not all chiropractors,</v>

201
00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:39.620
but the American chiropractic association,

202
00:11:39.621 --> 00:11:41.510
and this is fairly well cited within the article,

203
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.110
the American chiropractic association, they are generally anti-drug.

204
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.830
They want to use the least amount of inter inter medical interventions possible.

205
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.310
And chiropractors are not in most states in this country.

206
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.310
They are not cleared to either prescribe or give vaccinations.

207
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:01.210
So if you can manage to get a family to come into you for pretty much all of

208
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:06.010
their medical needs, that increases your bottom line and it stops, you know?

209
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.010
And, and you can just say, we can do everything for you.

210
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.550
<v 0>Where's the chiropractor isn't cleared for vaccinations. They don't,</v>

211
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:12.720
they don't give vaccinations.

212
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.690
<v 1>And I mean, one of there's one state in this country,</v>

213
00:12:15.691 --> 00:12:18.600
I believe it was Wisconsin, where they were trying to get chiropractors,

214
00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:22.710
to be able to give pre sports physicals. And in, in some cases,

215
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.280
the pre sports physical is the only time all year when a student will see a

216
00:12:26.281 --> 00:12:30.600
doctor. So this is, this is infuriating. So the like whenever a doctor,

217
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.380
and I mean, this is like, you can look at the ACS website. There is a,

218
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.040
put a couple of links to it in the article where they say, you know, they're,

219
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.050
they're not very Provax. And I mean,

220
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:44.070
their language on it is under the condition of freedom of choice,

221
00:12:44.071 --> 00:12:47.970
medical choice. And it's like, they don't say straight out vaccines don't work.

222
00:12:47.971 --> 00:12:51.120
They're bad for you, but they're kind of they're, wishy-washy on it.

223
00:12:51.121 --> 00:12:54.090
And they're not, they don't say vaccines work and you should get them.

224
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.270
But a couple of chiropractors will try to say, we don't need vaccines.

225
00:12:57.271 --> 00:13:00.990
We can increase your immune system. We can increase your immunity by, you know,

226
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.930
pressing on a spot. I'm like zero evidence, zero evidence. And I'm like,

227
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.330
do me a favor. Uh, tell me which spine,

228
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.870
which part of the spine you press on to give a child immunity to measles and

229
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:11.010
polio. Give me, tell me,

230
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.000
give me the titers test that child's titers to show me that they're immune to

231
00:13:15.001 --> 00:13:19.080
polio. Now from you touching their spine. Maybe I it's like, how about this?

232
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:21.450
How about I'll punch you in the, I'm not going to punch a chiropractor.

233
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.270
How about I just, you know, not just give you a few little,

234
00:13:24.271 --> 00:13:28.140
like a little pokes in the back, and then you're going to be immune to smallpox.

235
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.300
Just, just let me know how that works, but I can't,

236
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:35.370
I can't get behind a system that has no evidence and tells me it's going to make

237
00:13:35.371 --> 00:13:36.480
children immune to death.

238
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.120
<v 0>Here's the real question. How did it get this far? Like how, how did this guy,</v>

239
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.390
who's a magnetic healer who had no background in medicine,

240
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:50.550
come up with this system and then have it spread all

241
00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:51.384
over the world.

242
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.340
<v 1>It's such a good story. Isn't it?</v>

243
00:13:53.341 --> 00:13:57.720
People love a story that says that you can heal them without, uh,

244
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.910
without taking dangerous drugs. And at the time.

245
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.220
<v 0>I forget about medicine, it was drugs. I mean, even just,</v>

246
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.120
just helping you with anything, it's really.

247
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.620
<v 1>It's partially because of when it came up,</v>

248
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:12.420
because we only found out 50 years after this, that, uh, that,

249
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:12.720
uh,

250
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.770
frontal lobotomies were a bad idea and that the lithium-ion was going to kill

251
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:18.870
babies. Uh, so we were,

252
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:23.640
we were really bad at medicine when this came up and we're, I mean,

253
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.330
we're way better at it now, but we still don't have the answers to everything.

254
00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:30.120
And that's kind of, I don't want to say a failure of the medical system,

255
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:31.890
but it's just a sign of where we are now.

256
00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:36.180
So think about the number of people who have sent us anecdotes, uh, saying,

257
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:36.841
you know,

258
00:14:36.841 --> 00:14:39.900
I was in miserable pain and my chiropractor was the only thing that worked.

259
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.270
And it's like, maybe you needed to get, uh, you know,

260
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.360
get to physical therapy for longer term pain.

261
00:14:45.361 --> 00:14:47.430
But these people that are still going to their Kairos,

262
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.130
it means they're still in pain. And they should go to a physical for, you know,

263
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:55.910
a couple months of therapy that will eventually strengthen their backs and take

264
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:58.520
care of those issues and, you know, get a massage,

265
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.700
but they're going to their Cairo because medical has not said, you know,

266
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:05.000
we don't have a tri-quarter that can scan you show the exact thing and say,

267
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:08.330
here's the exact medicine, drug and thing that will fix you. It's kind of,

268
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:09.500
and I hate to use this term,

269
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:13.070
but it's out of the failures of the medical system that something like this has

270
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:15.560
shown up. So we're not perfect at medicine yet.

271
00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:18.890
And that's why alternative medicine swoops in with.

272
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:21.970
<v 0>Well, it's just a matter of innovation. It's like,</v>

273
00:15:21.971 --> 00:15:25.270
there's a certain level that the medical community is at right now.

274
00:15:25.271 --> 00:15:27.220
It's pretty staggering what they're capable of,

275
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.080
but it's still growing and learning and we're in a constant state of

276
00:15:32.081 --> 00:15:32.800
progress,

277
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.720
but what's shocking to me is how far this medical healer or

278
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.260
magnetic healers, quack idea. God,

279
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.950
I just thought it was based on something. I mean, I really did.

280
00:15:44.951 --> 00:15:48.490
I've been going to a chiropractor for years or different chiropractors for

281
00:15:48.491 --> 00:15:52.360
years. And one of them was like, this guy used to go to Hollywood.

282
00:15:52.361 --> 00:15:53.770
He's like 140 bucks.

283
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.680
And literally he would take care of you for like 10 minutes.

284
00:15:56.681 --> 00:16:00.790
He would rub your back a little bit and massage a little bit and then he would

285
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.420
pop it and then go, we got it. We got it. And I'd be like, okay.

286
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.000
And I would think her head, man, maybe I'll start feeling better now.

287
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.110
<v 1>Roller for 20 bucks that I can lend you a little crack your back really well.</v>

288
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.290
<v 0>So, well, yeah. Um, it's just,</v>

289
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.680
it's just stunning to me that insurance companies pay for it.

290
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.770
And that it's been around so long. How did that happen?

291
00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.300
How were insurance companies paying for it?

292
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.820
<v 1>Some lobbying. And I don't think I put this into the article,</v>

293
00:16:24.821 --> 00:16:27.760
but there was a lot of lobbying from chiropractors in,

294
00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:32.470
I believe the seventies that pushed the American medical association and, uh,

295
00:16:32.471 --> 00:16:36.100
and the insurance companies as a whole to kind of accept them as being

296
00:16:36.101 --> 00:16:38.290
medically, uh, a part of the system.

297
00:16:38.291 --> 00:16:42.850
And that that's part of why more and more insurance companies now will cover

298
00:16:42.851 --> 00:16:47.230
them and accept them. And even though like most doctors won't, uh,

299
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.860
like a lot of doctors won't, uh, refer you, they'll kind of be like, well,

300
00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:53.050
you can look into Cairo. Like there's,

301
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.500
they're still from a lot of doctors push back. Uh,

302
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.440
but there's a little bit more coverage now just because of a lot of lobbying in

303
00:16:59.441 --> 00:17:00.610
the seventies. Now.

304
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:05.500
<v 0>If chiropractors do have a center or a treatment center or whatever it</v>

305
00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:08.590
is, and they have a bunch of different methods that they employ,

306
00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.370
this is not saying that those other methods might not give you some relief,

307
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.480
but the actual cracking of the necks and the cracking of the back,

308
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.760
there's virtually no evidence that,

309
00:17:18.761 --> 00:17:21.970
that heals anything or stops any,

310
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.470
or promotes your immune system functioning better or anything like that.

311
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.200
All these things that that's based on, it's.

312
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.980
<v 1>Precisely like the big thing is that, I mean, there,</v>

313
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.730
if they were just claiming we can reduce your back pain,

314
00:17:36.731 --> 00:17:38.110
if that was the only thing they claimed,

315
00:17:38.111 --> 00:17:40.150
I probably wouldn't have written the article, you know,

316
00:17:40.151 --> 00:17:44.950
but what they're claiming is that they can fix all of your health by

317
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.980
realigning, these vertebral subluxations, which have never been proven exist.

318
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.720
So like, what are they doing.

319
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.130
<v 0>When, when your back pops,</v>

320
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.500
what is actually happening is there's nitrogen being released or something it's

321
00:17:57.501 --> 00:17:57.650
just.

322
00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:00.980
<v 1>Moving around air bubbles. Like, I mean, tiny little bits of bubbles and yeah,</v>

323
00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:04.700
they are like, there, I don't think realigning is the right word, but you know,

324
00:18:04.701 --> 00:18:06.080
they're, they're doing, they're,

325
00:18:06.081 --> 00:18:09.350
they're moving around your back in a way that it kind of naturally moves because

326
00:18:09.351 --> 00:18:11.870
you can kind of move and twist and your back will pop.

327
00:18:11.871 --> 00:18:15.320
But like they're doing some manipulation of things that kind of naturally

328
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.760
happened to a, to a spine, uh, with, you know, with a tiny little bit, I mean,

329
00:18:19.761 --> 00:18:21.500
tiny bit of degeneration with age.

330
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.590
I think like I'm not exactly the right expert to explain, uh,

331
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.100
this type of thing. And osteopath would be a better person to explain this.

332
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:29.080
Cause there's, uh,

333
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.350
there are people who are a little better at spinal manipulation than a

334
00:18:33.351 --> 00:18:35.720
chiropractor, which is a DOE and osteopath.

335
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:40.460
So in this country we have MDs and dos and they both can practice medicine,

336
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.030
a doctor of osteopathy, a doctor of osteopathy.

337
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.270
I believe that's the correct term. And my doctor is actually, uh, my, uh,

338
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.080
primary care is an osteopath and he's given me a spinal manipulation once when

339
00:18:51.081 --> 00:18:53.780
my back was killing me. And we had no idea what it was,

340
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.040
it turned out I had a broken rib,

341
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.030
which was not a good time to do a spinal manipulation.

342
00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:03.680
We've got a rib broken right on your spine. Uh, but it was like, he, um,

343
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.520
the difference is an osteopath, never claims that they're, um,

344
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.500
they're cracking your back to try. Yeah, exactly. They're, they're giving you a,

345
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.950
they're giving you your vaccines. They're doing, you know, they're going, wow,

346
00:19:15.951 --> 00:19:18.500
there's something wrong with your, with your ovary.

347
00:19:18.501 --> 00:19:20.450
We're going to send you to a gynecologist like there,

348
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.540
they're doing all the things the doctors should do for your health.

349
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.500
And if your back is in pain, they'll say, do you want to try a manipulation?

350
00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:30.020
They're not pushing that that's a part of their care.

351
00:19:30.021 --> 00:19:33.320
And they try to do science-based, uh, you know, uh,

352
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:38.000
manipulations for the potential help of, uh, of,

353
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.330
uh, back relief. Uh, but they don't, you know, they don't want to do that.

354
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.630
Long-term they do it minimally. At least that's been my experience with it.

355
00:19:44.631 --> 00:19:47.960
And it seems to be like it, there still seems to be,

356
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.730
I'd say at best weak evidence that it helps with, uh, with back pain,

357
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:53.450
the problem.

358
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.930
<v 0>Is they usually do it with other things that also have been shown to help with</v>

359
00:19:56.931 --> 00:20:01.430
back pain massage, and also just rested it. Yes.

360
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.740
<v 1>Breast ice anti-inflammatory. So are you.</v>

361
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.320
<v 0>Looking at all these different factors? Well,</v>

362
00:20:06.321 --> 00:20:09.620
I went to a chiropractor and he helped me [inaudible] are you sure? Yeah. Yeah.

363
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.020
<v 1>And I mean, I think that it's, I think it's funny,</v>

364
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.760
the things that chiropractors add into it,

365
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.700
cause like one of the things that they went into in this, uh, in this article,

366
00:20:16.701 --> 00:20:17.560
cause we, we,

367
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.200
we really liked diving deep on some of the things that we investigate. Um,

368
00:20:21.201 --> 00:20:25.280
and it's like, I try, I like, I I'll admit I'm biased when I go in. I,

369
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.930
cause I go after a lot of, uh, kind of some of the naturally things and I'm not,

370
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.830
I'm not anti natural. Like I, I'm not a hundred percent against like going.

371
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.040
<v 0>To homeopathics, like, well it's funny cause we can, we can go.</v>

372
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.210
Some of it's real, right?

373
00:20:38.211 --> 00:20:41.990
Like garlic really is good for infections or some stuff that's legit.

374
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.840
<v 1>For your heart gender. I love like when I have a stomach ache,</v>

375
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.800
I'll go for ginger. Before I go for a remedies at work,

376
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.070
there are some herbal remedies that I'm like, absolutely keep them in your,

377
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:53.650
in your cabinet. I'm not against them,

378
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:56.830
but I'm against people taking things without evidence.

379
00:20:56.831 --> 00:20:58.240
And I think that's the thing, like try it,

380
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.240
try absolutely it to look for the hard evidence, uh,

381
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.560
before you waste your money.

382
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:05.380
And I think that's the thing that people have fallen into. Cause they'll say,

383
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.160
oh, it's natural. It's better. It's like it is. Cause polio is natural.

384
00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:11.620
And I don't think it's very good for you. Like, but I know,

385
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.690
I know that's a straw man fully aware of it,

386
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.610
but I also think that people should,

387
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.120
should ask for evidence and you never know and ask for it to mandate before you

388
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:20.200
give somebody your money.

389
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.930
And that's what people haven't done with chiropractors.

390
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.640
<v 0>And that is the very good point.</v>

391
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.180
<v 1>And it's, you know, I, I think people deserve evidence and that's,</v>

392
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.670
and I think that's something that hasn't been out in the public sphere.

393
00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:33.970
Like there was an article I was trying to write a while ago. Um,

394
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.930
I forget the exact topic, but one of my editors, uh, you know,

395
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.580
sending it back to me credit, she's like, I've read that she, uh,

396
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.250
her comment back was, well, I've been reading this a lot online.

397
00:21:42.251 --> 00:21:45.250
A lot of people have been saying this I'm like a lot of people have been saying

398
00:21:45.251 --> 00:21:48.460
is not evidence. That's the exact opposite of it.

399
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:51.310
Like I'm like here I put in the peer review data on this.

400
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.230
I didn't work with her again. But she was, a lot of people have been saying,

401
00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:58.630
that's not. And I mean,

402
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:01.360
this is why I like the editors I'm working with now quite a bit.

403
00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:02.250
That's the problem.

404
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.990
<v 0>With this whole clinic thing though,</v>

405
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.800
is that they don't have to have any sort of background in keys,

406
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.670
kinesiology or in physical therapy or in any of these things.

407
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.520
And so they incorporate all these other modalities,

408
00:22:14.521 --> 00:22:15.870
all these other methods of healing you,

409
00:22:15.871 --> 00:22:19.320
but they don't have to have a background in education and those things,

410
00:22:19.321 --> 00:22:20.790
and they're calling themselves a doctor.

411
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.190
<v 1>There is, there is one thing I've heard of and this isn't,</v>

412
00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:27.630
this is why I'd say don't go to a chiropractor because we don't know.

413
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.010
You don't know what you're going to walk into.

414
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.270
But I have heard a couple of cases of times this being the case where a

415
00:22:33.271 --> 00:22:34.710
chiropractor at first,

416
00:22:34.711 --> 00:22:38.100
they go to school for physical therapy and then they find they can't open their

417
00:22:38.101 --> 00:22:41.910
own clinic. Even if they've got like an MBA and a physical therapy background,

418
00:22:41.911 --> 00:22:43.500
they're like, how do I open my own clinic?

419
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.440
And they realize if they just go to school for chiropractic,

420
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.520
they can do the physical therapy work they want to and offer a spinal

421
00:22:50.521 --> 00:22:51.600
manipulation on the side.

422
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.720
<v 0>How long does it take to get a degree in chiropractic? Like, how's it.</v>

423
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.030
<v 4>Going to get a doctor three, four years?</v>

424
00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.750
<v 1>Like it's, I mean, it's a lot of school, but think about it. You learn, I had a,</v>

425
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.710
how to crack spines.

426
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.530
<v 0>It's created by a guy who's a quack.</v>

427
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.350
What the could they possibly be teaching you for four years?

428
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.850
<v 1>Uh, I do. They do learn some anatomy, but it's like, they also learned some,</v>

429
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:16.290
you know, along with it. So I'm like, I wonder, I mean, this isn't, I get it.

430
00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:19.260
This isn't all chiropractors obviously. But like I know,

431
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.530
and it's hard to figure out which one you're going to walk into.

432
00:23:22.531 --> 00:23:25.620
That's going to be a artist and not so like, I,

433
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.680
I did want it like this isn't this wasn't the point I was going to bring up an

434
00:23:28.681 --> 00:23:30.780
article that was going to have a specific point of view.

435
00:23:30.781 --> 00:23:33.930
But like I know there are some out there that say, I, you know,

436
00:23:33.931 --> 00:23:37.440
I want to give people physical therapy. I want to strengthen up their spine.

437
00:23:37.441 --> 00:23:41.760
I want to get them out of here in less pain so that if they injured themselves

438
00:23:41.761 --> 00:23:45.030
again, they know they can come back to me and trust me with their,

439
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.220
and also give them some relief while we're fixing them. So, you know,

440
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:51.980
this is a thing that happens, but I don't think it's all the time. It's. I mean,

441
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:54.230
he's clearly not all the time. So, you know,

442
00:23:54.231 --> 00:23:57.050
you're going to have some really moral people in every field and you're going to

443
00:23:57.051 --> 00:24:00.350
have some really up ones in every field. Like we were, uh,

444
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.680
one of the things we touched on in the article, uh, were these very, uh,

445
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.850
social media savvy people, and this is something that drives me crazy.

446
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.000
You have to hunt and Peck through their websites to find that they say that

447
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:13.370
they're a chiropractor. They just say, doctor everywhere.

448
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:17.360
Dr. And they're giving they're giving recipe ideas and they're giving,

449
00:24:17.361 --> 00:24:19.880
and they're talking about the adrenal glands and the adrenal glands.

450
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.820
I don't know, they're not anywhere near close to the spine.

451
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.530
And this is the thing that they're talking about.

452
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:25.790
I'm like the adrenal glands are.

453
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.350
<v 0>What are they talking about? Manipulating the spine to help the adrenal glands.</v>

454
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:30.340
<v 1>You're talking about.</v>

455
00:24:30.341 --> 00:24:33.550
One of the things we talk about a lot is adrenal fatigue syndrome,

456
00:24:33.551 --> 00:24:38.110
which has never been proven to be a thing it's not recognized as a,

457
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.260
as a disorder, anywhere within the medical care system.

458
00:24:41.261 --> 00:24:45.520
Now you can have a couple of different disorders of the adrenal gland you have,

459
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.250
uh, Cushing syndrome. Um, have like,

460
00:24:48.251 --> 00:24:50.980
there are a couple of different things that can go wrong with your adrenal

461
00:24:50.981 --> 00:24:54.460
glands. They're little glands that sit on top of the kidneys. Uh, but this is,

462
00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.310
I mean the specialty, I believe, hold on a second,

463
00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.170
I'm having a blonde moment on the words. Uh,

464
00:24:59.171 --> 00:25:01.450
but like there's are on the subspecialty,

465
00:25:01.451 --> 00:25:04.840
but the specialty for which you're going to study the Adriana lens,

466
00:25:04.841 --> 00:25:08.230
isn't deemed as a specialty that chiropractic has. So it's like,

467
00:25:08.231 --> 00:25:11.060
if you want to know about your, if you're having issues with that,

468
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:15.460
like it's like the, the things that chiropractor seemed to harp on right now,

469
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.480
or a lot with, uh, immunology or a lot with, uh, sorry,

470
00:25:19.481 --> 00:25:22.370
just having a complete blonde moment on this. Uh, but there,

471
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.600
there are specialties that chiropractor seem to harp on a lot lately.

472
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.410
And it seems to be the type of things that are very nebulous and very hard to,

473
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.100
uh, to nail down when someone's having an issue with it. And these are,

474
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.040
these are things that chiropractors just don't have the training in.

475
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:40.480
<v 0>So essentially someone's putting up a health website and they're claiming to be</v>

476
00:25:40.481 --> 00:25:44.230
a doctor and they're offering all this advice on diet and all these different

477
00:25:44.231 --> 00:25:47.500
things. But when you get to what is their degree in,

478
00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.830
it's not a real doctor, it's a chiropractor.
