1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And I just went on a riff right there.</v>

2
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:06.120
But the thing is.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.550
<v 1>Isn't that what you do though? Like yeah. Yeah. One of the things that I,</v>

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.720
when anybody ever talks about you to me, they, they, they say, well,

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.000
he's all over the place. And I say,

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.190
I think that he's got a different power source.

7
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.000
Like if you look at the way everybody interfaces with the world is if there's a

8
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.910
universal power, most people have like a 20 watt charger.

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.380
The way I describe you. I say,

10
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:31.640
I think that got like 150 watt charger and these ideas are just coming at them.

11
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.650
So you do go on these rants that sometimes need to be dissected into

12
00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:41.150
individual things, but overall you're an incredibly productive.

13
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.960
So my question is why do,

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.140
why do people think there's something wrong with you, right? This is,

15
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.990
but I've literally legitimately, like you've been medicated.

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.970
They've they've put you away. Right. They've brought two men to men.

17
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.200
How did that happen? Well, I'll.

18
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.970
<v 0>Say these two things, I think.</v>

19
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.270
<v 2>Uh, very.</v>

20
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.710
<v 0>Three-dimensionally I don't think in the black and white lines that I've been</v>

21
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:10.250
programmed to think in. And I, and I think in full color.

22
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.900
So when I talk,

23
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.270
I have to describe a thought in five ways, you know,

24
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.140
we, we enjoy food that has multiple seasoning in it.

25
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.460
We enjoy music that has multiple instruments. So when I talk,

26
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.240
it's not a rent, it's a symphony of ideas.

27
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.260
And when you collect them, you say, oh, these are all these things that connect.

28
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.990
Yeah. You know, I, I,

29
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.480
I just tell the truth and telling the truth is crazy in a world full of

30
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:44.300
lies. That's simply it.

31
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.510
<v 1>The things you're saying are crazy. None of the things you've said,</v>

32
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.780
it's fascinating the way you think, right?

33
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.050
Because I can see that you're thinking and all these different layers,

34
00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:57.230
and you're looking at things from all these different perspectives and they all

35
00:01:57.231 --> 00:02:01.070
come together out of your mouth and like a tornado of ideas. Now,

36
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:04.100
if someone wants to just have a conversation with you back and forth,

37
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:06.350
I could see where they would go. The guy's crazy. Just doesn't stop.

38
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.120
He's just ranting. But what I'm seeing is just, you're a very thorough thinker.

39
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.000
You're thinking of things independently,

40
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.430
but you're thinking of things in a massive perspective now who convinced

41
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.690
you that that's bad. Is it,

42
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.100
have you always been this way or were you less,

43
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.480
was it less manageable before? Did you have issues with it before? Yeah,

44
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.980
I believe before.

45
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.990
<v 0>I found Christ and gave my life to</v>

46
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:39.590
God, I would try to lean on my own understanding.

47
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.750
And that's the universe is like a black

48
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:47.690
hole of information. What do you mean by your own understanding?

49
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.100
Meaning when people, as Einstein said, you're the smartest person,

50
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:55.970
what would you like to know? He, his Reinstein, his response was,

51
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.850
I'd like to understand the mind of God, meaning, meaning God is all knowing.

52
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.750
And we can only know or see. And for me as a visionary,

53
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.760
we can only know or see what God allows us to see and what he feels we're

54
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:12.630
ready to see and understand to,

55
00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:17.530
to maximize what our Maslow's hierarchy of needs chart is.

56
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.680
You know, what sets our dopamines, what sets our serotonins off.

57
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.010
What makes us feel good, basically like, you know, we,

58
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.710
we did a good deed and it's like, it was somehow where, you know, you know,

59
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.310
just doing a beat for a famous or just doing a beat for, um,

60
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.530
a local dope rapper really meant a lot to me when I was 14 years old,

61
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.600
doing a beat for just anyone famous that had a major record deal was

62
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.010
a lot to me at age 19, me being able to, you know,

63
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.090
put out my own music and put my own. I was a lot to me at age 24,

64
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.130
meaning as I grow,

65
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.330
God sets new stages in the game of life.

66
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.580
For me that you get your satisfaction.

67
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.690
Like Maslow's hierarchy of need is like our satisfaction chart.

68
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.670
What makes us feel whole and, uh, accomplished as a, as a,

69
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.300
as a human being. So as I go through these different levels,

70
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:18.010
there's times where I would use confidence when I knew what I was doing.

71
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.190
And I would use arrogance when I didn't know what I was doing,

72
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:25.000
but I'd rather use arrogance than to let someone, uh,

73
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.530
diminish my idea of myself, because that is what keeps us going.

74
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:33.070
Hope actually keeps us alive. Anybody you ask, most people is like,

75
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:36.070
do you want tomorrow to come? And they say, yes, they, they have,

76
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.060
they have hope for it.

77
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.130
But I went from having confidence and arrogance to having faith and faith is the

78
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:46.930
opposite of fear. And that created this fearless approach that I have.

79
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.850
And that's what made now has made me the fearless leader

80
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.661
that I am,

81
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:57.520
that I've like crystallized into the leader that my

82
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:01.960
mom always knew I would be when kids followed me in preschool,

83
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.760
the leader that people saw when we changed the sound of music, the leader,

84
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.080
when we changed, uh, the, the sneaker industry, the leader,

85
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.070
and what we're doing with, uh, with farming and with, with shelters,

86
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.630
when I was building, you know,

87
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:21.400
the homeless shelters a couple of years ago and visiting parks,

88
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:26.230
and then going to skid row and understanding the, uh, uh,

89
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:30.880
the dynamics and empathizing with what actual mental health

90
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.180
issues are, not someone, you know,

91
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.520
telling their truth or being exhausted and then being labeled as

92
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:41.090
such like I.

93
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.380
<v 1>So that's what you felt happened to you.</v>

94
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.010
Like you were absolute truth and you were exhausted and they labeled you as

95
00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:50.380
mentally unhealthy. Yes, absolutely. Am I saying this right?

96
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.780
That what happened with you is you feel like maybe,

97
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.780
or you probably feel like that having this higher calling and

98
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:04.520
recognizing this higher power was the glue that

99
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:06.050
kept your thoughts together.

100
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.730
They kept your mind straight and it kept you on a righteous path.

101
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.580
So instead of being scattered with all these crazy thoughts and being exhausted

102
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:20.540
and being labeled manic, right? Like we talked before,

103
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.520
and you were saying that they had you on medication,

104
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:26.870
but the medication with your creativity, it with all kinds of things.

105
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.860
<v 0>Oh, it blocked my ability to channel what God wanted me to do. But we're all,</v>

106
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.940
we're all on medication right now. Did you use toothpaste with fluoride today?

107
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.720
It blocks your pineal gland and they put children on it. And we put,

108
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.260
we put our kids on it. You know, we w it's inside the,

109
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.760
the deodorants that we use as all these things to create like a disconnect

110
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.380
to God to serve that. It's like, are you serving, man?

111
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.350
Are you serving the one and only mask.

112
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.360
<v 1>But what did they tell you when,</v>

113
00:06:57.361 --> 00:06:59.850
when they said that they were going to put you on medication,

114
00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:02.370
what did they put you on? And what did they tell you? One.

115
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.420
<v 0>Of my favorite things that they did is they put me on this medication that made</v>

116
00:07:06.421 --> 00:07:11.130
me gain a lot of weight. And I said, I'm not going to take this. And they said,

117
00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:13.710
okay, we got a medication you can take where you don't gain weight.

118
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.660
And this shows you, they were trying to kill a superhero slowly,

119
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.040
trying to kill genius,

120
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.450
trying to make me not feel like I could run for president,

121
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.130
make me not feel like I can go, uh, be born in Atlanta,

122
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.990
grew up on the south side of Chicago,

123
00:07:30.991 --> 00:07:35.970
go into music going when all these Grammys changed the sound of music and the

124
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.820
look of stage performances, all that.

125
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.650
And then still end up in $53 million of debt. What the music industry has.

126
00:07:43.651 --> 00:07:47.730
People go into the exact debt of the house that they think they're going to buy

127
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.920
after the tour is over. And it's,

128
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.520
and it's strategized is criminals all over.

129
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.040
Everyone's almost accounts in the music industry. It's not a safe place. It's a,

130
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.440
it's a treacherous place. So the.

131
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.270
<v 1>Money, as soon as things are filled with money,</v>

132
00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:05.160
they're filled with people that are trying to take advantage.

133
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.440
<v 0>Of other people it's filled with money bees come to honey.</v>

134
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.430
<v 1>Exactly. So they put,</v>

135
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.390
they put you on this ship because you were exhausted. What did they put you on?

136
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.023
Um.

137
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.360
<v 0>Um, you know, I can, I can research on Mac now.</v>

138
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.980
I'm actually forgetting the exact medication that they had. Um,

139
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.250
but what did it do? Do you, uh, do the main thing?

140
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.920
What it did is

141
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.660
it destroyed my confidence.

142
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.800
It may be this shell of who I really am.

143
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.260
It like grayed over my eyes. It, it,

144
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.760
it made me, it made the Mustang not buck anymore.

145
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.653
Hmm.

146
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.450
<v 1>They sedated you. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And they,</v>

147
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.530
what was the, the thought process behind it? When you,

148
00:09:02.531 --> 00:09:06.440
when you talk to a doctor about this, what did they tell you was wrong with you?

149
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.640
<v 0>Uh, they S they told me I was bipolar.</v>

150
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.550
And I remember going on TMZ and saying, you know, slavery is a choice.

151
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:22.550
And they medicated me for saying that for having that opinion and

152
00:09:22.551 --> 00:09:26.870
saying it out loud. But as I put those contracts up, I'm saying,

153
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.380
this is a choice as I, you know.

154
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.320
<v 1>Uh, you didn't mean people being abducted and brought into slavery and put into</v>

155
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:37.730
chains was a choice.

156
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.110
What you were talking about is people making decisions that would enslave them

157
00:09:42.111 --> 00:09:44.270
financially and enslave their life.

158
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.370
And it was taken out of context and it was taken in the least

159
00:09:49.371 --> 00:09:53.690
charitable way. And they decided to try to say, look at crazy, Kanye,

160
00:09:53.691 --> 00:09:57.950
look at this saying, then they medicate you. Yes.

161
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.640
<v 0>And the media has always taken anything out of context.</v>

162
00:10:01.641 --> 00:10:06.320
That isn't a part of the overall narrative. Yeah.

163
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.110
That, because there's, you know,

164
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.130
like Hollywood iMedia has control so much of the narrative.

165
00:10:13.131 --> 00:10:16.700
And then he had silicone valley and that's,

166
00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:19.310
what's so beautiful about one of my heroes, Steve jobs,

167
00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:22.130
because there wouldn't be a silicone valley.

168
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.160
The Silicon valley wouldn't be what it is today.

169
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.570
If Steve jobs didn't make information

170
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.830
accessible like this, which is still a bit controlled,

171
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.230
but it feels like Twitter is the,

172
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.040
the safest fleet freest, uh,

173
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.900
mass platform to communicate on. And,

174
00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:51.740
you know, it's like, they mess with Jack because of that, you know, you know.

175
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.860
<v 1>Well, it's, it's still censored. There's a lot of issues now,</v>

176
00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:56.000
but I think that's internal.

177
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.120
I think that's people that are working there that are woke that want to stop

178
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.620
people from saying certain things.

179
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.160
And there's a lot of struggles with that today. And I,

180
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.260
it's unfortunate because I,

181
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.030
I do agree that it's an unbelievable way to get ideas out there. Yeah. So,

182
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.250
but it's also, it's a new thing.

183
00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:16.130
And it's mismanaged by the people that use it often.

184
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.320
They don't know what they're doing or why they're doing it.

185
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.060
<v 0>Yeah. Every version of anything that man has made will be flawed.</v>

186
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:29.330
<v 3>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

187
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.480
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

188
00:11:32.481 --> 00:11:34.880
They're going to be available everywhere. But after December 1st,

189
00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:38.600
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

190
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.590
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

191
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.420
That's all we're asking. You just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
