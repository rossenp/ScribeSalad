00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.480
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You come in here moving and shaking. Man.</v>

2
00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:07.480
You come in here making deals you're on the phone already. Gotta do it.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.360
You're always moving.

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.100
<v 1>I mean,</v>

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.040
is there anything else to do &lt;laugh&gt; is there anything else to do

6
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:17.640
besides no. You want to get ahead? No, no, especially not now, man.

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.030
Hunters hunt. Yes. Those that don't do get eight.

8
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.630
<v 0>The last time you were here, man,</v>

9
00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:25.710
that was one of the most inspirational podcasts I've ever done. I left that.

10
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.990
I literally had a shift in the way I was looking at things like you put an extra

11
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:32.790
gear in my step that day, I was like, oh,

12
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.230
I love being around people like you, my guy, people around you, you, you,

13
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:41.820
people like you, you're, you're going for all the time. And it's infectious.

14
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.740
It's like, uh, you're you, you give off energy. And when people are around you,

15
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:48.780
they want to, they want to get done too. It's cont yes.

16
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.940
<v 1>It's contagious. It's not, it's not just me putting that out. I think that, uh,</v>

17
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.220
the last time I was here,

18
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:57.900
our conversation was such a great conversation because there was,

19
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.140
there was, we both had point of views, right.

20
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.420
And when we shared the point of views,

21
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.580
you elevated the other person's POV.

22
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.500
Like when we were talking and I was telling you why I live the way I live,

23
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.420
why I am the way I am. You springboarded then you said, yeah, because ke for me,

24
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.170
I've been doing this and, and we had this ying and yang thing going. Yeah.

25
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.850
And it, and it drove the conversation. I told you, you know,

26
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:27.970
before we jumped on one of the,

27
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.010
the best interviews that I've ever done. And from a feedback perspective,

28
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.890
with people that just loved what the discussion was, uh,

29
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.090
loved the tone of the interview. The things that was said, uh, felt inspired,

30
00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:45.120
motivated after it was just great. All around for me checked all the boxes. It.

31
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.761
<v 0>Was for me too.</v>

32
00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:49.240
And I got a bunch of great responses from my friends from fr that's when I know

33
00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:52.360
it's good. When I get friends and my friends are all like pretty unanimous.

34
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.800
They're like, that is a motivational. Wow. Like that dude gets done.

35
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.640
When people hear stuff like you like someone who's oh, excited about life,

36
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.150
excited about doing things. You know, there's something about at that it's fuel,

37
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.030
it's fuel for PO fee. We need that. Everyone needs that.

38
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.750
<v 1>You know, I don't even, this is, this is not a cheesy segue.</v>

39
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.430
All right. This just makes sense from what you just said,

40
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.750
what you just said is the reason why I did the decision.

41
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.820
You said people need that it's fuel. Yes. Right?

42
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.300
I feel that in today's time, what people are most selfish with is information.

43
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.500
Hmm. Nobody wants to give information. You gotta ask for it.

44
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.100
If you ask for it then, all right. Maybe, maybe I'll tell you some stuff,

45
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.980
but it's a search and fine. You mean real good.

46
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.923
<v 0>Information.</v>

47
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.580
<v 1>Information, information,</v>

48
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.890
a about how to get to success. That's the,

49
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.530
that's the one from everybody across the board on some level. Right? Okay.

50
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:56.010
Everybody's success is different. This doesn't mean fame and, and stars.

51
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.610
I'm not talking about that level of success for everything. I'm saying,

52
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.080
whatever your version of success is to get to it.

53
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.120
Information from someone that's done it,

54
00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:09.720
or that's partaking in it in some degree will only add

55
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.320
to the value of your journey. It's only going to make it easier.

56
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.800
It's not to say that you gotta do what they said, but be with that information,

57
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.750
you're able to process it. Maybe use it. Maybe not right, but you got it.

58
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.430
Right. That's what I wanted to do. I said, yo, I got, I got a, I got a life.

59
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.630
I got a hell of a life that I've lived full of. Ups, downs, potholes,

60
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.550
cobble stones, speed bumps, flat row.

61
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.940
U-turns some smack brick walls that I ran into. Uh,

62
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.180
you know, some revolving doors of back and forth and through it, all,

63
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.820
my mental has only gotten better because I feel like I've been in,

64
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.020
I've been in a mental gym, the mental fitness that,

65
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.420
that coincides with life, you know, it should get better. It should,

66
00:03:57.421 --> 00:04:00.970
you should get wiser. You could get smarter,

67
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.130
you should be able to make better decisions.

68
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.370
And all of my decisions came from the massive amount of fuckups

69
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.170
and I can now share those fuckups.

70
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.570
I can now share the rights and the wrongs and the way that I handle all of the

71
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:19.970
things that I've done and people can just take that information and go, wow. I,

72
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.280
I never looked at it like that. What.

73
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.200
<v 0>Gives him a better view of the landscape? Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.920
Especially when someone like you, you,

75
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:29.120
you almost seem like an unattainable person. Like how, how, how does he do that?

76
00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:29.960
How is he doing that?

77
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.560
How does this guy go from Philadelphia to be one of the biggest movie stars in

78
00:04:33.561 --> 00:04:36.960
the world? How does he become one of the biggest standup comedy stars ever?

79
00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:39.840
How the do you do that? You almost seem like an alien. Yeah. You know,

80
00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:40.870
to people in the time.

81
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.870
But then when they hear you talk about your real life and talk about these

82
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.110
fuckups and talk about these successes and talk about the lessons that you've

83
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:51.430
learned, man, that's fuel for folks in a way that nothing else is because it's,

84
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:53.390
there's a lot of people that are bullshitting online.

85
00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:57.030
There's a lot of these motivational speakers that haven't done. And it's a,

86
00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.230
it's a weird thing. It's like, they're,

87
00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:03.100
they're trying to give you motivation by like sort of reciting

88
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:05.540
things that they think are gonna work or think they think.

89
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.220
<v 1>That they think you wanna hear, but they haven't done anything.</v>

90
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.980
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; someone who's done something. When you say it, people are gonna listen,</v>

91
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.140
they're gonna go. Oh, and you're so honest about everything.

92
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:17.980
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; which is every that's everything to people.

93
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:21.180
Because when you are pure, when you, you are your words,

94
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.570
are your people take them right in, they come right in there's no,

95
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:28.210
there's no like, ah, this guy's kind of selling me something. Oh,

96
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:29.044
this guy's selling.

97
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.250
<v 1>Yeah. I got, I got nothing to sell. I had a, uh,</v>

98
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.050
I had a talk with chase, like, uh, chase, JB, Morgan, chase,

99
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.890
the partners of mine. And we were doing this more, not we were, we are,

100
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:43.200
we're doing this thing called advancing black pathways, right.

101
00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:46.040
Where we're trying to cure financial literacy in the black community.

102
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.040
We've been we're on like year number two right now. Right?

103
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.560
And there was a conversation where, you know,

104
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:56.000
they wanted to have said, bankers,

105
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.560
go and talk to the kids in the inner city. And I was like,

106
00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:02.394
you can't,

107
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.120
you can't send a white man that works for JP Morgan

108
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.880
chase to the inner city of sad community hood,

109
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.153
whatever,

110
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.070
to talk to these young black kids that has no idea about the life that the black

111
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.670
kids live in. I said,

112
00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:21.750
what you need is people that have actually come from these environments.

113
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.510
They have made it out of the environments and now understand

114
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.950
how money works. Because now when I talk to you,

115
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.870
I'm not talking to you at hypotheticals and I'm not preaching to you about what

116
00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:38.540
you should do and what you gotta do. I said, I'm telling you what I did.

117
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.900
That didn't work. I'm telling you I off money. And I'm telling you what?

118
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.100
I didn't know. Hey guys, here's a fact.

119
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.980
There is no education that comes with money in the black communities.

120
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:51.700
It doesn't, you can go search for it. There, there isn't one. It does not exist.

121
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:56.660
There is no one that is outright teaching the kids in a black community.

122
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.450
How to operate financially,

123
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.410
how to set up for your future. There is nobody talking to you about ownership,

124
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.450
homes, mortgages, investments, stocks that doesn't exist.

125
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.810
It doesn't exist. It's not until you get out of that environment that you meet.

126
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.160
Some people that are planning their life accordingly,

127
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.360
that you start to ask questions. It's not till maybe college.

128
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.760
And on the later side of it,

129
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.280
that you're with people that are getting jobs in the future that you start to do

130
00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:34.920
it. There is no prep or education at a young age. I said, so you need a,

131
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.400
you need a man that can go there and go, man.

132
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.550
&lt;affirmative&gt; let me tell you why y'all gotta stop taking these free credit

133
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.393
cards.

134
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.870
Let me tell you why you gotta stop putting a cable in somebody else's name and

135
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:47.830
continuing to it up.

136
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.790
Let me tell you why you gotta stop being okay with not having a bank

137
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.990
account. Let me tell you why you gotta stop using the check cash in place.

138
00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:59.300
There's nobody giving that information. Mm-hmm I said, that's what I am.

139
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.220
So if we're going to have a relationship,

140
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.060
let's build it off of something authentic.

141
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.460
Let's build it off of something that people can go.

142
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.180
I get that since then to go back to your point.

143
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.500
My relationship has been based on me telling the truth.

144
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.940
I told JP Morgan chase.

145
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.730
I wanna go to the inner city and I wanna have these discussion, but let me have,

146
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.530
'em my way. I don't wanna have it in a JP Morgan chase way.

147
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.690
And I gotta credit them for backing me because they align me with other people

148
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.170
that share the same stories that have achieved certain levels of success,

149
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.930
that speak to the same thing. So everything that I've done,

150
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:42.360
everything that I'm trying to do, when I do you talk about it, I come proven.

151
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.680
I'm only talking about this because I really got knowledge about it.

152
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.560
I don't got knowledge about it because I'm the smartest world.

153
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:51.520
That's not where the knowledge is coming from, Joe. My knowledge is coming from,

154
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.680
Hey man, yo, don't walk through door. Number one,

155
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.520
I walked through that door. There's a monster in there.

156
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.320
There's a bunch of in that door. &lt;laugh&gt; it?

157
00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:05.000
Wasn't until I came out that door that I saw those monsters that I knew the

158
00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:07.960
other monsters weren't as bad and door number two,

159
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.480
but door number three is finally where you should go. I messed up, man.

160
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:13.840
I went to the first two doors wrong.

161
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:19.830
Why can't I give that to somebody that, that hasn't experienced those doors yet?

162
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.310
Why can't I just give that information and possibly prevent them from walking

163
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:23.630
into.

164
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.630
<v 0>Those doors? And that's, what's really valuable for people listening. Yeah, man,</v>

165
00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:28.070
that's, what's really valuable. Yes.

166
00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:31.390
Someone who's actually done it and done it wrong and done it. Right? And like,

167
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:36.020
Hey, listen, I up. This is how I up. That that means so much to people.

168
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.620
It really you're. You're advancing people's possibilities.

169
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.820
<v 1>It's I think that's what life should be about. Yes. If, if as,</v>

170
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.740
as adults, as adults, we have a job to do,

171
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:51.540
whether you wanna admit it or not,

172
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.370
your job is to set up the next generation.

173
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.930
That's our job. Whether you wanna admit it or not, it it's your kids.

174
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.210
It's your friends. It's whomever. You are supposed to live a certain way.

175
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:12.410
Do certain things to set up for the next generation to come and to

176
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:15.210
be able to do better. If you don't,

177
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.480
then you are not doing your part. And if the world never grows,

178
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.680
you gotta raise your hand and be responsible. Mm.

179
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.320
Cause you are a part of the lag. Yeah. You're part of the delay.

180
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.680
If we look up in 15, 20 years and we are in the same spot,

181
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:38.190
what that means that our ground breakers was doing all the during that 15,

182
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:41.190
20 years never shared the information so that these new people could come

183
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:45.670
through and break new ground. Yeah. Somebody gotta do more than what the I did.

184
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.710
I don't care who it is. Right. But you gotta do more. Right.

185
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.630
Somebody gotta do more.

186
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.870
Somebody gotta break these records and you already believed the trail. Yeah.

187
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.340
This all I did, all I did was show you, Hey man, Hey, they stopped here,

188
00:10:58.341 --> 00:10:59.540
but I kept going to the left.
