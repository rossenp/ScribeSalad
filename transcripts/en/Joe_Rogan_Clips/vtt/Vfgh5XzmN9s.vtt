00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.360
<v 1>You know, machines are, this is an interesting point of view. Okay.</v>

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.440
There is a belief that machines are great for beginners and because

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.040
you don't have to control it, it savence isolated. So on and so forth.

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.390
Really machines have limited use for advanced lifters

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.670
when they're injured or whenever they have to just really focus on something.

7
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.270
So it's possible. It's possible to use a machine. If you're really messed up,

8
00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:35.910
you can find some angle, but a beginner starts doing leg presses.

9
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.390
Uh it's skinto missap coordination. It's not gonna have the back strengths.

10
00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:44.580
It's not gonna be some strengths. Mm. So machines are not necessarily bad.

11
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.020
So the Peck deck might be okay for bodybu looking for

12
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.140
cuts or for somebody recovering from an injury,

13
00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:55.420
knowing exactly the angle to which to push,

14
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.100
but your typical person going the gym has no business doing that. None.

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.490
<v 0>One of the things that I love aboutll ketlebells is that it promotes functional</v>

16
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.690
strength. It promotes the entire body moving as a unit.

17
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.370
And that seems to apply very quickly to athletics.

18
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:13.610
It's one of the reasons why jujitsu people have adopted kettlebell training.

19
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.930
So almost universally. Absolutely. There.

20
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.570
<v 1>Are many reasons why, but that's one of.</v>

21
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.130
<v 0>Them. Yeah. And non-amous moves like Turkish get up,</v>

22
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:23.400
which is like one of the very best moves.

23
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.040
Forjijitsu it's just phenomenal for your stability, your core and your,

24
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:31.160
your ability to get out from under the bottom bottom positions.

25
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.160
And so just a phenomenal work, uh, phenomenal workout, but the, the,

26
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.280
the, these principles of using the entire body and, you know,

27
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.590
with he bells using different parts of your,

28
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:50.030
about using your legs, your core, your AB all in one,

29
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.990
one workout ISS also. So it's so effective time wise,

30
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.350
cuz you can get a spectacular workout in a very short amount of time.

31
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.683
<v 1>You're correct, Joe,</v>

32
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.900
maybe this is a good time to discuss the bad S of Kett bills versus let's say

33
00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:08.060
bar bills or body. Sure. That's very good conversation. That's a question.

34
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.940
Ask people, ask coffin. Right?

35
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.780
So I would name these as three top modalities for people. Yeah.

36
00:02:13.781 --> 00:02:15.860
There are some other additional things, dumb bills and whatever,

37
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.540
but that usually they're secondary.

38
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.660
So what are the respective benefits of these different modalities?

39
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.970
The body weight is obviously it's accessible.

40
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.210
It's with you no matter where you go, but interestingly enough,

41
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:34.050
the body weight requires the most coaching. So you have to, it's very subtle.

42
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:37.050
Like for example, if you look at developing something,

43
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:40.810
the gym is called the hollowlo position takes a lot of coaching to perform,

44
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.610
correct. Even pull up or pushup.

45
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.480
It's it's a lot of work well on like the squad so on and so forth.

46
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.800
So it's great and takes, but it just takes more time, more investment.

47
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.760
Also the downside of the body weight would be,

48
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.400
you can't really turn your lower back effectively and you have to turn your

49
00:02:56.401 --> 00:03:00.120
lower back to see young. You just have to, and whatever you do back extensions,

50
00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:03.240
other stuff, neck bridges, it's not gonna do for your back. Just won't.

51
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.800
So by the way, great modality. But with its these limitations,

52
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.760
the Barb bell, if you just love heavy stuff, it's awesome.

53
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.960
And it's just psychologically, it's extremely satisfying.

54
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.750
A heavy debt of let's say for some people not for all,

55
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.550
then if you're looking forward to maximize your muscle mass,

56
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.590
nobody has come up yet with anything other than the barbell. So, you know,

57
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.830
you start doing, you know, some repetition dadlift squad, so on.

58
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.910
So that's another reason, but let's say you are playing football, right?

59
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.980
The problem with the barbell, first of all, is the, um,

60
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.860
learning curve. It takes some time to learn it correctly.

61
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.580
It's not easy to master it. And it takes a lot of instruction.

62
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.060
In addition, um, the Barb is not forgiving.

63
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.940
So let's say that one of your shoulders is a Jack top.

64
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.890
It's just not very forgiving because you can't,

65
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:06.370
you just have to adjust yourself to the bar as opposed to make the implement,

66
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.770
adjust to yourself. So this is where the ketlet comes in. First of all,

67
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:14.930
the ketlebit because it moves freely. It adjusts to your body,

68
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.770
to your physiology, to your anatomy, I should say. So it works.

69
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.320
It works quite well. For example, mark Rifkin. He is, uh,

70
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.760
one of my top instructors.

71
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.520
He was a highly successful gymnast in the past and later on,

72
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:30.640
he was a coach for women's power lifting national team and great parlifter too.

73
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.240
So he cannot do byilateral exercise as well because

74
00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:39.840
of the mileage he sustained. He took a very bad landing as a gymnast,

75
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.270
ruins an knee. And then from there, other things went bad and back whatever. So,

76
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.470
but he can do one arm.

77
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.550
He cannot do two arm swings because it just messes him up. Mm.

78
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.110
But he can do one arm swing.

79
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.510
So the body see a little differently and he can handle it.

80
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.830
So it's with the proper medical clearance,

81
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.790
it's much easier to work around problems.

82
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.420
Then the offset center, gravity, that's just tremendous thing for your back.

83
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.980
I'm sorry for your shoulder. So the, the positions to put your shoulder in,

84
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.540
you cannot do with anything else, but, and you know,

85
00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:16.860
obviously you have the get up, which is an amazing exercise.

86
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.500
Cannot do it as well with other implements.

87
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.690
But the ballistics that another unique benefit of the kettlebell

88
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.330
swings and snatches exercises like that,

89
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.450
the benefits of these exercises are many. So first of all,

90
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:36.370
ballistic loading obviously is part of sports and it's a part of life.

91
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.970
And oftentimes it's hard to do it safely.

92
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.360
Go ahead, start jumping it like before somebody starts jumping correctly,

93
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.040
jumping off boxes and so on and so forth. Just even, you know,

94
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.320
hopping across the floor. It requires some coaching.

95
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.680
It requires getting some strength.

96
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.960
It requires addressing some dysfunction. So on and so forth.

97
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.000
The gettable swing, for example, it's

98
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.600
so many hard men with high mileage who are really banged up in so many different

99
00:06:10.601 --> 00:06:12.840
ways, their backs, their knees, their hips,

100
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.440
they're able to do swings safely and that's just remarkable.

101
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.790
And the ballistic contraction's very important. So you have to run,

102
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.630
you have to jump, you have to do things like that,

103
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.310
but it goes beyond that for your health for longevity.

104
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.710
So as we grow older, um,

105
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.980
there's a loss of type two muscle muscle fiber. So the strong ones,

106
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.780
the fast reach fibers, and there are several problems with that. First of all,

107
00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:47.460
they're metbolically needed for the body to be healthy, to process sugar. So on.

108
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.353
So on and so forth.

109
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.420
Second is to deal with real life situations. You know,

110
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.460
like as very unfortunate, some old person trips and breaks the,

111
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.250
a hip it's terrible. And oftentimes the reason's just weakness.

112
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.850
And we need these fast fibers because whenever

113
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:12.010
you trip and you have this reflexive contraction, these fibers go online first.

114
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.530
So if you don't have the money more, you got massive problems, right? So

115
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.840
another reason is in type two fibers.

116
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.280
There is, uh, miochondrial degeneration takes place as you grow older,

117
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.760
much faster than others. And if you don't take care of that,

118
00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:34.400
it's also that's aging. So you've gotta train this type two fibers.

119
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.430
And there are only two ways to train type two fibers it's heavy or fast.

120
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:40.990
So there's no third way.

121
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.870
So whenever people try to do some sort of a super slow this or

122
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.630
Pilates that whatever, it's not gonna do it.

123
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:54.030
So you have to train heavy or you have to train fast if you wanna stay

124
00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:54.850
young. So.

125
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.630
<v 0>Are you, uh, completely against that kind of super slow training?</v>

126
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.420
<v 1>Not at all, but for totally different reasons. There is. Um,</v>

127
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.940
well obviously one reason is possibly somebody's injured, right?

128
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.140
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; another reason is to develop your type one

129
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.300
endurance fibers hypertrophy for these fibers. Why would you want to do that?

130
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.140
Well, first of all, type one fibers,

131
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.970
they down side of these fibers is they cancontract slower.

132
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.210
So obviously that's a downside for some sports for some activities,

133
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.890
but they're also more efficient, which means it's plus for other sports, right?

134
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.210
So another positive here,

135
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.450
they already come prequiro maochondria so mitochondria.

136
00:08:39.451 --> 00:08:41.240
That's where IE metabolism takes place.

137
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.120
And by building your type one fibers,

138
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.200
you automatically get more endurance in addition to muscle mass and strength

139
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.480
too. So

140
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.640
super slow work is good for that, but it has to be done correctly.

141
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.500
Uh,

142
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.400
the proper methods were developed by Russian professor

143
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.240
vicilian. And so he developed this method.

144
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.880
I'm gonna summarize it for you right now for your, for your listeners.

145
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.520
That's something you can easily do yourself. Well,

146
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.640
easily is not the word simply.

147
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.070
So the duration of a set is

148
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.350
30 to 60 seconds.

149
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.230
You have to select the range of motion where there's no, uh,

150
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.190
there's no stacking. There's no, there's no support from your bones at all.

151
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.820
So for example, if you were to do a squat, you go down below parallel,

152
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.060
but not to the point where you're sitting on your calves and come up just a

153
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:47.020
little above parallel and below again. So just that most unpleasant,

154
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.260
the most painful area. Mm. If you're doing,

155
00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:53.660
let's say pushups for, for your chest, for example,

156
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.330
you would almost brush the deck with your chest,

157
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.890
come up about halfway and come back down. And the speed is very slow.

158
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.730
So there's no momentum at all. Now doesn't sound like anything new,

159
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.410
but here's, what's new. So Leana, I optimizeed the rest periods. And,

160
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.930
and that's a big game game changer.

161
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.000
Normally when people train in this manner bodybuils and others,

162
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.160
they just wanna get more burn possible. And by the way, the burn this awful.

163
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.240
And in this particular case, you want to train closer failure.

164
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.080
In this particular case, that's just a muscular training.

165
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.960
That's not strength training per se.

166
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.630
So they try to run for one set to the next. So they'll do that.

167
00:10:37.631 --> 00:10:40.110
Let's say that 30 seconds set, then they will just, you know,

168
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:43.070
rest for 30 seconds to do it again, completely hammer themselves.

169
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.350
The problem with that is even though we do not know the exact

170
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.830
mechanisms of fossil growth,

171
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.470
we do know that some lactic acid is needed,

172
00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.340
but too much llactic acid is destructive.

173
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.020
So what siion did is he figured out is after this kind of set,

174
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.180
you have to rest for five to 10 minutes. And that sounds for people it's, it's,

175
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:13.140
it's very hard mental thing to do. So here I am going for this massive burn

176
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.170
and I have to wait for five to 10 minutes, but it's very simple.

177
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:23.850
You introduce another exercise in between. So train twice a week,

178
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.530
five to five to 10 sets on the heavy day.

179
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.010
Eventually once you build up to it and about one to three sets in the light day,

180
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.770
that's it. Now this is incorporating super slow techniques. Oh yeah.

181
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.440
And who would this be good for? Wrestlers? Mm. For wrestlers is spectacular.

182
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.360
Yeah, because even though there are explosive elements there as well,

183
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:49.840
but it's also very much there's that static element, static endurance. And uh,

184
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.400
one of my strong first, one of my strong first instructors, Roger from the UK,

185
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.840
he, I had him follow this protocol, um,

186
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:04.160
before he and his crew rode across Atlantic and he did much better after most

187
00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:07.960
people and was much happier if you can be happier rowing across the Atlantic.

188
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.440
So for rowing, for wrestling, for body building,

189
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.430
for some people who cannot do anything else, so that's a good protocol.

190
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.883
So this is.

191
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.230
<v 0>Uh, essentially a muscular endurance protocol.</v>

192
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.950
<v 1>You know what, it's both because, because the muscle's getting bigger. Right.</v>

193
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.190
And it will get stronger as well, but it won't be faster.

194
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.430
<v 0>It's not something you would incorporate with a boxer.</v>

195
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.580
<v 1>I would. No, absolutely not. No, definitely. Rest are yes. MMA.</v>

196
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.540
You just have to use your judgment there, right.

197
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:39.500
Maybe certain muscle depending upon your style. Yeah. Yeah.
