00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. The Sandra bland case. Um,</v>

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.130
how does that one fit in? Because that one,

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.390
that the girl was pulled over the cop was

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.640
T she was failure to signal, right? I mean, it's a thing. It's a thing.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.200
And she started lighting cigarettes. He told,

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.400
told her to put the cigarette out and it all escalated from that.

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.120
She said she doesn't have to put the cigarette out. And then he's says,

8
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:31.530
he's got a lighter up, um, he's screaming at her. He pulls her out of the car.

9
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.430
He rests her.

10
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:37.380
And then is there controversy about whether or not she committed suicide in

11
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:41.420
jail? There is. I don't get into that, uh,

12
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.750
because it seemed, that seemed unlikely.

13
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.460
<v 1>That she was killed that.</v>

14
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.670
<v 0>Yes, it seemed likely that she was killed versus she committed suicide.</v>

15
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.540
I didn't think that someone would commit suicide being in jail for three days,

16
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.210
especially one of the things that you highlighted in the book,

17
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:01.670
and you actually played in the audio version of it,

18
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.470
her little sort of affirmations, you know, and she was,

19
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.090
she sounded very positive and upbeat and calling everybody Kings and Queens,

20
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:16.040
and it was thanking God and being very thankful and being

21
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:18.710
aware of, of life and, uh,

22
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.370
humility and just graciousness and gratitude.

23
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.140
It didn't seem, I mean,

24
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.070
obviously you don't know what kind of dark things can happen to a person when

25
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:30.470
they're incarcerated for three days for a reason.

26
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.610
Like how maybe that's the straw that broke the camel's back. But she did.

27
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.320
<v 1>Have, you know, she had a, uh, a complicated, um,</v>

28
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.510
emotional history. She had previously, I tried to commit suicide. Um,

29
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.510
and she'd had, she was emerging from a,

30
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.400
quite a difficult period in her life and went to Texas to start a new

31
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.180
leaf. And so there is an interpretation, like I said,

32
00:01:56.181 --> 00:02:00.170
I don't really have strong feelings on this particular part of the story,

33
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:04.310
but there's an interpretation that says here's a woman who's emerged from

34
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.250
very difficult period in her life goes, leave shoes. She was in Illinois.

35
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.610
She drives half across the country to start over.

36
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.420
And on the first day that she arrives in Texas to start over,

37
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.790
she gets pulled over by a cop. And by the way,

38
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:24.170
she had thousands of dollars in outstanding, uh, tickets.

39
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.150
So she had a history of this stuff with cops where, you know,

40
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:34.040
the same trap that many poor people in this country get into,

41
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:38.810
which is they get the police use, um, uh,

42
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.420
uh, uh, people as an ATM, right. They like set them off on trivial things.

43
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.630
And when they can't find when the campaign to find they get another fine.

44
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:50.510
And when you know how that goes, she was part of in that trap.

45
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.590
So here she is trying to start over. After difficult time gets first day,

46
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:58.130
she gets to Texas, she gets pulled over again and she, in her mind,

47
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.050
it's the same. She's like, oh my God, I tried to start over. And I can't,

48
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.970
and then she's in jail and she can't make bail. And, you know,

49
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.120
there's a scenario where you can see that she just began to despair.

50
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.530
<v 0>Don't they take away your shoelaces and, and do.</v>

51
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.110
<v 1>Yeah. Are they doing things by the book? I mean, I find the whole thing about,</v>

52
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.360
I went to that town when I was reporting the book and,

53
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.370
you know, the it's kind of hard to be,

54
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.690
to kill, to kill someone and get away, get away with,

55
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:38.490
it requires a level of expertise in forethought that struck me

56
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.470
was not present in that little town in Texas. I mean, a serious crime.

57
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.680
It's just not, I don't, they're not like, did not think in this,

58
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.730
these are not people playing chess. Right. I think they

59
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.260
encountered it with this cop and he's not very good at his job.

60
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.970
And he gets way over his head and he completely misreads her and he

61
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.570
pulls her off to jail, public, deeply regrets, the whole incident.

62
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.320
And they're all embarrassed and sitting around and hoping it'll just all go

63
00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:08.970
away. And meanwhile,

64
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:13.770
she's all alone in a prison cells spiraling deeper and deeper into

65
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.240
depression. I mean, it's, I think it's almost more tragic, um, um,

66
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.180
that she committed suicide. She committed suicide. It's insane.

67
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.710
<v 0>That you can keep someone in jail for three days for failure to signal.</v>

68
00:04:25.711 --> 00:04:30.300
It seems like there should have been an initial review of the circumstances that

69
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:32.460
led to her getting pulled out of the car in the first place.

70
00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:35.450
And the cops should've been fired immediately. They just said, look,

71
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.680
you're screaming at her because she lit a cigarette. Yeah.

72
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.640
<v 1>Well, this is fascinating. And I feel like,</v>

73
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.080
I don't know you and I are probably the same age. There's this? So the cops 29,

74
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.200
if you grew up with cigarettes,

75
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.980
you have a different understanding of the meaning of lighting a cigarette.

76
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.820
So what's happening in the encounter is he pulls her over.

77
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.220
What he does is he sees her coming out of this university campus.

78
00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:06.330
And while she's still on campus property, she rolls through a stop sign.

79
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.350
And then he notices that she's got out of state plates and she's a young black

80
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:15.180
woman and she's driving a Hyundai, like not a, not a Mercedes-Benz.

81
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.350
And he thinks, huh, I'm gonna check this out. So he,

82
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.130
she pulls onto the road and he drives up behind her

83
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.420
aggressively. He speeds up behind her. So what does she do? Well,

84
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.300
what any of us would do? She gets out of the way thinking, oh, he's,

85
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.500
he's going to, he's going to, you know, the scene of an accident or something.

86
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.890
I better get out of his way. She pulls over to get out of his way. And he goes,

87
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.740
oh, you didn't use your turning signal. And he pulls him,

88
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.320
pulls her over and pulls a minor. Now, by the way,

89
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.100
whenever I hear a fire department, truck,

90
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.980
or a police car coming, and I pull over to get out of the way,

91
00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:52.080
I do not use my turning signal. Right.

92
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.700
You just get out of the way it's reflexive.

93
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.520
So her immediate thought is what he does is, is like, oh, this is.

94
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.960
Eddie tricked me. And he knows what he's doing. That's exactly what he wanted.

95
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.200
He wanted to get her in a situation. Cause it's all a pretext he just wants.

96
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:09.290
He thinks, oh, maybe there's something weird with her. So then he,

97
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.890
we have this all on tape, of course, because this is,

98
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.640
and this is one of the incidents that was captured entirely on the dash cam,

99
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:20.240
the officer's dash cam, it goes up to the window and he says,

100
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.700
uh, he looks at her and he realizes she's agitated. Why? Because she's off.

101
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.260
And he goes, memes, there's something wrong. And she's like, well, you know,

102
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:32.090
I want to know why I'm bill over Bula.

103
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.570
And then he goes back to his car and he comes back to her.

104
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.590
And he later says in the deposition that when he goes back to his,

105
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.060
to his, uh, vehicle to check on her license and registration,

106
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.690
he begins to develop suspicions that she's up to no good she's got drugs or

107
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:48.524
guns.

108
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.420
And so she comes back and it commenced to have this increasingly heated

109
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:54.254
conversation.

110
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.630
And she lights the cigarette because she's trying

111
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:02.210
to calm herself down. And this is my point.

112
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.930
You and I who grew up in an era where people smoked all the time,

113
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.170
know that one of the principle functions of lighting a cigarette was to calm

114
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:12.170
your nerves. And in her mind, I think in her mind,

115
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:16.580
she's trying to signal to the cop. Let's deescalate this.

116
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.730
And I'm one of the ways I'm going to show you that I want to deescalate.

117
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:24.320
This is I'm going to take a moment and light a cigarette and

118
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.800
just take it down a notch and let's have a real conversation.

119
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.140
He doesn't understand the meaning of that gesture. And he thinks, oh, she,

120
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:36.650
he thinks several things. He thinks one she's messing with me.

121
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:39.800
She's defying my authority by lighting a cigarette.

122
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:43.820
She's going to blow smoke in my face or something, you know, nefarious,

123
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:46.580
or she's going to like take the light cigarette and put it out of my,

124
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.020
he has all these kind of weird, crazy fantasies.

125
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:55.220
This is what he said in his deposition. Oh yeah. He, so even on the level,

126
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.970
I try and identify in the book all of the different ways.

127
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.920
And this is when I come back to the case at the end of the book,

128
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:02.090
I go through this in more detail,

129
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.480
all the different ways in which he completely misunderstands her.

130
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.980
And one of them is he doesn't understand the meaning of letting a cigarette in a

131
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:13.760
moment of tension. Um, and that's, you know,

132
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.950
still more evidence why you need,

133
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.800
if you're a cop or anyone dealing with a stranger,

134
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:20.480
you need to slow down and jot,

135
00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:23.270
not jump to any conclusions because there's so much you can miss.

136
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.250
<v 0>What it seemed to me when I listened to it initially.</v>

137
00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:29.350
And then I listened to it again in your audio book,

138
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.130
there's a thing that happens with police officers.

139
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.690
And I've never been a police officer,

140
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:36.790
but I was a security guard for a brief period of time.

141
00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:38.200
And I recognized it in myself.

142
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.760
And I recognized in a lot of people that I work with is that you start treating

143
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.800
the other people like the other, like it's us and them.

144
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.280
It was us. I worked at, uh, great, uh, great woods.

145
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.330
It's a performance center in Mansfield, Massachusetts like this.

146
00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.210
And we would catch a lot of people, smuggling booze in things like that.

147
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.470
And there was an attitude that you got,

148
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:08.910
and I was only there for one summer, but there's an attitude of, they were,

149
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.540
they were the bad people and you were the good guys. It was us and them.

150
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:17.370
And we stuck together and they weren't us and cops get

151
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:21.990
that a hundred times worse because there's guns involved and they can get

152
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:22.501
shot at.

153
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:27.090
And we've all seen videos of gun cops pulling people over and he says,

154
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:29.460
can I see your hands please? And the guy pulls out a gun and shoots out them.

155
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.560
We've all seen those videos. Those are real.

156
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.440
This is all always in the back of the mind of cops. Yeah.

157
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.010
And I think that was just a guy who, as you said,

158
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:41.220
29 years old is a young guy. He's not that bright,

159
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.650
not good at communication.

160
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.810
And he is this attitude that he's a cop and that you have to listen to the

161
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:51.030
cops cause he's them. And you're you.

162
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.610
And that that's like when he's telling her to put the cigarette out and she's

163
00:09:56.611 --> 00:09:59.340
saying, I don't have to do that. And he's saying, get out of your vehicle.

164
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:02.580
And she's saying, I don't have to do that. And then he's screaming at her.

165
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.610
I mean, that's, that's all right there. I mean, so it seems like to me,

166
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:07.710
he wants compliance. He wants her to listen.

167
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.940
<v 1>He does. Yeah, he does what he gets. It's funny.</v>

168
00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:14.690
The what's remarkable about that tape,

169
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.290
which I must've seen 50 times. Um,

170
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.450
and which has been viewed on YouTube, you know,

171
00:10:20.451 --> 00:10:23.930
even a couple million times is how quickly it escalates.

172
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.610
The whole thing is it's insanely short. You,

173
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.970
you would think if I was telling you the story of this, you would think, oh,

174
00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:35.960
this unfolds over 10 minutes and it doesn't,

175
00:10:35.961 --> 00:10:40.910
it unfolds over a minute and a half. Um, and that, when I remember years ago,

176
00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:45.380
I wrote, uh, uh, my second book blank and I have in that book,

177
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.910
a chapter about a very famous infamous police shooting in New York case of

178
00:10:49.911 --> 00:10:51.590
Amadou Diallo. Remember that,

179
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.990
remember that one would be shot like 40 times by cops.

180
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.030
And one of the big things I was interested in, uh,

181
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.120
talking about in that case was how long does it take?

182
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.040
How long did it take for that whole terrible sequence to go down?

183
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.240
So from the moment the police develop it, uh,

184
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.050
suspicions about Amadou Diallo to the moment that I'm going to Dell was lying

185
00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:17.810
dead on his front porch. How long,

186
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.520
how much time elapsed and the answer is like two seconds. It's boom, boom, boom.

187
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.440
It's like, and I had a conversation with I'm actually here in the valley with,

188
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:32.360
uh, uh, Gavin de Becker. Um, was he ever been on your show? No. Oh,

189
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.950
fascinating guy.

190
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.270
<v 2>And we were security experts, security experts. Incredibly interesting guys.</v>

191
00:11:38.271 --> 00:11:41.030
Friends with Sam Harris. I know that. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.380
<v 1>Um,</v>

193
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:47.090
and he was talking about this question of time that when you're a security

194
00:11:47.091 --> 00:11:49.700
guard, guarding someone, you know, famous,

195
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.760
a lot of what you're trying to do is to inject time the scenario,

196
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.380
instead of you don't want something to unfold in a second and a half where you

197
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:00.970
have almost no time to react properly,

198
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.940
or what you want to do is to allow it to unfold in five seconds.

199
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.940
If you're going to add, I'm making this up, I can't remember his exact term,

200
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:11.710
but basically what your job is, is to add seconds into the,

201
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.020
the encounter so that you have a chance to intelligently respond to what's

202
00:12:17.021 --> 00:12:20.650
going on. And so he was hit this great riff about, um,

203
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.210
how good Israeli, uh, uh,

204
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.180
secrets secret service guys are. And one of the things they do is they're,

205
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.260
they're, uh, they're either not armed or they don't,

206
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.660
they're trained not to go for their weapons.

207
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.250
And he situations because his point is so say you're guardian to precedent.

208
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.220
You're a body man, but the president, you walk it through a crowd.

209
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.900
Somebody comes up to you like pulls a gun, wants to shoot the president.

210
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.490
His point is if you're the secret security guy and your first instinct in

211
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:54.490
response to someone pulling a gun is to go for your own gun.

212
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.320
You've lost a second and a half, right? Your hands got to go down to your,

213
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.260
your whole focus is on getting to your own gun. And in the meantime,

214
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.340
the other guy whose gun's already out has already shot. You've lost.

215
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.320
You need to be someone who forgets about your own gun and just focuses on

216
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.620
the, on the man in front of you, right. And protected the president.

217
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.800
But it was all in the context of time,

218
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.920
is this really crucial, um,

219
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.790
variable in these kinds of encounters and everything as a police officer,

220
00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:29.110
you should be doing is slowing it down. Um, wait,

221
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.120
uh, you know, analyze what's happening. And that's what he doesn't do.

222
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.220
The competence instance speeds it up, right? He goes to Def con you know,

223
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:43.420
she lights a cigarette and within seconds he screaming at her. This is a,

224
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.940
you know, a parent shouldn't do that. I mean,

225
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.400
let a little police officer by the side of the highway.

226
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.410
<v 0>The differences he knows she's not a criminal. I mean, he,</v>

227
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.970
he must know it's.

228
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.500
He's pulling her over because he's trying to write a ticket and the way he's

229
00:13:58.501 --> 00:14:02.790
communicating with her, when she lights a cigarette, it's like, she's inferior.

230
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.390
Like he, this is not someone who's scared.

231
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.440
He's not scared of a perpetrator is not scared that there's a criminal in the

232
00:14:10.441 --> 00:14:14.640
car about to shoot him. He's not scared of that at all. He wants utter,

233
00:14:14.641 --> 00:14:19.020
total complete compliance. And he's talking to her like,

234
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.390
like he's a drill Sergeant, but Kent.

235
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:26.400
<v 1>You can't, both those things be true. How so? Well in that,</v>

236
00:14:26.401 --> 00:14:27.780
so in the deposition he gives,

237
00:14:27.781 --> 00:14:31.170
which I get to the end of the book and I got the tape of the deposition is it's

238
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.330
totally fascinating. It's like,

239
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.170
he's sitting down with the investigating officer, uh, in, uh,

240
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.750
looking into the death of Sandra bland. And he's got,

241
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.190
I don't know how long it is two hours.

242
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.520
And he's walking them through what he was thinking that day.

243
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.650
And he makes the case that he was terrified that he was

244
00:14:49.651 --> 00:14:53.690
convinced. He, he says, he goes back to his squad car.

245
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.080
He comes up and as summit, there's some evidence to support this.

246
00:14:57.081 --> 00:15:02.000
So he pulls her over and he goes to the passenger side window and leans

247
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:05.210
in and says, ma'am you realize why I pulled you over and blah, blah, blah,

248
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.250
and Z. Okay. Cause he, she doesn't seem right to him. She gives him her license.

249
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:13.640
He goes back to his squad car and he says, while he's in the squad car,

250
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.660
he looks ahead. And he sees her making what he calls furtive movements.

251
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.273
So he's like.

252
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.500
<v 0>Furtive movements. Also. He sinks.</v>

253
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.370
<v 1>She's being all kind of jumpy. And you don't know, he isn't. He just says,</v>

254
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:27.620
I saw her moving around in ways that didn't make me happy.

255
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.520
And then when he returns to the car, he returns driver's side,

256
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.090
which is crucial because if you're a cop, you go driver's side.

257
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:38.390
Only if you think that you might be in danger, right? He doesn't,

258
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.970
if you go driver's side, you're exposing yourself to the road.

259
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.280
The only reason you do that is that when your driver's side,

260
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.100
you can see the it's very, very difficult.

261
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.960
If someone has a gun to shoot the police police officer, who's pulled them over.

262
00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:53.090
If the police officer is on the driver's side, right.

263
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:56.410
You have an angle if they're on the passenger side. So why does he go?

264
00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.840
If he thinks she's harmless? There's no reason for him to go back driver's side.

265
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.680
I think this guy, I think these two things are linked. I actually believe him.

266
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.930
He constructs this ridiculous fantasy about how she's dangerous,

267
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.100
but I think that's just what he was trained to do. He's a paranoid cop.

268
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.710
And then why is he so insistent that she be compliant for the same

269
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:22.340
reason? Because he's terrified. He's like, do exactly what I say.

270
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.690
Cause I don't know what the what's going to happen here. Right. And she's, I,

271
00:16:26.691 --> 00:16:30.800
you know, I, I don't know. I, I don't think those two, uh,

272
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:35.860
those two strains of, uh, of interpretation are mutually exclusive. Hmm.

273
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.060
<v 0>That's interesting. It didn't sound like he was scared at all.</v>

274
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.230
It sounded like he was that she wasn't listening to him. Yeah. I didn't,

275
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:48.970
I didn't think he sounded even remotely scared. I felt like he had,

276
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.710
I mean, we're reading into it.

277
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.140
<v 3>Right, right. I have no idea. But from.</v>

278
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.030
<v 0>My interpretation was he had decided that she wasn't listening to him</v>

279
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.210
and he was going to make her listen to him. That's what I got out of it.

280
00:17:01.211 --> 00:17:02.230
I didn't get any fear.

281
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:06.700
And I thought that version of it that he described just sounds like horseshit.

282
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.870
It sounds like what you would say after the fact to strengthen your case.

283
00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.470
<v 1>Well, the, so there's another element here. Did I get into,</v>

284
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.210
which is I got his record as a police officer. So it'd been on the,

285
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.030
on the forest for, I forgot nine, 10 months.

286
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.670
And we have a record of every traffic stop he ever made.

287
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.610
And when you look at his list of traffic stops,

288
00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:32.200
you re you realize that what happened that day with Sandra bland,

289
00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:37.270
it was not an anomaly that he's one of those guys who pulls over everyone for

290
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.490
reasons hold along. So I think I forgotten exact number, but in the hour,

291
00:17:42.491 --> 00:17:46.690
before he pulled over Sandra bland, he pulled over four people,

292
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:51.030
four other people for equally ridiculous. He's that cop.

293
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.150
And he's that cop because he's been trained that way. Right?

294
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.090
That's kind of quotas, strain, strain of modern policing,

295
00:17:57.091 --> 00:18:00.540
which says go beyond the ticket, pull someone over. If you,

296
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.140
if anything looks a little bit weird because you might find something else. Now,

297
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.470
if you look at his history as a cop, he almost never found anything else.

298
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.710
His history is a cop. In fact, I went through this,

299
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.010
I forget how many hundreds of traffic stops he had in nine months.

300
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.200
If you go through them, he has like,

301
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.290
once he found some marijuana on a kid and by the way,

302
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.950
the town in which he was working as a college town. So I mean, how hard is that?

303
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.780
Uh, I think he found a gun once misdemeanor gun, uh,

304
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.730
but everything else was like pulling over people for, you know, the, uh,

305
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.540
the light above their license plate was out.

306
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.760
That that's the level of stuff he was using.

307
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:43.560
He did this all day long every day.

308
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.910
So he's like to him, it's second nature. Yeah. Pull her over.

309
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.990
Like who knows what's going on? She's out of state. She's young black woman.

310
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:56.120
<v 0>Was this comparable to the way the rest of the cops in the force in his division</v>

311
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.750
did it.

312
00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.470
<v 1>Well, I looked at, I didn't look at the rest of the cops on his voice.</v>

313
00:19:00.471 --> 00:19:02.420
What I looked at were, uh,

314
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:07.040
state numbers to the wherever there several American states give us

315
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:11.570
like North Carolina, for example, will give us, um, precise,

316
00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.760
um, uh,

317
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:18.590
complete statistics on the number of traffic stops done by their

318
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.550
police officers and the reasons for those stops. So when you look at that,

319
00:19:22.551 --> 00:19:25.550
so I have the, I look at the North Carolina numbers, for example,

320
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.840
in the North Carolina highway patrol,

321
00:19:26.841 --> 00:19:30.860
it's the same thing they're pulling over unbelievable numbers of people and

322
00:19:30.861 --> 00:19:35.570
finding nothing like night, you know, 1% less than 1% hit rates.

323
00:19:35.571 --> 00:19:38.990
In some cases of being hit red, being, finding something of interest.

324
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.560
So like they're pulling over 99 people for no reason,

325
00:19:42.561 --> 00:19:45.800
or to find one person who's got, you know,

326
00:19:45.801 --> 00:19:48.380
a bag of dope or something in the car.

327
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.430
You cannot conduct policing in,

328
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.280
in a civil society like that.

329
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:59.000
And expect to have decent relationships between law enforcement and the civilian

330
00:19:59.001 --> 00:19:59.834
population.

331
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.530
<v 0>Yeah, no question. But doesn't that sort of support the idea that he's full of,</v>

332
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.100
that he was really concerned that she had something he'd never encountered

333
00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:07.934
anything.

334
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.180
<v 1>Well, or, or this was the one,</v>

335
00:20:11.181 --> 00:20:13.730
the fantasy in his head is so what, so the question is,

336
00:20:13.731 --> 00:20:16.730
why does he keep doing it? If this is a guy who day in day out,

337
00:20:16.731 --> 00:20:20.180
pulls over people for no reason and finds nothing and continues to do it.

338
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.740
Now there's two explanations.

339
00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:25.700
One is he's totally cynical and thinks this is the way to be an effective police

340
00:20:25.701 --> 00:20:27.080
officer X mission.

341
00:20:27.081 --> 00:20:30.470
Number two is this is a guy who has a powerful fantasy in his head.

342
00:20:30.471 --> 00:20:33.200
That one day I'm going to hit the jackpot.

343
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.980
I'm an open the trunk and is going to be 15 pounds of heroin.

344
00:20:36.981 --> 00:20:39.260
And I'm going to be the biggest star, whoever lived.

345
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.760
<v 0>I think there's also a rush of just being able to get people to pull over this,</v>

346
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.970
the compliance thing, which is another reason why he was so furious.

347
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.960
She wasn't listening to him and she kept a cigarette lit.

348
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.980
<v 1>Yeah. Or she was listening, but not complying. Yes.</v>

349
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.920
<v 0>Yeah. Um, w what are the laws, I mean,</v>

350
00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:58.950
are you allowed to smoke a cigarette in your car when a cop pulls you over?

351
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.190
How's it work like that? Yeah.

352
00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.910
<v 1>I mean, of course, yeah. It can't stop you from engaging.</v>

353
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.490
<v 0>The kids tell you to put out your cigarette. There's no law that.</v>

354
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.920
<v 1>He could have said. I mean, no, there's no law. I mean, the two things,</v>

355
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:19.350
the courts historically give enormously way to the police officers

356
00:21:19.351 --> 00:21:24.300
in a traffic stop, as opposed to a person to person stop. But, uh, but no,

357
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.770
I mean, this is about what he should've said is he could've said,

358
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.240
um, ma'am do you mind, um,

359
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.900
I would prefer if you put out the cigarette while we're talking,

360
00:21:36.901 --> 00:21:39.090
or I'm allergic to smoke or whatever, I mean,

361
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.840
there's a million ways for him to do it nicely. He's a about it.

362
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.710
<v 0>But he's, I mean, he's basically doing the job, like a,</v>

363
00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.770
he's doing a version of being a cop.

364
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.280
<v 1>So this is, so this is one of a really,</v>

365
00:21:53.281 --> 00:21:55.620
really crucial point in the argument of the book, which is,

366
00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:01.170
I think the real lesson of that case is not that he's a bad cop. He's in fact,

367
00:22:01.171 --> 00:22:06.090
doing precisely as he is, was in trained and instructed to do he's,

368
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.330
uh, he's the ideal cop. Um,

369
00:22:09.331 --> 00:22:13.500
and the problem is with the particular philosophy of law enforcement that has

370
00:22:13.501 --> 00:22:15.450
emerged over the last 10 years in this country,

371
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.380
which has incentivized and, um,

372
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:24.150
encouraged police officers to engage in these incredibly

373
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.380
low reward activities like pulling over a hundred people or to find one person

374
00:22:28.381 --> 00:22:32.430
who's caught something wrong that has become enshrined in the strategy of many

375
00:22:32.431 --> 00:22:36.150
police forces around the country. They tell them to do this.

376
00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:39.540
I have a whole section, a book, right. Go through in detail.

377
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.980
One of the most important police training manuals, um, uh,

378
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.330
which is, you know,

379
00:22:45.331 --> 00:22:48.390
required reading for somebody coming up and which they just walk you through

380
00:22:48.391 --> 00:22:49.020
this. Like,

381
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:53.550
it is your job to pull over lots and lots and lots and lots of people.

382
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.670
Even if you only find something in a small percentage of cases,

383
00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.690
why that's what being a proactive police officer is all about. Right?

384
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:05.340
So they are trained to that phrase, go beyond the ticket is a,

385
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:10.380
is a term of art in police training. Like you gotta be thinking, you show,

386
00:23:10.381 --> 00:23:13.170
you pull them over for having a taillight that's out, but you're look,

387
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.430
you're thinking beyond that.

388
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.340
Is there something else in the car that's problematic?

389
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.650
That's what you're trying to find. So there,

390
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.520
he was being a dutiful police officer and the,

391
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:28.500
the answer is to re-examine our philosophies of law enforcement.

392
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:32.310
Not to not, I mean, you can't dismiss this thing by saying, oh,

393
00:23:32.311 --> 00:23:35.100
that's just a particularly bad cop. It's not great,

394
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.950
but I don't know if he's any worse than, you know,

395
00:23:37.951 --> 00:23:39.480
he's just doing what he was trained to do.

396
00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:41.610
That's the issue should be trained to do them in deference.

397
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.010
<v 0>Right. That is the issue, right? The issue is there.</v>

398
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:49.460
This is practice to treat citizens that are doing nothing wrong

399
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:54.380
as if they're criminals and pull them over and give them extreme paranoia and

400
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:57.640
freak them out. Yeah. I have to find something. Boom.

401
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.850
<v 1>I'm Canadian. And I was home in Canada,</v>

402
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.710
small-town Canada a couple weeks ago. And I saw in the pack,

403
00:24:05.711 --> 00:24:07.180
you know how these cars always have,

404
00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.970
they're often had a slogan on the side of the car, the back of the car.

405
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.650
So in my little hometown, in Southwestern, Ontario, sleepy, you know,

406
00:24:14.651 --> 00:24:15.790
farm country, the,

407
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.320
the slogan on the back of the police cars is people helping people,

408
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.510
right? So Canadian, right?

409
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.450
And like the extent I understand that this is a country with very,

410
00:24:28.451 --> 00:24:29.800
very low levels of gun ownership,

411
00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:33.040
which means that a police officer does not enter into an encounter with a

412
00:24:33.041 --> 00:24:37.390
civilian with the same degree of fear or paranoia that the civilian has a

413
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.730
handgun. Right. Which is a big part of this,

414
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.930
regardless of how one feels about gun laws in this country.

415
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.470
The fact that there are lots of guns mean makes the job of a police officer a

416
00:24:47.471 --> 00:24:50.320
lot harder. And every police officer will tell you that in Canada,

417
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.740
that you don't have that fear, but it's also Canada and it's small town, Canada.

418
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:58.060
And so when you encounter a police officer in my little town, he's like,

419
00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.740
he's people helping people, right? He's like, he's like driving like a Camry.

420
00:25:02.741 --> 00:25:03.940
And he's, you know,

421
00:25:03.941 --> 00:25:08.260
he's like this genial person who was a really Camry means I forgotten exactly

422
00:25:08.261 --> 00:25:10.300
what the drive. They're not, they're not driving.

423
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.820
<v 2>Cars. Yeah. Explorers.</v>

424
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.750
<v 1>Painted black with like big bull bars at the front. Right. Uh,</v>

425
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.280
and then you.

426
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.530
<v 2>Go, you know, you go, I mean.</v>

427
00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:24.850
<v 1>Even in LA, here in LA, like the cars are painted black and white.</v>

428
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.930
It's really, they look for rochus. I mean, is that what it is?

429
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.180
They look for OSHAs too. They just look,

430
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.420
they identify as police to connect to a Canadian. Looks.

431
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.940
<v 2>To me, it looks a little, why do they have.</v>

432
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.930
<v 1>To pay it up? Black forgot stuff. They open Raiders. I mean, it's like.</v>

433
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.800
<v 2>What do you think they should pay them something mild and like bright, yellow,</v>

434
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.530
something lovely, something lovely. Like.

435
00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.890
<v 1>A nice, can you imagine it like a teal or green?</v>

436
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.870
<v 0>Well, that would be, yeah,</v>

437
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.850
because there's a lot of black cars and a lot of white cars,

438
00:25:54.851 --> 00:25:58.840
not a lot of teal cars, so it would, yeah. It would stand out like, oh,

439
00:25:58.841 --> 00:26:03.490
it's a cop. Is pink car. Well, you know, this kind of symbolism.

440
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.570
<v 2>Matters. Right. You're projecting an image.</v>

441
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:11.820
<v 0>Joe Arpaio, who makes all of his prisoners wear pink. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

442
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.940
That's kind of a thing. Well, I mean the two against his point though,

443
00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:20.590
how many women shoot cops? Isn't that an insanely low number?

444
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:25.030
Yeah. I mean, insanely low. I mean, w w what are the numbers? I mean,

445
00:26:25.031 --> 00:26:28.960
it's probably almost nonexistent. Yeah. Guys pull over women.

446
00:26:28.961 --> 00:26:31.360
I don't think they're worried about being shot. I really don't.

447
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.720
I think it's horse. I think it's all after the fact,

448
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.940
he was trying to concoct some sort of an excuse I.

449
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.730
<v 1>Was going to excuse for. Um, is he still on the force?</v>

450
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.850
I know he he's either.

451
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.610
He's kicked off for, I forgotten the precise language they used,

452
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:52.290
but for basically being impolite to a civilian.

453
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.640
But, um, yeah, I don't think there's a lot of, um, uh, but I don't know whether,

454
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.790
I mean, I still think we're saying the same thing,

455
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.470
which is the thing that's driving him. His motivation is not rational.

456
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.290
Right. And if you were a rational actor,

457
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.180
you would never engage in an activity where 99.9% of your police stops,

458
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.460
resulted in nothing. Right.

459
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.590
He's he is often some weird kind of fantasy land for a

460
00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:23.580
reason, which is, that's what, in certain jurisdictions in this country,

461
00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:27.180
that's what law enforcement has come to look at. Right. Like, um, and that's,

462
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:29.300
that's problematic. It's a huge problem.
