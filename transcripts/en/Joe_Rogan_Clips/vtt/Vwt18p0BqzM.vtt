00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.200
<v 3>There's too many of 'em. It's amazing. They're still alive. Isn't it?</v>

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.440
So many of 'em when you see one how ancient they look. Yeah.

4
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.680
<v 1>They're dinosaurs. They're legit dinosaurs, right? Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.040
And they're all over the place. We were talking the other day about, uh,

6
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:18.600
Disneyland in Florida that over the last few years they've pulled hundreds of

7
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.790
alligators outta Disney world. Dude.

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.870
<v 0>That girl got eaten. Yeah. A little kid. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.830
<v 1>Yeah. Imagine your two year old. You remember?</v>

10
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.150
You remember what it was like when your, your kids were two. Yeah.

11
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:31.310
Like you love them so much. You're so protective of them. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

12
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.710
<v 0>Yeah. They're so vulnerable and.</v>

13
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.030
<v 1>Kill killed by an alligator.</v>

14
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.430
<v 0>Yeah. That is a lawsuit.</v>

15
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.340
<v 1>Oh God. I'm sure. But they probably just paid 'em off. I mean,</v>

16
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:47.580
Disneyland's just printing money. Yeah. Or Disney world. Yeah.

17
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:50.580
Disneyland's been shut down for a year.

18
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.380
<v 0>Is that the one in California?</v>

19
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.740
<v 1>Yeah. They're open again now.</v>

20
00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:57.660
But they were trying to Sue to try to get open again. You know, they had the,

21
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.180
the strictest laws in California when it came to COVID,

22
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.690
but it didn't have an impact on like the number of cases.

23
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.290
It didn't have the impact on the number of deaths. Yeah.

24
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:10.490
Like in comparison to Florida where they just went buck wild and wide open.

25
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.770
Right. It's like Florida did better.

26
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.530
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; with their cunty alligators wandering around.

27
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.240
<v 0>Now they got, the Everglades are filled with Ana pythons.</v>

28
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.400
Oh, pythons.

29
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.680
<v 1>Yeah. They killed all the mammals.</v>

30
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.040
They did this study on mammals in the Everglades. Yeah.

31
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:33.680
They used to have raccoons and marsh hairs and all these different deer.

32
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.920
Nothing. Wow. Nothing everything's gone. It's all pythons.

33
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.960
Its pythons and alligators. It's so bad. Now that pythons are eating alligators.

34
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.270
<v 0>I saw video of that. It's crazy.</v>

35
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.870
<v 1>Ah, there's a, there's a photo famous photo. Florida.</v>

36
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:52.870
Python challenge gets underway with a new $10,000 prize. Yeah.

37
00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:57.870
They're trying to, what they really should do is, uh, first of all, California,

38
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.870
which is so dumb, you can't buy Python goods.

39
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.900
<v 0>Why?</v>

40
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.220
<v 1>Because they're. They've just decided that's an exotic and we don't want it.</v>

41
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.660
It's just political. It's completely. It's it's it's all about optics, right?

42
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:14.340
Like the idea that you're gonna have these exotics,

43
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.700
like why is it okay to have like lamb skin or

44
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.740
sheep skin? Why is that? Okay? Yeah.

45
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:25.530
Why is it okay to have OS with sheeps skin inside of 'em that's okay. It's okay.

46
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:28.770
To have a leather jacket. It's not okay to have a CTY Python. Yeah.

47
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.730
Like what the? That's crazy. Doesn't make any sense. Yeah.

48
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:35.130
There's no logic to it at all. Hmm. You can't have pythons. And meanwhile,

49
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.650
what they should do is make it a available everywhere and,

50
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.570
and make it so it's commercially fishable that you can go or huntable.

51
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.080
You can go out the there and collect these pythons. If it's very valuable,

52
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.280
they'll they'll at least be able to put a dent. The problem is it's all swamps.

53
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.600
So they can't even find them.

54
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.400
<v 0>They're never gonna put a dent. That, that is that ship is sail. Look.</v>

55
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.120
<v 1>At this 185 pound Burmese Python captured in Naples might be the</v>

56
00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:04.000
heaviest in Florida history. How big.

57
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.120
<v 2>That I think it might've been 16 feet. They also got a, this was a female.</v>

58
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.840
They got a male that was 140 with it.

59
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.160
<v 1>I saw one there's one somewhere that how big do those things get? Like,</v>

60
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:20.030
what's the biggest Python. I was looking at some thing on the, uh, internet.

61
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.943
And I was like, is this real?

62
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.590
Cuz it was said they found a 30 foot Python and it was eating dogs.

63
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.883
<v 0>Oh yeah.</v>

64
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.430
<v 1>They get that big. Well.</v>

65
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.150
<v 0>It ate a alligator longest alligator.</v>

66
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.230
<v 2>Long. According to this longest in Florida. Uh, 18.9.</v>

67
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.700
<v 1>Feet. What about longest in like, uh, I think this was in um, some Indonesia,</v>

68
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.620
south Pacific, somewhere in the, a, in Asia. It's all pets.

69
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.420
<v 0>85 Pounds is big enough to eat 150 pound man.</v>

70
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.060
<v 1>Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's wall Jojo. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.140
Another thing they have in Florida that's everywhere is IU.

72
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.740
Gus mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; everywhere. Yeah. There's I've been,

73
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.050
I've went down a YouTube rabbit hole the other day where people hunt and cook

74
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.210
iguanas in their backyard. Wow. Yeah. Cause people who live on canals,

75
00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:08.130
they live near canals. They uh,

76
00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:12.530
they get like a bow fishing setup and they're out there shooting and killing AU

77
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.410
GUAS and they turn 'em into chicken wings. Wow. Yeah.

78
00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:19.890
They whack their legs off and they fry 'em they fry 'em up and they batter 'em

79
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:23.400
and make like these, it looks delicious. Like these Asian dishes,

80
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.440
this might be the one that's it? That's the one. So 33 feet. 33 feet. Holy.

81
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.120
That's exactly the one. Where was that? It says it was excuse me in Brazil.

82
00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:36.800
Brazil. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Oh my God. Oh my God.

83
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.430
The size of that thing. Holy. Are you? You can't fake that.

84
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.990
<v 0>Right? What is that thing? Eat.</v>

85
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.350
<v 1>Dogs. That's what they were saying. Giant snake found in Brazil. 10 meters.</v>

86
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.870
Wow. Oh my God. Look how fat that thing is.

87
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.430
That is so crazy. That that's a real creature that lives alongside us.

88
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.100
A imagine if you're just hiking and you see a 30 foot it's snake staring you

89
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.380
down. I mean that is so big.

90
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.300
<v 0>Wait, that's an Anaconda. Is the Python in Anaconda?</v>

91
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.300
<v 1>The same thing? No different 33 foot Anaconda. Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.100
Well that was that movie with Jennifer Lopez.

93
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.060
Remember Anaconda mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; where they were even bigger because they,

94
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.730
they think that there used to be giant anacondas in the Amazon that were even

95
00:05:22.731 --> 00:05:25.650
bigger than that. Like what is the biggest,

96
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.010
like the myth of the giant Anaconda is something that's apparently it's in

97
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:32.170
dispute. Whether or not they're real thing. That's.

98
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.090
<v 2>I, I was trying to find the biggest Python, which I did see it.</v>

99
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.010
Does this say a reticulate Python can grow up to 30.

100
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.010
<v 1>Feet, but anacondas I believe are, are bigger. I.</v>

101
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.880
<v 2>Typed in biggest snake. That's how I got that.</v>

102
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.040
<v 1>Which was Anaconda.</v>

103
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.000
I think they think that at one point in time anacondas would get to a hundred

104
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.640
feet long. Like there's all, it's all meth.

105
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.160
It's hard to tell what's horses or not.

106
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.600
But there's like photos of ones that people took from planes where you see this

107
00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:02.400
thing that looks like a telephone pole, but a hundred foot long telephone pole.

108
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.920
Yeah. Making its way through the water like that big. Wow.

109
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.120
I don't know if it's real.

110
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.320
<v 0>Though. Dude. The alligators get big in Florida too. My, uh,</v>

111
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.390
my mom lives down there and she plays golf and there's a,

112
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.030
a pond that has alligators in it. Like on the golf course on the golf course,

113
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:23.510
they just wander around &lt;laugh&gt;.

114
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.990
And so she was standing on the edge of the pond. One day,

115
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.990
her ball is near the edge. And for some reason she decides to play it,

116
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.350
not kick it out in the fairway. She plays it from the edge.

117
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.500
She takes the club back and she lose her balance and falls in the water

118
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.100
over her head goes under and then goes to get out of the water. And she's,

119
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.780
she's like pulling herself up, but it's a muddy slope and she can't get out.

120
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:50.340
She's like flailing on the side. Oh my.

121
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.100
And somebody helps her out and she got out the water and I mean, she,

122
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.300
she was so scared that when she got,

123
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.210
she started laughing and she was laying on the side of the pond, but.

124
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.243
<v 1>Like two minutes.</v>

125
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.890
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; my mom's like five, two.</v>

126
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.650
<v 1>Oh my God. She's 78 years old. Oh my God. &lt;laugh&gt; imagine.</v>

127
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.490
That's how she went out. Yeah. Golfing near.

128
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.370
<v 0>A pond, getting spun around in circles by an alligator in the water.</v>

129
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.880
What's the worst animal to die at the hands of if you had to choose.

130
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.120
<v 1>Probably hyenas wolves. Hyen cuz they eat you guts first. Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.800
Yeah. If you see hyena videos,

132
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.200
they're they're pulling like Gazelle's they pull their guts out. Uhhuh.

133
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.870
They're eating 'em guts. First coyotes do that too. They eat you first.

134
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.390
<v 0>Oh wow. The.</v>

135
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.670
<v 1>Yeah. Um, a friend of mine who was a wildlife biologist was telling me about,</v>

136
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.990
um, there,

137
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:52.910
there was a girl who got killed in Canada a few years back by coyotes and

138
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.030
the particular area where she was in, she was a real, um, a petite girl.

139
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.460
And she apparently was a very talented singer.

140
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.580
She was a talented like folk singer or um, yeah, I think that's what it was.

141
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:08.780
I think she was a folk singer and uh, strong for a walk. Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.500
&lt;laugh&gt; and uh, she got killed by coyotes, which is super, super rare. Yeah.

143
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.180
But he was saying that is one of the worst ways to go cuz they,

144
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:18.020
they tried to kill you.

145
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.930
First her death is the only known fatal coyote attack on adult as well as the

146
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:27.050
only known fatal kayak coyote attack on a human ever confirmed in Canada.

147
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.850
Mm wow. She was 19 years old in Nova Scotia.

148
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.250
