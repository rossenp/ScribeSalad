00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Don't talk me through how this starts with you.</v>

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.900
Have you, were you always religious your whole life?

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.970
<v 1>Yes, I was. And then I, you know, then I hit high school. Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.260
<v 0>So, but yeah, you know, when you're a young man and you're, you know,</v>

5
00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:25.850
you're a superstar musician and you know, you live in a wildlife. What,

6
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.250
what was it that led you back to this?

7
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:32.030
Just a feeling in your life that there was more to life,

8
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.280
there was more to your position.

9
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.290
There was more to this idea of a calling that you felt like you

10
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:44.000
could do more and that it resonated with you more to, to,

11
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.710
to produce these Sunday services and to, to start thinking of,

12
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.070
of life in this way. Like you can improve things.

13
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.590
<v 1>There. God knocked me off my horse. God like literally call me and said,</v>

14
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.480
okay, now I need you. I need you right now. I need, I mean,

15
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.390
not that God needs needs me. We need God,

16
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:08.270
but he called me to serve him.

17
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.840
And I was tired of serving the music industry,

18
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.760
start tired of serving, you know, uh, filling up stadiums,

19
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.770
uh, you know, the last concerts and last tour I did,

20
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.160
we had a floating stage and, uh,

21
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.090
and actually it was a hanging stage, but it looked like it was floating.

22
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.500
And that's just another thing.

23
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:32.720
That's illusion where we need to dispel the illusion.

24
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:34.310
I wouldn't even call it the floating stage day.

25
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:38.240
But the whole thing about is people used to say how I would lose money on tours,

26
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:40.790
because I would put so much into the creative and I,

27
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:43.670
and I was like wanting to prove, but prove to who, you know,

28
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:46.670
prove to man prove to greedy people, you know,

29
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.250
that I could make more than anybody.

30
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.970
And that's like the gladiator position that all artists are put into.

31
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.670
Like we're in the middle of this Coliseum, let me show you,

32
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:59.360
I can kill more lions and tigers and bears and people and blah, blah, blah,

33
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.420
then than any other gladiator that happened. So that's what I'm,

34
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.710
that's what I was doing.

35
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.930
And then I remember talking to James Tarell and I was like at the top of my

36
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:12.440
lungs, like screaming about saving, uh,

37
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.240
saving ourselves and humanity and the reason why me and James needed to, uh,

38
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.120
connect. And then I went to, uh,

39
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.220
my show and then it's like my, like,

40
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.380
like my head popped back in the spirit jumped down and it felt like it was like

41
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:32.210
my mom talking. And the last thing I said was this thing is over.

42
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.890
And I'm saying it like, I sound like my mom, like Donda,

43
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.450
like that's something she would have said if she was in the physical form,

44
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.530
when she sees her son, you know, exhausted.

45
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.450
Like I just went through a, um, I had this, uh, fashion show.

46
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:54.800
We had this fashion show where we took over MSG and just broke all boundaries.

47
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:58.760
So 20,000, 16,000 seats and played the new album. And,

48
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.810
uh, uh, it was, you know, a thousand black people in the show and yeah,

49
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.190
like all the young thug plugging in the iPhone and, uh,

50
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.540
Travis and Cuddy dancing and had 50 cent they're JZ there,

51
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.410
Lamar Odom, the, uh, the first time that people, you know,

52
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:20.920
saw him and re uh, walk again, um,

53
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.930
was we walked together into the, uh, into the stadium. Uh, and he's,

54
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.700
cammo Yeezy jacket, all a head to toe. And the reason why that was so important,

55
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.080
it's like when he was in a coma, I would come by and play him the new music.

56
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.790
And once he was out of the coma,

57
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:40.390
he said that he remembered that music when he was in a coma.

58
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.820
And that was the album I was playing that day.

59
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.920
So that's the reason why me and Lamar, uh, walked in together.

60
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.590
And then the next, uh,

61
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.890
few months later I did a fashion show and it started 45 minutes late.

62
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.110
And the media, they just killed me. They LeBron to me, as I would say,

63
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:03.250
like when LeBron went to, uh, to, um, uh,

64
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.990
Miami and they said, you know, who are you to have a choice? You know,

65
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.190
like what, uh, one of my other heroes, Tom Brady, he, he left.

66
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.930
I didn't see no jerseys getting burned, like when LeBron,

67
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.430
uh, left. So then less than a week after that,

68
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.870
my wife is robbed in Paris.

69
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.730
And so we, we just, cause I'm,

70
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.720
I'm in the middle of a tour while I'm doing the fashion show while I'm doing

71
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:36.250
this. So we cancel the tour. Cause it's, it's very, you know, traumatic.

72
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.340
And then, you know,

73
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.390
we start the tour back up and we get back into it.

74
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.690
And then I just keep on saying, I want to go to Japan.

75
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.250
I just want to go to Japan because Japan is like a way that people treat there.

76
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:55.870
Isn't like this systemic racism embedded and every single

77
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.280
individual that's inside of the place, like in America, a black, white,

78
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.720
anything, there's a systemic, uh, white, white supremacy.

79
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.060
Like when I tag, you know,

80
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.290
white supremacy or we say this it's like the, yes,

81
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.350
that is America. That is the world. Currently.

82
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:18.520
We've been taught that my first superhero was Superman, you know?

83
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:22.480
And my dad was a black Panther, but you know,

84
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:26.230
when Disney makes black Panther, now when you look it up,

85
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.780
you don't see my dad protecting his neighborhood or snatching a

86
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:35.320
mic out of somebody's hand while they're lying. I don't know, you know,

87
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.600
like father, like son right there. Uh,

88
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.490
but you see this character that's made for

89
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:45.610
black people to idolize that was designed by white,

90
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.920
white person and put out by a white company.

91
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.620
So it's controlling the narrative to say,

92
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.960
we're going to show you Harry Harriet Tubman.

93
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:57.130
We're not going to show you not Turner. And they do it every,

94
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.470
they get Maleficent. Uh, um, they called her,

95
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.350
her race of people, the Morse and the more,

96
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.490
and I just saw it again. I was just like, yo,

97
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.010
if you erase our history, like most black people, we don't know where we come.

98
00:06:15.011 --> 00:06:16.690
We think we came from slaves.

99
00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:20.080
We don't know our bloodline and we're,

100
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.880
we're given black history month. And we take that like at some gift to us, no,

101
00:06:24.881 --> 00:06:28.030
it's a programming to us. Ray says him,

102
00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:32.680
doesn't end until we get to a point where we stop having to put the word black

103
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.320
in front of it, because it's like, we're, we're,

104
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.510
we're putting the rim a little bit lower for ourselves. Like it's when I say,

105
00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:45.370
I'm the second wealthiest black man in America. Like,

106
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.050
why do I have to say that? Because, you know,

107
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.550
obviously if we just go on wealth period of, of what we call wealth,

108
00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:55.300
like financial wealth, that score card, you know, I'll be like, I'm the,

109
00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.070
I'm the 78th wealthiest man in America,

110
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.810
but we shouldn't have to have a special box a special month because

111
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:09.640
also what they show in black, black history month is us getting hosed down,

112
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.090
reminding us that we were slaves. Like, what if we had,

113
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.960
remember when I cheated on you month? Like, remember when you first found the,

114
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.800
found the text messages, remember how does that make you feel?

115
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.570
It makes you feel depleted and defeated. You know, it's, uh,

116
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.500
no matter what religion you are, where we can agree on as it is always now,

117
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.980
but now is the shortest moment of our life.

118
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.380
It's gone in an instant.

119
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.760
The longest moments of our life are our memories and our

120
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:44.380
imaginations. Think about how long a kid imagines Christmas before.

121
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.870
I mean, versus how long Christmas really is.

122
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.310
And when you think back to your Christmas,

123
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.240
are you under the table like Jim Carrey and eternal sunshine for the spotless

124
00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:56.800
mind, like under a chair, or are you a giant, are you a king? Are you, what,

125
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.850
what, what black history month has told you? You are?

126
00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:04.450
And this is me speaking to, uh, you know,

127
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.590
black people specifically in America that,

128
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.660
you know, I know people who would, you know, kill someone and,

129
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.000
uh, or have a gun or, you know, in,

130
00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:22.990
in their own hood and be afraid to go downtown and literally be like

131
00:08:22.991 --> 00:08:27.850
afraid of white people. Like the most gangster gang of gangsters,

132
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:31.810
wouldn't go downtown and that's just a programming,

133
00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:35.980
but that program is a side of the curriculum. It's an, it's a side of the media.

134
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:40.780
It, and it, and it goes to this whole idea of yay.

135
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.940
When people say is Jay crazy, is Jay a narcissistic is Jay.

136
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.920
Uh, egomaniac is J self-absorbed of J all these, no, yay.

137
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.620
No who yay. Yes. I know who I am. And I'm not fin,

138
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.450
I'm not fin to bow to, uh,

139
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.390
to an idea that you want to have of me.

140
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.880
I am going to be the full idea that God has

141
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:13.770
of me. And when I do things that are that God don't like, I'm,

142
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.450
I'm, I'm, I'm being the lesser version of me. This is where,

143
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.990
you know, in my weakness, God becomes strong.

144
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.100
I have to be the higher me. When,

145
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.190
when people are Downing me, it's not like me fighting fire with fire,

146
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:36.090
me attacking, or it's you say, like, you know, stooping to,

147
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.270
uh, stooping to that level.

148
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.470
It's like the devil will use you against you.

149
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.650
You become your own. Uh, you become your own worst episodes.

150
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.850
<v 2>Of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>
