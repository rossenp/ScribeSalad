WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. And you're what you're getting at is a,</v>

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.800
a problem in politics is as politicians and political leaders,

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.160
I think F forgot to explain why we believe what we believe. Yes.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.160
And that's pretty important. Um, you know, we'll,

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.920
I think too often talking points are relied upon,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.030
and it's not that those talking points are false and that's necessarily,

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.910
but they're not persuasive because you haven't gone a couple layers deep

8
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.630
again. I think you talk about this a lot. Why are podcasts so popular?

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.190
They're popular because people want to hear a little bit more information.

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.630
They want to get a deeper understanding of why you think,

11
00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:38.750
what you think people are ready to hear that they're ready for some nuance. Um,

12
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.740
that being said to being in politics, you wouldn't think,

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.780
you wouldn't think that we're getting any closer to nuanced conversations. And.

14
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.940
<v 1>Uh, I think political conversations on podcasts are opening up a whole new door</v>

15
00:00:51.941 --> 00:00:56.540
where you understand people like Tosi Gabbard or Andrew Yang or Bernie Sanders,

16
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.580
the people that have had out I've had on this podcast.

17
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.380
One of the things that I've talked to people about, they,

18
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.490
I didn't know that Bernie was like a normal person. You hear him talk and you,

19
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.330
you know, it's always in these very quick sound bites on television. Know,

20
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:12.570
he's always yelling about wealth or race or something. He goes,

21
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:13.770
looks like a mad man. Yeah.

22
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.690
But then you sit down and talk to him for in a long form conversation.

23
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:19.570
You let him expand on his thoughts. You go, oh, he's a reasonable guy.

24
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.800
He just has this. These are his pre principles. These are, these are his ideas.

25
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:24.634
And he's not a cartoon.

26
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.520
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, on a personal level,</v>

27
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.280
most people in Congress are not exactly who you think they are. They,

28
00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:34.440
they are just people. They make jokes. And we, of course, we, we,

29
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.080
we make small talk in the elevator. You know, these, these things happen. Um,

30
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.640
Bernie in particular, he's on the Senate side.

31
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:44.150
I don't really interact with him at all. TSI Gabbard. I know you mentioned her.

32
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.870
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, you know, we, we, we do, we do have good conversations,

33
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.790
uh, that does happen. We disagree vigorously on, on lots of things.

34
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:56.590
What do you guys disagree on? Uh, Tosi in particular? Sure. Uh, well,

35
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.990
most things I would say, uh, one, one things she's quite outspoken about is, um,

36
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.220
is our involvement overseas. Uh she's she would generally say she's,

37
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:09.300
she's much more of an I isolationist than I am.

38
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.860
What I remind people when we're talking about that particular subject. Why,

39
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.220
why do we keep troops in Syria? Why do we keep troops in, in Iraq?

40
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.540
Why do we keep troops in Afghanistan? Isn't the war over? Um,

41
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.380
why don't we bring the boys back home?

42
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.890
And the answer is the says not a conventional war.

43
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.810
This is not something where you sign a peace treaty with a uniformed, uh, army.

44
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.810
It is, it is a different, it's a different situation.

45
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.130
We send guys like me over there so that they don't come here.

46
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.530
We send guys like me over there so that we keep pressure on them and, and,

47
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:41.490
and prevent them from whom in the operational space and timing to commit another

48
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:42.270
nine 11.

49
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.440
You have to understand that these people over there wake up every single day,

50
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.400
trying to plan another nine 11. It is, it is, it is what they do. And, uh,

51
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:53.000
we've already seen, uh, an increase in, in ISIS activity,

52
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.560
just from the draw down that we already did have in Syria. So, you know,

53
00:02:56.561 --> 00:03:00.240
that's a, that's a fair disagreement again, but she's a really cool person.

54
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.640
And I want to, I brought upul just specifically, because we do talk and I,

55
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:08.080
and I, and I, I just like her as a person, we just disagree on things,

56
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.400
but there's a respect there.

57
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.680
<v 1>To play devil's advocate.</v>

58
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.840
Some would say that the reason why they wanna PLA plot another nine 11 is

59
00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:15.680
because we're over there.

60
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.270
<v 0>Yeah. I disagree with that. So let's, let's look at the bin Laden, um, example,</v>

61
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.510
what exactly did we do to this guy? You know, well, we helped him, right.

62
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.510
<v 1>Exactly. When he was fighting Soviets with the Mujahadeen.</v>

63
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.270
<v 0>Exactly in the, he was a Mahaine fighter. We helped him fight the Soviets.</v>

64
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.790
We protected Saudi Arabia from invasion, from Saddam hue.

65
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:38.870
That's his Homeland and yetty hated us. And when we left,

66
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.780
we never occupied Saudi Arabia.

67
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.220
We left when they asked us to leave after we defended them, um,

68
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.620
and prevented another invasion from Saddam MUE after he invaded Kuwait,

69
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.020
what is it we did to make this guy.

70
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.460
So Matt and the answer is we didn't do anything objectively speaking.

71
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.780
He hates us because of our Western ideology. He hates us because he hates us.

72
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.410
And, and it's hard for us to understand cuz it's not logical. Uh,

73
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.850
but it is the truth. And, um, it's, it's, you know, so it's,

74
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.050
and it's the prime example of, of why we, this, this,

75
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:14.450
this is a long term fight and it's, um, it's not likely to go away anytime soon.

76
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.850
And the last thing I would say, the world is a very small place. We can,

77
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.080
when we pretend that we to nor things going on in the middle east,

78
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.120
we can pretend that they won't come here.

79
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:27.720
But the reality is that's a 12 hour flight and, and, and,

80
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:30.640
and the speed of information travels even faster. You know,

81
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:32.720
when we were seeing a lot of attacks in the us and in Europe,

82
00:04:32.721 --> 00:04:36.840
when ISIS was at its peak, as its, as its peak strength,

83
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.440
that was because they were able to radicalize online. No,

84
00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:42.430
to us that they've stopped having that power.

85
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.750
And it's because we actually took the fight to them.

86
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.400
<v 1>Well, there,</v>

87
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.110
there certainly are some conflicts between their ideology

88
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.790
and Western ideology, but why on Western values,

89
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.430
but why is it that they're dedicating their entire life to try to take down

90
00:04:58.431 --> 00:04:59.264
America?

91
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.830
<v 0>Well.</v>

92
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.620
<v 1>They, and there's a, this is always the question. It.</v>

93
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.500
<v 0>Is a question civilian and it's, and it's you,</v>

94
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.780
you almost have to ask them exactly why, right? But I mean, at its core,

95
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.540
we are indels at, at its core, there's they, they're,

96
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.740
they're taking an extreme view of,

97
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:16.260
of Islamic fundamentalism and believing that we are indels.

98
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:20.020
That must be destroyed. I mean, that's at its core. Uh, there, there it's,

99
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:23.730
it's less political reasons, little bit more emotional reasoning. There has.

100
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.563
<v 1>To be some,</v>

101
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.890
some part of it because of our policies and some part of it because of our

102
00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:29.450
actions. And I, I'm not, I'm.

103
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.170
<v 0>Not so sure that we should always assume that it's our fault, that, that,</v>

104
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:36.370
and I think that's a common, that's a common theme, uh,

105
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.810
in politics these days where anything bad happening must be America's fault,

106
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:44.360
must be decisions we made and it may be, but let's objectively make the case.

107
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.000
If that, if that's, if that's true,

108
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.080
I think there's an automatic assumption and I, it's not self evident to me.

109
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.600
<v 1>But if we're in,</v>

110
00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:53.560
what are we in a hundred and how many countries do we have bases in?

111
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.720
What's the number? Do you know?

112
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.400
<v 0>It's a lot. It might it's, it's definitely over a hundred. Yeah.</v>

113
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.440
<v 1>And if you were one of the people that is in one of those countries,</v>

114
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.640
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you had to deal with that,

115
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.760
and you saw like the drone attacks in Yemen that have killed people in wedding

116
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.920
parties and the kind of that we hope never happens again,

117
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.120
but has happened in the past.

118
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.830
You can kind of understand why there would be a hate it against the number one

119
00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:18.830
superpower in the world.

120
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.550
<v 0>Well, opinions in these countries are not, are not homogenous.</v>

121
00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:26.670
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right. They're, they're, they're vastly diverse. There's a,

122
00:06:26.671 --> 00:06:29.350
there's millions of people in Yemen, probably begging for us to come there.

123
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.070
Same with Iraq. Iraqis did not want us leaving. They knew this would go badly.

124
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.150
Um, but again, not all Iraqis, right?

125
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.003
<v 1>So there's ones who.</v>

126
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.340
<v 0>Right. I mean, it just depends on who you talk to. Uh, so again, it's, it's,</v>

127
00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:46.220
it's, everything is more complex than a simple than a simple black and white

128
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.460
scenario where America's bad. Good. It's just, it's,

129
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:49.580
it's always more complex than that.

130
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.060
<v 1>So you feel like if we did pull out of all these countries,</v>

131
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:55.700
particularly pull out of the middle east Afghanistan and all the bases that we

132
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:57.420
have over there, that it would be, uh,

133
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.570
very similar to like what's going on in Iraq. What happened in Libya?

134
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.810
There's a power vacuum. The vacuum gets filled by bad.

135
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.290
<v 0>Guys. It'll a hundred percent happen that way, you know, and it's,</v>

136
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.090
there's not a doubt in my mind. There's not a doubt in any expert's minds.

137
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.530
Who's looking at this. I would also say when we're,

138
00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:16.250
when we have a base somewhere, that is, that is at the, that is,

139
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:21.080
that is at the discretion of, of that, uh, local government. There's,

140
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.720
there's no cases here except in the case of Syria, uh, where, you know,

141
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:30.680
their local government basad doesn't want us there. That's the only case I,

142
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:34.440
that I can think of in, in that, that we don't have an agreement,

143
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.870
a status of forces agreement with the government there. So I, I, I,

144
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.630
I don't think it's quite right to paint it as some kind of imperialistic

145
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.270
occupation. That's just, that's just not how we,

146
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.550
how we do things and You right over there. Yeah.

147
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.670
I'm just making sure this sound is off. &lt;laugh&gt;.

148
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.710
<v 1>Good for you before anything actually did happen now, now, um,</v>

149
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.150
do you think that this is a,

150
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.460
a political ploy that this is a popular to say,

151
00:07:59.461 --> 00:08:02.300
because so many people that have, uh, you know,

152
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.660
a cursory understanding of foreign policy,

153
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.300
they look at our military bases overseas and they say, Hey,

154
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:10.380
let's bring those people back. Let's end these wars.

155
00:08:10.381 --> 00:08:14.820
Let's stop spending this money, but you're not the only one that's told me this.

156
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.380
And particularly not the only one that's told me this that's has a military

157
00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:17.800
background.

158
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.850
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; saying it's virtually impossible to prevent any of this

159
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:23.410
stuff without having bases over there.

160
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.810
<v 0>That's a hundred percent, right? Yeah. I mean, and you, you need,</v>

161
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.610
you need that relationship with the host nation, of course,

162
00:08:29.611 --> 00:08:31.610
that you wanna partner with. And that's generally what we do,

163
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.130
especially in the special operations community.

164
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.930
When we're in a hundred plus countries, we're there to partner with them.

165
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.720
We're not there doing our own thing. We're there partnering, training and,

166
00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:44.200
and equipping and, and enhancing their capabilities. So that,

167
00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:46.800
that's part of what we're doing. The, and the other part is just knowledge.

168
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.040
We want to know what's happening. If we don't know what's happening, why do,

169
00:08:50.041 --> 00:08:51.680
why do we have embasies everywhere? Mm-hmm,

170
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.440
&lt;affirmative&gt; part of that is just relationships and knowledge and understanding

171
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:58.920
of what's going on, because we can't look at it from afar and actually get it.

172
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.200
Uh, it just, it doesn't work that way. So, and, and, and again, and I'm,

173
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:04.560
I'm not,

174
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.080
I think it is reactionary to just assume that we have bad intentions all the

175
00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:12.080
time and that everything is America's fault. I hear that constantly, um,

176
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.000
mostly coming from the left, but,

177
00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:18.070
but by isolation is sentiment certainly comes from the right as well. And, uh,

178
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.830
and it's a reaction,

179
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.670
it's a reaction to the Iraq war and some of the mistakes we made there,

180
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.430
it's a reaction to Vietnam. It's never, that's never left the American psyche.

181
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:29.190
Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh, in many ways, but these,

182
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:31.630
these matters are complex and they,

183
00:09:31.631 --> 00:09:35.820
they deserve complex reasoning and analysis and a little on understanding.

184
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.980
And I, I just think that's how we should look at it. We, we don't,

185
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:40.580
we don't say that we're always right. That's, that's not what I'm saying.
