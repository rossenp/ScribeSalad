<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.870
<v 3>Hip flexors.</v>

3
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.160
That's a muscle that so few people work out and there's this guy that I follow

4
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:10.230
on Instagram, that's become very popular.

5
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:12.840
Jamie actually turned me on to him that needs over toes guy.

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.630
I saw him with mark, Mark Bell. Yeah. He was trained with Mark Bell,

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.340
but I started implementing a lot of what he does in my training routine.

8
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:22.650
And I actually got one of those monkey feet things.

9
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:23.610
If you don't know what that is,

10
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.680
it's a thing that you strap onto your shoe and you can attach a dumbbell to it.

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.920
So you lift. So like in, you know,

12
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:36.150
for like hip flexors to get them strong, it's kind of hard to do,

13
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:40.200
but if you want to be a strong runner or if you want to throw hard knees,

14
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.500
like that's really where the muscle comes from.

15
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.980
If you think about like throwing a hard knee, a lot of that is hit.

16
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.390
<v 1>And it also with kicks everything about roundhouse kicks. I, I,</v>

17
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.970
you know, been kicking since I was a little kid,

18
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.460
so I've got pretty decent hip flexor muscles,

19
00:00:56.461 --> 00:01:01.230
but I don't do an exercise to work them other than this

20
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:04.710
stuff. Like, and I started maybe lunches, I guess, work them a little bit.

21
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:07.980
But using this monkey foot thing, you,

22
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:12.270
you can actually like lift weights with your hip flexes as you're lifting your

23
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:16.020
knee up. And that's all that muscle. See if you can find, uh,

24
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.490
like a video of him doing it,

25
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:22.350
but this guy has some really interesting perspective on a really interesting

26
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:25.020
perspective on strengthening all the muscles around your knee.

27
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.760
And he calls it knee over toes guy. Because traditionally, if you thought,

28
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.050
if you talked to someone, they'd say, Hey,

29
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:32.790
don't ever have your knee over your toes.

30
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.130
Cause it puts a lot of pressure on your knee. It's bad for your knee.

31
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.750
And his idea is no build up to where you can have your knee over your toes

32
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.620
easily. And if you look at his Instagram, he does a lot of like crazy,

33
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.290
like where he jumps and lands with knees over toes and goes all the way

34
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:51.780
down to the ground. And they could spring back up like this.

35
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.690
And this is a guy who had like multiple leg surgeries. And so look how he lands.

36
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.780
And he does a lot is his Instagram it's knees over toes guy is

37
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:06.750
his Instagram, but he's definitely got that, um,

38
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.580
monkey foot thing in there somewhere. Jamie CVS, he's doing the tip thing,

39
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:14.160
which is called scroll up. I'm sorry. That's good too.

40
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.130
But scroll up to that one way is leaning back right there. Yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.100
Watch this. This is a crazy strength in his legs. Look,

42
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.720
he goes all the way back,

43
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.420
which is hard to do already and then pops all the way forward.

44
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.630
That's hard to do, man. Yeah.

45
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.600
And that is all those muscles that we're talking about here.

46
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.860
<v 0>That's like hamstring. So a lot of that is hamstrings too, I think because yeah,</v>

47
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:36.690
because we'll do, yeah, we'll do a similar thing.

48
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:40.890
I obviously can't do it as good as that guy, but uh, yeah. Hamstrings glutes,

49
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.960
bro. The glutes are super important. Like.

50
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.350
<v 1>Uh, and you see that pose that he's got in the middle of there, Jamie with the,</v>

51
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.610
yeah. That one with the arrow.

52
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.910
So that's showing like the op what happened there,

53
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.600
that's showing the optimal position to strengthen,

54
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.800
like to have that sort of a, what do they call it?

55
00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:02.770
A split squat where you have that crazy angle or your knees hanging way over

56
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:06.040
your toes. And you obviously you build up to it slowly.

57
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.060
Like he's got Miriam Nakamoto. Do you know who she is? Yeah.

58
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.140
Multiple time world, kickboxing champion world, more tight champion. My friend,

59
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.760
Miriam shout out to Miriam. Um,

60
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.290
she's a beast and she has a pretty significant knee injury that she's trying to

61
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.890
recover from. And she got a bunch of stem cells and shot in there.

62
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.190
But she's now doing a lot of this guy's program to strengthen all the muscles

63
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:27.790
around it,

64
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.650
but see how he's into doing a lot of stuff that puts you in

65
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.230
that position. And believe me,

66
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:38.890
the dude can do some crazy athletically, but he,

67
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.050
he also uses all these examples of different athletes that have incredible

68
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:48.490
explosive power with their legs. And they use these, uh,

69
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.300
these kinds of exercises and they, they they're strong in these positions.

70
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.340
So he shows a split squat, which is really hard to do, man.

71
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.480
It's really hard to get down like that with that knee hanging way out over your

72
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:02.950
toes and get all the way down.

73
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:06.220
So your back knee touches the ground and then pull yourself back up.

74
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.480
But it's true. He calls it dense strength and it was just,

75
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:13.750
you're strengthening all your tendons and all the muscles that stabilize the

76
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:18.670
knee and put the knee in a, in a good position and for kicking things, man. And,

77
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.810
and, and for grappling, I think, I think a lot of guys could benefit from it.

78
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.090
Look how flexible the dude is. Look at that picture with her.

79
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.760
And like he does a lot of stuff on slant boards. If you go to that one,

80
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.870
the video that we were just on Jamie of him doing a full split. Yeah. That one,

81
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.340
like, so he does a lot of stuff on slant boards where,

82
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.490
so he'll have like, like it's like a, a slant board,

83
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:44.140
which is good for stretching your calves out.

84
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:48.070
And I started doing this because of him too and drop all the way down with a

85
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:51.610
barbell and go all the way down to the floor.

86
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.780
And it's just tremendous hamstring stretch, but also strengthening.

87
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.980
And you see the kind of flexibility that this guy has because of it. I mean,

88
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:03.070
he can go off if you can go scoot that thing all the way up,

89
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:06.220
the dude can go all the way down to a full split and look at that.

90
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:09.730
He's doing a searcher squat grip,

91
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.970
like where you put it in the crux of your elbow with weights.

92
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.300
I don't know why he's showing some, getting slammed into the triangle. I guess.

93
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.220
I don't know. I'd have to listen to him, but a lot of great exercises.

94
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.820
And if he could find that monkey foot thing, he's got that in there somewhere.

95
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.410
<v 2>Definitely seen on his page,</v>

96
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.750
but the video might not be up or it's been somewhere else. He's just,

97
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.370
the only thing I could find was that tibia thing,

98
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:35.140
which is a very close thing to.

99
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.440
<v 1>Yeah, that's a different, that's a different thing, but that's pretty dope too.</v>

100
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.800
Yeah.

101
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.090
That's a bar where you put your feet into it and you put plates on the end of it

102
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.350
and it works those muscles on the tibia and you know,

103
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.870
you just flex the foot up and down. So it's like,

104
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.560
there's all these different ways you can strengthen these muscle groups that you

105
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:56.140
don't fit. Like there's no direct way to strengthen them,

106
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:59.870
like individually that you think of when you think of doing squats, you know,

107
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:02.750
you're, you're strengthening them sort of, but you know,

108
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.150
they're just kind of coming along for the ride and getting stronger.

109
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.210
Whereas this is Iceland, that's it? That's the monkey feet thing.

110
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.270
Those are crazy. It's dope, dude. It's really dope. I love it.

111
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.520
Because what I'll do is I'll like, hold on to, um, like a chin up bar like this,

112
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.850
and then I'll just do these leg lifts with my, uh,

113
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.910
and you could do leg curls with it. You can do leg lifts,

114
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.370
but I feel like for a guy like you,

115
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:29.900
who already has a nasty flying knee that would make your knee
