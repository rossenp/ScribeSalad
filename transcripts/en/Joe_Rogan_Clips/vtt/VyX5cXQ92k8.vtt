00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.080
<v 1>Check this one out today's paper, uh, front page of USA today,</v>

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.920
confessions of a lottery scammer. I brought this along.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.600
I thought it'd be interesting. A lottery scammer. This is a guy, big fat guy,

5
00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:19.360
300 pounds sitting on his in I somewhere who was on his

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.110
device, figured out some, a way to intrude on some algorithm.

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.430
And he started scamming different states.

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.230
He scammed the state of Colorado out of 4.8 million. And,

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.030
uh, there he is a, a, a, a total of 16.5 boy. You guys are good.

10
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.220
Uh, 16.5 million. Um, now I'm thinking &lt;affirmative&gt;,

11
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.540
if this guy had scammed, the corporation led by Jose Miguel battle. He,

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.900
he he'd be, he'd be dead.

13
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.740
He wouldn't be on the he'd be on the obituary section of.

14
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.060
<v 2>What he here was never my intent to start a full out ticket scam. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

15
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.580
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.260
<v 2>He sent us up to 25 years.</v>

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.250
<v 1>You, you could not am organized crime in this way. Well, how do you scam.</v>

18
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.370
<v 2>Lottery? Like.</v>

19
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.090
<v 1>You figure out,</v>

20
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.250
you figure out how the number is determined and then you're able to play with

21
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:14.650
it. You're able to, to play with it. So you an organized crime, you couldn't.

22
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.610
<v 2>Do that. Well, I don't understand that. How could he, like,</v>

23
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.370
isn't there just a random system, a computer program.

24
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.840
<v 1>Or something that runs he found? Yeah. He found some way to, to, uh,</v>

25
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.040
to tap into that computer system.

26
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.120
<v 2>To tap into what I mean to hack into it.</v>

27
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.080
<v 1>Hack into it and alter and alter the number. Oh.</v>

28
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.980
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.200
<v 0>Wow. That's.</v>

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.160
<v 2>Crazy. Wow. That is crazy. What,</v>

31
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:38.280
what is fascinating to me is that this what you were talking about earlier,

32
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.400
what we're talking about about like that this was,

33
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.270
it gave them an opportunity for, and that it was a part of the community.

34
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.990
Oh yeah. We're missing that in the west coast, the west coast,

35
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.070
like off track bedding. There's no off track bedding here.

36
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:53.510
There's a few weirdos that go to the Hollywood park, but that's gone now.

37
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.990
You know? I mean, there's nothing here.

38
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.190
<v 1>Well, you, the west coast never had this. There's.</v>

39
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.830
<v 0>Nothing. Yeah. There's nothing like scene that,</v>

40
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.900
like I saw that and I saw what goes with it and it may sound EY

41
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.060
spooky to most people, but it's not EY spooky. The people who are really,

42
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:15.060
really Sicilian and people who are very Cuban when you're Sicilian

43
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.260
in that culture, there's women that you go to and they tell you things,

44
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.660
they're witches, they're Sicilian, witches, whatever the you want in,

45
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.730
in sleepers, remember he goes, bring the eyeballs to this lady.

46
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.690
What sleepers sleepers is a movie about four Irish kids. That lady was,

47
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.970
but kind of, uh, one, I'm trying to remember that movie.

48
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.410
It's about the four kids to Nero plays. A priest priest met, uh, uh,

49
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.650
Brad pit, Jackie Gleason's grandson.

50
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.953
<v 2>Okay. There it is.</v>

51
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.200
<v 1>Levi movie.</v>

52
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.950
<v 0>And then they,</v>

53
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.800
they got the guy on Letterman and he started backtracking like Steven Segala

54
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.320
by the CIA involvement. Oh really? Yeah. They said he Lorenzo Carty. Yeah.

55
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.600
He later on became.

56
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.600
<v 1>He said it was a true story and it was not a true story. It.</v>

57
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.520
<v 0>Was based. But uh, if you look at it,</v>

58
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.600
weren't two or four of those two kids were supposed to grow up to be Westley.

59
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.280
Yeah. But it wasn't, it's. It's. Yeah. Like they, the two other,

60
00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:13.040
the four of those guys, what were we talking about?

61
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.440
&lt;laugh&gt; we were talking about, well, you were talking witches and he, you know,

62
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.630
in the Cuban world, it's the same thing.

63
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.190
I want my kid to go to Catholic school. Right. If I play this number today,

64
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.430
this is gonna save me. We, you know, we don't, when you are a comic,

65
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.510
you have that hope, you know, tonight, I'm gonna go to the improv.

66
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.550
Just SU's gonna be there. Maybe, you know, just may it's, it's a,

67
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.420
but it's a ethnic hope that comes back from your country.

68
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.420
It's hard to describe you understand it because your grandmother was a bookie.

69
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.660
But if you talked to her on a daily basis about it and why she would play that

70
00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:56.180
particular number, like my mom played five 17.

71
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.050
Those were the last three numbers on my dad's gravestone. Mm.

72
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.970
You know, 6 0 4 was some other hallucinogenic she had.

73
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.410
If I go like this, if I go like this and I go, you know what?

74
00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:13.890
You're looking good today. Here, go take a yard, stick. Most Cubans,

75
00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:17.850
look at it and go give $5 on 2 53,

76
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:21.360
because it's the last three numbers. The 20 you gave me now, is this.

77
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.200
<v 3>Still going on? Oh yeah. The numbers are.</v>

78
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.520
<v 0>Still going on. Yeah. Not in a, not as a, not as a 10 man office.</v>

79
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.920
When I was a kid, it was a 10 man office. You were downstairs. You had a bodega.

80
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:35.000
Me and you ran the bodega. There's two yous.

81
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.720
And yesterday's paper was selling the book of dreams.

82
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.670
And then you come and you gimme 6 0 4, 5 17.

83
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.550
It comes on three sheets of paper with, with copy paper.

84
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.950
So right away, I rip the top one. I give it to you. I keep the other one.

85
00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:56.510
And the other one goes upstairs to the department where now there's a big wall

86
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.590
with zero to nine on the wall. And I park there.

87
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.260
So Joe just came up and played two 19. There's two. And all of a sudden,

88
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:09.220
there's a list that goes down. I'm a board guy. I just worked the board.

89
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.820
I got six guys with phones, yelling numbers on me. Oh yeah. And Rogan,

90
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.980
just put a hundred dollars on that number. That killed me last week.

91
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.610
That send $50 of that to Miami. Cuz I could unload to create the utopia.

92
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.330
You know, when you, when I take a sports bet, I'm taking 500 on Pittsburgh.

93
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.050
Pittsburgh's playing new England.

94
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.050
I can't take 10,000 on Pittsburgh and 5,000 on new England.

95
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.930
That's not called the utopia.

96
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.130
I'm gonna make money on the V the 10 points from you losing.

97
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.200
So if you bet 10,000 on somebody and you bet five, I unload five,

98
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.360
ah, to another bank somewhere across town. So this is how and, and I mean,

99
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:49.140
when I was a kid,

100
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.560
my mother had a bank in the Bronx and the guy that cooked was black Mike.

101
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.720
He was a Vietnam vet and I was five. And he would gimme 10 bucks to go get him.

102
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.280
Blackberry, Brandy black Mike cooked Italian food.

103
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.720
That was so good. It was 1970.

104
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.840
Even if you hated black weep &lt;laugh&gt; you ate his spaghetti.

105
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.240
Even Italians came to eat his spaghetti on Wednesdays.

106
00:06:13.241 --> 00:06:16.830
He cooked corn beef on Wednesdays. He made Cubans food.

107
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.630
They have an office and every phone has a little tape recorder with a wire

108
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:25.070
connected to the phone. So you can't call me and say, you played two 18. Yeah,

109
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:29.030
it's recorded. I bust your head. It's recorded. I play the tape for you.

110
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.430
So every hour the tapes come around and I,

111
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:35.230
and those get destroyed and those get destroyed the week after or that night

112
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.460
after everything settled.

113
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.740
But to see those offices in action,

114
00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:44.660
when you're a kid and I'm going to get cigarettes and they're giving me a 10 to

115
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:47.060
go get a $3 pack of cigarette. So I keep seven.

116
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.940
<v 1>Now, did you ever see the money?</v>

117
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.740
<v 0>What do you mean? The money? Well, the money that was gathered,</v>

118
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.100
I saw how the money would be taken up. That would be a separate location.

119
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.890
That would be a separate location, counting room. Now there also,

120
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.810
they move locations every week. You also have to stay ahead of the cops.

121
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.970
So every week you got a guy like Joe Rogan, that just rents apartments for me.

122
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.490
So every week we move locations.

123
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.410
So nobody ever gets comfortable with three months at one place.

124
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.490
Then with three months in another place,

125
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:14.650
then with three months in another place,

126
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.690
because not only do you have to worry about cops, you gotta worry about Jamie.

127
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.560
Get a little cocky. Right?

128
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.600
Jamie found out from Joe di that they make 40,000 a day.

129
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.560
Jamie's gonna go get two guns guy,

130
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:27.120
go get the two guns and try to go up there and see what happens because they got

131
00:07:27.121 --> 00:07:30.680
two guys on the third floor that just got two guns waiting for idiots like you

132
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:34.080
to come upstairs to the fourth floor. It was you surreal.

133
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.480
It was surreal. So in the mornings my mom would go, you wanna go?

134
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.590
Or you wanna go with mama to the Mets and go, yeah, I got some going. I go,

135
00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:47.190
I'm going with you because these bookies would all gimme 20, 40 bucks.

136
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.190
It's part of that.

137
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.350
<v 1>Good. Look now, check this out at the end of the day,</v>

138
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.270
every day that this is going on because betting is going every day,

139
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.790
seven days a week, this system that Joey's talking about. So money's coming in.

140
00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:01.420
Lot, lot of money's coming in. It goes to the counting rooms.

141
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.420
So at the end of the day, you got a lot of money at like two,

142
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.500
300 different locations. All around the New York area.

143
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.620
What they would do is they have people whose responsibility.

144
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.540
It was to come around, collect the money that money would go into a van.

145
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.210
And that van would have a police escort. As it left,

146
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.610
New York city went through the tunnel and in New Jersey,

147
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.650
it was met by New Jersey police who picked it up and escorted it from there

148
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.170
into the apartments or the houses in union city where the money was crazy.

149
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.210
Wow. So the cops got.

150
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.240
<v 0>Paid. So how can I tell you this? At the age of 10? I knew this,</v>

151
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:43.560
but I could never tell you cause you wouldn't blame me.

152
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.600
So I gotta keep it to myself. Well,

153
00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:48.240
most of the kids wouldn't be able to shut the up either. Cause I didn't up.

154
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.960
Wouldn't call out to talk about nothing in my world, in my world. I didn't.

155
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.520
When, what were you Saturday? We played handball all day. I,

156
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.640
I had to go to a play with my uncle, but later.

157
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.600
<v 3>Bronx, you worked for a sports betting place too.</v>

158
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.240
<v 0>Later on, as I got older, but when I got outta high school,</v>

159
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.160
I was such a loser that I went to hundred 18th street. The guy's name was chair,

160
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.680
Jose Torres. And the son, I went to him like a man.

161
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.400
They were around the block to this guy named Raleigh and Miguel.

162
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.950
And they ran a complete different operation from the corporation.

163
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.270
Raleigh's still around. If I had any balls left,

164
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.030
I'd go put a bullet in Raleigh's head because Raleigh was tight with my mother.

165
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.030
My mother helped get Raleigh started on hundred 18th street.

166
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.030
When my mother died, he got tight with my stepfather.

167
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.350
And when my stepfather died,

168
00:09:33.351 --> 00:09:36.660
he took that money and gave it to my stepfather's sister.

169
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:37.820
That money belonged to me.

170
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.380
So today I'm still off at Raleigh because when I was a kid,

171
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.020
I saw Raleigh every day. He'd gimme 50 bucks. Every time I went over there,

172
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.780
those guys lived their life on a karma based life.

173
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.220
So whenever they see Joe RO and come here, come here.

174
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:55.260
You know how many things I did with your father? Come here.

175
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.770
Here's a hundred dollars. Go get your Dick sucked. My mother would,

176
00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:02.210
would drive her crazy. Like how much money did you get today?

177
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.890
200 could gimme 400 of that.

178
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.610
Cause I used to buy knives and stars to throw at people. &lt;laugh&gt; you know,

179
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.650
but that's there where they're very generous, Joe, you know,

180
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.520
you can't do that. When you come over to my, with your daughters. I can't,

181
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.640
first thing is they do is put a 50 in everybody's hand.

182
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.800
So now the girls know whenever they come over, uncle Joey's, they get a 50,

183
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.200
right? So even after you are not around,

184
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:31.160
they'll come over when they're 14 and they're going to go to Hollywood,

185
00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:34.040
they'll come over by uncle, uncle Joey. When you girls going,

186
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.200
you girls got money. There's 50.

187
00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:40.870
So I people giving me money because it's a karma based business. Hmm.

188
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.270
The more I, my mother would hit the number for 10,000. She'd give away. Really?

189
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.750
Yeah, because that's the generosity part of it.
