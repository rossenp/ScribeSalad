00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know, there's like,</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.830
that's one of the isn't that now the people we went to recently went to jail for

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:09.990
like bribe, for getting their kids into college.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.650
It's kind of a version of the acts that with your kids, right? You're like,

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.190
you're like just, they, their kids aren't, aren't,

6
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:19.890
aren't supposed to be in college because they haven't done any work in high

7
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:22.860
school and they don't know what they're doing, but if you pay enough money,

8
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:25.020
you get them in there. It's like,

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.070
and also aren't they doing some thing where they get people to go and take SATs

10
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:33.300
for your kid. Like, you figure out a way to like, it's an identity theft thing,

11
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:34.950
or you can even get someone to go and like,

12
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.240
do the test as your kid using fake ID and.

13
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.170
So it's like,

14
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.710
you've sent in an operative that isn't your kid take the test so you can get

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.720
into a nice school.

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.790
<v 1>That whole thing was so crazy.</v>

17
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.510
Did they spent so much money to get kids in school,

18
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.660
but didn't want to be good students. Yeah.

19
00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.813
<v 0>That's right.</v>

20
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.680
<v 1>Almost like you think you could buy by a kids way too</v>

21
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.180
enthusiastic focus.

22
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.030
<v 0>That. Well, there you go. I mean, there's the whole problem. Isn't it?</v>

23
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.230
<v 2>Th this was, this is from the district attorney's office in Massachusetts.</v>

24
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:17.900
One of the photos that was used to show this girl's a rowing, uh,

25
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.430
high school rowing career that she got a scholarship on.

26
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.590
That's a workout machine. Oh, wow. It's was supposed to be like, yeah,

27
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:27.600
look at her and her varsity. Oh.

28
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.210
<v 0>Man. Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.730
<v 1>Wow. So there was no photos of her actually rowing out on a boat.</v>

30
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.490
<v 2>That's part of the thing. Like having people take tests,</v>

31
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.870
they went and staged photos too. It'd be like, look, the person saw allegedly,

32
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:43.704
according to the court.

33
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.770
<v 1>Can you imagine how mad real rowers would be at you?</v>

34
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.550
If they found out you got a scholarship based on a rowing machine photo,

35
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.193
we'll wait and we'll get.

36
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.860
<v 0>Was it for scholarships or was it just get, trying to get them in.</v>

37
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.500
<v 2>To just to get any, I don't think they got scholarships,</v>

38
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.660
but to be on the rowing team, you know, or whatever it's called. Uh, I forget,

39
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:04.020
I've talked.

40
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.390
<v 1>To my head. Is it like good for your GPA or some?</v>

41
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.700
<v 2>It's a way to get in.</v>

42
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.610
<v 1>Oh. Way to get in. Yeah. Oh, right. So that end the bride.</v>

43
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.800
<v 2>Extracurricular activity kind of stuff on your record.</v>

44
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.450
<v 1>And whatnot. So they just, they fudged that and then bribed the rest of it.</v>

45
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.620
Do you think the kids knew?

46
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.360
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. You CA you know, when your parents like, Hey,</v>

47
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.090
we just bought this rowing machine.

48
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.060
Why just don't worry about it.

49
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:33.420
We're just going to take a picture of you in a rowing machine, like sure.

50
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:34.770
You know, you're, you're getting a picture,

51
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:38.430
taken a you to try to get you into this school that your dad went to or

52
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:41.580
whatever. You're complicit to some degree. Like.

53
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.080
<v 1>You have to be a little.</v>

54
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.340
<v 0>Yeah. A little.</v>

55
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.980
<v 1>Bit to that picture. She doesn't even shouldn't even broke a sweat.</v>

56
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.900
<v 2>Has her face covered in. So.</v>

57
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.560
<v 1>I want to see closing on that. She didn't look sweaty to me.</v>

58
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.750
<v 2>Crew is the word I was trying to.</v>

59
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.420
<v 1>Think of. She looks like she's barely started exercising.</v>

60
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.750
There's another one down here too. Yeah. Come on son. I don't see no sweat.

61
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.010
That's a better one. Cause look, stop, go up. Look at that. That's a gray sweat.

62
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.610
A gray. T-shirt great. T-shirts look sweaty instantly. Yeah.

63
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.480
Instantly recall this. This is hilarious.

64
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.020
She probably pulled it back a couple of times. Am I done yet?

65
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.700
You can't even get me into USC loser.

66
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.760
My father's a loser and he takes pills. Yeah.

67
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.670
<v 0>Dude, he.</v>

68
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.370
<v 1>Wants you to love me. Well, get me in a EFC.</v>

69
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.360
<v 0>All my friends are going, dude. That thing that's really up. It's like,</v>

70
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:39.220
there's some kid whose parents like w like are making 20 K a

71
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:42.910
year. Who's working his off, you know, like,

72
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:46.930
just like somehow managing to like study nonstop to try to get into a good

73
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:50.200
school. It doesn't get into the school because of that. That's the,

74
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.180
that's the satanic part is like,

75
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.940
they buy their way in and that's someone's place.

76
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.790
They have a limited number of places. Meaning like,

77
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.630
theoretically someone doesn't get into the school who could be the person who is

78
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:04.930
gonna, you know, invent teleportation or some. Yeah.

79
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.080
<v 1>Isn't that weird with schools or you have your first choice. Second choice.</v>

80
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.090
And Billy got his third choice. Yeah. Billy's going. Where's it going?

81
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.790
South Dakota. Billy. What's in South Dakota. Yeah.

82
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.020
Flat ground.

83
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.760
<v 0>Dude. I get it though. I mean, I get wanting to get into some Ivy league.</v>

84
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.950
I Illuminati school. I think that'd be cool.

85
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.040
<v 1>Especially if you're in, if you're in the Illuminati and your kid's a dope.</v>

86
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.870
<v 0>You're the Illuminati with an embarrassing.</v>

87
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.830
<v 1>Kid. And if you like, like, I don't,</v>

88
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.960
I don't swear that much real my kids,

89
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:42.730
my kids don't know how I talk around my friends.

90
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.800
What if that's how it is with like Illuminati too.

91
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:47.770
Like these kids don't even know their parents were the Illuminati, you know?

92
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:51.820
And you're like, look, I'm trying to get you to be in a better position in life.

93
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.930
But I was working all the time. I wasn't around, I didn't push hard enough now.

94
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.190
<v 0>Jenny Yale, or they know you're in it. And they're just like, you're like,</v>

95
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:04.390
did you get into my adrenochrome again? They're like breaking into your vaults,

96
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.250
you know, taking your, like goblets of blood and drinking it.

97
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.060
Parties don't drink anymore. My blood, you have to stop this.

98
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.170
<v 1>You know,</v>

99
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.380
I joined them in the skull and bones don't they bring their kids to skull and

100
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:20.380
bones. I don't think so. I think they do. I think they, they,

101
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.320
once they're there in their son, turns 30 decided son,

102
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.160
I'm going to show you something. They take him, take him to the skull and bones.

103
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.790
Don't they bring them in. No, you, if you go to school there, you get into it.

104
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.730
Right. That's how you, I think that's how you get to the end of school.

105
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.360
That's how you get in stuff. Right? Legacy. Is that how you get in?

106
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:39.820
Or is that how you get in skull and bones? Like, I would not,

107
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.270
I don't think the whole school gets to be scone, but that's you,

108
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.760
that's how you get accepted is when I met, that's how you get into this school.

109
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.830
Isn't that funny? Like, if you're in a place like Yale,

110
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.300
which is very exclusive and very prestigious already, some creeps,

111
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.830
like that's not enough. I want to get in the secret cult, Dick suck society.

112
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.740
What do they do? They don't suck. Do they know?

113
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.400
They're a rumor that they make each other blow each other on,

114
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.500
take photos of it so that they, uh, they have something over them. That was,

115
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:10.400
what's one of the crazy online conspiracy theories. Right. They,

116
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.370
they make every guy suck a Dick and they take Polaroids of it.

117
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:15.080
And so they always have it. They hold over you.

118
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.080
I think that's just fraternity stuff, but yeah. Is that normal fraternity stuff?

119
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:21.080
I mean, Burt's talked about that thing, whatever for it. Yeah.

120
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.290
They would jerk off on a biscuit, right? Yeah. That's the circle jerk thing.

121
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.130
And the last guy to come eat the best yet. No, one's really doing,

122
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.100
except for the one idiot.

123
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.960
That one guy who can't come because it's just jerking off all the time

124
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.153
and he just.

125
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.120
<v 0>Yeah. I said, I talked to a bunch of my friends. who's cares. I going to say,</v>

126
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.540
are we in a time now? Where like, like a picture of me emerges,

127
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.670
sucking all my friends. I think there's.

128
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.080
<v 1>I think they peg you or something.</v>

129
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.430
They take pictures of them wearing a strap-on and you got pegged.

130
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.500
Some people know why, but you know,

131
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:56.240
they want to rise through the branch at Raytheon and get to the top every time.

132
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.560
<v 0>And Raytheon gets pegged, like, wow, you know, that's just like, it. Like, yeah,</v>

133
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.880
we all get pegged now. So what we're inventing bombs now. You're like,

134
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.930
who cares? Of course.

135
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.360
<v 1>We get packed. Yeah. But the guys were in a goat costume.</v>

136
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.710
<v 0>So what I like to wear a goat costume. When I get pegged, I like too much.</v>

137
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.830
It's like, God. I hope we get to a time where like,

138
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:20.300
they take pictures of someone doing a thing that's legit up so that, you know,

139
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:23.480
and they get banished for it. It's like, God forbid, like,

140
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:27.650
I can't even imagine the Polaroids that could emerge of weird. I've done.

141
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:29.180
You know? I've I could only imagine.

142
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.840
<v 1>You can't.</v>

143
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.250
<v 0>Imagine. I can't. Uh, but that being said, it's like, yeah,</v>

144
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:39.020
I wonder what, what I think what the initiation, I get it. Like it is look,

145
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:40.330
let's face it. You're not going to charge.

146
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.510
<v 1>Fun to be a part of a little tiny group. That's a part of an exclusive group.</v>

147
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.820
Right? You got the exclusive group. That's Yale.

148
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.400
And then you get the little skull and bones. We're all good together.

149
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.380
All brothers in the, in, in the room would they probably have like secret wars.

150
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:55.490
You have to say in Latin and.

151
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.900
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, we,</v>

152
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.880
that's the thing that I imagine based on the way I have come to

153
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:06.530
understand things, whatever it is is way more boring than we imagined,

154
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.160
because you know what I mean? Like when you don't know what a thing is,

155
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.910
you always project the worst thing on it. My guess is it's boring as.

156
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.920
It's probably just some college where people are in a frat sit around and like

157
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.040
make dumb jokes and do stupid. And it's nothing.

158
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.350
<v 1>Peggy. They probably just take a Polaroid of your. Got it. Look,</v>

159
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.540
we got your gear, man.

160
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.610
<v 0>Yeah. We have a picture of your. It's your soul's fingerprint.</v>

161
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.030
<v 1>[Inaudible] your told a lot about you.</v>

162
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.480
<v 0>That's.</v>

163
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.920
<v 1>A person's eyes, you know? And you see their soul. It's the windows to the soul.</v>

164
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.200
What if the is like,

165
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.810
you really know whether you like someone just by looking at their,

166
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.630
something about the tells you things. Books.

167
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.860
<v 0>Come out, decoding your.</v>

168
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.690
<v 1>Now like people read hands. They read fingerprints. You can't, they read.</v>

169
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.770
I bet tell you a lot. Just like, ah, someone's eyebrows dealer.

170
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.040
Someone's got like, mean eyebrows, like whoa, like how it looks aggressive.

171
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.000
I don't trust the guy's got big thick, bushy eyebrows.

172
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.610
And he's not mean I get suspicious.

173
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.810
He's all friendly with big, crazy eyebrows.

174
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:26.400
But all the villains have big, crazy eyebrows. They're all angry.

175
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:29.250
Yeah. It was crazy eyebrows. Yeah.

176
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.920
<v 0>Yeah. It's just like, man, I, for one here's probably for sure.</v>

177
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:38.340
We don't know that you can't tell a person future from their yet because no

178
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:39.174
one's thought it.

179
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.940
<v 1>That could be the new thing that people pick up as a business during this</v>

180
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:43.740
pandemic. Yeah. reading.

181
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.620
<v 0>Or what if it's like a, what if it's like scan it</v>

182
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:51.720
discount.

183
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.900
<v 1>The QR code, your flats into a QR code.</v>

184
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.340
<v 0>All this time. We've been looking for alien signals from space.</v>

185
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.890
We didn't know it was in our. Yeah.

186
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.820
<v 1>It was all, all photos of our. If you put them together on a grid,</v>

187
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.750
it gives us the diagram of how to build a spaceship to get out of here,

188
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:13.830
Except to have all the photos.

189
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:16.980
It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with 8 billion pieces,

190
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.030
you take 8 billion and you put them on a grid and you'll see the schematics

191
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.893
behold.

192
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.700
It'll tell us exactly when the sun's going to supernova for about 50 years.

193
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.040
<v 0>Maybe what if that's what the quantum computer,</v>

194
00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:32.610
the first thing it says is I need pictures of all the on the planet.

195
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.420
<v 1>Like if you vote, you have to show a photo,</v>

196
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.230
your or your phone. You have to have it on your phone. And that's your thing.

197
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.860
You know, thumbprints are not exact are exact exact,

198
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.880
and they don't get changed by workouts or they don't like, you know,

199
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.600
your thumb pin, your hands can get bigger. It'd be a little bit different.

200
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.200
<v 0>All right. How do you know? I don't know that don't get changed from workouts.</v>

201
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.420
<v 1>The one thing they could do with your thumbprint, right?</v>

202
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.990
Some people have burned their prints off. You can't really burn. Well,

203
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.670
I guess you could burn the, your into an unreadable.

204
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:12.180
That's.

205
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.013
<v 0>One of the levels of.</v>

206
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.370
<v 1>Time getting your. Well,</v>

207
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:17.340
I can't get a good relationship because people keep rude, my wrong.

208
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.440
<v 0>Look, I'm more than my.</v>

209
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:31.800
[inaudible].
