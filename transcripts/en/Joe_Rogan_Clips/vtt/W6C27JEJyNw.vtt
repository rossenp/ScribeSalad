WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.600
<v 0>Along with rock, rock my son out here, his first wood duck that he got very, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.480
with much effort and we have that wood duck mounted. There's a,

3
00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:13.400
there's a love affair with our instinctual stewardship

4
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.560
duties to the wildlife, to harvest the surplus,

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:18.680
to make room for next Springs productivity,

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.590
because there's going to be more animals, but there's not gonna be more habitat.

7
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.470
Hence sustained yield, successful wildlife management model.

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.830
That is so perfect.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.310
It defies criticism unless you're a lion sack of.

10
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.350
Have you ever had to.

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.230
<v 1>Have a reasonable conversation with someone who's anti-hunting you ever like SA</v>

12
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.240
often? Yeah.

13
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.060
<v 0>Often. Absolutely. And, and to the, an woman and I mean,</v>

14
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:45.980
adamant vegan until I explain to him, well, vegan, I like that vegan.

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.980
<v 1>Vegan.</v>

16
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.813
<v 0>Whatever it is, vegan vegan,</v>

17
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.060
I can't even pronounce much less bar comes outta your mouth. Figure it out.

18
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.820
&lt;laugh&gt; very so stupid. But by the way,

19
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.780
my son Raco mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; who I love beyond description. Yep. Vegan. No.

20
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.330
Yes. He has. Looks like he needs to eat more. Yeah. Well actually I,

21
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.970
when he is asleep, I try to shove up backstrap up his,

22
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.650
but he's got more muscles than I do. Anyhow. My point is,

23
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.770
is that, how did that, how, how did he become vegan? He hasn't, he has a,

24
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.930
and he has a great hunter. He doesn't like to hunt anymore.

25
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.250
He's decided not to he's uh, killed great deer. Great hogs.

26
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.760
I've seen him on your TV show ducks. Yeah, he's a great hunter,

27
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.440
but he Des he decided he does not wanna take part in the harvest.

28
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.000
I respect it completely, but good for you.

29
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.960
If you really wanna kill the most things,

30
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.520
be a vegan because the farmers who protect your beans,

31
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.150
kill everything. I kill one animal per arrow. In order to grow tofu,

32
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.110
you have to kill every ground squirrel. Every vol, every Shrew, every snake,

33
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.870
every turtle, every frog, every bird, every rabbit,

34
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.270
anything that gets in that bean field, I'm either gonna plow and dismember,

35
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:04.660
which is why the crows and the, and the Seago follow the, the, uh, the combines,

36
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:08.780
the combines every year. And then if anything does survive my first slaughter,

37
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.100
I'm gonna come in with mans Santo and poison the outta everything.

38
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.260
So you can have a tofu salad and not be responsible for any death.

39
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.820
<v 1>You. That's a really good point. And it's a point that a lot of people.</v>

40
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.330
<v 0>Ignore and, and avoid because it's, it's uncommon. Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.050
Isn't life full of uncoming thing.

42
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:31.370
And you shouldn't be uncomfortable to kill game to feed.

43
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.730
Mankind is perfect to kill cows and pigs

44
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.330
to feed mankind. It's the system is often less than perfect,

45
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.810
but until someone comes up with a better system,

46
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.360
I salute and genic at the altar of farmers and ranchers and people

47
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.640
who kill animals to sustain my fellow. Man.

48
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.313
<v 1>I agree with you.</v>

49
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.160
I think you and I would probably both disagree with factory farming when you see

50
00:02:58.161 --> 00:02:59.480
animals stuffed in the cages.

51
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.800
<v 0>But we have to come up with a better system. I kill a lot of beer and I,</v>

52
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.840
I feed more people than any, any hunter ever. I kill so many,

53
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.080
much game every year. Cause I have to, I have to, I know, hire sharp shooters.

54
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.400
I, I, I kill the animals on my beautiful swamp in Michigan,

55
00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:18.360
on my Texas property that have to die. They have to get out of there,

56
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.510
take room for the next year's Fonds. So I soup kitchens, homeless.

57
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.990
I literally give tons. And, and I'm a sweetheart, but I'm not an idiot.

58
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.510
I keep the backstraps,

59
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.310
but I give tons of venison to soup kitchens and homeless shelters and veterans.

60
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:36.830
We make jerky and send it over to the troops overseas. I mean, I,

61
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.950
I have to adjust my Hailer just to get in the room.

62
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.740
So what I do is literally perfect.

63
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.900
<v 1>Well, the problem is what you do, everybody can't do,</v>

64
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.100
like everybody's not gonna have your kind of land.

65
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.940
More people could though more people could. Yes. Well, you, you definitely,

66
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.340
I know the hundreds for the hungry distribute, uh, ton.

67
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.580
<v 0>250, 200 50 million Joe,</v>

68
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.130
250 million meals every year of venison.

69
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.770
And there are people that would ban that shame on you.

70
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.730
<v 1>Well, I do.</v>

71
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.970
I just think there's a lot of films and a lot of documentaries that portray

72
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.530
veganism as being this perfect way of living that doesn't have any death or any

73
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:19.970
you're right. Habitat loss associated with it.

74
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.040
And then they look at the extreme of meat eating, which is the,

75
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:25.000
the worst aspects of it. Factory farming,

76
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.160
some of these disgusting pig farms and chicken pharmacy. Oh, disgusting,

77
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.750
horrible.

78
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.420
<v 0>Horrified.</v>

79
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.720
And they're the upgrade goes on because more alarms have been sounded not by

80
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:35.960
paid and not by the humane society of the United States.

81
00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:39.960
They're just scam artists by people who are coming to

82
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.990
realize that we do not only have a re responsibility to kill critters,

83
00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:46.390
to feed mankind,

84
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.110
but it can be done in an environmentally beneficial way. I mean,

85
00:04:51.111 --> 00:04:53.070
if you watch my great late friend,

86
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:57.310
Anthony Bourdain on his shows and Andrew Zimer on the travel channel,

87
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.700
you watch their shows and the emphasis us on environmentally

88
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.980
friendly productivity, more and more organic farming,

89
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.820
more and more conscientious waste dispersal, whether it's, you know, pig guts,

90
00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:13.420
and they re utilize those or in Las Vegas,

91
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:17.380
they get all this wasted food and they feed the pig. So it's good food going in.

92
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:20.260
The pork tastes better. So there is upgrade taking place.

93
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.050
And here's the ultimate inescapable fact of upgrade environmentalism.

94
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.890
When I was growing up,

95
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.810
Joe lake EIE would catch fire because of the

96
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:35.610
pollution. It wasn't environmentalists or Greenies that sounded the alarm.

97
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:38.570
It was the duck hunters that said your pollutant. This area is so bad.

98
00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:43.120
There's no ducks. There's no wild salary. There's no wall. There's no fish.

99
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.880
There's no muskrats for the trappers hunters,

100
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:49.320
fishermen and trappers have sounded the alarm more often than not about

101
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:51.560
environmental IR responsibility.

102
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.720
And now lake area that would spontaneously combust when I was growing up

103
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.040
is now the number one walleye and small mouth bass fishery in the world.

104
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.600
And it's still, we're still producing.

105
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.080
You've still got the industrial evolution going on there, but conscientious,

106
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.680
higher responsible level of awareness is spreading like

107
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.800
wildfire across the country.

108
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.430
And I believe that there's no mutual exclusivity whatsoever to

109
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.070
productivity and environmental responsibility.

110
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.990
I believe that they both benefit each other.

111
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.190
And I've got so many UN unlimited examples where that's worked from farms.

112
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.343
I mean,

113
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.910
people who live down wind of a P big farm are gonna be the biggest

114
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.150
squaws rightly so. Yeah. And,

115
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.540
and so I see a lot of upgrade going on more organic, more conscientious,

116
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.740
less waste. It's not, um, it's not as, uh,

117
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.380
regular operating procedures. It should be, but I see upgrade.

118
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.020
<v 1>I think, I think you're right. And I think that the,</v>

119
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.300
the thought process behind all these people that are upset about factory

120
00:06:54.301 --> 00:06:56.140
farming, people, even that go vegan,

121
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.650
the thought process is behind it is in the right place.

122
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.130
I just think there's a lot of misguided energy there because they don't really

123
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.890
understand where the food is coming from.

124
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.570
They don't understand large scale agriculture. They don't understand when you,

125
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.810
and a lot of large scale agriculture is to grow food,

126
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.610
to feed animals that people essential. Yeah. Yeah. But it's also wheat.

127
00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:19.520
There's also a lot of grain that people consume and that displaces

128
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.200
thousands and thousands of acres of animals. Sure. And the,

129
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.920
the process is not a clean process. It's not clean in,

130
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.560
in terms of there's no death, there's no harm. Yeah. It's cruelty free.

131
00:07:31.561 --> 00:07:32.394
That's crazy.

132
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.720
<v 0>If you can possibly go through a day without having blood on your hands,</v>

133
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.670
do you drive on the highways?

134
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.430
Does any of your sustenance come on the highways because billions

135
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.230
of animals are slaughtered on the highways every day.

136
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.870
And if you are on planet earth, part of that blood is on your hands.

137
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:57.150
You gotta be who doesn't know this. Who's not willing to admit this, but again,

138
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.980
I see an upgrade in level of where earnest and responsibility, but the,

139
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.820
the charge began in the hunting, fishing and trapping community, because agree,

140
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.620
where does, where does quality air, soil and water come from?

141
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.220
I'll go ahead and answer that wildlife habitat.

142
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:11.661
<v 1>Well,</v>

143
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:14.900
it's a lot of the people that are out there every day that really recognize it.

144
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.860
<v 0>Yeah. And more and more. I, you know, I used to,</v>

145
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.810
I still get death threats because I murder innocent animals. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

146
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.410
<v 1>I didn't put no, I get those too.</v>

147
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.570
<v 0>What the hell? So it's just so.</v>

148
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.410
<v 1>Absurd, but I think their, their heart like the right Don place,</v>

149
00:08:28.411 --> 00:08:30.330
I don't know what they're talking about. No.

150
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.170
<v 0>They're just haters. They're just a little bit of that too. How, how in 2018,</v>

151
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:39.810
do you not acknowledge barbecue? &lt;laugh&gt; how in 2018,

152
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.960
do you not acknowledge? There's a few dead turkeys on Thanksgiving. What,

153
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.360
I mean, you gotta be brain dead.

154
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.800
I think they're so consumed with hate that they fight ignorance is acceptable.

155
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.800
I'm ignorant. When I go to the Indy 500, I couldn't tune a Cogsworth. I don't,

156
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.280
I'm ignorant about CO's worth ignorance is acceptable because you can remedy it

157
00:08:58.281 --> 00:09:03.280
with knowledge and, and research. Stupidity is when you guard your ignorance.

158
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.520
If you think that we're murdering innocent animals to feed our families

159
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:11.160
with the purest protein available to mankind,

160
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.830
balancing the herds with more dear, more elk, more bison, more turkeys,

161
00:09:15.831 --> 00:09:20.830
more waterfowl, more cougars, more bears than ever in recorded history,

162
00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:22.430
except for the bison. But we're way back.

163
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.030
We have as many bison as we can sustain in north America.

164
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.630
A lot of the native American tribes are desperate to get more harvested in an

165
00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:31.190
efficient and responsible manner.

166
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.420
So wildlife is thriving because hunters in implemented regulations

167
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.700
for sustained yield. How many ducks can we kill? How many will they reproduce?

168
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.860
Where is their habitat? Where determines their reproduction.

169
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.820
We must safeguard that Delta water file ducks unlimited, but see,

170
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:51.980
this information is universally available, but the fake news,

171
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.860
academia, Hollywood,

172
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.850
and half of our government is stone cold obsessed

173
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.210
with political correctness and denial. Yeah. So I do what I do.

174
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.290
And our spirit of the wild show has been number one,

175
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.450
an outdoor channel is 29 years now. Wow. I'm getting old. Um,

176
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:11.050
because we say it like it is.
