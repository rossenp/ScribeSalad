00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.853
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.120
I would also remind everybody of this with respect to the drug price, um,

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.750
discussion that bill, that HR three bill,

4
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:12.720
it won't become law because the Senate won't take it up and the president won't

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.080
sign it. But if it did it wouldn't hurt big pharma.

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.710
I think Democrats would like to believe that it would hurt big pharmaceutical

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:23.520
companies. It wouldn't, it would put all of the smaller startup, um,

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.450
biotech companies totally out of business because they're the ones who actually,

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.650
they start that innovation just, just, just like happens in silicone valley,

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.680
the startups start it, and then they get bought out by the bigger companies.

11
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:37.920
That's sort of how the system works. And it's, it's a very dynamic system. It's,

12
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:41.460
it's, it's why we are the, by far, the number one innovator in the world,

13
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:45.120
no other country innovates like we do, they don't do the research like we do.

14
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.350
If we implemented the price controls that are inherent in Medicare for all,

15
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:50.550
or HR three,

16
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.500
there wouldn't be anybody else in the world doing what we do. Um,

17
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.940
I can relate that back to the coronavirus discussion too on, because there's a,

18
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:03.300
there's like a, there's a big discussion about, you know,

19
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.360
should we have Medicare for all doesn't coronavirus, uh,

20
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.310
prove that everybody should have a free healthcare. And again,

21
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:15.180
what I, what I have to remind everybody is is that if we had Medicare for all,

22
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:17.820
what we're basically talking about our price controls,

23
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.260
because Medicare already pays below average payment for,

24
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:25.530
for anything we're for whatever service, wherever for whatever doctor visit,

25
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.930
it's about 60, 70% on the dollar. Can.

26
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.530
<v 1>I stop you right there? Medicare is available for who right now, what.</v>

27
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.270
<v 0>What is the bubble that it cares for as a senior program? Right.</v>

28
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.090
<v 1>So what, at what age is it? Does it kick in? Is it 65?</v>

29
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.400
<v 0>I believe so. Um, yeah, I don't want to confuse it with social security.</v>

30
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.080
<v 1>So the idea is that for older folks, we should, uh,</v>

31
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.300
give them healthcare and make sure that their basic needs are covered in terms

32
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:58.340
of sickness, illness, injury, and such.

33
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.560
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I mean the, the entire, you know, it w we could argue that we could,</v>

34
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:08.160
we could even debate the merits of, of Medicare on its face.

35
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.320
<v 1>But Medicare for all would be available for everybody. Now,</v>

36
00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:14.410
if Medicare for all was available for everybody,

37
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.190
what you're saying is it was essentially you, you would fix prices on,

38
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.220
on everything in terms of medical treatments.

39
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:24.130
And that would be a problem because of what.

40
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.350
<v 0>Well, so, okay. So once you find once you've fixed prices, um, well,</v>

41
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:32.450
imagine this imagine if, if,

42
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.360
if the government said that your podcast could,

43
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:37.310
could only take a hundred dollars per ad,

44
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.080
and that was just the price fix from now on what incentive would you have to

45
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:44.240
really expand your audience?

46
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:47.180
What expensive one incentive would you have to keep going or expand the

47
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:51.410
business? You wouldn't be able to it's similar under any industry. Once you,

48
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.030
once you fix that price, you're going to reduce the supply that goes in.

49
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.480
Can I stop you on that analogy? Yeah, here's.

50
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.320
<v 1>The problem with the differences of it would have to be a reason why they would</v>

51
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.510
say that I could only get $100 per ad.

52
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.740
The reason why you would say that things shouldn't cost too much for someone

53
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:11.650
who's injured or sick is because we want to take care of each other as a

54
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:12.430
community.

55
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.840
And the idea is that healthcare should be something that we provide so many

56
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:19.900
services to people that we, we, we are United, right?

57
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.590
Who the United States of America we're supposed to be a gigantic community.

58
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.000
And one of the great things that we could do for each other is to make sure that

59
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.610
if someone's sick or injured and something's wrong,

60
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.930
that we can take care of that we would like everybody to do their share.

61
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.740
And we would like everybody to chip in so that this is possible,

62
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.640
but there's a big difference between that and fixing the price on an ad.

63
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.280
Well.

64
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.510
<v 0>No, but not economically. There's no difference morally there is. And,</v>

65
00:03:47.511 --> 00:03:49.140
and I agree with you morally, we do have the,

66
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.320
we have the same goal of getting everybody adequate care, right.

67
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.790
But from an economic standpoint, but from an economic standpoint, my, my,

68
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.560
my point still stands and, and you can apply that to any industry.

69
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.360
<v 1>But I think we're looking at medical care as a basic human, right.</v>

70
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.860
Instead of just an economic. Yeah. The.

71
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.450
<v 0>Reason I don't describe it as if it's not in your right.</v>

72
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.370
It is both a moral and an economic issue. But for, for,

73
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:18.900
for my, my argument that you will reduce supply, that is fundamentally true.

74
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.330
It is fundamentally true. We see another countries. It's why,

75
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.340
as we compare ourselves to other countries right now,

76
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:27.450
all these places with socialized medicine, it's important to look at some stats.

77
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:30.550
And actually I have them here. I could take the time to pick them up, but I'll,

78
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.670
but I'll, I'll give you the bottom line up front.

79
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.090
We have overwhelmingly per capita,

80
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.530
more ICU beds in this country than any other Western country

81
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.080
overwhelmingly per capita.

82
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.960
We have more ventilators than any of these other people. We're all,

83
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:49.380
we're all freaking out right now because we're worried about our ventilators and

84
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.090
in our ICU beds, on a per capita basis, our system has way,

85
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:58.710
way more than the UK than Italy and Spain and Germany, all of them like,

86
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.330
like orders of magnitude more. Okay. So, okay.

87
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.430
Also we're the ones who innovate. I mean,

88
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:08.670
the vast majority of research and development and new drugs that come out that

89
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:12.240
comes from this country. So these are, these are facts that we can't escape.

90
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.680
If we do price controls and Medicare for all is fundamentally a system of price

91
00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:21.570
controls. If we do that economically speaking, we absolutely will reduce supply.

92
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.910
I understand the moral argument you're making,

93
00:05:23.911 --> 00:05:26.550
which is we still want to help people. Yes, we should.

94
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:28.410
We should be looking for the ways to do that,

95
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.730
but I want to be able to do that in a way that doesn't undercut the foundations

96
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.570
of the good parts of our healthcare system, which is quality and innovation.

97
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.990
If we undercut those things, and we're the last country doing this,

98
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:44.280
we're the last country in the world, truly doing innovation. Uh,

99
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.130
the world is left out to dry. Can I pause you there?

100
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.180
<v 1>This, what you're saying makes a lot of sense. Is there a way to do both?</v>

101
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.730
Is there a way to provide healthcare to everyone,

102
00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:57.060
but also encourage this innovation encouraged profit?

103
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.040
So you encourage these companies to do all these great things that you're

104
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:02.210
describing and, and,

105
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.960
and maintain this incredibly high level of healthcare that we have right now.

106
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.700
<v 0>That's certainly the goal, right? And, and that, that should be the goal.</v>

107
00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:10.600
And this is why I think there's,

108
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.800
there's gotta be room for compromise on the healthcare debate because you can't

109
00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:17.410
compromise with the other party. If the goals aren't the same,

110
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.290
like I I've come to believe that our goals on immigration are actually not the

111
00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:23.200
same. Okay. So it's hard to compromise on healthcare. They should be the same,

112
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.400
like, cause we, we, we want everybody to have access to quality healthcare.

113
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.310
Now they have a very different way of getting to that point.

114
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.020
We have probably a much more complicated.

115
00:06:32.021 --> 00:06:36.160
We recognize how difficult it is to get to that point while also ensuring that

116
00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:40.480
we maintain quality and innovation. And so,

117
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.850
um, what I'm working on personally is, is the primary care side of things. Okay.

118
00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:47.500
So primary care doctor is your,

119
00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:49.510
that's your first point of contact and healthcare.

120
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.860
And the system that I think works best for that as direct primary care.

121
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.840
So direct primary care basically means that you, Joe, you're a doctor. Um,

122
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.260
you can handle about 250, 300 patients at a time.

123
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.090
They all pay you a subscription fee of about $75 a month and they have full

124
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:10.660
access to you. So it's like less than a cell phone bill. This already exists.

125
00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:14.660
This model is prevalent. It's growing. I would like to see it grow much faster.

126
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.090
Okay. How do you do that? Well,

127
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:19.930
we can subsidize lower income people in order to do that.

128
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.410
Now how we do that is very complicated. That's what I'm working out. Um,

129
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.270
and within our complicated system,

130
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.310
but that's an idea to one make that free market model actually

131
00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:34.570
take off so that people who don't need help with their healthcare costs like you

132
00:07:34.571 --> 00:07:38.230
and me, we can still afford that. Just like we afford any other monthly costs.

133
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.950
And you have access to preventative medicine, you have access to telemedicine.

134
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.420
You actually have a doctor patient relationship that makes it a lot easier to

135
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:49.210
start solving the rest of the problem. Um,

136
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.630
making our insurance market more competitive, making, putting more choice in it,

137
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.510
directly subsidizing those who need it,

138
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.000
but in a way that looks a lot more like Medicare advantage.

139
00:07:58.001 --> 00:08:01.780
So Medicare advantage is a part of Medicare that basically forces competition

140
00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:04.090
and choice between insurance companies.

141
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.870
It came out to be a lot cheaper than we originally thought it would in the early

142
00:08:07.871 --> 00:08:09.700
two thousands. When, when this thing was created,

143
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:14.290
this was a Republican plan because there's certain foundations that I think we

144
00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:17.860
have to adhere to anytime we want to problem solve choice and competition are

145
00:08:17.861 --> 00:08:20.440
among, I mean, you, you can't escape those things.

146
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.310
And I think when he would talk about Medicare for all, it tries to,

147
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.900
it tries to move past these essential foundations, um,

148
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.040
whether of a free society that we have to adhere to. And,

149
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.900
and because the, the other thing I, I pushed back on a little bit is,

150
00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:41.950
is the healthcare is a right. Um, S a statement.

151
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.830
And I pushed back against that because what that,

152
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.540
when you're calling something a right,

153
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.640
what you're effectively saying is that somebody else has a obligation to serve

154
00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:54.340
you. And it's hard to call something a right, when that right.

155
00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:58.430
Requires service of somebody else, don't do that. Don't.

156
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.790
<v 1>You already do that with the firemen.</v>

157
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.440
Don't we do that with the police department.

158
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.520
Don't we do that with public schools? No.

159
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.960
<v 0>Not exactly. No. I mean, we, we, we have public services that I would,</v>

160
00:09:08.961 --> 00:09:13.910
I would distinguish those public services from something like a rec

161
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.810
quantum of care. I would distinguish them to it to an enormous extent, like,

162
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.160
and here's why you can add a few hundred thousand more people to, uh, you know,

163
00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:25.070
to, to the nation's population.

164
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.880
And it doesn't change the mission of the military, right? Like it doesn't,

165
00:09:28.881 --> 00:09:32.210
it doesn't take an away thing away from them, but these,

166
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.450
but because of the sort of non-rival, um,

167
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.010
this is like an economics term for the sort of non-rival

168
00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:43.370
attribute of these things. It is different, right?

169
00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:45.200
Because there's only a select number of doctors.

170
00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:47.420
And we've already said that once you put price controls and there's going to be

171
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:51.380
less doctors, because doctors will be paid less, they'll get burned out more.

172
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.760
Um, they'll the then possibles will be able to,

173
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.030
I actually never finished that point. Um,

174
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.480
the reason price controls reduce supply, and we're using,

175
00:09:59.481 --> 00:10:02.810
we see supply reductions than other countries is because, well,

176
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.310
hospitals don't get the same amount of money.

177
00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:06.200
They're not gonna invest in that extra ICU bed.

178
00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:07.880
They're not going to buy those extra ventilators.

179
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.770
They're not going to hire those other doctors.

180
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.770
A doctor doesn't want to be a doctor because they don't make the amount of money

181
00:10:12.771 --> 00:10:14.570
that they thought they would make. Um,

182
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.080
they're doing extra work because there's more people who now have access to

183
00:10:18.081 --> 00:10:22.000
them, but there's less of them. So wait lines are huge. And they didn't,

184
00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:24.140
and they're seeing multiple more patients a day.

185
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.640
Doctor burnout increases quite a bit. That's the quick answers to why, why,

186
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.880
why that happens. But does that kind of answer your question?

187
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.490
It was getting really, yeah.

188
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:39.380
<v 1>The human right issue. We, we kind of moved around with that, this,</v>

189
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.100
the idea that it's different than the fire department or the police department.

190
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.760
<v 0>Or, well, it's not a right either actually the, the, the fire departments,</v>

191
00:10:46.761 --> 00:10:49.850
not necessarily a, a right as we would, but it's.

192
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.370
<v 1>Service that's provided to everyone now.</v>

193
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.680
<v 0>It is. But, but, but, but understand, so let's call it a public service then,</v>

194
00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:00.680
and let's call a doctor healthcare, a public service as well,

195
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.270
if we were to do Medicare for all.

196
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.880
<v 1>But wouldn't the result be the same if it's provided for everyone?</v>

197
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.980
<v 0>Um, not, not from a practical standpoint, just because it's much easier. Again,</v>

198
00:11:09.981 --> 00:11:12.950
you could add a hundred thousand people more to your city and the fire

199
00:11:12.951 --> 00:11:16.700
department would have marginally more, more work to do, you know,

200
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.720
compared to like an, a doctor, for instance. Does that make sense?

201
00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:22.940
Like you just, it doesn't, I think on a,

202
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.690
if we're trying to compare them in that sense, that,

203
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.020
that non-rival attributes, um, matter,

204
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.350
it matters quite a bit if I'm describing that. Correct.

205
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:38.000
<v 1>So what you're saying is because competition is necessary with medical</v>

206
00:11:38.001 --> 00:11:42.950
innovation and also like doctors profit off

207
00:11:42.951 --> 00:11:47.930
of being exceptional. So you, you, they have incentive to be exceptional.

208
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.990
<v 0>No, no. What I'm saying is if you have,</v>

209
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.330
if you have 10 doctors that are serving a community, um,

210
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.310
every time that doctor is serving somebody,

211
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:59.210
it means somebody else can't see them. Well.

212
00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.740
<v 1>Isn't that just a signal that we need,</v>

213
00:12:01.741 --> 00:12:05.850
more doctors and more hospitals they're understaffed. Uh.

214
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.470
<v 0>It, it would be, yes,</v>

215
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.840
but I'm saying that's how it's different from a fire department,

216
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.870
which is sort of lying in wait for a fire to occur. Well,

217
00:12:12.871 --> 00:12:17.340
if there was more fires. Yeah. But, but just unlikely most of the time,

218
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.730
I'm just, I'm, I'm trying, I'm trying to distinguish why those,

219
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.170
why those aren't very comparable things. Like what,

220
00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:28.550
why one is more of a public service that, that we see to work while,

221
00:12:28.551 --> 00:12:31.360
while the other wouldn't necessarily be in for, and, and,

222
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.730
and you kind of just said it yourself,

223
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.450
it would be a signal for there to be more doctors, um,

224
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.050
which is why the free market, um, price,

225
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.550
price points are so important because the only way to signal that is to

226
00:12:44.551 --> 00:12:46.980
actually, um, uh,

227
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.460
that demand raises prices when the government tries to do that.

228
00:12:50.461 --> 00:12:53.100
Now there's this theory as a socialist that they would say,

229
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.270
the government can just figure that out. Um, I,

230
00:12:56.271 --> 00:13:00.090
I would say that they've tried that in the past. It never works. It never,

231
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.680
it just, it never ever works.

232
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.850
The government can't possibly be so omniscient as to know every single price

233
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:10.740
signal and anticipate every single piece of demand

234
00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:13.200
and production that is therefore required. And so, you know,

235
00:13:13.201 --> 00:13:15.270
it's not just healthcare that this is a problem. It's,

236
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.310
it's every aspect of society. So.

237
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.590
<v 1>If I can go back to what you were saying earlier,</v>

238
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.020
so what you're essentially saying about socialism,

239
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.380
that socialism looks at this problem and says, Hey,

240
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.290
let's make the government take care of everything.

241
00:13:28.291 --> 00:13:31.440
Let's take money from the wealthy people and pour it into the government.

242
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.590
And that the government will then have resources to take care of these issues.

243
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.920
And you'll, you're just looking at the first step of the problem.

244
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.010
You're not looking at the secondary or tertiary

245
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.180
instances or things that are going to go sideways.

246
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.000
Once you do implement that first step, is that what you're saying?

247
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.360
<v 0>It's a hundred percent what I'm saying. I would,</v>

248
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.600
I would add the social and leaves out some very important things like,

249
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.290
like human nature, uh, for instance, and,

250
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.820
and this, this notion that we need incentives,

251
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.020
um,

252
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.580
socialism doesn't believe in incentives doesn't believe that we need incentive

253
00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:10.230
to do things. There's, there's, there's,

254
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.210
there's this utopian belief among the most hardcore

255
00:14:15.211 --> 00:14:18.240
socialists that, that humans will act in this,

256
00:14:18.241 --> 00:14:21.510
in this kind of philanthropic manner, no matter what,

257
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.660
like we're going to do the most amount of work, even if that reward is,

258
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.360
is overwhelmingly, taken away from us and redistributed.

259
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.330
But of course that's not how it would actually function in reality,

260
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.390
you would start to you. It just wouldn't right.

261
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.490
And so you're now maybe for a few people,

262
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.860
if you altruistic people would be the ones, you know,

263
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.680
doing all the work while everybody else is like pretending to work,

264
00:14:40.681 --> 00:14:43.110
which was what happened in the Soviet union. You pretend to pay us,

265
00:14:43.111 --> 00:14:46.740
we'll pretend to work. Right. But that was the saying from the Soviet union.

266
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.920
That's I think we intuitively understand that. And, and, and when that happened,

267
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.560
and again, the same thing with Medicare, for all, if, if you're,

268
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:58.400
if you have price controls, your incentives change. And, and if we're,

269
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.330
if we're not really serious about understanding that aspect of, of these,

270
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.620
of these policies, then we're, we're, we're not thinking through them correctly.

271
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.500
And I understand a lot of Democrats would say, well, it's Medicare for all.

272
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:12.530
It's not socialism. And I'm like, yeah, but it,

273
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.570
but it has very socialistic tendencies.

274
00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:18.650
And it has these qualities that I've described of not taking into account the

275
00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:23.640
second, third order effects of removing human incentive of, of, of,

276
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.740
of forcing somebody services. And because you're calling it a right,

277
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.890
which means that you now have a right to somebody else's services like these

278
00:15:30.891 --> 00:15:35.570
are, these are things that have been proven not to work. And,

279
00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.610
and I, and I think we, and I think we have to understand that as,

280
00:15:38.611 --> 00:15:42.710
as we try to move towards the mutual goal of getting everybody access to

281
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.720
healthcare.

282
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.610
<v 1>It doesn't work with everything, but it does.</v>

283
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.590
Doesn't that work with the fire department?

284
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.000
Isn't the fire department in a lot of ways, a socialist institution.

285
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:54.520
<v 0>No, no, I, again,</v>

286
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:59.110
I still say it is not because it is not under any obligation to serve

287
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.380
everybody, um, that, that demands its service, right.

288
00:16:02.381 --> 00:16:06.730
It's there for specific emergency service as a, as a public, but.

289
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.480
<v 1>It's there for fire. If there's a fire, they, they come in and help you.</v>

290
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.550
There's not a financial incentive for them to do so.

291
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.340
<v 0>Right. But I mean, but, but on a practical level, on a practical level though,</v>

292
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.400
imagine the scaling that has to occur if you're,

293
00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:28.660
if you're doing that with medic with medical care and I, and I think that's,

294
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.660
and I think that's the difference with, from an economic point in a,

295
00:16:31.661 --> 00:16:32.890
in a practical standpoint.

296
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.040
<v 1>We're talking about over, well, you're talking about socialism overall,</v>

297
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:38.710
not just overall, not just involving medicine,

298
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.360
you're talking about socialism in general,

299
00:16:40.361 --> 00:16:44.560
and I'm saying isn't the fire department and an example of socialism that works

300
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:46.520
well.

301
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.670
<v 0>Definitely not an example of socialism. Um,</v>

302
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.560
I think it's an example of a public good,

303
00:16:50.561 --> 00:16:52.870
the way the military is an example of a public good.

304
00:16:52.871 --> 00:16:56.950
The way the highways are examples of public goods, the way parks are, right.

305
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.760
<v 1>But they're funded by the people it's funded by people overall.</v>

306
00:17:00.761 --> 00:17:02.740
And it doesn't cost people money to use them.

307
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.720
And the people have these as a basic part of our society and our

308
00:17:07.721 --> 00:17:08.560
civilization.

309
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.190
<v 0>No, I understand that. And I have nothing, no problem with that. I just,</v>

310
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.260
I just would not call them socialists. Well, what'd you.

311
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.840
<v 1>Call the fire department? W w how does it get funded?</v>

312
00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.180
<v 0>It's a public good, how's it get funded?</v>

313
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.470
It's a public good it's with it's funded by the public. And it just,

314
00:17:23.471 --> 00:17:25.810
it's not it's, but it's not relying on these sort of,

315
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.950
it's not relying on the tenants of socialism to function. And so now we're,

316
00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:32.710
now we're kind of having a discussion of, of definitions.

317
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.900
And this is an important discussion to have, because

318
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.000
oftentimes even Democrats, aren't really talking about socialism. Well,

319
00:17:40.001 --> 00:17:40.570
even Germany.

320
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.370
<v 1>Has Bernie Sanders. Doesn't call it socialism.</v>

321
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:44.290
He's talking about democratic socialism,

322
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.600
and he makes some very clear distinctions between the two of them,

323
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.860
which I think you could apply to things like the fire department or the police

324
00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:50.694
department.

325
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.480
<v 0>Yeah. Um, there's a lot in that. So I think Bernie, yes,</v>

326
00:17:56.481 --> 00:18:00.860
he does say democratic socialism. I think he does mean much something much,

327
00:18:00.861 --> 00:18:04.730
much closer to socialism. And that's just me gleaning from his policies. Um,

328
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.340
because he does talk about putting, you know,

329
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.530
government control on corporate boards.

330
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.090
Elizabeth Warren talked about the same thing.

331
00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:13.910
So now we really are talking about nationalizing things. Um,

332
00:18:13.911 --> 00:18:17.630
when you're talking about mass price controls across all industries on wage

333
00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:21.170
controls, that you really are talking about more of an actual socialism,

334
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.720
again, going back to the,

335
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.110
whether a fire department or a park or a public highway,

336
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.340
or the military is a socialist institution. Again, I, I would, I would,

337
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.400
I would really push back against that. That is a, that is a public good.

338
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.370
We've never in our culture, in our economics.

339
00:18:37.371 --> 00:18:40.850
We've never defined these things as socialists institutions, you know,

340
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.230
socialist institution effectively means you're, you're, you're, you're,

341
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.020
you're seizing the means of production. And you're,

342
00:18:47.021 --> 00:18:51.530
you're forcing everybody into a centralized planning state. Um, you're, you're,

343
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.980
you're telling people what they will earn and what you will pay them,

344
00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:56.600
how much they can sell, you know, the,

345
00:18:56.601 --> 00:18:59.090
you start to take more control over the economy.

346
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.410
A lot of the policies set out by Bernie Sanders are movements in that direction.

347
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.770
Uh, the fire department is really not that again, that is,

348
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:11.540
that is a public service. It has a defined, you know, it has a defined budget.

349
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:15.950
It has a defined role. Uh, um,

350
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.570
it doesn't, it doesn't meet any of those other attributes or elements that I,

351
00:19:20.571 --> 00:19:23.210
that I described when I described what a socialist is.

352
00:19:23.211 --> 00:19:24.920
And so this gets into another question, like, what will,

353
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.880
why maybe Bernie just means the Nordic countries, right. And, you know,

354
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.360
I remember the foreign minister from Denmark came to Harvard.

355
00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:35.450
I think he gave a speech. This was a few years ago. And he said,

356
00:19:35.451 --> 00:19:38.900
stop calling a socialist. We're not socialists we're, we're probably,

357
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:43.550
and I would agree, agree with them. Um, all these Nordic countries have frankly,

358
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.290
more of a free market than we do, uh, in,

359
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:49.530
in many ways when we look at their regulatory standards, they're, they're,

360
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:53.500
they're quite liberal. Um, when we look at their corporate tax rates,

361
00:19:53.501 --> 00:19:58.070
it's very low, they don't have a minimum wage, uh, in, in many cases. And so,

362
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:00.500
you know, they're not socialist countries.

363
00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:05.150
What they do have is a very generous welfare state and,

364
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.820
and that's different than [inaudible], that is different than socialism. It's

365
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.820
 a giant welfare state. Now I'm still against that in

366
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.820
 many ways. I think there's consequences to that giant welfare state that, that they now have to suffer with

367
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.820
, um,  as a result. And if you've noticed too, that they D

368
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.820
 they actually used to be very socialist countries, but their economies crashed, 

369
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.820
or as a result, and over time, they became much more free market. Uh,

370
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.820
 we see the same thing out of Israel. We see the same thing out of India. It

371
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.820
 used to be much more deeply socialist countries. And

372
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.820
 a lot of them have just maintained their

373
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.820
 big welfare states, which they are having trouble paying for just like we're having trouble paying for our big welfare state, which is mostly based 

374
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.653
in social security, Medicaid and Medicare.

375
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.920
<v 1>W when you say public good, right.</v>

376
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.640
This is what you feel that the fire department is, it's a public good. Right.

377
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.780
What do you think that it's possible to implement something like that with,

378
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.310
in regards to medical care? Yeah.

379
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.350
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, so this is a discussion. If we,</v>

380
00:21:04.351 --> 00:21:06.210
if we get our definitions straight and we're just saying, okay,

381
00:21:06.211 --> 00:21:09.300
we just want another public good. And it's medical. So that's a,

382
00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:12.060
that's a more accurate way of describing it. I think people.

383
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.240
<v 1>Don't care what's called right. We just want healthcare.</v>

384
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.020
<v 0>Right. But, but then we get back to the discussion we had before. Okay.</v>

385
00:21:19.021 --> 00:21:21.360
What if we did that? Well, there's a cost to it,

386
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.300
and it's a hell of a lot more than the fire department and police department.

387
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.610
Um, the cost by,

388
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.990
by most estimates is in the mid 30 something trillion dollars.

389
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:35.430
Uh, that's a cost on that for over 10 years. So about,

390
00:21:35.431 --> 00:21:37.500
about three and a half trillion per year.

391
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:42.030
So that's basically doubling our budget just every year. Um,

392
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.580
that's in addition to what we already spent. Okay.

393
00:21:44.581 --> 00:21:46.680
So that's additional federal spending. Some, some,

394
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.920
some people try to massage those numbers and say, oh,

395
00:21:49.921 --> 00:21:53.520
but that's actually cheaper than what we have. Now, if you add it all together,

396
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.030
that is false. That is, that is completely false. I, again,

397
00:21:57.031 --> 00:22:01.200
I have a whole podcast where I actually interviewed the guy who made that study,

398
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.500
uh, the economists who did that study, and that's not a controversial study.

399
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.400
Everybody basically agrees Elizabeth Warren's plan was 50 something trillion

400
00:22:08.401 --> 00:22:09.234
dollars.

401
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.210
That's adding what we already spend to the new spending that would have to

402
00:22:12.211 --> 00:22:14.160
occur. So what does that mean in practice?

403
00:22:14.161 --> 00:22:17.130
It means doubling or tripling your taxes, unless,

404
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.920
unless we try to deficit spend it, which I think would be crazy.

405
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.590
So it means doubling or tripling your taxes. And so then,

406
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.000
and then the question is, okay, fine. Well,

407
00:22:24.001 --> 00:22:25.800
I do want to double or triple my taxes. I mean,

408
00:22:25.801 --> 00:22:27.600
some people will say that I don't actually believe them.

409
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.200
I bet once they got their taxes, they would totally change their mind,

410
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.240
but let's say they're totally into it. Okay.

411
00:22:33.241 --> 00:22:35.040
Let's say they actually want to do that.

412
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.910
Then you have the second and third order consequences, which is okay,

413
00:22:38.911 --> 00:22:40.770
what are you getting for this? What is,

414
00:22:40.771 --> 00:22:44.220
what is this new utopia that we really live in, where healthcare is free?

415
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.170
And then I go back to, okay, in order to meet that price point of the,

416
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.890
the three and a half trillion a year that's that's, by the way,

417
00:22:52.891 --> 00:22:56.580
assuming that we continue using Medicare prices, um,

418
00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:01.410
which is what all the plans do assume by the way. Um, so if we're doing that,

419
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.670
we're drastically cutting prices that we pay doctors and hospitals.

420
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.560
If we do that, we drastically cut our supply of doctors and hospitals and we,

421
00:23:10.561 --> 00:23:14.700
and we, and we cut off and choke off the innovative capacity that we do have.

422
00:23:14.701 --> 00:23:19.020
So we're losing those quality, um, those quality points again.

423
00:23:19.021 --> 00:23:20.700
So how do you get people care? Well,

424
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.720
the main problem we have with healthcare in this country is that it cost too

425
00:23:24.721 --> 00:23:27.780
much. That's fundamentally the problem.

426
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:32.580
It is too costly. And so from the Republican side,

427
00:23:32.581 --> 00:23:35.940
but we'd rather do is actually target the source of the problem,

428
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.910
make it easier to get insurance. Cause right now, I mean, you know,

429
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.860
it's for so many Americans, that insurance is just too expensive.

430
00:23:43.861 --> 00:23:46.490
If you have it through your employer, it's usually pretty good.

431
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:49.850
People are pretty happy with that. But for the most part, it's too expensive,

432
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.820
which is why I go back to my direct primary care idea. Because once you hit,

433
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.580
once you solve the direct primary, the primary care issue,

434
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.730
you make solving insurance much easier. You can talk,

435
00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:01.730
then you can still protect people with pre-existing conditions. Uh,

436
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:05.150
we like things like either high risk pools at the state level or re-insurance

437
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:08.110
programs. Uh, you, you can make this, uh, you,

438
00:24:08.111 --> 00:24:12.110
you can continue to make improvements to the system that make it affordable for

439
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:16.420
people. And you can give people a box system that they need. Well,

440
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.830
so get out of that.

441
00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.470
<v 1>Sorry, you broke up there for a second.</v>

442
00:24:20.471 --> 00:24:24.880
This whole connection of doing things remotely sucks. What did you,

443
00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:28.810
can you say that last statement again? Just the last few words that you said.

444
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.980
<v 0>Um, I I'm, well, you were talking about.</v>

445
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.530
<v 1>Insurance. Here's my question about the whole thing.</v>

446
00:24:35.531 --> 00:24:39.460
Like insurance still has to pay for it, then it's still, you're still paying.

447
00:24:39.461 --> 00:24:41.290
Someone's still paying for all this healthcare.

448
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.840
If the insurance companies aren't making any profit,

449
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.990
because they're paying for all the healthcare, then what happens then?

450
00:24:46.991 --> 00:24:48.820
Do we fund the insurance companies? I mean,

451
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.740
how does all this stuff get evened out?

452
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:56.740
<v 0>Are you referring to cases where like, you know, the cost of somebody cares.</v>

453
00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.700
So astronomically expensive that even the insurance company can't afford it,

454
00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:01.840
look.

455
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.590
<v 1>Here's the problem. Right? People can't afford healthcare. So we get them.</v>

456
00:25:05.591 --> 00:25:07.420
Insurance insurance takes care of healthcare.

457
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.340
How did the insurance companies make any money then?

458
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.590
<v 0>Well, I mean, they make a profit just like, just like anybody else,</v>

459
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.320
but they're also, they're,

460
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.600
they're also what we've found is especially with our experiments with Medicare

461
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:23.350
advantage is when you pit insurance companies against each other and in a free

462
00:25:23.351 --> 00:25:26.770
market, um, they lower costs. You know, they,

463
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.460
they are a natural, there's different,

464
00:25:30.461 --> 00:25:33.550
there's different elements of the healthcare system. Um,

465
00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:35.920
on one side is driving up costs, you know,

466
00:25:35.921 --> 00:25:38.680
because the doctor wants to keep doing more tests or whatever it is, or,

467
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.910
or a patient wants to do more things. The insurance company's job is to say,

468
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.660
hold on a second, why are you doing this? What is the reason for this?

469
00:25:46.661 --> 00:25:50.620
What's the outcome that we expect from this? So that naturally drives. That's a,

470
00:25:50.621 --> 00:25:53.620
that's a natural, um, uh, you know,

471
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:58.120
bulwark against higher costs. The government would in a Medicare for all steam,

472
00:25:58.121 --> 00:26:01.420
the government would simply replace that insurance company. We,

473
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.900
we should be very careful when assuming that the government will somehow be

474
00:26:04.901 --> 00:26:06.940
better at that than insurance companies.

475
00:26:06.941 --> 00:26:09.310
I'm not saying insurance companies are great at all.

476
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.050
Everybody doesn't seem to like them,

477
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.870
but I also don't want the government doing it.

478
00:26:13.871 --> 00:26:17.050
I don't want to be in a case like in great Britain where,

479
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.120
where the government will say, you know what,

480
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.090
your grandad's not on the ventilator anymore. We're done with that.

481
00:26:22.091 --> 00:26:24.040
Or your baby can't get that care. I mean,

482
00:26:24.041 --> 00:26:28.450
we've all seen these stories and we don't have that issue in America.

483
00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.240
Um, but can I pause.

484
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.480
<v 1>You don't we have a problem with insurance companies not want to pay for certain</v>

485
00:26:33.481 --> 00:26:35.850
things. They.

486
00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.820
<v 0>Might, but they still, but the care still happens. Um,</v>

487
00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.490
the hospital has to eat that care a lot. And there's,

488
00:26:41.491 --> 00:26:44.790
there's different funding mechanisms that them, I mean, we have a really,

489
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.880
I'm not defending our healthcare system. I want to be clear about that.

490
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:51.810
It's definitely not perfect. It's a huge patchwork, but no, that doesn't,

491
00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.200
that's not the way it happens over there, because over there,

492
00:26:55.201 --> 00:26:58.260
like in great Britain, if you actually nationalize the healthcare system,

493
00:26:58.261 --> 00:26:59.094
the way they do,

494
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.630
it's when they say you're not going to be on the ventilator anymore,

495
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.680
there's no choice. Like, that's, that, that is, that is the decision.

496
00:27:07.681 --> 00:27:11.460
And then that's what they have to deal with. And so it's, it is different.

497
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.880
<v 1>But don't, they have some private health care over there as well.</v>

498
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.790
<v 0>I think they might have elements of it. Same with Canada, but, but,</v>

499
00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.670
but not for basic care, like,

500
00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:24.750
so you can use for other kinds of health care that aren't necessarily

501
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.740
yeah. Like elective stuff. Yeah.

502
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.340
And I I'd have to really get some details for you on what each country does,

503
00:27:32.341 --> 00:27:36.080
but it's limited. They limit what they can actually do. Okay.
