00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.440
<v 1>Experience. Even three people is too many people. Probably. Yeah, it is.</v>

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.280
It's like, if you want to get to know someone,

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.200
it's a one-on-one because even with three people,

5
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.600
you're there's moments where you have something to say,

6
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:14.920
and then someone interjects something else,

7
00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:17.880
and then you lose your point and then you don't express it.

8
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.280
And then the other person's talking and you don't know when to,

9
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.470
and then you find yourself being a little bit more assertive in the way you talk

10
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.750
is just trying to get your point across. You feel like I'm not,

11
00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:28.670
you nailing it talking enough. And then if there's four people you're.

12
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.750
Like the most ridiculous thing they ever do is when they have those seven people

13
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.550
panels and one person just starts chiming in and

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.190
screaming out loud and they're talk over people. And.

15
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.860
<v 0>But they're also talking about,</v>

16
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.020
because I had one foot in cable news for a long time. Still do. I mean,

17
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:46.840
I still go on.

18
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.380
And then I had my long form radio show where I would talk to policy experts.

19
00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:52.820
It was very like the, the ti like right now,

20
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:57.100
when they're talking about the polls for the presidential race is anybody that's

21
00:00:57.101 --> 00:00:59.140
paying attention to that is wasting their time.

22
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.730
It's a complete waste of time to about who's leading in what poll a year away.

23
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.650
It's a year away. You could have aterroris attack. You have the economy,

24
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:08.090
crack people.

25
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.410
<v 1>Like it for a game. It's not a game. Okay. But it is a game.</v>

26
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.930
If you're watching basketball,

27
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.970
do you not pay attention to the first minute of the game?

28
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:15.930
Cause it doesn't really matter.

29
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.970
What's really important is how many points are scored over the four quarters.

30
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.570
Those there four quarters of.

31
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.960
<v 0>A basketball game. I think there might be two have college of college of pro.</v>

32
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.440
But.

33
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.800
<v 1>The point is it's, this is a weird game going on. Like Kamala Harris was ahead.</v>

34
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.600
Now she's. Like this is fun. It's fun for people. This is half of what it is.

35
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.840
I don't, I know it's serious. I know it's significant.

36
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.200
I know there's grave consequences to picking the wrong leader,

37
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.560
but this is a game. Right. But.

38
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.280
<v 0>It's a game. Cuz as you said earlier,</v>

39
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.590
the reason why Kamala Harris or anybody else takes a step backwards is because

40
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.270
one stupid moment and how are we possibly picking somebody on one?

41
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.670
<v 1>Not with pamelamala Harris. There there's a bunch of different issues. Sure.</v>

42
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.190
Yeah. But.

43
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.790
<v 0>But often, I mean, Howard Dean, come on. I mean, have you,</v>

44
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:59.950
have you listened to that? It never gets old. It never gets old whole never,

45
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.460
ever. But it is weird that it is weird that this day and age, that,

46
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:04.700
that crashed him. Well,

47
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.620
given everything that all these other candidates have done and said. Yeah.

48
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.540
<v 1>But honestly there's probably something else.</v>

49
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.580
It's how he responded to that as well is like he showed a,

50
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.340
a lack of humility or understanding of what it was like. Yeah. I sounded stupid.

51
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.300
That's not what important. What's important ladies and gentlemen. Yeah. Yeah.

52
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.450
I screamed out like when he got a microphone on me and uh, I get excited. I go,

53
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.353
yeah.

54
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.050
<v 0>The, the,</v>

55
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.370
I mean you can also talk just about the ego of the people who are running for

56
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:37.290
these offices and they don't seem to have an understanding of the idea of ego

57
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.130
and what it means and how they should try to separate from it while using it.

58
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.040
Like once you get into Paul S much less entertainment and you get really

59
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:47.920
well known and fame,

60
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.000
you start believing things about yourself that aren't even remotely true.

61
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.600
They're not at the root, some of that. Right?

62
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.920
<v 1>Huh? There's certainly some of that.</v>

63
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.360
A feel like they all have that protecting yourself. Right.

64
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.680
You're you have an image you're protecting yourself. Yeah. It's.

65
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.520
<v 0>It's a delicate dance that I, uh, am completely turned off by. I mean, thats,</v>

66
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:06.110
why it's understand.

67
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.960
It's hard to think about like I'm I was seriously considering running for

68
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.120
Congress cuz you were or are I it's hard right now because I

69
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:17.960
learned some crazy. What'd.

70
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.390
<v 1>You learn? Dun dun dun uh, first of all, drum roll please.</v>

71
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.630
<v 0>The, the corruption I live in New York state, wait.</v>

72
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.470
<v 1>A minute, New York. State's not corrupt the.</v>

73
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.390
<v 0>New York state stop.</v>

74
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.030
<v 1>The stop. This show.</v>

75
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.510
<v 0>All of, all of, you know, politics there's levels of corruption. But the, the,</v>

76
00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:40.100
in the New York state democratic party, there's always been all kinds of issues.

77
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.140
So I be,

78
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.020
I met with a whole bunch of really smart people about running for New York 17,

79
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.900
which is the district that I live in.

80
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.580
Like the day after I lost my gig at Sirius,

81
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.060
the woman had been representing that district for 33 years,

82
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:55.500
announced that she was retiring. And I was like, well, I got,

83
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.933
I got nothing going on.

84
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.450
And I've always thought about running for office and let me, you know,

85
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.284
seriously consider it.

86
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.770
I reached out to a whole bunch of people from all different walks of life,

87
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.970
congressmen that were in office that had been out of office, uh,

88
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.810
campaign coordinators. I talked to Chris Cuomo.

89
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.890
I talked to a whole bunch of people,

90
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.090
but there's one person told me that if you wanna, if you wanna win,

91
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.760
regardless of already affiliation, uh, you have to, there's a certain,

92
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.641
uh,

93
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:28.600
special interest group that you had to promise you wouldn't interfere with and

94
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.400
make sure they got an envelope of cash. And I'm like, well, I'm not doing that.

95
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.880
I will tell everybody. And everywhere I go about that, what is it?

96
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.560
I can't because I don't have a second source. So I wouldn't say it,

97
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.550
but when I'm, I'm trying, trying to get one to.

98
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.270
<v 1>Prove that's true. It, what does it rhyme with?</v>

99
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.710
<v 0>Uh, the special interest group. Yes, won't do it.</v>

100
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.030
Cuz he'll just everybody'll know. Everybody'll know and it's, it's dangerous,

101
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.070
but the point is the point is.

102
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.470
<v 1>What's it, the, what's the opposite of that special interest group?</v>

103
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.660
<v 0>Uh, maybe the private sector. Right.</v>

104
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.380
<v 1>But what would be like, what, what would be like't I will tell you if I,</v>

105
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.460
if I think that they're.

106
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.293
<v 0>Opposed to,</v>

107
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.700
what would they be that they're opposed to you interfering with you interfering

108
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:12.980
with the way that they run their.

109
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.100
<v 1>Show. Right, right, right, right. But I'm saying like what,</v>

110
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.940
what group that we know would be opposed to, well, I could, I.

111
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.330
<v 0>Could tell you it could be a religious group, uh, a pride of it sector,</v>

112
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.930
a union or a company, you know, a corporate interest. It could be any,

113
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:27.770
one of the, the point is a C L U the point.

114
00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:31.970
Now the point is that all of those types of organizations,

115
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.410
pressure that you have to, I'm an honest guy. I can't, I can't lie.

116
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.610
I've never said anything into a microphone that I don't, I don't believe.

117
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.560
And that's been, but it to my detriment and to my benefit,

118
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.320
I think I'm authentic. So when I was talking about running for office,

119
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.280
my brother's like, you got, you can't, you can't lie.

120
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:50.520
You can't be dishonest to people. How are you gonna do that?

121
00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:54.160
You'll have to sell out at least a little bit. That was the other thing.

122
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.200
And then I realized, I'm not sure that this district or, you know,

123
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.280
the country's ready for someone like me. I'm a comic,

124
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.400
I've said a billion things on TV, into a microphone and on stage.

125
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.080
And we are in a humorless country right now. Number one, I smoke pot. Like,

126
00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:13.200
are they ready for, for tho? Are we there yet? I don't.

127
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.750
<v 1>Think we're humorless. I disagree. I think there's a lot of criticism going on,</v>

128
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.070
but that's cuz there's a lot of politic politic.

129
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.190
<v 0>For, do you think, I agree with you overall, but I mean, for politicians,</v>

130
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.310
for me to run for office and you see some standup bit I did or something,

131
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.430
and then my opponent's playing that outta context, dude.

132
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.990
<v 1>I got five words for you. Grab them by the that guy's the president.</v>

133
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.180
<v 0>I think he is an aberration. I do.</v>

134
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.820
I don't think there's anything else that can get away with that kind of stuff.

135
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:40.940
Well.

136
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.860
<v 1>I think, I think you're probably right. He's definitely an aberration, but.</v>

137
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.140
<v 0>Uh, I just think Al Franken won as a Senator, as a comedian,</v>

138
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.380
but he was a writer like there wasn't a ton of,

139
00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:50.980
and he got in trouble when there was a photo of him.

140
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.340
<v 1>I've said, well, more than a photo, there was actually all.</v>

141
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.420
<v 0>The allegations. But the, but the photo, you know, perception,</v>

142
00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.210
politics is perception and,

143
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.410
and whatever people see it's different than what they hear and what they

144
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:05.810
believe. And so that's the point that photo was harmless,

145
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.490
but it looked bad just like any joke I've said or anything that I've said outta

146
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:13.490
context. So I just feel like, and then I thought that it, you know, I,

147
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
they could destroy me in any future earning potential that I could have.

148
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.480
I just, the second episode of my podcast, I interviewed Tim Ryan,

149
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.040
you know who he is. He was running for president cuz I was asking,

150
00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:27.360
what does it take? And it's, first of all, you gotta run.

151
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.520
You gotta raise a million dollars from people and individuals. You don't like,

152
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.600
you don't wanna be affiliated with, but you have to,

153
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.190
you gotta make 'em promises that the whole system is so filled and corrupted

154
00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:42.110
with money in almost every district in every state, regardless of the office.

155
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.230
And how do you, how does a person I'm a fairly affluent guy.

156
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.390
I'm a white, straight guy, whatever. But I couldn't,

157
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.670
I don't know how I can afford to apply for a job for a year and pay

158
00:07:55.671 --> 00:08:00.060
mymortgage. So I wanna do it if it looks feasibl bull. Uh,

159
00:08:00.061 --> 00:08:03.020
and if I don't have to take care of my family, my parents, uh, not to mention,

160
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.500
you know, pay my bills. Uh, but it's you,

161
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:09.260
you have to be an independently wealthy person,

162
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.140
which sucks because reg it makes it much harder for regular people.

163
00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:15.940
There's plenty of exceptions to run for, for.

164
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.890
<v 1>Office. Now, when you say that you had to give them a,</v>

165
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.530
an envelope and that you had to, what did you have to do?

166
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:25.650
Did you have to support.

167
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.650
<v 0>Them through intermediariesiaries you have to say basically you have to</v>

168
00:08:28.651 --> 00:08:32.770
basically say I'm not gonna interfere with your business.

169
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.210
We'll just look the other way,

170
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.930
which is had to say that like that's what I'm told. That was what I was told by.

171
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.680
<v 1>How are you told this? Are you told this like, Hey,</v>

172
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.880
if you ever wanna be Congressman yep. You have.

173
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.520
<v 0>To do this. You don't have to. But if you,</v>

174
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.560
but if you don''t wanna win it's you're far more likely to win. If you,

175
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.480
if you pay off these more likely it's not impossible, but they'll,

176
00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:56.240
they'll try to destroy you if you don't really. Yeah. And I can't, it's like,

177
00:08:56.241 --> 00:08:56.670
Joe.

178
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.600
<v 1>They'll just go.</v>

179
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.520
<v 0>After you. You can Des if, if it's just me.</v>

180
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.760
<v 1>Why can't you say who this is? Because.</v>

181
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.400
<v 0>It's only because I Don' know if it's positively true. I need another source.</v>

182
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.280
I try to act like a journalist and someone.

183
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.880
<v 1>Who's the intermediary, like what kind of person is this?</v>

184
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.920
<v 0>He, he manages campaigns in that district.</v>

185
00:09:11.921 --> 00:09:15.030
He knows everything about the politics of, and the, and special in just in.

186
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.950
<v 1>That district. So it could potentially be that he's hoeing you out. Absolutely.</v>

187
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.670
<v 0>Which is why I won't tell you because, and once.</v>

188
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.390
<v 1>He's saying that so that he's, he's like sort of playing both sides. So he goes.</v>

189
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:26.470
<v 0>He wanted me to run and.</v>

190
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.310
<v 1>He wants sure. I'm sure he did,</v>

191
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.470
but he might also want to maintain his relationshippossible with what a group.

192
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:35.460
This is. So he says, Hey, I've gotten a ssurance.

193
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.260
<v 0>Knowing this guy. I don't think he, he he's affiliated with that group,</v>

194
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.940
but it's possible. And, and so I try to, you know,

195
00:09:42.941 --> 00:09:45.300
have journalistic ethics before I would say something,

196
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:47.580
I'll tell you off the mic. Okay. But I, but I wouldn't,

197
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:48.460
can't wait for the show to be over.

198
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.780
But I wouldn't say without having a second source, like that's,

199
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:54.860
what's irresponsible about so much of our media, right? Like when,

200
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.610
when or anybody says fake news, it's like, listen, it's not it. You can't,

201
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:00.850
if you have to have two sources,

202
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.810
you go to your editor with those two sources and then you can print it.

203
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.210
You can't make them up. If you make up a source.

204
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.290
Y you're you're you're like mania, that's it. You're done. You can't,

205
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:12.450
that's like stealing a joke. You can't make up a source.

206
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:15.690
You'll never work again. It would be a stupid to do worse.

207
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.200
<v 1>You make up a joke. I mean, uh, if you make up a, a source, I mean, you,</v>

208
00:10:20.201 --> 00:10:23.160
you literally wouldnt do it. Can't work. Then C is still working. Fair enough.

209
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.120
People do work after.

210
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.440
<v 0>They steal jokes, journalism and comedians yeah. Are a lot different.</v>

211
00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:28.000
But that's.

212
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
<v 1>Of, I mean, it's the worst. If you, if,</v>

213
00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:31.720
if someone finds that you making up a source.

214
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.240
<v 0>Yeah. Nobody does it. And,</v>

215
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.480
and the few in the few instances where someone did make up a,

216
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.070
a source or even plagiarize,

217
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.750
which are the two worst things you can do as journalists, they never work again.

218
00:10:40.751 --> 00:10:43.590
Right. Or they don't work for a very long time, you know, Johan,

219
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.590
har he's been on your show. He's been on my show.

220
00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:48.030
Uh-huh &lt;affirmative&gt; he was accused of, uh, of some, like,

221
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.670
I think it was plagiarism. Yeah. And it took him a really long time to,

222
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.830
to win his integrity back.

223
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.910
<v 1>Yeah. That I didn't find that out actually until after he'd been on the show the</v>

224
00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:58.900
second time. Yeah. But like, what was great guy? He's a great guy,

225
00:10:58.901 --> 00:10:59.540
but what was he.

226
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.460
<v 0>Accused of? I don't remember. It was,</v>

227
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.500
I feel like it might have been plagiarism though. Mm. And,

228
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.100
and that kind of thing, the point is that kind of thing ruins you.

229
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.900
And so I wouldn't come here and do that, even though I don't,

230
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.580
I wouldn't call myself a journalist, but I would want,

231
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:17.420
because what you're saying, cuz you're smart. I'm very skeptical too,

232
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.970
of people and their source of what their interests are.

233
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.410
And a lot of people really want me to run for Congress for a lot of different

234
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:24.110
reasons.

235
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.370
But mainly cuz they think I can tap my network of wealthy people and you know,

236
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.290
they can make money. Well.

237
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.490
<v 1>Love Trump or hate Trump.</v>

238
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.770
That is precisely what he was talking about when he said drain the swamp.

239
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.650
Now this is the swamp, this sort of,

240
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.040
this sort of con voluted world of influence.

241
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.880
<v 0>Well yes and no, the swamp. Yeah.</v>

242
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.640
<v 1>But it's also money and all the other things that he didn't drain.</v>

243
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.760
And he actually brought in people that.

244
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.480
<v 0>Were, he made the swamp swampier way filled with malaria and</v>

245
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.240
crocodiles. Like, like I always, we don't even define things.

246
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:56.840
Unfortunately we don't have the same baseline,

247
00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:57.960
unfortunately in this country of what,

248
00:11:57.961 --> 00:12:02.080
what words mean mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but I've always thought what that meant was

249
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:03.680
government, uh,

250
00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:07.960
corruption that the private sector is influencing government because, and,

251
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:09.240
and the way that they obviously do it,

252
00:12:09.241 --> 00:12:13.590
the system that we have is you have to get money from wealthy people and wealthy

253
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.150
interests. And then you have to advocate for them,

254
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.030
whatever the interest is you have to, or they won't give you more money.

255
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.470
And so that's, what's beautiful about Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders,

256
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.350
they are not allowing any donations from any, uh,

257
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.910
super PACS from any, uh, wealthy individuals. It's it's grassroots.

258
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:34.140
And that's think Chelsea's doing that as well. Yeah. I have of the,

259
00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:36.100
the whole democratic party, mostly committed to it.

260
00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:39.900
Mm-hmm I don't think Biden's doing it. Uh, but the, if Biden was doing it.

261
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.940
<v 2>I don't think he remembers.</v>

262
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.500
<v 0>I totally agree with that, by the way, dude's out.</v>
