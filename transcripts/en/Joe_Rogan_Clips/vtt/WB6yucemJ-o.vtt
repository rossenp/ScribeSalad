00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 3>But you know, the, since we're on this topic,</v>

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.140
can we talk a little bit of vaccines? Cause I'm,

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.500
it's something I've I have seen a lot of misinformation,

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.130
like on everywhere,

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.090
Facebook on, you know, different news, media outlets. And,

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.590
and I think there's really like some, some main ones that,

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.340
that I just feel are causing harm.

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.520
And so, um, there's really eight of them.

10
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:32.520
We don't need to talk about all of them, but I think the eight really are that,

11
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.600
you know, SARS, cov two is not that bad. COVID-19 is not that bad.

12
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.550
And, you know,

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.530
vaccines basically don't prevent transmission spike protein

14
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:47.220
from vaccines are cytotoxic. Therefore they're really bad. Um,

15
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.270
that vaccines are gonna cause something called antibody dependent enhancement,

16
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.060
which is going to make you have a more severe disease.

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.670
There's the vaccines are gonna cause infertility there's the, um,

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.490
vaccines are going to cause a more violent virulent, um, strain or variant.

19
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.240
<v 0>And then there's one more that, um,</v>

20
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.570
alternatives to vaccines exist right now that are just as good.

21
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:15.660
And I think that there's a few of those that are really, I mean,

22
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:20.400
just like blatantly the wrong all of them, I think they're, but I mean,

23
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.590
you know, there's some that are more important than others.

24
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:26.670
And I think that I would like to talk about them. Um, you know,

25
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:30.330
I think first and foremost, the there's like two groups of people,

26
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.020
mostly one take things COVID-19 is bad.

27
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.860
Doesn't want to guess once the vaccine and the other one that thinks it's not

28
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:42.360
that bad and, uh, that the vaccines may be harmful. And there's also.

29
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.210
<v 1>People vaccines are harmful to anyone. Well.</v>

30
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.250
<v 0>Of course, I mean.</v>

31
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.040
<v 1>Do you know anyone that's had bad reactions to vaccines? I.</v>

32
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.140
<v 0>Personally, interestingly,</v>

33
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:55.860
the only I've know a lot of people that have gotten vaccinated and the only

34
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:57.720
person that I know that had something was like,

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.740
she had a headache for like a week and a half and then it went away.

36
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.930
Um, oh no, another person I knew had like nausea for like a couple of weeks.

37
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:11.130
They were like nauseous more, more frequently, but it went away. Um, you know.

38
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.990
<v 1>You would feel differently if you knew someone that had had a stroke or someone</v>

39
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:19.440
who's had heart attacks per tap, perhaps young people that have.

40
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.790
<v 0>Well, I, it's hard to say so, you know,</v>

41
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:28.470
I do people react differently, obviously when you're giving,

42
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:33.180
you know, a hundred and more than 169 million people are vaccinated, right?

43
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.040
I mean that's half our adult population is

44
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.930
vaccinated, fully vaccinated with COVID-19 and, um, it's not zero risk.

45
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.400
People are, some people are going to have an adverse reaction and they do.

46
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.200
It's a big world out there. You know,

47
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:52.680
like if you were to give 169 million people, a peanut or a shellfish,

48
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:54.840
like some people are going to have very adverse reactions.

49
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:58.560
Some people are going to die. Like it's, it's a big world, but you know, with,

50
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.810
with the, or the heart attack, you know, you have to like, like,

51
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.040
so if you're trying to compare, for example, let's say, you know,

52
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:10.510
you're looking at actual COVID-19 deaths and from heart attacks and strokes,

53
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:15.010
and you're looking at the vaccine, adverse events reporting site there's right.

54
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.070
And, and that as well, you know,

55
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.930
you have to realize that basically in the United States, like in 2017,

56
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:24.940
there was a publication in the journal of circulation.

57
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.620
Someone dies from cardiovascular disease, every 30 seconds in the United States,

58
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.120
like every 30 seconds.

59
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.160
Most of those people are above the age of 50 and certainly most are above 65,

60
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.760
but every 30 seconds someone's dying from cardiovascular disease.

61
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.600
Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke.

62
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.730
Every four minutes, they die from history.

63
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.510
<v 1>But this is also very, very rare in young people, particularly young,</v>

64
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:53.260
healthy people. But one thing that has occurred in young,

65
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:55.870
healthy people that have been vaccinated is mild carditis.

66
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.270
And some people have had blood clots,

67
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.860
like quite a few blood clots and there's speculation, right?

68
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.950
The Salk Institute released that paper about the, uh,

69
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.450
spike protein causing, uh, some sort of deterioration of the blood vessels.

70
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:11.284
Did you read that?

71
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.550
<v 0>I look, I've been looking at a lot of the spike protein and.</v>

72
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.470
<v 1>That's from COVID-19 they're discussing.</v>

73
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.210
<v 0>It. They're talking about from yeah. From the.</v>

74
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.350
<v 1>Actual disease itself.</v>

75
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.740
<v 0>Yes. So, um, you know, first of all, like there,</v>

76
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.950
you have to like, there's, you're, you're,

77
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.250
you're either going to get infected with SARS, cov two,

78
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.340
most people are going to be eventually we're all going to be exposed to it.

79
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.980
So you're either going to be vaccinated when you're exposed to it or not.

80
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.570
And people are dying from heart attacks and blood clots,

81
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.640
and even people are getting mild carditis,

82
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:45.940
like a hundred full times more than vaccines. Like the,

83
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.690
the myocarditis link from the MRNs specifically,

84
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:51.700
the MRD vaccines is real.

85
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.810
And I think the last I saw it was like 50 per million,

86
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.250
which is still rare.

87
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.740
<v 1>And it's two people that I know.</v>

88
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.350
<v 0>It. So up until then. And actually now that you asked me, um,</v>

89
00:05:04.351 --> 00:05:09.010
I forgot I had a, um, someone who's a, a supporter. Um,

90
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.110
I talked about vaccines in one of my Q and A's I do.

91
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:14.650
And they went and got it and they were younger and ended up having some kind of

92
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:17.560
myocarditis. So I do know someone that had ha I don't know them,

93
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:18.640
but they emailed me.

94
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.320
<v 1>Now, what happens if you have that? And like, how do you recover from that?</v>

95
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.790
<v 0>Because it's happening to young people. So myocarditis is caused by two things,</v>

96
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:31.930
one by inflammation, two by a direct viral infection.

97
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.660
And it's more common in adolescents and young people.

98
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.280
<v 1>Enlargement of the heart.</v>

99
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.940
<v 0>It's inflammation of the heart can lead to that. Yeah. But it's,</v>

100
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.090
it's happening in young athletes with COVID-19 like,

101
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:47.800
and it's happening like more frequently than people that are getting vaccinated.

102
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.450
So it's still like, well, if the person that got vaccinated, look, it is a risk,

103
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.590
but it's still pretty rare. And it also is treatable.

104
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.350
And most they treat it like within a few days. And it's isolated.

105
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.820
<v 1>Why don't you think that people like there are people that are completely</v>

106
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:09.110
asymptomatic when they get COVID or if they do get it, it's very mild.

107
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.310
Do you think that's because they have a lower viral load that they've been

108
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.720
infected with, or do you think it's their immune system that fights it off?

109
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.800
Like, what do you think has happened?

110
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.660
<v 0>It could be any, and all of those things, a combination of them and, you know,</v>

111
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.080
but so like, even if you think, you know,

112
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:30.230
if you're looking at just like the most extreme part of like the deaths, right.

113
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:33.980
You know, you've got like over 624,000 deaths and COVID-19,

114
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:38.510
most of those deaths are happening in people over the age of 50. Um,

115
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.860
and if you look at like.

116
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.270
<v 1>Most of them have four plus comorbidity factors, right. Isn't that the average?</v>

117
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.940
<v 0>No, if it's four plus for average, for, I think the co-morbidities increase.</v>

118
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:50.900
Yeah. I think they.

119
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.280
<v 1>With the number of comorbidities are in terms of like, uh, the desk,</v>

120
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.730
it used to be 2.6, but I think they raised it to four.

121
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.910
<v 0>Really the number of them before. Okay, thanks. So.</v>

122
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.650
<v 1>I might be wrong, but I know it was.</v>

123
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.560
<v 0>Right. So then there's the argument? Well, I'm healthy.</v>

124
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.150
I don't have comorbidities. Right. I mean, so, so what, what should I do? Like,

125
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:15.440
should I, you know, get vaccinated or, or should I be exposed to the virus?

126
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.660
And I think there's a lot of evidence and there's multiple lines of evidence.

127
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:22.160
One, you know,

128
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.230
there are people with mild symptoms that are getting post-acute COVID syndrome.

129
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.200
They're getting this, what people call it long haul COVID. And, uh,

130
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.730
and the majority of people.

131
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.700
<v 1>What is post, what is long haul COVID I.</v>

132
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.630
<v 0>Don't know what it is. I think it depends on the symptoms.</v>

133
00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:41.870
I think there could be a variety of causes for it. Um, you know,

134
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:45.560
so there are people in most of it's, this is happening in teenagers to like 50,

135
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.320
most of the people that are older are not getting this long haul code,

136
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:51.350
but it's like happening in people that are mostly not being hospitalized.

137
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.660
People that don't get hospitalized originally. And like,

138
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.770
they have mostly like pretty mild symptoms and some cases even asymptomatic,

139
00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.281
you know,

140
00:07:58.281 --> 00:08:03.200
there was a study published in the Lancet like last year

141
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.180
showing there is a seven fold increase in stroke incidents in people under

142
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:10.520
50 in the United States compared to the year before that,

143
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:11.450
before the pandemic start.

144
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.740
<v 1>It's probably because the spike protein that causes this deterioration of the</v>

145
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:18.540
blood vessels and blood clots. Is that what it is from the, from the.

146
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.680
<v 0>Well, I don't know what it is. I mean, there's lots of things, you know,</v>

147
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.030
viral infections themselves can cause hypercoagulation,

148
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.080
they can cause blood clots, like,

149
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:29.870
just like that's like known from other viruses.

150
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:33.410
Like that's some there's inflammation without the spike protein. So let's okay.

151
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.880
I feel like I haven't got to address everything, but let's talk about this.

152
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.880
<v 2>Real quick. I think this four points out where I would find this information.</v>

153
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:41.810
I hope that's the spot.

154
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.450
There was an average of 4.0 additional conditions or causes of death

156
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:49.730
for data on deaths involving coal.

157
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.500
Uh COVID-19 by time period jurisdiction and other health conditions.

158
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.900
This is only 5% of COVID was the only cause. And then,

159
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.100
so for only 5% of the COVID does COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned.

160
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.230
So out of those 600,000 people that died only 5% died just

161
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:11.280
from COVID-19.

162
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:12.931
<v 0>Well, I mean,</v>

163
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:17.580
so you have people that are COVID-19 is going to make their comorbidities worse

164
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.710
and, and that could be the same for a vaccine.

165
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:21.300
It could be the same for anything. Right. I mean,

166
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:24.150
so like something that's going to activate the immune system. Yeah.

167
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.570
<v 1>Th the concern is, would what vaccines,</v>

168
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.970
the negative effects that what people are worried about,

169
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:31.860
I think as young people that are healthy,

170
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.460
that have negative effects like that have had strokes,

171
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:40.260
or that have had thrombosis or mild carditis and those

172
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:41.094
issues. Right.

173
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.120
<v 0>Well, I, you know, again, if you look at the data, you know,</v>

174
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:49.440
young people are also experiencing those things at a higher rate and are those

175
00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:53.430
all the people with the comorbidities? Like, I don't know, you know, like, I,

176
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:58.170
I'm not sure, but it seems as though no matter which way you look at it,

177
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.700
like it it's, it is worse to be exposed to that virus. And like,

178
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.540
how do you know the person that had that myocarditis wouldn't have had it X fold

179
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:11.040
worse with the, with the COVID-19, because it's been shown to happen in young,

180
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:13.410
healthy athletes, you know, and people have.

181
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.290
<v 1>Been shown in large numbers, like the war.</v>

182
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.310
<v 0>More so, more.</v>

183
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.220
<v 1>So than the vaccines that we were saying, yes.</v>

184
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.270
<v 0>I'm saying that it's happening.</v>

185
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.030
Myocardium is from the vaccines it's happening in younger people at a higher

186
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:24.864
rate than from the.

187
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.340
<v 1>Do we have accurate data?</v>

188
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:30.720
Do you think about how many myocarditus instances we have from the vaccine?

189
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:31.680
Well.

190
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.090
<v 0>You could argue there's an under-reporting. Um, I think people,</v>

191
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.970
so anyone can submit data to the, to the bears.

192
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.920
And I think when it comes to someone who's younger, um, they're more likely,

193
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.190
I mean, so healthcare professionals have to submit to the bears.

194
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:48.660
If there's like something that's,

195
00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:51.150
life-threatening some which myocarditis could be,

196
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.210
or if it's a death or something, that's like no changes,

197
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.770
their daily functions like congenital effects. Yes they are.

198
00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.633
If they are.

199
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.490
<v 1>But if they,</v>

200
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.210
how do they know that mild carditis is caused by the vaccine?

201
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.530
<v 0>It, they don't. But if it, if the person had gotten vaccinated and by the way,</v>

202
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:13.050
there's no time constraint, like, it's not like, oh,

203
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.080
if they've only been vaccinated within like two months,

204
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.860
like they're supposed to, they're supposed to submit to verus like,

205
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.530
if someone was vaccinated and then something yes.

206
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.160
<v 1>Is there encouragement or discouragement to submit to various?</v>

207
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.150
<v 0>I don't know. I don't know. But I mean, you know, if you, again,</v>

208
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.990
even just looking at the deaths in every age group, even like, you know,

209
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:36.570
people that are in my age group 40 to 49, you know,

210
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:41.040
there's 20,000 deaths that have been linked to the confirmed COVID 19 cases.

211
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.800
Whereas, you know, in fairs it's 200.

212
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.390
<v 1>Trinity's for people with co-morbidities obviously it's a real issue.</v>

213
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.800
<v 0>Yeah. I don't know if that's, if that's always the case, but yes,</v>

214
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.550
definitely with people with co-morbidities.

215
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.530
<v 1>Because according to this, what we pulled up,</v>

216
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:59.860
it's 5% that are dying just of the COVID

217
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.180
95% have an average of four comorbidities.

218
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.410
<v 0>Okay. Well, if that's true for all ages, um, then, you know, yes,</v>

219
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:13.060
people with comorbidities are more likely to die, but also younger people. I,

220
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:15.400
like I said, there are more likely to get, you know,

221
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.970
these long haul symptoms where I've known so many people, you know,

222
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:19.804
that they're, they've,

223
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.140
they've gotten like their loss of smell or taste has been like several months.

224
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.050
And there's now studies showing that, you know, if you,

225
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.540
there was a huge study out of the biobank, um,

226
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.080
UK biobank data where they were right before the pandemic started,

227
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:36.490
MRIs were done brain scans on like almost a thousand people.

228
00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:41.290
It was like over 800. And then the pandemic hit people got COVID,

229
00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:44.730
some people didn't whatever. So they brought these, these,

230
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.090
the same cohort of people back in for a brain scan. And, you know,

231
00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:52.060
basically they corrected for people.

232
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.400
So they had people that they compared people that were the same age,

233
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:57.790
same gender, same sex. And, and then they, um,

234
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.220
also time between scans and they found that both mild and severe COVID-19

235
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:08.110
cases caused a atrophy in the gray matter region of the brain.

236
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.280
It was worse in people that had it more severe understandable,

237
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:17.200
but people that had mild cases that didn't go to the hospital had it, you.

238
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.130
<v 1>Know, people did their study.</v>

239
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:22.570
<v 0>With this. It was over 800. Yeah. I mean, you know, it's, you need,</v>

240
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.520
you need more data to confirm, but I mean.

241
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.690
<v 1>People did, they stratify it by age? Did they have.</v>

242
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.160
<v 0>Age, gender, ethnicity, health? I don't know.</v>

243
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.350
<v 1>Do they have co-morbidities do they factor that in.</v>

244
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.670
<v 0>They had people that age,</v>

245
00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:40.330
the same age as the people didn't get COVID they didn't have it. I mean,

246
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.870
you know, this is several months, this is just months after I don't know about.

247
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.960
<v 1>Did they monitor their nutrition or find out what kind of supplements?</v>

248
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:53.320
<v 0>I don't, I don't know if any of that data was, was, you know, in it, but.</v>

249
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.000
<v 1>It would be a factor at all.</v>

250
00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.130
<v 0>I don't know, because I know people that supplement that exercise that have had,</v>

251
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.510
um, were diagnosed with, they had a mild case and they were diagnosed with pots,

252
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:09.250
you know, posts, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome,

253
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.390
where their heart was racing. Like tachycardia was racing,

254
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:17.320
just calm control, like uncontrollably. They were dizzy.

255
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.810
Couldn't had no energy. I mean, this was months.

256
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.090
And they finally got to Agnos and it's like a lot of people coming out with

257
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:22.960
this, but, you know.

258
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.970
<v 1>I know anybody that had COVID and got through it with almost no symptoms at all</v>

259
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:29.020
and was very mild.

260
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.950
<v 0>Um, well, yeah, no symptoms at all, but the people that I do know,</v>

261
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.460
most of them had some kind of weird taste issue, like,

262
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:39.700
or smell thing for like weeks and weeks. But, um.

263
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.830
<v 1>But yeah, anybody that didn't have that.</v>

264
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.070
<v 0>Um, I don't,</v>

265
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.970
because most of the people I know that had it have lost their smell.
