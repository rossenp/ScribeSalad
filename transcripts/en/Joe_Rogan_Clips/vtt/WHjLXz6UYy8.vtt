1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>But it's a natural instinct to do that. You know,</v>

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:05.820
I was telling you before the show, Ted Nugent is a nice guy.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.530
He's like a really nice guy. God.

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.180
<v 1>Remember trolling his message board from your message board.</v>

5
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.460
<v 0>Old, his message board. And you were,</v>

6
00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:17.570
you were giving instructions on how other people should trolls message board. I,

7
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.950
they were, they were so like, they were Magda before Magda was mega.

8
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.690
Like they were make America great.

9
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.610
I had a bit about it in my act about not needing the draft.

10
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.850
He just show up at Ted doujin concerts and scoop them up and nets.

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.470
It was subtitle. Otherwise they're going to take away NASCAR. And, uh,

12
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.390
I forget the bit, but it.

13
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.010
<v 1>Was, I even have a message board are there now it's over. Do they even exist?</v>

14
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.580
Because your message board would troll. And I,

15
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.530
I got on board with the trolling Ted Nugent's message board and I would pass

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.010
them aggressively. I would backhand, uh,

17
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.000
insult him by God. Hey, we get a,

18
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.500
we get a band together and get the new news back on the airwaves. It's no fair.

19
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.420
All these, uh, you know,

20
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.280
rage against the machine wannabes are getting all the airplay.

21
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:17.030
And when I called to request a true rock and roll legend,

22
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.300
like Ted Nugent, they laugh me off the phone.

23
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.190
And it's no fair that all these guys are selling out arenas and Ted Nugent

24
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.870
is stuck at some state fair playing beside, you know,

25
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.270
tilt a whirl and an Andy Gump. Oh,

26
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.840
oh, a handful of people.

27
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.490
So I'm like I'm pro rooting people to get new news more notice,

28
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.540
but at the same time,

29
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.810
he's playing 35 people at the Arkansas state fair. It's no.
