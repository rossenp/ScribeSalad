1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 0>One of the things that I read about you was that you worked in a sand mine when</v>

2
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.960
you were young, that you dug sand all day.

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.080
<v 1>Yeah. That was growing up. Um, I was 10,</v>

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.560
about 10 years old when I started that because I was in the village and, uh,

5
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:22.510
where, where I grew up after my leaving my aunt house,

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.350
I went to my grandma and we had to like do something, you know,

7
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:31.230
we had to work to contribute at home, uh, to buy oil,

8
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.390
to buy food and also for our scholarship for books.

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.180
So we have to do you have to work and &lt;affirmative&gt;,

10
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.980
that's how we started, even though you, that work was, um,

11
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.900
meant for adult, but we didn't have any option.

12
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.740
So we take what we had at the time.

13
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.340
<v 0>Growing up, doing something like that. Dad's got to, first of all,</v>

14
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.490
it had to be very difficult, like very digging sand. It's also,

15
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.610
your body must develop very strong from doing something like that at 10

16
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:11.930
years old. Like as you're growing, as you're maturing doing something,

17
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:15.730
that's that difficult. I mean, it must have made you really strong.

18
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.330
<v 1>Yeah. I, I hope so. But.</v>

19
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.120
<v 0>What I was, well, obviously it did, but it's just genetics too.</v>

20
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.000
There's a lot of good things that, that came your way that way. But,

21
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.600
but also the difficulty of doing something when you're that young,

22
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.720
such hard labor, I mean, it had to teach you discipline.

23
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:38.800
There had to be like some POS it's terrible that you had to do that at 10. Yeah.

24
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:42.080
But there had to be some positive aspects of it.

25
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.230
Some positive repercussions of it. Oh.

26
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.350
<v 1>Definitely. I mean, uh, I didn't like,</v>

27
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.790
like my life and, uh, I felt,

28
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.510
I always felt like I missed my childhood.

29
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.670
Like it's something missing in it because, uh, it's been too much,

30
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.300
um, frustration. Yeah. In my life, you know? Um,

31
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.460
like I had to work by that age and he wasn't enough. Like,

32
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.820
uh, when the school, when school started, when school starts all the time,

33
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.820
I gonna go to school.

34
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.820
And most of the time still didn't have a pen to take note

35
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.530
or a notebook to write on it sometime, uh,

36
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.970
no shoes or clothes just have to wear, like my, uh,

37
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.890
uniform was tear all, all, all over. And, um,

38
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.370
I was frustrated to look around and see other kids looking good. You know,

39
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.770
they went to the Vaca. Uh, they went in vacation to this family.

40
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.840
Men number came back with all brand new stuff.

41
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.960
And I was just there looking crappy with my, I have to,

42
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.880
I had to like take my old book and look for empty page to take a

43
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:59.840
note, expecting, hoping that when I have a book,

44
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.640
I will copy the note from this year in the new book.

45
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.840
But at first I have to use the, I always had to use the old book.

46
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.160
And most of the time teachers, they don't understand why you don't have a book.

47
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.080
They don't understand why you don't have a pen.

48
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.030
Sometimes they just think that you didn't tell your parent, you should, uh,

49
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.270
um, tell your parents so they can buy it for you.

50
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:29.790
They don't understand that you can't not just afford it. You know,

51
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:34.630
your parent can't and, um, they'll kill you out from the classroom.

52
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.070
Maybe just to say, go tell your parents and,

53
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.780
and you can tell them we can't afford it. You didn't wanna say it. Then the, um,

54
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.380
they knew they know what can they do? Nothing. You know,

55
00:03:48.381 --> 00:03:51.780
because most of the time it's gonna be, even with the money that I work,

56
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.580
that they're gonna buy my pen or my book. Yeah. But, uh,

57
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.490
you work sometime and they don't pay you right away is maybe a after month

58
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.250
months, you know?

59
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.730
So all the process and sometime they'll just kick you out from the school

60
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.650
because of the, um, scholarship fee, uh,

61
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.650
you, you haven't paid on time, so they kick you out. So I was a subject,

62
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.280
I was subject of shame to other kick. Yeah. You know,

63
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.400
because all the time when they kick you out in front of 50, 60,

64
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.560
uh, uh, student, it's not a good thing, you know? And, um,

65
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.120
I couldn't have a friend because you know how things work.

66
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.720
You have to be able to bring something on the table

67
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.230
to, uh, enjoy, you know,

68
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.110
but since you don't even have a pen or a book to take no to take note,

69
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.310
nobody expect you to, uh, bring a lunch, um,

70
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.830
um, lunch or to buy something, uh, in the break,

71
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.260
break time to share with them. So they don't wanna share with you things.

72
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:06.540
They don't have any hope that you will share, have something to share with them.

73
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.140
And I was always in retreat. I always stay in retreat.

74
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.140
And that's how I technically grew up by myself.

75
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.620
I end up like, not even trying to have a friend, I'm like, okay,

76
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:25.010
this is my situ. Maybe I just, I feel, uh, okay,

77
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.170
just retreat myself.

78
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.690
Not just to try all the time and get shame of it all the time. You know,

79
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.003
I always,

80
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.890
I retreat and don't have to deal with these people with their opinion on me.

81
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.600
And, um, but that motivated me at some point, I'm like,

82
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.040
look, this kid they're looking at me like, I'm, I was nothing.

83
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.160
But technically I was more than them because, uh,

84
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.320
I'm working, you know, uh,

85
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.800
even though what I have is less than what they have,

86
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.000
I deserve what I have. I work hard for it and they don't do, they don't work.

87
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.720
They don't deserve. They're just a kid. Right. They work. And their,

88
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.320
their parent provide for them. I, I'm not just lucky.

89
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.870
I'm not just lucky to have the chance, but I'm still trying,

90
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.430
which me, I'm not bad at the end of the day. You know?

91
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.910
So that's that pushed me to, like, from there,

92
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.470
I wanted something to prove them wrong. I'm like, okay,

93
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.340
I cannot do something that can to prove this kid that I'm not beneath them.

94
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.620
So that gave you motivation. Yes.

95
00:06:41.621 --> 00:06:46.580
That gave me motivation because that frustration, I was full of frustration.

96
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.100
And I want to like drive this into something.

97
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.060
Like I have to prove them. I can't go to the party.

98
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.460
I can't be between, I can't have friend I, any,

99
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.090
anyone and I have to work hard than anyone, you know? Um,

100
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.490
my schools was like, my, um,

101
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.250
middle school was, I think

102
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.090
about six miles from home.

103
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.160
So it took me almost two hours to get at school. So you walked? Yeah.

104
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.320
So I walked around about two hours and, uh,

105
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.280
before meet the first student is at least after

106
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.960
like 40 minutes walk, you know?

107
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.920
So I have to wake up at five, just get ready,

108
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.670
start at work sometime with not, uh, not eating.

109
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.110
Then I get to school and the school, uh,

110
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.110
close at maybe four to five. But since I didn't eat in the morning,

111
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.910
uh, by noon, one or two, I'm hungry, I'm starving. I can't take it anymore.

112
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.860
I will leave school sometime, you know, just because I was hungry

113
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.260
or if I, uh, if I have a chance,

114
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.540
if I had a chance to have breakfast or something,

115
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.420
I won't eat before I leave home, because I know if I eat at five or six,

116
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.660
I will get hungry early ill take it at school to eat maybe around

117
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.970
10 so I can resist onto the end. Mm. You know? And that's, uh,

118
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.010
how I, I did it my, um, this entire time.

119
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.090
So my, um, my process was all different from,

120
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:38.810
from other kids. And, uh, nobody could have understand that,

121
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:39.470
you know,

122
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:44.360
he was just on me and I was the only one knowing what I'm dealing with

123
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.600
exactly. To get there. So,

124
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.800
and all those things keep kept frustrating me. I'm like,

125
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.440
I can show this. I'm gonna show them, like, how long did you have to work.

126
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.960
<v 0>In these, uh, sand mines.</v>

127
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.930
<v 1>Until I left school until I finally, I left school, I was 17.</v>

128
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.530
And then I keep doing it.

129
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.330
<v 0>And then I, so you did it from 10 to 17. You did it all through school. Yeah.</v>

130
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.610
And what, when.

131
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.450
<v 1>Did, that was the only thing to do, right? When.</v>

132
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.120
<v 0>Did you do it? Like if you went to school during the day,</v>

133
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.600
when did you work in the sand lines?

134
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.640
<v 1>Over the weekend? Over the, um, holidays,</v>

135
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.000
because I never, uh, have a chance to go to.

136
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.960
I never had a chance to go to holiday even for the summer holiday,

137
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.240
which is like three months.

138
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.560
That would be because we have a tropical climate.

139
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:40.230
So at that moment we have two season wet season and dry

140
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:43.950
season, and that's a wet season. So it's almost rain all the time.

141
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.310
Kids go to vacation and all those stuff, uh,

142
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.910
adult doesn't wanna work because it's raining all the time.

143
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.940
Guess what? That was opportunity when they don't wanna work.

144
00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.380
So we have a chance to work.

145
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.300
Otherwise they will come back to their job. We will not have job. Right.

146
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.100
You know? So that was a good opportunity to work under the rain all the time.

147
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:15.100
Like get back home shaking because all day long it's been raining.

148
00:10:15.101 --> 00:10:18.490
So you have to stay, uh, because as,

149
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.850
as soon as you stop working, moving, you get cool. You just get freezing.

150
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:27.730
So you get active. It force you to stay active and to work even more.

151
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.770
And our employer will,

152
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.450
will love that because you work even more than normal.

153
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.960
And, uh, yeah. So that's how we, we do it.

154
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.520
And sometime, uh, after school,

155
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.680
I will stop at the same mind if I have like a quick job,

156
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.440
maybe if a truck comes and, uh, they have to load it.

157
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.080
If I have a place to load, because you load, they give money to share,

158
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.510
you get something sometime, sometime not.

159
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.790
And when I was a kid, most of the time they kick you out.

160
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.390
Other didn't want you on it. I'm like, eh, get away of you. You know,

161
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.950
because the less, they are more money they get.

162
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.870
So they don't want you to around. &lt;laugh&gt; really.

163
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.590
<v 0>I, I saw that you went,</v>

164
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:21.020
you went back recently and you taken photos of you

165
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.660
in the sand. Mine where you worked as a boy. But I see that on Instagram. Yeah.

166
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:26.900
What was that like?

167
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.660
<v 1>I always do that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, when I'm home,</v>

168
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.180
I always like to do that. It's kind of like, he really,

169
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.730
really hurts me to remember everything,

170
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.690
like where I came from, how he was, you know,

171
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:51.530
every time that I get, when I, that I go back home, I would go back to those,

172
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.320
all those places that I used to, uh, work there. I,

173
00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.080
I hated this thing growing up. Oh, you can't imagine. I hated the sand, mine,

174
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.800
everything. I hated my life.

175
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.640
But today it seems like if you, for my life today, I have to feel,

176
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.510
feel up from that life, go back there, cities &lt;affirmative&gt; because most people,

177
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.910
there are still people that we grew up together.

178
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.150
And he allows me to see how far I came from. Mm. You know,

179
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.190
like, I think it's the,

180
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.470
the moment that I enjoy the most is like those moment, you know,

181
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.540
going back, go to my, uh,

182
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.460
the house that I grew up into, even though we fix it today is not the same,

183
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.700
but the environment like sleeping have all this nostalgic, uh,

184
00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.500
wake, uh, at five o'clock, all this, uh, animal sounds from outside the bed,

185
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.050
the bed beds, all those sound was just like,

186
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.810
very familiar. Bring you back from 20 to 25 years ago,

187
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.490
the smells, everything reminds you something.

188
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.290
And this always my best moment,

189
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.490
like I can go there and, uh, live in the five star hotel,

190
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.320
do some crazy stuff. But he doesn't, I don't, I don't enjoy that as much.

191
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.120
Like, I don't know how to explain it, but &lt;laugh&gt;,

192
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.320
I always do it. Like, I always go back to the sand.

193
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.560
This is like a tradition now just for them,

194
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:34.040
because he hurts me. I like it. I feel like, okay,

195
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.270
you know, it's kind of like taking my revenge of life, like, okay.

196
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.670
I used to be here thinking this,

197
00:13:41.671 --> 00:13:46.150
thinking that dreaming of this dreaming of that today, I have this look,

198
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.790
that's my car. Look, that's my truck.

199
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.343
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

200
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.590
<v 1>Yeah, look, that's my house. Look,</v>

201
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.740
this my life I can and fly back to America, even though I'm here,

202
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.020
you know? Yeah. So it's like living a dream. Yeah.

203
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.020
Because back then that was just a dream, a crazy dream. Unbelievable.

204
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.460
So I'm living into it right now. Like yes. Doing this 20 years ago,

205
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:17.050
I was dreaming like, man, how is this to be in the airplane, going somewhere,

206
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.050
imagine yourself being the airplane,

207
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.050
going to America or to France or something. Wow.

208
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.010
And I go back, I do the same. I'm like, guess what?

209
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.810
I'm going back to America in one week. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

210
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.810
<v 0>Right. You're living the dream. Yeah. Yeah. And so it just, just re reminds,</v>

211
00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:38.560
you just put, puts you back in that place. Yeah.

212
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.840
<v 1>And, uh, what is crazy is like,</v>

213
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.120
most of the time it's gonna be with the same guy that I grew up with. Wow.

214
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.440
That in the same place doing the same thing. And, uh, what.

215
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.560
<v 0>Is it like for them? Do they ask you questions? Like man.</v>

216
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.120
<v 1>You know, and that's why I feel, uh,</v>

217
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.960
very lucky just to have a different mindset just to even have a dream,

218
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.800
because they don't even have a dream. Most of those people,

219
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.840
like if you ask them like, okay, what do you,

220
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.710
what is your dream? What, where would you like to be in like one years,

221
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:20.150
five years from now? Doesn't know he gave up long time ago.

222
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:25.230
He doesn't give a about it. As soon as, as long as he has something to eat, uh,

223
00:15:25.231 --> 00:15:29.550
before go to bed, he's okay. That's it. And now I'm like,

224
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.260
how can somebody leave like this? Right.

225
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.860
But it's still alive. You can't do anything I'm like,

226
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:43.180
but then you will find someone, some people, uh, which is a little different.

227
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.500
They, they are like, they have a dream. They're hoping to, uh,

228
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.420
change their life. Those people over years, you can see the,

229
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.570
in their life improvement step by step. Like this year,

230
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.410
they're gonna say, ah, I want to do this.

231
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.890
I wish I can do this next year. Guess what?

232
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.370
Even though they didn't do that, they didn't get that done. They get closer.

233
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.450
And next year, and next year, and next year they move up.

234
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.720
But those who doesn't have a dream, you know,

235
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.153
it's just there like that.

236
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.920
<v 0>Do you find some of the people there that do have a dream look at you and they</v>

237
00:16:19.921 --> 00:16:21.040
get inspired? They.

238
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.440
<v 1>Say, yeah, those who has, and they, and I think that's, um,</v>

239
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.120
even why, um,

240
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:32.400
some of the reason will keep me going back and like,

241
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.750
even in the foundation,

242
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.070
like once I had like a really good friend of mine,

243
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.310
this guy is in the village and he is doing good.

244
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.430
He's doing his businesses doing good for a village guy.

245
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.350
Like, sometime I will come there he'll even give me like a whiskey,

246
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.620
find a good whiskey for me. And he said, man, you know,

247
00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:59.500
like you just going in America and come back here means a

248
00:16:59.501 --> 00:17:04.100
lot to us. Like we grew up together. That mean it's possible for us too,

249
00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:09.620
that, uh, drive us through our dream, like motivate us. Like,

250
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.740
yes, if Francis did it, I mean,

251
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:18.370
I might Don do the same thing, but I can get to what I want to, you know?

252
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:23.930
And uh, I'm like, thank you. I, I really appreciate his work.

253
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:28.890
And he was like very humble explaining me things. And yeah.

254
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.930
And that's why I also like, uh, doing my foundation.

255
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.400
I like to like tell this kid, like, listen, I'm not a, a,

256
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.520
a fairer, I'm not a story that you watch on TV. Um,

257
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.760
uh, that you read in the book. I'm in fact, I grew up here. Most of you,

258
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.680
uh, know me before I even, I even live here. Um,

259
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.280
which mean it's possible, you know,

260
00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.400
as long as you believe in something in a dream, uh,

261
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.240
as long as you have a dream and believe in yourself,

262
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.400
I think a success is just a matter of time.
