1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I went there with that. A UFO guy.</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.510
<v 1>Bob [inaudible]. Yeah, yeah. And.</v>

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.800
<v 0>Uh, Schultz. Andrew Schultz wanted me to and Jeremy,</v>

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.470
Corbell the guy who made the documentary.

5
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:15.390
We all sat around talking to him that Lazard.

6
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.160
<v 1>Freaked me the out, man. He's a freak.</v>

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.570
<v 0>Out. Makes me want to move. I, you know, I had no indication that he's full of.</v>

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.210
I mean, I was zero.

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.433
<v 1>Meter.</v>

10
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.430
<v 0>Here's the thing, man.</v>

11
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.650
When you've told a story for his many years,

12
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:34.980
as many times as he did, um, it's, uh,

13
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.020
it's super hard to be consistent if you're just making everything up.

14
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.790
It's super hard to, to,

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.680
to have things that you are saying back then that everybody says don't even

16
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:52.530
exist. Right. Eventually turn out to be true.

17
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.580
It's very difficult to deny that like these are parts of his initial story.

18
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.970
His initial story had something to do with this thing called element one 15,

19
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.090
which, um, most people, I mean,

20
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:07.560
they didn't even recognize that it actually existed until much later.

21
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.810
Right? That's a big feature of it.

22
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.200
<v 1>When did he start talking about it? Once you're talking about the eighties,</v>

23
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.210
seventies, eighties, a long time ago.

24
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.411
<v 0>It's about, look,</v>

25
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:20.520
I don't know enough about elements and the table to understand it.

26
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.410
<v 1>You're talking to a state school kid.</v>

27
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.500
<v 0>Bull stupid. You're probably more educated than me though.</v>

28
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.220
But at the end of the day, this guy is obviously smart as.

29
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.280
And he's a scientist that definitely worked at Los Alamos lab.

30
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.840
There's a record of him there. Right.

31
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.360
And they tried to deny that and they tried to erase it.

32
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.920
That alone tells me just the fact that they tried to say that he didn't exist.

33
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:44.430
He never went to, he never worked at Los Alamos lab. That's.

34
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.263
<v 1>A.</v>

35
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.670
<v 0>Huge freaky. Yeah. In the 1980s,</v>

36
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:50.820
you don't think they could just erase your past. Right? Right.

37
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.300
You don't think that they could just erase your birth certificate or erase your,

38
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:57.090
your, your medical records or race, your dental records.

39
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:58.500
They can do whatever they want back. Then.

40
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.330
<v 1>Tell me you saw that documentary about, um, the three identical strangers.</v>

41
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.560
Did you watch walk, read about.

42
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.580
<v 0>It? I didn't see it, bro.</v>

43
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.910
<v 1>I heard, oh my God. I mean, essentially in so many words I can,</v>

44
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.140
without divulging too much, three brothers are born. Uh,

45
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.810
triplets are born and they were separated at birth. Unbeknownst to them.

46
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.690
They grew up completely independently run into each other later in life.

47
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.910
This was in the seventies. I think it was seventies.

48
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.980
And they meet publicly on maybe not Donahue, but one of those big shows,

49
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.371
you know,

50
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:30.000
like they bring them all together and they ended up finding out later in the

51
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:34.560
documentary, spoiler alert that the com there's a company who is doing this.

52
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.920
That's doing trial tests on babies that are separated and putting them with

53
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:42.300
different families to find out if they end up growing up with similar, um,

54
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.690
characteristics, nature versus nurture nature, nurture scientific.

55
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.610
<v 0>But imagine how sick you have to be. to decide to separate kids. Yeah.</v>

56
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.320
<v 1>And T dude and show up and test their family to find out how they're breeding</v>

57
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:59.890
these or how they're growing. These children gross as you wash it. Right.

58
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.790
Jane they'd.

59
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.340
<v 2>Come test them every week or two and just be like doing checkups.</v>

60
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.040
And they didn't, the parents almost didn't even know. I don't, I'm not sure.

61
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.620
<v 1>One of the parents seem to be more keen about it.</v>

62
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.840
And the other ones just felt like, well, they were getting money for it.

63
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.150
So they were like, this is just a part of a program that we're in, bro.

64
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.030
<v 0>How has that much different than aliens, abducting people. And that's what.</v>

65
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.880
<v 1>I'm saying. It's not that's my point is like, if they got away with.</v>

66
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.330
<v 0>The voluntary life and,</v>

67
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:26.050
and genetics test pro involuntary.

68
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.010
<v 2>The data from that to like the nurse or the assistant from the good,</v>

69
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.860
the doctor that was doing, it says there is data. She has read it,

70
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:36.790
but it has never been released. And it should be because they up all.

71
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.900
<v 1>Oh wait, you're leaving out an important part. It's in, it's in a library in a,</v>

72
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.340
in like Harvard law library. And it legally can't be released to the public.

73
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:46.570
It's something that's, it's,

74
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:48.760
someone's holding onto it and it cannot be released.

75
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.680
They've tried hundreds of times and it's got a 2050 release date or

76
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:55.510
whatever their home they're waiting for these people to die.

77
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.770
So then they'll just go away and no one will think about it anymore. It's dude.

78
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:03.700
Watch it. It'll you up. I'm scared. And then you find out in the documentary,

79
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.710
they're not the only ones there's,

80
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.530
they've done this over and over and over and over

81
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.790
It. dude, I'm sitting on a plane watching it and he's a reptilian. Yes.

82
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.740
You know when you're, you know, when you're on a plane watches, I'm so good.

83
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:20.920
And you look around like to other people, you're like, oh, no,

84
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:25.540
one's watching it. But I'm like, it. It was so trippy, man.

85
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.190
It's so trippy. So yes.

86
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:31.300
Do I think that Lasar had people trying to ex out his,

87
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.590
his PA for sure.

88
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.600
<v 0>For sure. And there's a look,</v>

89
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.610
there's a lot of other stuff that you gotta go. Hmm. I don't know.

90
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.010
How do you, how do you prove that? How do you explain that?

91
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.290
<v 1>Well, I don't know. It's not like anything in our world.</v>

92
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.370
What do you believe in the.

93
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.930
<v 0>Big questions are, is education background. That was a big one. Um,</v>

94
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.400
what do you mean credibility wise? No.

95
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:56.110
Whether or not he actually was educated at a certain place. I'm not, I can't,

96
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.880
this is a up one, but I can't say what he told me. I,

97
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.670
um, but essentially without saying it, it had to do with projects.

98
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:09.100
He was working on currently. No,

99
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:11.680
at the time when he's working on Los Alamos labs,

100
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.570
I can't say anything more than that.

101
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.960
<v 1>And now the internet, but I don't know.</v>

102
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.410
<v 0>If it's true. Right? Who do you know? I told them I wouldn't say anything.</v>

103
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:23.440
So I said, I wouldn't say anything and I'm not going to say anything,

104
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.150
but whatever he said about all these different things

105
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.990
only, he knows if it's true, when you're talking to a guy,

106
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.760
it doesn't seem like a liar.

107
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.110
It seems like he's very intelligent Nene when he's talking about all kinds of

108
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:39.280
different things, very intelligent.

109
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:43.390
So either he's running the greatest 30 year con of all time,

110
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.780
or maybe this really did happen when you talk to him.

111
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.410
So you're just guessing. You don't know. I don't know. I don't know his life.

112
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.960
I don't know his real life. Right. Just gas,

113
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.600
but he seems like a guy who seen some and just

114
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.490
didn't know what to do and told some friends about it. And then,

115
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.710
then went to the news. And that's what that George Knapp guy,

116
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.730
who was the investigative journalist that studied this case over all the years.

117
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:20.900
Like this guy's never wavered. Like you stuck with the story over and over.

118
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:25.250
Things have shown to be true that they said were science fiction. Like the, um,

119
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.540
there was this equipment that they had at Los Alamos labs that he talked about

120
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.400
where it was this a thing that measured the distance or the size or other of the

121
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:36.830
digits in your finger. Apparently it's like a great,

122
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:40.010
like your fingers that the inches are specific.

123
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.070
And so like if you put your hand down in that thing and then Jamie's hand,

124
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.990
it would give a different measurement. Like there's different.

125
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.340
Each bone is a different length.

126
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.080
And the exact length is like 1.7, whatever the it is,

127
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.060
you know, 1.7 inches, like whatever men measurement, teal tool they use,

128
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.500
it was,

129
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.580
he was calculating the length of your fingers through some kind of buggy system

130
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:03.080
that he said, didn't really work that often.

131
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.600
But people said that science fiction, it doesn't exist.

132
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.930
And then they finally got photos of these things and people that worked at Los

133
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:13.010
Alamos labs concluded, or they conceited that these were real things.

134
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.240
But for a long time, they were fighting.

135
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.720
Some people that didn't know were saying he made that stuff up.

136
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.240
It doesn't exist, but insurance showed it. It does exist.

137
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:21.980
And it did exist right there where he worked.

138
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.550
He even took them on a tour through the labs. Like he knew where everything was.

139
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:28.670
He used to work there. So he, when they went there with the documentary crew,

140
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:31.850
with Jeremy Corbell, they just walked him through. He showed where he worked.

141
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.230
He walked right in there,

142
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.750
namely the guys running the craziest con game of all time.

143
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.840
And he's just a super genius and way smarter than me trick me.

144
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:42.800
And he thinks it's hilarious.

145
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.990
Or maybe he saw some what he was

146
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:51.590
explaining that made it more and more interesting was how compartmentalized it

147
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:56.510
was and about how the problem with being so compartmentalized is that

148
00:07:56.511 --> 00:08:00.170
science is based on free exchange of information. Right?

149
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.950
You have to have guys are testing all these different things and working on them

150
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:06.000
together. That's the only way you can do so. Right.

151
00:08:06.001 --> 00:08:08.990
So he's limited to a couple of guys that are working on the propulsion system.

152
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.540
And then there's a couple of other guys that are working on the metallurgy and a

153
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:13.610
couple other guys that are working on the navigation system.

154
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:19.160
And they chose him because he was kind of a maniac and he put a jet

155
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:20.600
engine in the back of a Honda.

156
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.870
And it was on the cover of the Los Alamos newspaper.

157
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.070
And it said in the article about Bob was armed with his jet powered Honda,

158
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.700
that he was a scientist at Los Alamos lab, a physicist.

159
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.950
So this was in the newspaper. They printed this one,

160
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.410
this guy was doing this thing where he said he was living at the time in the,

161
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:40.130
in the area where Los Alamos was.

162
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.290
And it said in the newspaper that he worked at the lab,

163
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.060
there's a log book of employees. It's got his name in it.

164
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.540
From that time a guy had it, he showed it, they took photos of it.

165
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:53.990
They showed it to everybody. Look, we have an employee log book like this,

166
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:58.230
or the employee directory rather, Robert Lasar right there.

167
00:08:58.231 --> 00:08:59.730
So he worked there. He really did work.

168
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.130
<v 1>How could he, how could all that? I mean, how could you fabricate that?</v>

169
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:02.700
Everybody's.

170
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.340
<v 0>Scared to talk. All the people he worked with are scared to talk.</v>

171
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.460
Why do you think, look at what's happening to him? And he looks like a fool,

172
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.980
the FBI raids, his house, everybody calls him crazy.

173
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.360
He didn't wanna have anything to do with this.

174
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.270
The only reason why he wanted to do my podcast, he was why he like,

175
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.950
he wanted one more chance to just get it out in a form where it's just him

176
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:23.780
talking. And he felt like he and I, and we both talked about,

177
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.490
I think me and you talk, I'll just let you talk.

178
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.910
You tell me what happened and I'll let everybody figure out if it's true.

179
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.470
I don't know.

180
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.850
<v 1>What do you think? Honestly.</v>

181
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.030
<v 0>There was parts of me that said, maybe I'm just dumber than this guy.</v>

182
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:37.620
And he's like really manipulative.

183
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.580
And maybe he just knows how to tell a story and steady keen, dude. I know,

184
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:45.240
but it's a tricky thing, man. You can get cocky. You can get cocky.

185
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.300
I feel like you can get cocky and think that you know that someone's not full

186
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:49.340
of, but I feel like.

187
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.930
<v 1>You talked to enough people who are,</v>

188
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:55.170
and aren't full of that your meter is higher than most. I'm also a night.

189
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.070
<v 0>So when I'm trying to talk to someone, I want a one things to work out well,</v>

190
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.510
you're given the benefit of the doubt. Often.

191
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.810
I want them to have a good time when we're talking.

192
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:04.980
I don't want to confront people.

193
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.760
Even if I angrily disagree with every fiber of my being,

194
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.760
as I've gotten older and better at it, better at talking to people,

195
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.290
I avoid that kind of conflict. Right. I just, I don't think it's necessary.

196
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:17.400
<v 1>But I just don't.</v>

197
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.400
I just think your meter is keen enough where you don't be like.

198
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.450
<v 0>I think it's super cocky to say that I would like to think it is. Yeah.</v>

199
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:28.530
My ego would like to say bro, [inaudible] bro.

200
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.630
Just try it a lie. I've had people.

201
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.530
<v 1>Dude. I know NASA, bro, that ain't master stuff fin on anything.</v>

202
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.640
<v 0>There is times when you know someone's full of and there's times where you</v>

203
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:41.490
think, you know, someone's full of and you're wrong. Then you know,

204
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.630
it's like this whole thing of looking in someone's eye and talking to them,

205
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.030
sometimes someone will tell you something like, oh bro,

206
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:52.140
I didn't even know you called me. Like you, you see it right in their eyes.

207
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.860
Like.

208
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.130
<v 1>Oh, you didn't see your text demand. I didn't even see it. You didn't.</v>

209
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.830
<v 0>Saw him on. that.</v>
