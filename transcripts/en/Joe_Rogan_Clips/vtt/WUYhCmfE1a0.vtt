00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.120
<v 2>You had, uh, you had encounters with Bob Lazar. You,</v>

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.840
you know, Bob and you, you were around when Bob Lazar.

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.160
<v 1>First, uh, now is this gonna be all about the Mylar balloon event?</v>

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.880
&lt;laugh&gt; what's the.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.920
<v 0>Mylar balloon event. Oh, you.</v>

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.270
<v 1>Don't know that one? No. Uh,</v>

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.950
so we all jump in my car to go out to,

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.750
to the alien in area out there, you know, on, uh,

10
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.430
the alien in.

11
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.350
<v 0>Is that, uh, out there at, yeah, it's like a north of a bar.</v>

12
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.110
<v 1>Or something it's for north of that area. And so, so</v>

13
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.060
Bob Lasar, um, George NA myself and I think Jane Huff,

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.060
who is Bob's friend, we all go out there. Well, and beknown, to me,

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.580
Bob has a Mylar balloon,

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.580
which really bounces their radar signature a lot for its size

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.410
and a bottle of gas, uh, helium. So,

18
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.210
uh, we, we find our way back out in the desert out there. We're kind of,

19
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.410
I'm thinking we're on a, a UFO watch, which is always fun.

20
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.210
Sometimes the best thing is the food you take along. Right.

21
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.130
And you're out there under the stars and it's nice and you have a good time just

22
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.720
watching. So &lt;affirmative&gt;, but, um,

23
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.080
there's a Russell of things going on here. And,

24
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.320
and next thing I know there's a balloon, the Mylar balloons inflated,

25
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.440
and there's a slight breeze and Bob lets it go.

26
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.480
And we're on the opposite side of the mountain range from supposedly S four.

27
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.000
And he wants, he wants to go that way.

28
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.513
Thank God.

29
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.150
The wind was going in the opposite direction was traveling north instead of

30
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:49.710
south. And it went the wrong way. You know?

31
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.790
So I'm thinking my life's just passed before my eyes.

32
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.390
<v 0>Why do you think your life passed before your eyes?</v>

33
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.910
Cause if the moon goes towards area.

34
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.870
<v 1>S four, it's gonna get picked up. Yeah. Now they're.</v>

35
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.790
<v 0>Gonna go find out where it came.</v>

36
00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.470
<v 1>From.</v>

37
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.390
WN hunt security is gonna come get us and I'm gonna spend the night in jail.

38
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.380
Right. So you know, it all just unraveled real quick. Right?

39
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.020
<v 0>And was this before Bob had gotten in trouble for bringing people to the</v>

40
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:13.580
observation point to watch? Cause let's,

41
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:14.940
let's tell a story about Bob real quick.

42
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.780
Bob said he worked for area S four and he was hired to back

43
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.770
engineer with, they believe were alien crafts along the lines. He had this, uh,

44
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.570
top secret clearance and along the lines of all this happening,

45
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.930
they're monitoring his phone calls, turns out Bob's wife is having an affair.

46
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.410
Bob doesn't know about this.

47
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.410
They remove him from the project cuz they believe he'll be emotionally unstable

48
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.210
if he's so he's,

49
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.890
he's freaking out not knowing a that his wife is having an affair,

50
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.040
not knowing why he's pulled for in this project. Doesn't totally understand.

51
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.520
So he starts telling people about what he's doing and telling people, listen,

52
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.880
I can take you to a place where once a week they do these tests.

53
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.280
So he starts bringing people to this area.

54
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.320
They see these objects flying in these spectacular ways

55
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.720
that we really can't do with any of our conventional Aircrafts.

56
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.560
And then Bob gets in trouble for that.

57
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.800
Then Bob goes on the George nap show and starts explaining all these different

58
00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:14.480
things presumably for self-preservation because he,

59
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.470
the best way to pro probably protect your own life is to go public with this and

60
00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:20.910
explain everything that's happening.

61
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.990
And they can discredit you and make you look very good. Not,

62
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:27.390
but if they kill you, then you know, then it leads credence to your story.

63
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.350
<v 1>Yeah. It gives you a very, uh, huge hardship. So when.</v>

64
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.030
<v 0>Do you, when do you fall into the story?</v>

65
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.511
<v 1>Well,</v>

66
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:38.230
you've just given me an overload of information now that I'm pretty much aware

67
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:39.064
of. Uh,

68
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.780
but I don't know exactly when I don't think as I recall it. Um,

69
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.340
everybody was pretty much at ease and um, I wasn't,

70
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.453
it wasn't part of.

71
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.580
<v 0>When year is this, that this is all going on. Oh.</v>

72
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.820
<v 1>God. Um, I don't know. 91.</v>

73
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.090
<v 0>So this is around that time. This is around. When was he on George naps.</v>

74
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.730
<v 1>Show? Yeah, somewhere in that timeframe, but I wasn't aware of,</v>

75
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.810
of a lot until much until I don't think at that time I was aware of him taking

76
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:14.370
people out on, you know, Wednesday nights to go see something out there.

77
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.690
I kind of missed out on that or, or whatever. And, um,

78
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.320
I don't think this was anything like connected to.

79
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.200
<v 0>That. I think that that was before this. Yeah, probably that was,</v>

80
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.640
I think you're dealing with him out after, you know,

81
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:30.520
he had met George and after he had told his story. Yeah,

82
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.880
because George is with you. Oh yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.200
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so obviously they had already met. Oh, sure. Um,

84
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.640
so what was your initial,

85
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.230
obviously you're a person that has a deep fascination with UFOs. Now,

86
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:46.950
here you are talking to this guy, who's clearly a genius, brilliant guy.

87
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.150
Bobar and he's telling you this banana story he's out there

88
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.590
back engineering spacecrafts that came from another land that are,

89
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.990
that are using this element one 15, this, this stuff.

90
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.660
That's just a theoretical element that wasn't even proven by particle Collider

91
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:07.740
until what, 2013, somewhere along that line,

92
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.380
like it was just theoretical up to that point.

93
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.300
So he's telling you about all this stuff. What was your, what did you think?

94
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.460
<v 1>Um, I, I</v>

95
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.850
wanted to reserve judgment until I knew a lot more and um,

96
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.930
the more he talked, the more interesting it became, uh,

97
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.010
the more research that George did, things that he uncovered,

98
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.050
it became more interesting. And, um,

99
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.410
and so, um, as I said, a while back,

100
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.880
I think George was doing an interview with man. I said, I,

101
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.800
I wouldn't bet against Bob's the truth or the majority of,

102
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.720
of everything that Bob has said. I wouldn't bet against it. Uh,

103
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:55.040
could they be errors, Arizona missions for different reasons? Yeah, sure.

104
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.120
They could. But, um, the, the, uh,

105
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.800
I, I, I would tend to say Bob is, is legitimate.

106
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.400
Um, and, uh, you know, I don't,

107
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.920
there's certain aspects of things that are parts of stories

108
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.990
that you wonder, well, how could this happen and so forth. But I think if you,

109
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.870
if you take all of the collective information and the work that George nap has

110
00:06:22.871 --> 00:06:27.350
done to validate things, it's awfully impressive.

111
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.791
<v 0>Well,</v>

112
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:30.830
George is such an important part of it because he's a legitimate investigative

113
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:33.350
journalist and that was his career. And so he

114
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.430
poured himself into this. Oh yeah.

115
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.300
And exposed all the different aspects of this story

116
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.580
that seem to indicate that he's telling the truth. Oh yes. Yeah. And that's,

117
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.620
that's, what's crazy about.

118
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.980
<v 1>It. And George is not any normal journalist. He is. He's like what?</v>

119
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.260
He has like six P bodies. Yes. He's.

120
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.050
<v 0>Fantastic. And he's diving into this and the more he uncover, the more,</v>

121
00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:00.730
it seems like Bob bobbles, our story is legitimate. Right.

122
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.330
<v 1>Right. So I, I think until you, I,</v>

123
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:10.330
I like the philosophy of reserving judgment until you have a preponderance of

124
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.410
evidence that really moves you one way or another,

125
00:07:13.411 --> 00:07:17.450
you don't have to have a hundred percent. I go by reasonable doubt. But.

126
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.480
<v 0>What was it like for you to be this guy?</v>

127
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.320
Who's had this deep fascination with flying saucers and here you are

128
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.080
talk like, let me tell you my experience with pop, doing this podcast with Bob.

129
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.760
I wanted one of two things I wanted to go, oh, this guy's full of. Or I wanted,

130
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.520
whoa, this guy's, it seems like he's not full of.

131
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.150
I think he on the truth,

132
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.510
I think this guy really did encounter these Aircrafts and really did work on

133
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:48.030
these spaceships, whatever they are. That's when I, where I'm at right now,

134
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.070
my experience with him, my communication with him,

135
00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:54.230
he didn't seem like he was full at all. He's clearly a brilliant guy.

136
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.420
His story has not changed at all over the 30 plus years

137
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.580
that he's been saying it it's a crazy story.

138
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.540
But when you are a person like yourself,

139
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.980
you saw me even more than I, who is obsessed with this subject,

140
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.300
this the possibility of alien life that's visited, visited this earth and,

141
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.780
and maybe even left crafts behind.

142
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.810
And these crafts are in the possession of some secret government

143
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.970
agencies that are trying to observe them and back engineer them.

144
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.450
What is it like to talk to this guy to this?

145
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.650
Cuz this guy has seen the thing you're looking for. This guy, the,

146
00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:37.290
all the you're you're searching and all of your wondering and staring out into

147
00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:40.880
the heavens. And here's a guy that is a actually touched.

148
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:45.320
It actually worked on it. Been inside one, tried to figure out how they work.

149
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.320
Can't do it. Doesn't understand. It is talking to these people.

150
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:49.520
Everything's compartmentalized.

151
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.600
You got the metallurgist people that are working on the, the, the, what,

152
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.320
what kind of alloy this thing is made of. You got him,

153
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.400
who's a part of the people that are trying to understand the propulsion system.

154
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.600
And then you've got people that are giving you this information that like,

155
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.200
maybe they have, uh, been here forever.

156
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.800
Maybe this is a part of an archeological dig.

157
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.520
Maybe they've been trying to study these things for decades with no,

158
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.360
no advancement at all. Yeah.

159
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.070
<v 1>So we came across or, um,</v>

160
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.630
myself and a couple other people came across folks who could

161
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.750
collaborate some of the things going on out there, um,

162
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.310
such as silent craft, actually lifting off at nighttime.

163
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:35.220
Um,

164
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.220
&lt;affirmative&gt; not looking as though the control was very good,

165
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.420
but actually lifting off maneuvering like a real small trial kind of

166
00:09:46.421 --> 00:09:48.020
thing. Um,

167
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.740
and that fellow OB observed it from a distance where he wasn't supposed to be.

168
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.370
Uh, George has come up with, with collaboration,

169
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.890
I think from two or three other sources also,

170
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.130
besides what Bob said about certain aspects of things out there,

171
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.210
it's just that Bob's story is so much more in depth.

172
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.770
So much more detailed, like that book, uh,

173
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.410
that he talked about years ago coming across, um,

174
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.140
uh, amazing.

175
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.160
<v 0>Things. So what tell people about the book?</v>

176
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.600
<v 1>Well, there was a, there was a book, as I remember, there was some kind of a,</v>

177
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.480
a book that Bob, um,

178
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.640
was allowed to look through or he actually,

179
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.480
or he sees the opportunity to do it when he was in a room where the book

180
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.670
was. But I think that was by design and it was some kind of a

181
00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:44.870
holographic book that as you opened up the pages,

182
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.630
whatever the stories were became a hologram,

183
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:52.870
that's my recollection of a conversation that's decades old now. So,

184
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.980
um, um, you know, if I got it real fire me,

185
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.780
it's, it's, uh, I understand, you know, it's,

186
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.300
you'll have to talk to Bob about that or talk to George. Okay. And, uh,

187
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.020
cuz I remember something like that. I mean that was like, wow, what a,

188
00:11:09.021 --> 00:11:13.900
what an amazing way to portray information in some

189
00:11:13.901 --> 00:11:18.570
kind of a book and actually have holographic images it's coming

190
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:23.130
forth out of the, you know, I don't know. It just was so that, uh,

191
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.210
I have ever heard of, uh,

192
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.090
being repeated any place in terms of something else like that happening and so

193
00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:36.050
much, uh, that, uh, happened to Bob. It was so unique. There was.

194
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:40.240
<v 0>Also some very strange of what they understand,</v>

195
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.200
uh, or what they believe to be true about the origins of human beings

196
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.720
and that they believe that what these visitations were about was that

197
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:53.960
human beings are the product of accelerated evolution.

198
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.480
And that these species from wherever had been coming here and doing genetic

199
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:04.480
experience experiments with primates and created human beings,

200
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:09.960
which is the ultimate, like who knows like, wow, that's fun to think about,

201
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.320
but we were talking about this last night,

202
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.790
how bizarre humans are that outta all these things on earth.

203
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.710
We're the only ones with shoes, all these things.

204
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.390
We're the only ones that have to wear clothes.

205
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.430
We're the only ones that jump into metal boxes with rubber tires and roll around

206
00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:31.270
these hard surfaces that we created or fly planes or send video through your

207
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:33.460
phone to other people that are on the other side of the, a continent.

208
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.860
We're weird, we're real weird. We're way weirder than anything else that exists.

209
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.060
And if we are really a product of some sort of accelerated process

210
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.260
like that, this is how they, uh, get the party started on these planets.

211
00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:53.970
They find semi-intelligent curious animals that are using tool or

212
00:12:53.971 --> 00:12:58.450
using, you know, opposable, thumbs. And, uh, they,

213
00:12:59.010 --> 00:12:59.850
they do some things to them.

214
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.250
<v 1>Yeah. The, uh, there's a large variety of,</v>

215
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.370
of uh, potential, um,

216
00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.360
beginnings, um, more evidence for some than others, right?

217
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.120
So that's, that's always the trick. Um, have you.

218
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.640
<v 0>Considered that? Is this, uh,</v>

219
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:24.560
like a subject that you've deeply considered and thought about?

220
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.480
<v 1>Not really, really I'm here.</v>

221
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.680
I don't wanna look a gift horse in the face.

222
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.150
&lt;laugh&gt; I'll take it for what it is, you know, really, really. Yeah. I mean.

223
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.230
<v 0>I think about it a lot. I don't know.</v>

224
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:43.190
<v 1>I, I, I think, uh, I need more, more evidence, uh,</v>

225
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.790
to be more curious about,

226
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:51.310
I'm more concerned about other kinds of things that are now than where do the

227
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:52.870
human species come from. Particularly,

228
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.020
I'm more driven by other there kinds of things that could make a difference

229
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.860
today going forward.

230
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.820
<v 0>So getting back to the Bobar thing,</v>

231
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.340
when you first got to know him and you first were considering this story and

232
00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:07.980
how, how crazy it was, what was it like to,

233
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.980
to meet a guy who at least by his own accounts

234
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.460
had encountered this thing that you were seeking?

235
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.010
<v 1>Well, Bob's a likable guy. He, as you said, he is very smart.</v>

236
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.250
And so he's interesting to talk to, right? Yeah. And, um,

237
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:31.330
and so that's more than just entertaining to listen to his story is

238
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.810
profound, right?

239
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.560
So it gives you an awful lot to think about and to try to,

240
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.960
to position as to how can you measure future information.

241
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:48.360
You might get against that story. How can you verify different kinds of things?

242
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.520
And, uh, so I, I,

243
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.840
I've heard a lot more silly things I think, than,

244
00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.200
than what Bob was talking about. Didn't seem all that, um,

245
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.880
ridiculous. And then the more you get to talk to him,

246
00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:08.960
the more you get to know him and, and people like George,

247
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.150
who's an investigative of journalists. Uh,

248
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.630
it gets more and more wow.
