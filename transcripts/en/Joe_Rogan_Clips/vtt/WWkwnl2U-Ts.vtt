no, no, we need more detail.

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.870
And then it goes to 9,000 words and then they want more detail than it goes.

10
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.710
You dude, &lt;laugh&gt; look at that.

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.460
<v 1>That's a hair. That's a lot. That's a 1980s head of hair. If I ever saw one,</v>

12
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.060

13
00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:50.660

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.250
So let me go back to where Fri. Um, so I, uh,

22
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.490

00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:22.720
they're filming me in my car and radio in radio spot.

24
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.640
I'm wearing a WrestleMania t-shirt and I know cause I have this footage still

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.720
and I put it up on my motivational Mondays for my very first one, a power,

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.720
a power of what's possible.

27
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.120
And then they fill me at my office right now.

28
00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:41.880
Let me just digress the week before I'm going around at night and I'm grabbing

29
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:43.110
the drawer, you know, like the,

30
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:47.270
the money drawers and I'm watching video that's up on girls.

31
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.950
Just want to have fun. Remember that with Cindy LA and it had captain Lou,

32
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.390
Alabama wanted, who's like one of my favorite managers,

33
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:56.470
ever super character that a bunch of movies,

34
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.870
Lou was just super frigging fun to watch he's in that video

35
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.580
and I'm picking up the drawers and I'm not talking to anybody but myself.

36
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.540
And I say, &lt;laugh&gt; there he is. There he is.

37
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.260
<v 1>Captain Lou with the rubber bands and the beard. I.</v>

38
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.900
<v 0>Remember that, oh God. So I look up at that video and I go rock and wrestling.</v>

39
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.340
I should have been a part of that. And I walk into my office now,

40
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.100
other bartends gonna come in, count their drawers right now.

41
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.530
And smokey comes in my head bartender and he comes, he goes,

42
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.330
Paige J cuz my real first name is Paige,

43
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.970
Joseph faulenberg and my dad. Yeah. Right?

44
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.490
So that, that, that name's never gonna try any money. Actual wrestling.

45
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.250
<v 1>Yeah. Paige faalenberg is gonna a tough sell exactly Time in Dallas page. That.</v>

46
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.160
<v 0>Makes sense. It work right. But my dad's page one and he said, I'm freaking,</v>

47
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.240
you know, you're page two. And I'm like, no, as a little kid, he said,

48
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.113
I didn't like that.

49
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.200
So Dallas Cowboys was my team that I loved the most when I was a little kid,

50
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.480
I don't know cause of the stars or whatever and Landry and all that. And uh,

51
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.760
he ends up, uh, nicknamed me Dallas. So I always love that name.

52
00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:07.280
So I just put 'em together and kind of created it. Right.

53
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.400
So I tried that as handsome. So,

54
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.040
so bottom line is smokey comes in the back and he goes, Paige, Jack, he goes,

55
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.870
uh, what do you mean rock and wrestling? You should have been a part that,

56
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:21.950
and I said, well, you know, I tried it when I was a kid. He goes, you did,

57
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.150
what was your name? I said, handsome Dallas page. &lt;laugh&gt; he went, oh,

58
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.710
you can forget about using that gimick anymore. And everybody laughed, you know?

59
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.150
And now we're drinking after hours. Right. So I can't get to that in my head,

60
00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:39.940
Joe. And I just start scribbling and I write die diamond Dallas page.

61
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.220
And I said, you know, where'd you get the diamond? I just figured my birthday,

62
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.420
April. And it just kind of flowed was April. April was a diamond month.

63
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.780
April's diamond. Yeah. April 5th is a diamond. And I, um,

64
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.940
I love classy. Freddyie blasy and I love the way that name floated, classy,

65
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:58.260
Freddy blasy I thought diamond Dallas page a kind of flows. And I go,

66
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.210
what about if my name was I'm too old to be a wrestler now?

67
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.090
Cause remember try one was 22 or 20 23, 22.

68
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.890
And now I'm 31. So you're thinking you were gonna be a manager or something.

69
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.170
I gonna be a manager. Jimmy, Hart's a manager. I could be diamond Dallas page.

70
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.010
Jimmy Hart. You know's got the heart foundation.

71
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.450
I could have the diamond exchange. Whoa, Drake, Drake shot shot.

72
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.160
So now we're getting pretty up man.

73
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.280
&lt;laugh&gt; and at some point I say, uh, I say,

74
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:29.720
you know, um, you know, there,

75
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:33.440
there's not a lot of really good looking women in wrestling today.

76
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.640
I go miss Elizabeth's beautiful, but she's girl next door beautiful.

77
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.230
What if I had a whole stable little ladies and I called them diamond dolls and

78
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:45.430
they were stripper hot. Everyone's like, oh, that'll be a stretch. Whoa, shot,

79
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.390
shot, drink, drink.

80
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.390
And so the end of the night comes around and I'm

81
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:56.190
like diamond nows page, the diamond exchange, the diamond dolls. I go, man,

82
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.710
that's B a double D bad. And I went,

83
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.020
I just make that up there. I steal that for somebody.

84
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.060
And I just wrote it down a week later here I am with the party news

85
00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:12.500
network and they're interviewing me. And at some point they say,

86
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.340
so where does the voice come from now, Joe,

87
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:18.100
if there's not a pair of white sunglasses there at a time,

88
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.580
I don't know if I do it,

89
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.010
but they're sitting right the air next to that.

90
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.530
So I grab 'em and I put 'em on and I say, were they your sunglasses? Yeah,

91
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:31.570
they were my sunglasses. They to wrap around. I mean, if they weren't there,

92
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.010
I don't know if I say it. I don't know if I go into character. Right.

93
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.690
But because I could put a mask on, oh, I go,

We even brought in blades because we were afraid at the bottom of that.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.280
there's a someone a call for diamond Dallas page.

155
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.920
I pick up the phone. I go, you smokey. And I hang up the phone. Right?

158
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.950
I go, hello? He's like, yeah, we wanna bring you on the show. He goes, you know,

159
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.630
I'm a boxer who has his own show about boxing,

160
00:09:22.631 --> 00:09:26.150
but I wanna start doing wrestling. I go, he goes, I wanna have you on the show.

161
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:31.670
I go, bro. I don't really do it. I was just making that up. You know?

162
00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:36.140
And he's like, who cares? It's radio. And I'm like, man,

163
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.260
I don't know. He goes, I'm gonna have captain Lou want like,

164
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:44.340
what's the odds of that. I'm gonna have captain Lou ban on the show.

165
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.380
I want you to be my co-host. I go, do I get to talk to captain Lou? He's like,

166
00:09:48.381 --> 00:09:50.300
absolutely. I go, I'm in &lt;laugh&gt;.

167
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.770
So I do that show and I do another one with sergeants. And he says to me,

168
00:09:56.771 --> 00:10:00.970
he says, you know, you gotta do something with this diamond dos page thing.

169
00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:04.330
You're a natural, I go itty, do what? I don't know what the to do. I mean,

170
00:10:04.331 --> 00:10:06.450
it's just something in my head. And he says,

171
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.650
I got this friend of mine named Rob Russell.

172
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.730
Who's a boxing promoter who now is working for the AWWA up in Minnesota.

173
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.520
I'll give you his address, send him a tapers, something.

174
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.240
So I think about it and I write those storylines for those guys.

175
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.600
And then I make that tape and I send it to thewa

176
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.960
no, Joe. Two weeks later, I get a phone call. Hey, uh,

177
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.680
is this time in Dallas page? And I'm like, uh, yeah. Uh,

178
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.350
is Rob BRSON from thewa we've seen your tape.

179
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.590
We wanna bring you and your boys in for a tryout.

180
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.590
He goes, but we've got one question, you know,

181
00:10:47.591 --> 00:10:51.390
we've shown the tape around and everybody kind of likes your stick. You know,

182
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:54.750
it's fresh, it's got energy. He said, but no one's ever heard of you.

183
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:59.100
Where are you guys working? Well, Rob,

184
00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:03.940
we got one problem. Um, none of those guys can wrestle. He's like what?

185
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.740
He goes, why would you send us a tape? I go, it's like a secret society.

186
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.900
Like no one can figure out how to get in. So you know it, why they're training.

187
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.100
I could, you know, manage and they're like, ah, don't call us. We'll call you.

188
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.730
And two weeks later, odd just aligned this for me at some, for some reason,

189
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.530
just to be where I am today. But Paul Haman,

190
00:11:24.531 --> 00:11:26.210
who's one of the biggest stars as you know,

191
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.130
a character on wwhl television was called Paul dangerously.

192
00:11:30.131 --> 00:11:34.170
The time he left the AWA went to the

193
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.480
NWA, which was gonna get bought by Ted earner,

194
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.000
left a huge spot, open for a young guy that could talk.

195
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.680
They brought me in all those clothes. You saw me in.

196
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.800
I was wearing that in Fort Myers, Florida. And I said to my buddy Kurt church,

197
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.400
who was my head bouncer at the time head of the floor and I,

198
00:11:53.401 --> 00:11:55.400
and when this was starting to happen. And I go, dude,

199
00:11:55.401 --> 00:11:59.280
can you imagine if I ever have a reason to dress like this? &lt;laugh&gt; you know,

200
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:04.280
like, and if anything, I got way more Tapere down. You know,

201
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.480
I wasn't living the gimick, but uh, then it was the beginning of everything.

202
00:12:08.481 --> 00:12:12.240
And then dusty roads it'd come into Florida for Florida championship Pressland

203
00:12:12.241 --> 00:12:14.630
and dusty took me under his wing man.

204
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:19.110
And he gave me every break that ever meant anything to my career early on.

205
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.110
That's why it was so important for me to be there for Cody because

206
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.470
I'm not getting choked up. Just thinking about it without dusty roads.

207
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:30.870
There is no diamond Dallas page. He gave me every break I ever had.

208
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.620
And for me to watch his son do what they did last

209
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.940
weekend. Do you, you remember your first match? My first, yeah,

210
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.940
my first match, uh, was a tag match. So let him go. So'm managing now.

211
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.500
Okay. Three and a half years.

212
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.740
And then I finally get the call cause dusty who went to w

213
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.850
and he did just, pokad dotted to ick with him. He came back to run the,

214
00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.330
the w CW and you know, he's NWA world champion. He's like the,

215
00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:03.570
one of the smartest guys ever in our business. And, um,

216
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.890
I developed a relationship that was super tight with him when we were in

217
00:13:07.891 --> 00:13:12.490
Florida, but it was his wife, Michelle who really kept it going when he wasn't,

218
00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:15.120
because when I'd call up just to check it when dusty, once in a while,

219
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.640
she'd say, don't worry,

220
00:13:16.641 --> 00:13:21.640
Dallas dusty will call you back and knowing how bad he is at calling someone

221
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.640
back. I know that that's why I thanked Michelle on my whole fame speech,

222
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.720
cuz I know without her,

223
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.360
I don't know if it ever would've kept going the way it did, but dusty, you know,

224
00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:36.150
he brought me in, I managed the Freebird,

225
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.390
Michael psh and Jimmy jam Gar, which was such an education, such a good time.

226
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:42.190
Michael's still one of my best friends today.

227
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:47.270
And I helped Scott Hall who was big. Scott Hall come in,

228
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.670
changed his entire look from blonde hair in a big roll with mustache,

229
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.300
had him dye his hair, jet black and give him this rush,

230
00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.340
cut beard that like nobody had the five o'clock shadow and no one knew who the

231
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.413
he was.

232
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.180
And I brought him in and what is happening as you see all the crazy clothes I

233
00:14:06.181 --> 00:14:07.540
wore, well,

234
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:11.220
five months in Magnum TA who's get Dusty's right hand.

235
00:14:11.221 --> 00:14:14.100
Man comes up to me and he's like, listen, the, um,

236
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.890
we're gonna keep you the color commentator box.

237
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.970
I'm also doing color commentating with Eric Fishoff who would later run the

238
00:14:19.971 --> 00:14:24.090
company. Um, and he said, um, he said,

239
00:14:24.091 --> 00:14:28.770
we can't let you manage anymore. I'm like, what, what I do wrong? He goes,

240
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.090
it's not, it's not anything you're doing wrong, bro. He goes, he goes,

241
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:37.760
you just with the hair and the rap and the, and those crazy clothes. He goes,

242
00:14:37.761 --> 00:14:39.760
you're taking too much attention away from the boys.

243
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.560
And they're the ones who draw the money. And I was like, so,

244
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.400
are you telling me Magnum that I'm too over the top for wrestling &lt;laugh&gt;

245
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.480
and he goes as a manager, kind of, he said, but you know,

246
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:56.160
what we should have done is put you in a pair of tights and boots and see if you

247
00:14:56.161 --> 00:15:01.120
could do this. I had seven months left on my contract, bro. I said, this.

248
00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.560
I never got in this business to be a manager. I wanted to live the dream.

249
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.360
Well, I'm gonna do it.

250
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:12.270
And I went down there and they beat the out of me. Now,

251
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.870
did they teach you how to do it first? No, they,

252
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:19.670
what they do is they blow you up. This is how it was not done. NXTs is,

253
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.750
is different. Um, like down their performance center,

254
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.270
but the original power plant. My, one of my,

255
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:29.230
another mentors of a guy named Jody Hamilton, who was the assassin.

256
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.260
And he really taught me a lot and sort of this guy, Sarge,

257
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.940
but in the beginning they wanna run you off. So they wanna see if you'll quit.

258
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.020
Oh, absolutely. It's like to get you to quit.

259
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.020
It's a different level of seal training.
