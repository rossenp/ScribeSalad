00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.930
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I miss training with Dwayne.</v>

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:07.290
Like I'm that whole situation with Faber, obviously. Very.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.543
<v 1>Very upsetting.</v>

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.310
<v 0>Yeah, it is man. And I, I stayed out of the middle of it. You know,</v>

5
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:16.050
I have a ton of respect for favor and I have a ton of respect for Dwayne. Yeah.

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.290
<v 1>Oh yeah. I love both of those guys that sucked and you know,</v>

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.080
I've talked to Dwayne about it and I talked to favor about it. I'm like, ah,

8
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.910
I know I can't do anything.

9
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:27.510
I don't know them well enough to get in the middle of it and arbitrary,

10
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.310
but I feel like the improvement that everybody was making under Dwayne was

11
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.480
tangible. It was noticeable. Yeah. So he came along and then all of a sudden,

12
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.250
all of a sudden everybody had his foot work. They're moving good.

13
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.490
The striking combinations seem to be improving. I agree. Yup.

14
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.810
TJ for sure was the most he benefited the.

15
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.730
<v 0>Most. He took to it. Probably the best for sure.</v>

16
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.500
<v 1>Like a duck to water. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.890
<v 0>Perfect. For TJ, his style of wrestling,</v>

18
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.580
his body style and his ability to, I mean,

19
00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:58.410
TJ is one of those guys that gets obsessed too.

20
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.450
And him and Dwayne just really meshed on that, on that fact of notepad.

21
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.170
Right. And, you know, mapping everything out.

22
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.870
And TJ has that memory, you know,

23
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:13.140
that kind of comes along with it where he can remember all these different,

24
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:15.960
crazy combos and then get out there and actually perform it.

25
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.760
Like that takes a special athlete to be able to see that thing on paper,

26
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.010
train it and then actually hit it in a flight. For sure.

27
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.080
<v 1>Thinking about his fight with San Hagan was San Hagan had him in a triangle,</v>

28
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.990
locked up. And I was like, man,

29
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.940
I wonder if he had some like pointers on how to finish that

30
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:40.920
better. That would have been it because it seemed locked the in.

31
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:45.630
I mean he went to through, uh, through a knee. Right. And then, uh,

32
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.440
TJ takes him down and in the process of taking him down,

33
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:53.820
he locks up fully locked up triangle early in the fight. And I was like,

34
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.810
man, I feel like he's got this. I was like, I thought TJ was going to tap.

35
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.530
<v 0>[Inaudible] yeah, man. I mean that dude's a beast.</v>

36
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.630
I was worried for TJ going into that fight. I mean,

37
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.580
that's a lot of people are like, oh,

38
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:08.730
I think TJ is going to go in there and just destroy. And I'm like, ah, like.

39
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.430
<v 1>[Inaudible] the only guy who's ever really destroyed him was um,</v>

40
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.410
was all Joe and all Joe took him down and choked him and Aljamain has

41
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:22.500
got some nasty jujitsu, you know? Yup.

42
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.760
<v 0>No, I,</v>

43
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.030
I definitely knew this was gonna be a tough fight and it was a tough fight

44
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:31.410
coming off of that long, you know? And I, TJ is not getting a tune up fight.

45
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:33.570
Like this is gonna make or break like show everyone.

46
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:37.950
TJ is back or TJ is going to have to fight a couple of times and get back. But.

47
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.440
<v 1>It's close to the decision as you're ever going to say. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.350
I mean like you could S you could make an argument that,

49
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.520
that San Hagan did more damage and you can make an argument that, uh,

50
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.570
Dillashaw controlled. The more I'm a damaged guy.

51
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.480
I lean towards damage always. Yeah. But.

52
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.423
<v 0>The whole SAS.</v>

53
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.470
<v 1>Fight, both sides fight. I.</v>

54
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.960
<v 0>I guarantee they're going to run it back. Oh,</v>

55
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.420
we're going to see that at least one more time. Yeah.

56
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.980
<v 1>So, well, unfortunately with TJ surgery, I mean,</v>

57
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.740
he has like several major tears in that knee.

58
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.110
You really never know what a guy is.

59
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:17.860
Like once you get your knee mangled like that, because the pain,

60
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.360
like it might inhibit training, it might become a problem. You know,

61
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.540
it's so hard to say on TJ, his post,

62
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.990
you said it happened at this part right here where his knee gets all twisted.

63
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.840
Yeah. He'll hook right there. That's the heel hook. Yeah.

64
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.880
So he was yanking on that heel hook. Yep. You could see it. I mean,

65
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.490
we'll go back and by the way, that is the worst kind of hill look,

66
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:42.160
the inside heel hook, right. There is so nasty.

67
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.480
So TJ just didn't tap and he just Torres his apart.

68
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.340
Yeah. You can see it. They're.

69
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.040
<v 0>Keeping, keeping his weight off it there for a second.</v>

70
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.090
<v 1>Here. He falls to on the second round. It's just, well,</v>

71
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.720
I'm sure because his knee was mangled and look at him stepping on it. Funny.

72
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.160
Yeah. He's walking. I guess I.

73
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.480
<v 0>Didn't notice that before, but.</v>

74
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.410
<v 1>Yeah, he, he played it off. Well,</v>

75
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.770
he really did a good job playing it off and gutting it out because he was

76
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:12.160
obviously in like some serious pain right there. He got clipped,

77
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.240
but part of getting dropped there was because he had no balance on that left

78
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.060
leg. It was very wobbly, you know,
