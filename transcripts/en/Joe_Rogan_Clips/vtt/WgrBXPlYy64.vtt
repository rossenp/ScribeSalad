00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. That's when we came with the,</v>

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.100
we can't be stopped album.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.280
<v 1>That album cover. Yeah. Yeah. Jesus Christ.</v>

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.780
When you see Bushwick bill with a patch over his eye yeah. In the hospital,

5
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:18.140
gurney and you guys are rolling with him behind and that's the album cover.

6
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:23.040
Look at that. Yeah. I mean, come on. That is classic. Yeah. Yeah.

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.140
That is a classic album cover. I mean,

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.340
these stop and push weeks on the old school cell phone.

9
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.040
<v 0>And that's done,</v>

10
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.390
that was done like totally spontaneously.

11
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.240
We didn't, we, it was totally unplanned.

12
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.350
Cause we had finished the album and then Bush would get shot.

13
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.080
And this was how this would happen a lot with, with bill,

14
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.840
like bill could get a job done.

15
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.960
And like if he had something made to do, he'd get it done.

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.250
But then after he get it done, you know, it was just,

17
00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:01.310
something starts going on. Some stuff just does happening.

18
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.950
So we had finished the album and you know, get a call. Bill got shot,

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.320
go up to the hospital immediately. In my mind,

20
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:17.000
this is my Cabo Western days, mate, mind you, I'm thinking revenge.

21
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.760
Like I don't care who shot him? Who shot? Who? You know, like let's get him.

22
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.010
So I get to the hospital, I go into the room and build this land now.

23
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:28.010
And he's kind of, he's dazed,

24
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.380
but he's conscious. And he's like, well,

25
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.283
don't hurt her.

26
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.540
I made her do it.

27
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.240
Your Bushwick it's wrong. It's so wrong.

28
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.360
So that was that, you know, I checked on him. He was good.

29
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.780
He's going to survive. He lost his eye, but he's going to survive.

30
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.220
How did he make her shoot him? He said that they were arguing.

31
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.730
This is Bill's version that they were arguing over

32
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.140
something and he was mad.

33
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.390
So he pulled out the gun and he threatened to throw the baby

34
00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:17.390
downstairs. And then he,

35
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:19.440
he has the gun in the,

36
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.550
his girlfriend is like the tussling over the gun.

37
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.480
And so Bill's like, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me. This is what he's saying.

38
00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:32.320
That he told her. So the gun goes off. Boom,

39
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.960
bill get shot. Now. Now no, I'd be like, I know bed.

40
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.410
I know building purposely shoot himself in the eyes.

41
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.300
Have anyone shoot him? And now bill just likes walking on the edge.

42
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.770
You see, he'll walk that edge. I got to do it. I do it. I do it. Oh.

43
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.550
That's I believe happened. But bill say, you know, he made us shoot them.

44
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.850
So get to the hospital and

45
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.480
we go downstairs and cliff Blodgett is there. And at the time,

46
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.490
cliff is the co owner of rap, a lot records. And cliff say,

47
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.660
you know, everybody, you know,

48
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:23.020
we have a little meeting in the lobby and your bills, okay,

49
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.770
you're going to survive. You know that, that was our first thought,

50
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.370
you know what I'm saying? Everybody just wanted him to be okay, he's safe.

51
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.440
He survived Cliff's cliff site back to business cliff, like,

52
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.360
okay, so what, what are you going to,

53
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.570
what are we going to do about the album cover? And I said, well,

54
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:44.410
we can shoot it. He alive.

55
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.570
So, so cliff is like, well,

56
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:55.150
how do we going to do that? I said, I say, man,

57
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.990
we just go up there and shoot it. He said, well, who's going to ask him. I said,

58
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.550
I asked him. So I went up there and I was like,

59
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.410
yo, I say, man,

60
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.420
we want to shoot this album cover man. You down. Bill was like,

61
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.240
I don't care. He's like, yeah. He said, yeah,

62
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.300
went back down and told him it was a go. Me and Brad went upstairs.

63
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.940
Cliff went to his car, got the camera. We went,

64
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.240
we went upstairs and back to the room, the nurse put bill on another gurney

65
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.840
and me and Brad wrote them down the hall. So the nurse was in our nurse. Knew

66
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.590
we wrote them down the hall and we didn't roll him far. I mean,

67
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.190
he left like maybe the room was like right behind us to the, to the right.

68
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.260
<v 1>Whose idea was it for him to be holding the phone?</v>

69
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.070
<v 0>I don't know, but I know chief was there too. I road manager.</v>

70
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.600
So I don't know if chief told him, you know, rad a phone or something.

71
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:05.650
I don't know. But.

72
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.530
<v 2>What's the hat already on him? No.</v>

73
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.760
<v 0>He put the hat on too. So, uh, yeah,</v>

74
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:15.040
I think that was chief idea to put the props on,

75
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:18.280
but he started rolling down the hallway in cliff,

76
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:20.860
shot the pitch and that's how you got the cover. Wow.

77
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.320
<v 1>One of my great regrets is not having him on the podcast. He was reached,</v>

78
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.790
they reached out, whoever was representing him, reached out. And I had a,

79
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.450
you know, I, uh, my gets, I book it myself. I do it on my phone.

80
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:36.840
So I've months in advance, I'm trying to coordinate.

81
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.890
And it took a couple of weeks for me to find a date and I got ahold of them

82
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:43.410
again. But then he was sick. He was real sick.

83
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.070
He was in the hospital and they said he couldn't travel anymore. Right.

84
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.530
And then shortly after he, yeah, it.

85
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.890
<v 0>It happened fast. Like once he started, like once he made the announcement,</v>

86
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.880
his health, was it pancreatic here really fast?

87
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.650
I think what was it? Yeah,

88
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.710
I think it was one of those ones that it was pancreatic.

89
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.690
That's one of those ones that gets you quick. Yeah. That's, that's a bummer.

90
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.320
<v 3>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>
