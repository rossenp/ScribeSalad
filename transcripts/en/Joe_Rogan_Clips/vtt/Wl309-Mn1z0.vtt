00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.330
<v 1>I'm interested in that. I'm very interested in that,</v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:07.710
and I'm not saying those people are lying,

4
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:11.730
and I'm not saying that John Mack introduced ideas into their heads.

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.190
But what I am saying is the real evidence, the real evidence,

6
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:19.830
like the video of that thing,

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.130
whatever the that TAC was taking off,

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.600
right at what they estimate to be thousands of miles an hour instantaneously

9
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.310
from a standstill and jetting off to the cat point, right?

10
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.360
Where they were initially supposed to meet like this,

11
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.030
the coordinates that the jets had,

12
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.210
where they were supposed to scramble to doing this exercise,

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.560
this tic-tac went to that spot. Almost like to tell you, Hey,

14
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.980
I know where you're going. It went from, they tracked it on radar,

15
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:54.480
going from 80,000 feet above sea level to 50 in less than a second.

16
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.220
These are with no visual, visible propulsion.

17
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.110
<v 0>And flipping 180 degrees, which is, you know,</v>

18
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.890
and physically possible with the technology that we know.

19
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.020
<v 1>Exists. No heat signature, right? No.</v>

20
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.890
<v 0>Propulsion, no.</v>

21
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.800
<v 1>Known visual, visible propulsion system.</v>

22
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.150
They don't know what the these things are.

23
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.220
So if these are super advanced us military craft, wow,

24
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.500
holy. Have they been working? Holy.

25
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.720
Did they create something that defies all known physics that we have

26
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:28.050
today in terms of like, what's, uh, what's available for propulsion?

27
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.050
Cause everything else is you got to push something out the back,

28
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:34.770
whether it's flames and that makes things go fast forward. This is not.

29
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.680
<v 0>Described it the same way. Even back in the fifties and sixties,</v>

30
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:42.450
it was all described as similar types of things that would disappear or shoot

31
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:47.190
off that doesn't seem physically possible. But now what's so weird about it.

32
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:48.024
Now,

33
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.800
why are like former CIA directors like Brennan Woolsey,

34
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.950
even Obama has like, made like a joke about like, yes,

35
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:59.340
we don't know what these things are. What do you think it is?

36
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:02.670
Why is the intelligence community coming out and actually like putting their

37
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:03.990
stamp of approval on this?

38
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:08.670
When for the last 70 years it's been so under the radar, they, you know,

39
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.500
they've been putting this under wraps,

40
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.900
but now they're kind of toying with the idea.

41
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:16.890
Like we actually don't know what these are. And then they also say,

42
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.020
we know that they're not from our military.

43
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.540
So they're hinting toward adversaries, right? China, Russia,

44
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:24.540
with the hypersonic weapons technology that they're claiming that they can

45
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:27.450
develop weapons five to 10 times the speed of sound.

46
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.140
And I don't know what that looks like when you apply it.

47
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:35.970
But that's strange to me that you see this rollout in the mainstream

48
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:40.050
media talking about this now with the disclosures that the Pentagon has put out.

49
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.480
<v 1>Now you are a cynical person,</v>

50
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.330
especially when it comes to the U S military and the intelligence agencies.

51
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:49.620
What's your perspective. Like, I'm sure you're not just saying, oh, well,

52
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:53.310
they're looking out for us. They want us to know about these, uh,

53
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:56.370
amazing things. Like what's your cynical perspective?

54
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.680
<v 0>Well, when I look at these things, a lot of these people,</v>

55
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:02.740
I believe these people and especially watching that documentary,

56
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.963
job's a real mind.

57
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.500
And a lot of this is bone chilling because I believe especially when 62 people

58
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:11.290
see something or people 200 people in Melbourne, Australia,

59
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.250
or all of these high level military people who you could tell are scared,

60
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:19.060
shitless, recounting what they saw. I believe them.

61
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.740
I really do because it's hard to act. Right. But, um, I,

62
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.730
my mind tends to go toward what is physically possible?

63
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:29.920
Is it a mass hallucinations?

64
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:34.840
Is it some sort of DMT weapon that can elicit some sort of mass hallucination

65
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:37.570
where people are, um,

66
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.400
susceptible to a delusional mindset and told something like you just said,

67
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.620
is it the hypersonic weapons technology?

68
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.980
Is it something that is a drone being projected holographically?

69
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.540
Is it something that we can explain by, uh, you know,

70
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.360
the realm of quantum physics that we actually don't understand? Like,

71
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.820
like the Schrodinger's cat phenomenon, like,

72
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.460
is there something that is within the realm of physics,

73
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:03.010
but we don't understand and comprehend it yet.

74
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.560
So that's where my mind goes in terms of what is it,

75
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.890
if it is something from another planet,

76
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.910
is it holographically like projected onto us? You know, is that,

77
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.811
is that what's happening?

78
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:17.500
But in terms of the intelligence community and people like Marco Rubio with that

79
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:21.850
PBS special that came out or the 60 minutes special and Marco Rubio at the end

80
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:24.210
of it is just like, we don't know what these are, man.

81
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.010
They might not be from our planet. And I'm like, what the?

82
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.230
Like one of the most hardcore neo-conservatives is going out there and,

83
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:34.810
and cutely toyed with the idea that this could be from another world.

84
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:39.130
And knowing that this has been so under wraps

85
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.390
that whatever is happening and I believe something is happening has been

86
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.940
completely censored and covered up by our government.

87
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.160
But now they're coming out and saying, it's okay to talk about this.

88
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:55.330
This is no longer some fringe, kooky conspiracy theory. This is happening.

89
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.800
Of course,

90
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.330
the cynic in me goes to what better way to kind of

91
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.370
pull on our deep seated, psychological fears of something that we can't explain,

92
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:10.920
this kind of supernatural element to whatever's going on, going back to the,

93
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.400
the, the UFO lore of everything from X-Files something that I grew up on,

94
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.390
you know, the abyss,

95
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:21.040
like this notion that if there's something greater than our government and our

96
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.390
technological capabilities,

97
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:26.170
and we need to kind of like just acquiesce toward our institutions to be like,

98
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:30.760
you just do whatever you need to do, whether that be militarizing space,

99
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.130
like these things are a threat just because they exist and we don't know what

100
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:38.350
they are. So, so my mind goes to,

101
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.320
there's a reason why this rollout is happening and it's not for the betterment

102
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:44.920
of humanity.

103
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.790
And it's not because of the curiosity of these officials in terms of learning or

104
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.860
wanting to find out what UFO's are. It's about going back to what I said before.

105
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:56.530
It's about militarization and, and, you know,

106
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.920
space force is basically part of the neo-con blueprint back from Pinnock,

107
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.440
the Bush administration, and Trump fulfilled that dream.

108
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.780
And I do think that this is, this is part of that. And, and look,

109
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:11.390
I don't know, but I think that we need to ask questions.

110
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.490
Why is our reality being sanitized?

111
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.500
Why are things like Q Anon being purged from the internet as ludicrous as it may

112
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:19.190
be,

113
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.170
but we're also simultaneously being told that UFO's are something

114
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.470
that are real and they're concerning.

115
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:30.470
They're potentially a threat to national security. We don't know what they are.

116
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.930
And it's okay to talk about that. Now that is a curious thing to me, Joe.

117
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.520
<v 1>It is curious,</v>

118
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.650
and I appreciate your perspective because I think it's good to look

119
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:43.970
at this from a bunch of different angles,

120
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.220
because it's real tempting to say, well, I'm finally,

121
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.060
uh, at a point in history, it's amazing. I'm, um,

122
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.440
I'm here where the government is admitting that there are alien

123
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.450
crafts that are off world vehicles, not from this earth.

124
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.320
You know, those like one of the quotes that we're,

125
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.710
we're admitting that we, we have, we are being visited,

126
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.410
but are we cause why would the government finally start telling us without

127
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:20.090
motivation without some sort of end game without what

128
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.530
what's, what's, what's in it for them to tell us about these things in less.

129
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.770
They're so frequent and so bizarre.

130
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.430
And so many military people are talking about them that they feel like their

131
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:34.760
back is against the wall and they have to say something about it because

132
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:37.670
otherwise they're going to lose credibility that there's so many of these

133
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:41.630
things. And there's so many like the go fast video, the FLIR video,

134
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.920
there's so many of these encounters that these very reputable people like

135
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:50.780
commander David Fravor have had with these crafts that behave in a way that

136
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:55.760
is impossible. As far as we know, with any known technology on earth in 2021.

137
00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:58.610
And this is David Fravor. One is from 2004.

138
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.100
<v 0>And what's disturbing about it is no matter what it is.</v>

139
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:02.630
I don't think we're going to find out the truth.

140
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.670
And I think it's going to be exploited for,

141
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.290
for certain means that we're not going to know. Um, it's not going to be overt,

142
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.920
but there is definitely something going on because it doesn't make sense.

143
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.230
And if it's, oh, there's so many people seen it.

144
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.100
This has been going on for 70 years. I mean that movie, I mean,

145
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.420
there was people like every day.

146
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.670
One thing that I find really interesting though,

147
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:27.350
is now everyone has cell phones that film in 4k,

148
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.030
Google earth satellites all over the world that can zoom in on someone walking

149
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:36.710
down the street. So if these things are flying over the ocean, like someone, uh,

150
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:39.980
you know, part of the David Fravor special on 60 minutes was saying,

151
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:43.190
I saw this like this every day, that was a literal quote from him.

152
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.230
Why are we only seeing these grainy satellite images of these

153
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.183
UFO's.

154
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.420
<v 1>Christopher Mellon who used to work for the state department told me that they</v>

155
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:57.120
have way more, way more footage. They're just not releasing it.

156
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.380
<v 0>But why, why rollout this one? And where's this grainy Philomena.</v>

157
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.860
<v 1>And they're rolling. They're not rolling it out. It's it's soldiers,</v>

158
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.920
it's sailors. It's, it's a fighter pilots.

159
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:11.160
It's people are releasing these videos and photographs.

160
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:12.720
They're leaking them because they.

161
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.260
<v 0>Getting in trouble for like leaking them. You know, like we had like,</v>

162
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:17.670
this is a whistleblower leaking.

163
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.270
<v 1>These cause it's, I think it's a different kind of a leak.</v>

164
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:24.270
It's not like they're leaking something in the United States is doing right.

165
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:25.290
They're not like it.

166
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:28.050
Like you remember that kid that got arrested for taking a photograph inside of a

167
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:31.740
submarine. Remember that that's a different kind of leak, right?

168
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.690
That's you're leaking out U S military secrets. This is not us military secret.

169
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:40.620
This is a strange unidentified. What they call a UAP now,

170
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:45.150
because UFO's got a bad rap, right? It's like red pill got taken over by.

171
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.810
You know? So now they're these,

172
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.370
a lot of these people that have seen these things are frustrated at the lack of

173
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:55.890
transparency. I mean, this is the narrative, right? I don't know if it's true,

174
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:59.820
but my friend, Jeremy Corbell, who's been the guy who's released most of these,

175
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.050
most of these videos,

176
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:04.890
like those pyramid shaped crafts that they were watching with night vision that

177
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:08.730
were in the middle of the ocean floating around over this, um,

178
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.810
destroyer or this aircraft carrier. They don't know what the those things are.

179
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.310
These are videos from people that are there. The one, the, the,

180
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:18.150
the one that was a, um,

181
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.050
trans medium vehicle that was flying over the ocean and then went into the

182
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:23.880
ocean. They don't know what the that is.

183
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:27.270
They filmed that thing with night vision. They don't know what it is.

184
00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:31.260
And this was soldiers that were filming it, enlisted people who were filming it.

185
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.150
And you could hear them saying like, what.

186
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.770
<v 0>Splashing.</v>

187
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.090
<v 1>Down, it's in, it's in the water now.</v>

188
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.400
<v 0>And the water. Yeah. Like the whole like wild. Yeah. The water to air stuff.</v>

189
00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:44.580
Doesn't make sense either without compromising the function of like one or the

190
00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:47.490
other. That it's very fascinating. But what I guess my point is,

191
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.600
if they're seeing the every day, you think that they would try to film it, like,

192
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.670
you know, not on satellite.

193
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.230
<v 1>But the point they don't have the ability to film it on satellite.</v>

194
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.990
They only have access to their cell phones.

195
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.540
They have access if you're going to leak their cell phone,

196
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.700
but they are filming some of these things like that.

197
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:07.710
One that went into the ocean. That's I mean,

198
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:10.890
that's the best they can do with filming something off of night vision,

199
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.390
the ones that were floating around above that UFO or about, uh,

200
00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:18.390
above the aircraft card is shaped like pyramids about the, the, you know, the,

201
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.920
the go fast video. I mean,

202
00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:24.420
they're using the cameras that are on these fighter jets that are designed to

203
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:27.420
track enemy craft. And that's what they're designed for.

204
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.450
They're locking in on this thing with their tracking systems,

205
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.360
this thing's moving at the same rates of speed and they're following it.

206
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.010
This is the best that they have in that application.

207
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.730
Now that doesn't mean that the government doesn't have some satellites that

208
00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:46.200
could zoom in on those coordinates and get that thing and get a very detailed

209
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.120
high resolution video of that.

210
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.170
They probably have that if these things really are real, if they aren't,

211
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.700
if this isn't just some sort of, uh, a mass PSYOP, if that's true,

212
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.590
they probably have some really high resolution that will curl your

213
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:04.810
toes. And that's what Christopher Mellon says,

214
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.080
but there's no reason for them to release that stuff for two reasons. One,

215
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.270
why would they tell,

216
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.670
why would they give away the actual capability of these satellites

217
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.700
in a, like an undeniable way? Like,

218
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:23.140
if you could see like the bolts on this UFO from,

219
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.860
you know, however many miles in the sky, these satellites are,

220
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.850
and then everybody be like, Jesus Christ, like, what else are they watching?

221
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.560
What else can they see? You know,

222
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:36.940
they can watch you take a through your bathroom window. What are they doing?

223
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.620
You know, if they can see that,

224
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:41.260
like if they could read a license plate from space, that's,

225
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:45.880
what's been reported that it is possible now through these satellites that you

226
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:50.710
can get such a high resolution video that you can clearly see a license

227
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:52.690
plate from space and read it.

228
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.170
<v 0>That there's also something called clay tronics,</v>

229
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:58.750
which is like a programmable matter.

230
00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:01.960
Like microcomputers that can create a holographic cloud.

231
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.570
That's actually a tangible hologram. I mean,

232
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:07.990
there's so many things that seems like it's sent off.

233
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.200
Uh it's. This is what they're saying,

234
00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:15.400
that they're working on developing where you can have a series of microcomputers

235
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:20.500
program themselves into different visual entities into

236
00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:21.730
one giant hologram.

237
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.290
<v 1>That was a Spider-Man movie.</v>

238
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.270
<v 0>Yes, no, I know, no, this is, this is no, this is crazy, man. I mean,</v>

239
00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:31.510
Chris Carter, the creator of X-Files says that he had like a CIA guy,

240
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:34.120
like feeding him information for the show. I mean,

241
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:37.210
I do think that art imitates reality and a lot of ways,

242
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.120
and when it goes back to the 60 minutes special,

243
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.960
which was one of the only mainstream institutions that was taking this

244
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:47.050
seriously, my whole thing is like, there was no skepticism at all.

245
00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:50.140
There was no attempt to debunk these people,

246
00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:54.540
which seemed like a change in tone from these institutions. Like, so that,

247
00:13:54.541 --> 00:13:55.750
that like blows my mind. It's like,

248
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:58.210
usually you would have people have the debunker,

249
00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:00.490
have the guy saying that he saw UFO's right.

250
00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:04.240
But this one was just like glued in being like, this is happening.

251
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.630
<v 1>Well, the New York times is the first to break it in 2017.</v>

252
00:14:07.631 --> 00:14:09.490
That really shifted the perception.

253
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:13.810
When you see the New York times has an article talking about these

254
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:16.570
unexplained vehicles and taking them seriously,

255
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.720
and then interviews with like high ranking military officials,

256
00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:22.330
people from the Pentagon, all that kind of. When you see that stuff,

257
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.510
starting to make it into the mainstream, it just changes everything.

258
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.800
And the New York times for sure changed everything that 2017 article change,

259
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.340
the, the people that would never take U of O seriously,

260
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.860
they're seeing that in the New York times. And they're saying like, holy,

261
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.540
this isn't the times. Yeah.

262
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.650
<v 0>The same people who discredited Dennis [inaudible] at the 2007 presidential</v>

263
00:14:41.651 --> 00:14:45.100
debate because they were like, you saw a UFO, like you idiot.

264
00:14:45.101 --> 00:14:47.380
And that was one of the questions. And he was like, yeah, yeah.

265
00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:51.850
Like I saw you at FAU. And it's like, dude, yeah, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan,

266
00:14:51.851 --> 00:14:53.590
all of them saw UFO's too, you know?

267
00:14:53.591 --> 00:14:58.450
And it was such a discrediting fringe thing. But, um, but no, I mean,

268
00:14:58.451 --> 00:14:59.890
it's, it's not at all.
