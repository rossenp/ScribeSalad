<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.670
<v 1>Experience. Now I'm not in, believe it or not.</v>

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:09.360
I'm not into UFO's. I don't follow those stories or, you know,

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.480
your experiences. No, I'm fascinated with the technology. And I, I, it really,

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.330
it irks me like every night I go to sleep that, you know, I don't,

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.100
that it was my own doing, essentially that,

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.660
that prevented me from continuing on in the, in the project. I mean, it's the,

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.340
that to be on that cutting edge of technology is so alluring to me.

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.270
But, you know, by the same token,

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.720
I don't really care that there's aliens or where they come from. I mean,

11
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.870
the prize is the technology and that's what I'm fascinated by.

12
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:45.660
But so I don't listen to UFO stories and that sort of thing.

13
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:48.240
But George Knapp is, um, I mean,

14
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.280
he's the guy that has the context and tries to thread everything together. And,

15
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.920
uh, what he recently told me as he found, I don't,

16
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.180
it was either documentation or people that he spoke to it's at this,

17
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.210
the existence of this project, the project that I was on,

18
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.550
it's something that they seem to take out every eight or 10

19
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:08.880
years.

20
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.470
<v 2>So that's a very specific memo. And this is actually, this is the first time.</v>

21
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:14.910
I'll be very clear with people about it.

22
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:18.870
It's a big topic of conversation right now. It's called the Wilson memo.

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.340
You can look it up. Admiral Wilson met with a scientist.

24
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.440
Who's actually was featured in one of my films.

25
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.120
Everybody has been debating whether or not this document have a

26
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.070
conversation with a,

27
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:35.460
with an sitting Admiral at the time is a real document.

28
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.350
It's an actual conversation that happened.

29
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:39.840
And this document is where everybody wants to know the world is going crazy

30
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:43.080
right now in the UFO world. I'll tell you straight up right now,

31
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.030
I'm in the position to know,

32
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.900
and it is a real document that it is real.

33
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.220
So the conversation you read in that, that conversation was had,

34
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:54.990
I can't attest to every, you're not.

35
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.010
<v 0>Being very clear. Sure.</v>

36
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.690
<v 2>Please. No problem. So there was a document is circulating right now.</v>

37
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.750
That is really big. It's going around everywhere. People are asking them,

38
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:06.810
what is this document it's called? The Wilson memo is what,

39
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.230
how you can find it online. There are the Wilson leak.

40
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.370
<v 0>There it is. Jimmy's got it. The Wilson memorandum use of human volunteers.</v>

41
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.090
<v 2>No, that's not it. Yeah. So, uh,</v>

42
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.800
Admiral Wilson meets with this scientist and they have this discussion,

43
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.010
oddly enough, at special projects at EG and G. And I,

44
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:29.310
if I remember the documents from 2001, I'm telling everybody right now,

45
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.110
it's real. And we'll see,

46
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:33.960
my history is pretty good with like saying if something's real or not. Right?

47
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.090
So here we go. Document comes out.

48
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.260
They meet at EG and G special projects in 1989,

49
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.680
they stumble into a problem. This happens,

50
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.420
they put the technology away and then they bring it back out and see if material

51
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:51.450
science has caught up. And if they can make any progress.

52
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.630
So this document kind of talks about this process, the big thing I get from it,

53
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.360
and a lot of it's vindicating to Bob.

54
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.260
And one of the things that's vindicating besides the egg thing is that private

55
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:05.410
industry. So this guy's an Admiral. And he says,

56
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.830
I sh I found out about your SAP, your special access program.

57
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.660
I need to know about it.

58
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.640
And he's going to a private part of industry and he is denied

59
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.480
access. And he says, I, you know, I should be running this program.

60
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.540
And they were able to deny him access.

61
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.630
So I think the takeaway here is check it out.

62
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.050
I'm telling you that that is an actual correct. That is a leak.

63
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.240
Now everything said in that document, I don't.

64
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.300
<v 0>Know what is said in that document specifically, it's.</v>

65
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.320
<v 2>A, between a scientist and an,</v>

66
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.970
an Admiral that are sitting and they're having a meeting and they're talking

67
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:43.450
about, um, the search for the UFO subject,

68
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.760
the search to get special access program,

69
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.650
access to all of these different things like reverse engineering programs.

70
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.230
So in this document, they talk about it. Uh,

71
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.740
I believe that this document,

72
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.470
that the person that went was employed by Robert Bigelow, you know,

73
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.050
one of the guys has a couple of orbiting satellites and all that stuff.

74
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.160
Who's been guy.

75
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.180
<v 0>On skin Walker, ranch.</v>

76
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.130
<v 2>No, he's not. He was the guy, the old skin Walker. Yeah. He used to own it.</v>

77
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:12.550
There's a new owner. And I interviewed him for my other film,

78
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.080
but there's a new owner. And you'll be hearing a lot more about that soon. But,

79
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.370
uh, like it'll just, there's,

80
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.850
there's stuff that you'll be hearing about skin Walker ranch soon.

81
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.813
Cause there's a new owner.

82
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.690
And the whole point of this insertion here is just that,

83
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.460
that document kind of validates a lot of this idea.

84
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.240
Bob just said that they make a little progress, then they can't go anywhere.

85
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:37.450
They tuck it away and then they bring it back out, you know,

86
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:41.200
10 years later and start working on it. What is the limiting factor?

87
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:44.470
I think Bob should speak on this, but it's the material science.

88
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.180
<v 1>Early where physics is so I can, I can see them doing that. I mean,</v>

89
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.590
I didn't have any, uh, information on that, but I think what,

90
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.430
you know, George uncovered is probably accurate that, uh, you know,

91
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:00.880
we try and do what we can and once we reach a roadblock on,

92
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.890
we really can't figure it out. It's just frigging wait, put the thing away,

93
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:08.410
wait for science to catch up. And you know,

94
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:11.770
a decade later let's take the project out again and say, all right, now,

95
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:12.604
where can we go?

96
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.480
<v 0>It's gotta be someone who remains informed, right? Oh yeah.</v>

97
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:19.390
You've got your scientists like you and Barry,

98
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.760
you got your people that you compartmentalize. You got these people.

99
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.270
<v 1>Yeah. There has to be some people that know everything.</v>

100
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.680
<v 0>Security, and then someone's going to be in the outside saying, Hey,</v>

101
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:32.320
we need people to guard this building. Don't let anybody in.

102
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.910
<v 1>I th I think a lot of that is private industry and I think that's how they keep</v>

103
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:38.590
it. Yeah. I think that's how they literally,

104
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:41.170
because the government is just so leaky.

105
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.880
I think that's kind of what they're doing.

106
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.840
<v 2>That's what the document kind of proves you just articulated that, that, um,</v>

107
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.340
it isn't controlled private industry.

108
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.240
<v 0>Private industry, some aerospace company, something, I don't know.</v>

109
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.290
<v 2>W w the guy with the admir, wouldn't name it in the car right.</v>

110
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.133
In the conversation.

111
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.540
<v 0>So they still have.</v>

112
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.770
<v 1>These things, supposedly, I would guess. I mean,</v>

113
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:05.330
I don't have any information on them.

114
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.160
<v 0>You ever asked anyone that has any inkling of</v>

115
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.950
any idea of where they got them or how they.

116
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.560
<v 1>Now, but, um, something must have been said to me, um,</v>

117
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.210
from Barry and, but I, it was just too long ago and I,

118
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.350
I can't quite remember what was said, but it, it just left a seed in my mind.

119
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:30.740
I think at least one of them was part of an archeological dig.

120
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.770
So it's old. Some one, at least one of them is old.

121
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.210
I don't know if it was the one I worked on,

122
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:42.560
but I remember something to do with an archeological dig. Whoa.

123
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.760
So that's, uh, that means it's not just old. It's ancient. That'd be a great.

124
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.920
<v 0>Steven Spielberg. Yeah. Right.</v>

125
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.410
<v 1>That's all.</v>

126
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.230
<v 2>Of it. Would, you know when he said that for the first time?</v>

127
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.220
<v 0>Yeah. That's a freak out right there. Just a couple of dudes with some brushes,</v>

128
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.980
looking for a Tyrannosaurus Rex bone and metal.

129
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.190
<v 2>And when did they find it? You know, that they have nine of them.</v>

130
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.900
<v 1>How could we have not heard about that? What about the guys with the brushes?</v>

131
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.470
How could you uncover something like that? And.

132
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.410
<v 2>Joe's newspaper at home? Does, I mean, they set it on that first day. Oh,</v>

133
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:16.360
you mean the Roswell? Yeah.

134
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.550
<v 0>And when you told me, yeah, I have a cover, what is this here?</v>

135
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:22.880
Jamie is the document. But I had to do some digging to find it. Yeah.

136
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.270
<v 2>Just kind of, yeah. So this is where they meet at egg,</v>

137
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:28.610
and this is Adam or Wilson, and there's a lot more coming out. Now.

138
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:31.040
I want to be clear, George, didn't put this out.

139
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:34.640
He didn't leak this out to anybody. This is, I can tell you.

140
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.560
<v 0>How I recorded this, this conversation.</v>

141
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.430
<v 2>So this was an employee of, at the time Robert Bigelow, and this is.</v>

142
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.360
<v 0>In 2002.</v>

143
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.631
<v 2>Right.</v>

144
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:44.810
Do you remember when he had that government contract called out the world I'll

145
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:47.480
knows about now. And he had nits that studied the ranch,

146
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.170
that 22 million everybody is saying it was for a tip, um,

147
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.420
advanced aerospace threat identification program.

148
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:59.060
The $22 million was for all SAP that was pushed through, through Congress,

149
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:02.900
three congressmen, right. An astronaut. It was pushed through.

150
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.780
And that's what that $22 million, by the way,

151
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:08.720
they spend more money on Viagra every year than they do studying UFOs.

152
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.640
If it was just this program, which I think is funny.

153
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.070
<v 0>In the military, they probably.</v>

154
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.820
<v 2>Do that. Well, you never know how it seeds into population, but anyway, uh,</v>

155
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:21.140
this program, uh, this is what was the mother program. So it,

156
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.800
it got the 22 million. And really it was to study skin Walker ranch,

157
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:25.760
oddly enough,

158
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.020
that 22 million all was inspired by the phenomenon they were seen at skin Walker

159
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:30.410
ranch,

160
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:35.090
because the scientists they're seeing vehicles come through like a

161
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:36.410
space in the sky.

162
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.570
<v 0>I went there, I went through Duncan.</v>

163
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.190
We interviewed a bunch of people that seem full of, but a couple that didn't,

164
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.500
but this very, very interesting, totally.

165
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.290
<v 2>But if you look, I spent a lot of time in the area.</v>

166
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.700
I'm not talking about those stories.

167
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:52.370
I'm saying there were scientists hired by the government,

168
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.340
right through big lo to study the ranch because they thought was important. And,

169
00:08:56.341 --> 00:09:00.390
you know, whatever, whatever the point is, that 22 million was to study that.

170
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.650
Then we have a tip,

171
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.740
which is like an auxiliary kind of program of military settings,

172
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:06.420
like commander favors. And that sort of thing.

173
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.640
This document is just one of those things that has now come forward, that,

174
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.230
um, through the big, low studies,

175
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:16.800
it was government funded and then it was personally funded and then government

176
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:18.120
funded. Um,

177
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:21.750
it's just one of those things that kind of shakes you because you got this

178
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:26.550
military guy who can't get access because of the private industry that's

179
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:30.810
holding these non-terrestrial materials, they can't study it.

180
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:36.030
So that's the claim right now. Give it some time, let people dig more into this.

181
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.800
It's fascinating, man.
