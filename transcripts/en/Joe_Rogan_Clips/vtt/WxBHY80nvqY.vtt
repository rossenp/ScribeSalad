<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 2>You know, here's another thing, uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.070
cause it's kinda along the same line and I hope I don't get emotional on this

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:13.560
one, but so, you know, when I was

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.500
15, I'd want to stay championship and uh,

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.233
uh,

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.120
my first state championship in wrestling first year as a high school, sophomore,

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.920
because that high school started then. And I, uh, anyway,

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.690
long story short,

10
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.550
this neighbor kid ended up murdering my sister. And, uh,

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.710
he had walked to school with me a couple of weeks before that and uh,

12
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.270
said something to me who I should, if I would've communicated,

13
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.170
uh, it might've saved her life, you know,

14
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:56.520
just because she probably would've never let the guy into the, her house.

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.560
What did he say? He just said like, boy, you gotta a hot sister.

16
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.560
You know? And, and he was kinda my age one year older than me,

17
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:06.390
but my sister was four years older than me.

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.840
<v 0>So he was probably 16 and she was 19 and,</v>

19
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.760
and she had a boyfriend and she was living in home yet. And,

20
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.620
and uh, so, so the funny thing is,

21
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:23.610
is I didn't, I actually was going to come home and say something to her,

22
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:26.670
but when I got home, I got distracted and I said, oh, it's just boy talk,

23
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:29.090
you know, it's this boy talking then it was mostly about, he,

24
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:30.070
he just thought my,

25
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.330
my sister was really hot and that he would like to do something, whether,

26
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:36.890
you know, but he never really said outright, I'm going to, I didn't,

27
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:40.440
I just figured something, you know, the boy boys would like to do, you know,

28
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.750
but anyway, so the, you know,

29
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:46.950
that two weeks later we're on a fishing trip with my mom and dad and my sister

30
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.750
is supposed to join us and she doesn't show up cause she worked for my

31
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:56.520
dad after, uh, she went to college for a year and then she worked for my dad,

32
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.040
uh, after that as a secretary, the real estate business. So, uh,

33
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.580
she didn't show up. So we called the neighbor.

34
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.490
And back in those days you didn't have cell phones. So we had, uh,

35
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.440
we had a phone, uh, that was outside of cabin that we rented.

36
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.890
Now I can date you because the date at the cabin,

37
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:20.550
we rented for four bucks a night. So, you know, it's just unheard of,

38
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:25.230
and that was, you know, it would've been, uh, uh, 1964.

39
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.010
So, so we were at a payphone and about a half a block from,

40
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.290
from the cabin that we were renting and we rolled the window down and you put

41
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:38.010
the dimer nickel in the phone and you call it. My dad called the, uh,

42
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.130
I was in the front back seat. My mom and dad were in front.

43
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:45.120
My dad was driving and he called the neighbor and he asked if, um,

44
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.520
my sister's car was still in the driveway. And he said, yes.

45
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.440
So when she was supposed to beat Dallas,

46
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:56.070
90 miles away that morning and she didn't show up. So,

47
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.430
so my dad and my mom get really nervous and I tell him,

48
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.400
they tell him to go get break into that house. If he can't, you know,

49
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:04.091
if there's nobody, you know,

50
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:08.020
he can't get in break into it or she doesn't answer the door, but you know,

51
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.770
get into that house and call us back. So it's it.

52
00:03:10.771 --> 00:03:13.750
You can see the tension in the front seat of the car. You know,

53
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.990
I can see my mom and dad were in the phone rings finally at about 15 minutes

54
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:20.170
later. And all of a sudden the, uh,

55
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.320
my dad drops the phone and, and um, my,

56
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.373
my mom was going,

57
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.010
she was kind of starting to go a Storico Mo know what was wrong. And,

58
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.020
and he looked over, I'll never forget this, you know, being a 15 year old kid.

59
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.970
And I looked at my dad said to her,

60
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.990
Diane's not alive. And oh my God, you know, it's just,

61
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.210
my mom opened the door of the car. She took off running back to the block,

62
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:51.910
to the cabin. I got out and ran after me. When I,

63
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.100
when I followed her into the cabin.

64
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:57.970
By that time she was already on the floor and she had grabbed her hair and she

65
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.940
was pulling her head, hitting the wooden floor.

66
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.980
And she looked up and she had blood all over her forehead. And, um,

67
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.900
uh, so my dad then followed in and we packed up real quick, a blunt,

68
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.950
10 minutes. We left half the stuff there. And we took off from my hometown,

69
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.050
my 90 miles away. But within 15 men, within a half hour of that phone call,

70
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.090
I was in the backseat.

71
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.370
And there was a lot of trauma going on in that front seat. And I said to my dad,

72
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.390
dad, I may know something about this. I don't know for sure,

73
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:38.890
but I may. And he, you know, he overreacted, he slammed the car.

74
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:43.000
The brakes on the car got out of the car, came around, opened the door,

75
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.700
pulled me out, slammed me against the door. What do you mean?

76
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:47.140
You may know something about it.

77
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.450
And then I told him the story about the two weeks before that me walking

78
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:55.570
to school with a neighbor kid and what he had said,

79
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.480
and he just hugged me and throw me back in the car.

80
00:04:58.481 --> 00:04:59.950
And we stopped at the next town,

81
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:03.010
which is about 15 miles later and went into the police station.

82
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.600
And we told the police what had happened as far as, uh,

83
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.880
sister daughter getting murdered the night before. And we were on our way there.

84
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:15.220
But, but this,

85
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.510
my kid told me a story that I think if you could help me as soon as possible.

86
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.600
So they called a head to the Waterloo police department,

87
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:25.690
the Waterloo police located, he was at work

88
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.790
sacking groceries the next day in a grocery store. And so they,

89
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.450
and he'd actually admitted right there that he did it, you know, after they,

90
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.070
they, they got him. But the thing is, what's, it's amazing is

91
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.760
this guy. And then he escaped from prison after about 20. He was only 16.

92
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:50.440
He went to got life in penitentiary, you know, and, uh, and, uh,

93
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.850
he escaped and that pretty much doomed him ever getting out.

94
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.480
And, uh, then cause he was out for a month before they, they caught him.

95
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:01.220
And he actually in the trial,

96
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.620
he was so mad about getting sentenced to life in prison that he pointed to

97
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.970
the Gable family and on the way out, and he said he was gonna kill us all.

98
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.610
And uh, so anyway,

99
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.860
this guy goes to prison and uh, he lives in,

100
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.950
he dies in prison after he broke out and he never really got a chance to ever

101
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:29.840
let him out. But here's the thing. So it's just about, oh, I don't know,

102
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.020
say it's seven, eight years ago when he passed away,

103
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.400
but where we got another cabin now it's about 30 miles north of the cabin.

104
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:38.180
That was,

105
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.740
we were in that time and that was a rental cabin S torn down now and we go right

106
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:43.790
by that place.

107
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.980
So we're going right by that place. Actually, I'd been at weed.

108
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.200
Me and my wife had been at our cabin that my mom and dad owned and they,

109
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.890
that I inherited when they passed on, but we were at that cancer, uh,

110
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.810
cabinet and we were coming home and we're going right by the spot where that

111
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:07.280
payphone was and where we had learned about her death.

112
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.100
And as a cell phone call,

113
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.230
it's the warden of the prison he's in.

114
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.450
I think it was Indiana. He was in Indiana, the prison.

115
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.940
And the warden told me

116
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.600
that the guy that murdered your sister just died

117
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.970
the exact same spot where I learned of the murder I was driving by.

118
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:36.120
And it's 130 minutes off,

119
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.290
about 150 miles from whilst actually a lot further than that.

120
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.870
So it's like spooky. It's like real spooky.

121
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:45.770
And then what what's really amazing is what he said to me, the warden,

122
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.090
he said before he died,

123
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.300
he was seeing a counselor and a concert told me this, that he said, you know,

124
00:07:56.301 --> 00:08:00.830
I really sh I, he repented. He said, I really shouldn't have,

125
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.420
I feel bad about killing Diane Gable. I mean,

126
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:09.440
this is years later. Uh, uh, but that he had told,

127
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.500
and he had been rehabbed somewhat. And he goes,

128
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.970
and the reason why he said, I knew I was going to kill somebody, but he said,

129
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.300
because she was such a nice girl,

130
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.330
you know, oh my God. He said, he knew he was going to kill somebody. He said,

131
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.300
he'd knew he was gonna kill somebody. Just, it was just who he was.

132
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.110
And they told me that. And, and, you know,

133
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.600
I cried for an hour and got a lot out of me,

134
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.480
but you know,

135
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.370
as bad as my dad felt, my mom felt and,

136
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.720
you know, I felt probably it,

137
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.100
I kind of got rid of a lot of hatred when, when he told me that,

138
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.200
that he admitted that she was such a nice girl, that he shouldn't have done it.

139
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.700
And it was, you know, probably not too full for her.

140
00:09:01.701 --> 00:09:03.360
He probably did it on his death bed or something,

141
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:06.600
but he probably had all these guilt, but, but you know, it helped me too.

142
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.970
And it helped me because even though I,

143
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.770
I cried for an hour and I think the stuff you build up

144
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:15.990
inside you, sometimes you just,

145
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.540
you don't know what it's going to take to get it, get it out of you.

146
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.910
And I think that really helped me with my situation

147
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:28.260
because you always feel a little guilty because of maybe you could have saved

148
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:30.150
her life. But, but more than that,

149
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.040
it's been something that I based my whole life on to, uh,

150
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.900
just communication. I mean, this is your business communication. I mean,

151
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:43.800
there's, um, sometimes my wife's tells me, I'm telling her too much, you know,

152
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:46.320
you don't need to tell me, you know, we don't need to talk about this. I said,

153
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:50.250
yeah, I do hi to, you know, I need to talk about, it's not just that.

154
00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:52.020
It's just anything that there's crops up.

155
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.850
I need to go home and I need to have a conversation with somebody

156
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.020
that I, that I, I like and love. And, um,

157
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.280
to be able to see whether I'm doing the right thing or I'm not doing the right

158
00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:05.880
thing.
