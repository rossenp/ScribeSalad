00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.560
I want to talk to you about the story of the crystal skulls themselves,

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.120
cause there's this strange sort of a folklore attached to them.

4
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:15.810
And then there's a lot of people that believe that it's all horseshit and that

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.820
these were created by modern people and buried underground in order to

6
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.220
my understanding.

7
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.000
<v 1>Of it. Uh, is there you go? Yeah, indeed. That's just as the citrus model,</v>

8
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.050
the crystal driver, um, there were 13 heads and, uh,

9
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.050
and it was reported that the Navajo, the Anasazi, the Mayans,

10
00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:36.890
the Aztec ha each had one, uh, the most famous one is the, uh,

11
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:37.820
the Mitchell hedges skull,

12
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:40.820
which was found in the Yucatan by Anna Mitchell hedges. He reached into a cave.

13
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:44.360
She was with her grandfather and was around 1926 and she reached in and there

14
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.270
was an oil cloth covered, uh,

15
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.370
item in there and she pulled it out and opened it up.

16
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:53.300
And there was the two piece detachable jaw, Mitchell hedges, skull,

17
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.290
beautiful sculpture.

18
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.350
The Hewlett Packard engineers did a test on it in the sixties.

19
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.420
They said it could not have been carved by a lapidary by my

20
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:07.090
tools. It had to have been polished over hundreds of years over, uh,

21
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:09.620
over centuries to get to the shape that it was.

22
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:12.680
So they said it was a polished item. Uh, let's see.

23
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:16.130
There's the Mitchell had just called the Phyllis Newman skull and named max.

24
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:16.940
She says.

25
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.520
<v 0>Later decided by some people, but this was not.</v>

26
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.870
<v 1>I'm going to, I'm going to exactly get to that point because of course it's,</v>

27
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.800
it's important. It doesn't affect my business, whether they're fake or not.

28
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:30.290
These were beautiful artifacts and we've recreated it beautifully,

29
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:32.000
but it's nice to know the true story. And I,

30
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.730
I have a kind of a thought on the theory either way.

31
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.400
So there's the Phyllis Newman skull named max.

32
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:41.270
She has to put it in the closet cause it talks to her. There's one hit.

33
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.080
<v 0>The brakes, hit the brakes, a bunch of you. You're an excellent talker, sir. Uh.</v>

34
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.810
<v 1>Well, I, you know, I was inoculated with a gramophone needle at birth.</v>

35
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.290
I could talk a taxi dispatcher and a vow of silence.

36
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:52.940
I could talk an air raid siren to scrap.

37
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.290
<v 0>And you're obviously Canadian. Cause you said slag. Yeah,</v>

38
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.520
I see Canadian gal. She loved the tall, well.

39
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.030
<v 1>That's another tangent Canadian gals and Canadian guys. Uh,</v>

40
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:08.510
so the Philip Newman, Newman, skull, she, she got it's name is max.

41
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:10.850
She has to put it in the closet because it talks to her. She said,

42
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:14.060
so this is the Mitchell hedges. Yes she does. Phyllis has that one.

43
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.260
Then there's the, uh, there's is the Mitchell hedges skull that's in Indiana.

44
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.410
Um, the woman, the man that took care of Anna at the end of her life, uh,

45
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.620
eventually had it and got it. Uh, it sat in Grafton,

46
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:26.480
Ontario for many years and I never saw it,

47
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:29.930
but people said when they walked into the room and she covered it with the

48
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:32.060
cloth, she kept it in that, uh,

49
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.690
there was an immediate feeling of well-being and healing coming over to look at

50
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:38.840
the, at the original Mitchell. How just skull there's one in Mexico city.

51
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.100
It's one of like one of our minis.

52
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.670
It's got a cross stuck right in the top of it, which is, you know,

53
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.340
that would shatter crystal if you did that, how that cross got there?

54
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:51.280
I don't know. Um, there are, uh, there's one at the Smithsonian in Washington,

55
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.240
uh, two at the Smithsonian, Washington DC,

56
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:56.670
and one at the Victoria and Albert museum. So, uh, that's,

57
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.980
that's supposed to be eight that we have in five that we're missing. Um,

58
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.170
the woman that Smithsonian who has the two there, I think it's,

59
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.130
they're a cloudy orange one and a cloudy green one on their smaller.

60
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.170
She says they're all fakes that they were carved by a German lapidary in the 18

61
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:14.410
hundreds and that he seated them around the world. Well, wait a minute.

62
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.420
I think one was found in Tibet. One was found in Ohio,

63
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:21.370
we're hearing at the serpent mountains.

64
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.840
<v 0>Why does she think this one gentleman did.</v>

65
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.650
<v 1>He, because he was an expert lapidary he had the tools to do it.</v>

66
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:31.630
And she figures her theory is that they're not artifacts polished by tribal,

67
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.250
uh, hands and passed down that they're all fakes, but it's just wait a minute.

68
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.150
He would have had to have without an Airship to go and deposit these wherever

69
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:43.570
they might be around the world. Um, and uh,

70
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.520
you can get the pictures of the skulls up to Smithsonian crystal heads, uh, and,

71
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.500
uh, soleus crystal had, you can get in Victoria, Albert, crystal head, do.

72
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.350
<v 0>They all have the same similar type of markings, right?</v>

73
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.920
<v 1>There's the there's there's uh, yes. Yes they do. They do.</v>

74
00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:03.540
They all have the same. Now you see, some of them are more, um, are clearer.

75
00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:06.540
See, there's one at the, uh, the, the, uh, the British museum.

76
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.630
And there's some that are clear and they're more beautiful.

77
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.390
And there's some that are refer like that one there and the,

78
00:04:12.391 --> 00:04:14.850
and the green and the orange one, but she says all fakes.

79
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:16.260
But if they're all fixed,

80
00:04:16.261 --> 00:04:18.300
how did they get to these different places around the world?

81
00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:20.250
And how were they found? Well.

82
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.790
<v 0>Here's the, here's the thing, but what,</v>

83
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:25.980
why fake the word fake is very strange because it's like,

84
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:29.160
they are certainly real carved crystal skulls.

85
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.710
<v 1>So where are they from tribal ancestry? That's the question.</v>

86
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.320
<v 0>Is the question who made the modern Western anyhow.</v>

87
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.360
<v 1>Were they polished or were they carved?</v>

88
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:38.100
That's the thing aren't they beautiful old guy.

89
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.410
<v 0>What did the indigenous people say? They said they found them.</v>

90
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.160
<v 1>But Jose, they came from the star children that they,</v>

91
00:04:43.161 --> 00:04:47.940
they were brought down and deposited and given to them as crystal ball devices,

92
00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:48.840
scrying devices.

93
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.010
<v 0>Too. The one down there,</v>

94
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:52.980
Jamie keeps scrolling where you were the one on the left right there.

95
00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:55.350
That looks more, almost like a real skull, right?

96
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.850
<v 1>Oh yeah. No, the green is beautiful. So, so I guess, I don't know.</v>

97
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.670
I'm not a scientist. I'm not a professional historian.

98
00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:05.610
I guess I have to trust the lady at the Smithsonian, but then I questioned,

99
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.460
they were found at different times in history, around the world.

100
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.100
How do you go and seed how you deposit them there?

101
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.750
<v 0>Why does she believe that?</v>

102
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:15.690
Has she given a coherent reason why she thinks that they're all hoaxes?

103
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.050
<v 1>Yes, she's done her analysis, whatever they've done, you know,</v>

104
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.310
to through their skulls. But again,

105
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:22.980
the Hewlett Packard engineers took that Mitchell had just skull and they,

106
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.530
they said this cannot be, have not been polished.

107
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:28.620
It would have been cracked or destroyed. It could not have been built by tools.

108
00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:32.070
It would have been cracked or destroyed it. It had to have been polished. Hmm.

109
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.030
Yeah. So.

110
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.310
<v 0>But what about some sort of a, uh,</v>

111
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.140
very fast moving drill with a diamond bid on it that can slowly grind

112
00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:41.280
down? Well, that.

113
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.120
<v 1>Would be, then that would be them. There'd be marks that would be visible, uh,</v>

114
00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:46.620
under, under the scanner they put.

115
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.780
<v 0>Couldn't you Polish those marks down. I don't.</v>

116
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.400
<v 1>I think that the intensity of this,</v>

117
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.570
of the Hewlett Packard scrutiny revealed that there were none of those marks and

118
00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:55.440
that's why they were able.

119
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.580
<v 0>To make their claims. Here's the problem with is like, you want them.</v>

120
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.200
<v 1>To be real, right? Don't you? Oh yeah.</v>

121
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.870
<v 0>I do too. I do too, but I don't trust me. So neither do I.</v>

122
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:10.820
So when you're saying all these things, I want to believe you. I want,

123
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:12.710
I want them to be from the sky people.

124
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.590
<v 1>I do too. But again, you know,</v>

125
00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:17.830
you've got a professional in Washington at our national museum there who says,

126
00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:18.160
no.

127
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.880
<v 0>They're not, but what does she know? Well, we could forget her name.</v>

128
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:25.450
We should get her the, get her on the phone. It might be a party pooper. Well,

129
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.500
I.

130
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.410
<v 1>Think that she's probably as in LA and in love with the skulls,</v>

131
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.350
even though they are, you know, not polished it in her mind.

132
00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:33.820
I bet she loves him as much as we do.

133
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.601
<v 0>But the thing is,</v>

134
00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:38.350
if you are a professional intellectual or someone as a curator of, you know,

135
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.170
fine artwork and ancient relics,

136
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.060
you kind of have to be one of those people that dismisses anything preposterous.

137
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.720
Because if not like Neil Tyson, don't you love him. Yes. I love him.

138
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.860
I love Neil love him, but.

139
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.600
<v 1>There's no way you can sit down and say,</v>

140
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.350
Neil Barney and Betty Hill were abducted by a flying saucer in 1957.

141
00:06:56.351 --> 00:07:00.610
He's not going to accept that because he can't accept that because everything in

142
00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:02.770
his training, everything in his knowledge,

143
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.070
everything that he knows about physics and science and propulsion in the

144
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:11.050
universe and how to get from place to place defies, um,

145
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.850
the, uh, defies the legend, or I would say defies the theory that there are,

146
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.420
uh, extra terrestrial, advanced ships out there, he can't accept it. It's just,

147
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.530
you know, he, it would be unprofessional for him to say, okay,

148
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:26.020
there's even a possibility that there were abductions, but.

149
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.170
<v 0>Barney Hill's story is very interesting, but there's,</v>

150
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.730
there's no real evidence other than their testimony. Is that correct?

151
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.590
<v 1>Well, uh, there was a stain on Betty's dress. There's her excellent recall.</v>

152
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.860
She was not, he was unconscious on her dress. It's so interesting.

153
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.180
It was a fluid that they used, uh, in, in, in the testing that, uh,

154
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.450
some kind of a fluid of chemical testing that they did. One,

155
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.350
they drew over from her and they drew sperm from him now.

156
00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:57.490
So there's a book out called contact by Stanton Friedman or read that. Yeah.

157
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.150
And Kathleen, yeah. I'd love to know where the car is, where they, the, the,

158
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:05.230
the Chevy that we're driving or aware of here. I don't know.

159
00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:08.270
I'd have to ask Kathleen where it is. Did they get it ended up in a junk yard?

160
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.450
Cause there were marks on the back of the car as well.

161
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.600
There were trace evidence in the back of the car. You know, Ted Phillips is,

162
00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:15.730
he goes around the world, collecting,

163
00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:19.420
trace out of evidence and radioactive signatures from sightings and, and, uh,

164
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.870
and landings on the back of the car. There was a couple of marks,

165
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:25.000
but it was Betty's, it's their credibility.

166
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:27.310
Why would they want to bring this into their lives?

167
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:32.230
And she was conscious semiconscious through much of it. And, uh, Barney was not,

168
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.270
uh, uh, conscious. He was unconscious.

169
00:08:34.271 --> 00:08:38.590
If you hear the tapes of Ben Simon's interviews with them under hypnosis,

170
00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:42.370
the screaming and the, and the heat was just so frightened and that, and the,

171
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.770
and the Zeta reticular map, when, when a little,

172
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:46.500
the being Betty looked at the map and,

173
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.970
and the being showed her a map and she was on her way out the door.

174
00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:51.970
And she said, may I take this? And the being was going to give it to her,

175
00:08:51.971 --> 00:08:56.160
but then another one zipped up and said, no, I think I can't have this.

176
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.920
<v 0>Particular is exactly the same place where Bob Lasar says they found those,</v>

177
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.000
uh, with the spaceships that they have at area or S-corps. Well, the.

178
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.900
<v 1>Little Zaida particularly Barney and Betty's abduction,</v>

179
00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:11.360
you had Marjorie fish anatomy, amateur astronomer.

180
00:09:11.361 --> 00:09:14.900
She took the memory of Betty's, uh, Betty drew up the star map,

181
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.410
and she did a three-dimensional scale model of,

182
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.460
of that part of the universe and was able to identify Zeta particularly one and

183
00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:23.980
two and accepted by astronomers.

184
00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:28.280
So that map that Betty saw a board of that ship had not been seen on, uh,

185
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.210
on earth before.

186
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.710
<v 0>He has no history of astronomy. No, no studying it. Nope.</v>

187
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.540
<v 1>None of it at all. And, and, and, you know,</v>

188
00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:40.280
interesting things like when they got back to the, the house there, uh, there,

189
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.760
there,

190
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.080
the house was open and the keys to the house were in on the table with leaves so

191
00:09:45.081 --> 00:09:49.460
that they might've dropped them at the site. And the beings returned them. Now,

192
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.860
Yuma who had about Hopkins was yes.

193
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.930
He said that since he studied the Linda Cortez case where the woman was floated

194
00:09:56.931 --> 00:10:00.170
out of her apartment, building over the east river and orange or picked her up.

195
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.110
<v 0>Bud was an artist.</v>

196
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.500
<v 1>He was a graphic artist. He was a designer, a painter and a lovely man.</v>

197
00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:09.500
And he was one of the first people to start to deal with the trauma of

198
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:13.460
abductees. He, they, they, he got a reputation for being able to interview them,

199
00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:14.271
hypnotize them,

200
00:10:14.271 --> 00:10:17.660
interview them and get their stories and empathize and sympathize with them.

201
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.330
And he said that in some cases that he studied,

202
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.280
the beings would grab a man from somewhere in America and grab a woman

203
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.480
and out of their cars, out of their clothes, put them up, test them,

204
00:10:29.481 --> 00:10:31.970
draw all about Ross, sperm, fluids, whatever they were doing.

205
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:37.370
And then the woman would wake up in the man's shoes or a different

206
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:40.130
car, or almost as if the beings were finished with them.

207
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.310
I don't care where they go. Now I put them, put them back, you know,

208
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.710
that kind of thing. He said, that was the oddest phenomena,

209
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.710
like releasing a trout. Yeah, that's right. Well, that's.

210
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:49.500
<v 0>Such a trout.</v>

211
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.610
You can catch a big rainbow trout and your fly fishing and you get a barbless

212
00:10:52.611 --> 00:10:56.150
hook. You know, most people, if you go to Montana, go to the Gallatin river,

213
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.960
shout out to the gala, beautiful, gorgeous place. People catch and release.

214
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.060
Cause they, they appreciate that the trout are there.

215
00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:05.960
They'd rather go by halibut from a store and not eat the fish because they want

216
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.540
this, the salmon to be healthy. They want the trout to be healthy.

217
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.470
So they catch them and then they release them. But if you're a brown, well,

218
00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.600
brown trout are invasive. But if you're a SA Euro,

219
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.320
you're a rainbow trout and someone catches you and you know,

220
00:11:18.321 --> 00:11:22.700
they take you on some 200 yard, run down this river.

221
00:11:22.701 --> 00:11:23.840
As they're trying to draw you in,

222
00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:27.410
it's a big nine pound rainbow catch of a lifetime right. Full time.

223
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.960
And some guy pulls it on. It takes pictures of it,

224
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.530
like shows it and then releases it. And then this thing's like,

225
00:11:33.531 --> 00:11:36.620
how the did I get here? What am I doing outside of my universe?

226
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.790
What am I doing in this other dimension of air where I can't breathe? Precisely.

227
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.700
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's what I that's catching the lease.</v>

228
00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:46.010
Lease with people. Travis Walton says, you know,

229
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.100
you've got to think of them as just people from over there.

230
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.160
<v 0>Well, God, the fire in the sky movie was based on,</v>

231
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.680
he's got another interesting story.

232
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.190
<v 1>That I want people at ability there and credibility with Barney and Betty.</v>

233
00:11:57.191 --> 00:12:00.720
I just don't think they're lying. And I don't think the aerial school, I don't.

234
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.570
<v 0>Want to think they're lying. This is the problem that I have with it.</v>

235
00:12:03.571 --> 00:12:07.170
I want to believe them, but this is what I want people to consider.

236
00:12:07.171 --> 00:12:09.030
Because most people that are pragmatic,

237
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.370
reasonable people that don't want to be ridiculed.

238
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.250
They look at these stories and then go, oh, come on. People are full of.

239
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:19.350
And I've been there too. But I want, I want people to imagine that if,

240
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.430
if aliens did a CA occasionally visit earth,

241
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.463
what,

242
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.940
how often do you think this would take place and how it would be very

243
00:12:29.941 --> 00:12:32.990
infrequently? And if it was, if it was happening,

244
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.830
these would be completely unique,

245
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.240
unusual occurrences out of nowhere where someone would come down,

246
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.410
they would do something and they would be leaving the person with this thought

247
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.520
in this memory and this inability to describe it with normal words,

248
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.080
if you were taking a board of spaceship and you were some reptilian beings that

249
00:12:52.081 --> 00:12:55.860
were three feet tall were running experiments on you and you were paralyzed,

250
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.870
and then they released you back on earth. How,

251
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.610
what words do you have available to you to describe this experience in a way

252
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.270
that like, if you tell me, Hey Joe, I, uh, I, uh,

253
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.560
went white water rafting with my kids. It was a great time.

254
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.580
It was so fun. We got to see Eagles and it was, it was gorgeous.

255
00:13:14.581 --> 00:13:18.180
Then we had lunch at this beautiful little cafe. What a great day.

256
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.530
I can envision this experience. I can see it. But if you tell me, Hey man,

257
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.500
we went camping and I woke up and some alien had a finger in my.

258
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.500
<v 1>Allagash, the Allagash incident. They went camping and they, they were,</v>

259
00:13:28.501 --> 00:13:32.100
they just hear those right. There's hundreds of thousands. And here, this is,

260
00:13:32.101 --> 00:13:34.530
I brought you a book. This is a Bruce Maccabees book.

261
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.190
It's all the headlines from 1950 to 432 reports given.

262
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.890
And I'll address your specific question about people,

263
00:13:40.891 --> 00:13:42.780
how they relate to their experiences and,

264
00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:45.360
and how genuine they feel in a second here,

265
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:50.220
432 reports given the air force in 1952 on aerial siting ships from other

266
00:13:50.221 --> 00:13:53.760
planet, we've got memory members memos from the government here.

267
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.080
A former army pilot sees flying saucer by daylight. Whatever was cited here,

268
00:13:58.081 --> 00:14:00.330
July 30 stories, fighter pilots at Newcastle,

269
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.030
sail alert for more saucer reports. These are newspaper.

270
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.590
<v 0>Yeah, that's yours. So newspapers never lie. Well, Bible, if you know that,</v>

271
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.980
well, they never, they never make fake stories. They never talk

272
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.410
pretty.

273
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.730
<v 1>Reliable. Ralph Blumenthal and Leslie keener reporters for the New York times.</v>

274
00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:20.670
And they've been studying this phenomenon they've report.

275
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.210
We're very credibly on it. I'll tell you how an abductor,

276
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.480
these experiences related.

277
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.860
I attended a lecture at the, uh,

278
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.240
fifth avenue medical Institute in Manhattan with my wife a few years ago.

279
00:14:33.241 --> 00:14:36.660
That would be about 15 years ago. And John Mack was the lecturer. You know,

280
00:14:36.661 --> 00:14:37.770
he wrote the book abduction.

281
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.160
He was the Harvard psychiatrist who wrote a abduction.

282
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.950
You can get that up to abduction, John Mack.

283
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.340
<v 0>Yes. I've read that as well. And that freaked a friend of mine out.</v>

284
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:52.130
She was a very pragmatic non UFO believing person. And she came,

285
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.760
we were working together on news radio, my friend, Maura Tierney. And she, uh,

286
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.580
came up to me and she goes like, this book is freaking me the out.

287
00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:01.310
And he wrote a second book as well. Didn't he die in a car accident.

288
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.450
<v 1>John Mac, I believe he died in a car accident, off a curb in,</v>

289
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.050
um, in, in a, in a small town in England.

290
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:16.240
And he was struck by a car and three other John max died the same day in

291
00:15:16.241 --> 00:15:17.280
England. So.

292
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.940
<v 0>So Pete think people were whacking John max cause he to, I don't know, again,</v>

293
00:15:21.941 --> 00:15:23.350
I was, I was at this lecture.

294
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:28.840
<v 1>And there were 300 abductor teas there that did some of who we</v>

295
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.640
interviewed with some, some he had not,

296
00:15:30.641 --> 00:15:33.910
but who were there for interested to find out a bit more about their experience.

297
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.550
And one guy got up and said he had one arm.

298
00:15:36.551 --> 00:15:38.080
And I don't know whether that was related.

299
00:15:38.081 --> 00:15:39.880
I don't think it was related to the experience, but he said,

300
00:15:39.881 --> 00:15:43.180
I'm a wall street broker. I'm quite well off. I have a sailboat.

301
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.620
I was in long island sound a few years ago and a blue light hit me.

302
00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.590
And I had missing time of about five or six hours.

303
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.410
But in it I have filter filtrated memories of beings addressing me and telling

304
00:15:56.411 --> 00:15:59.500
me that I was powerful and influential and I could help the planet survive.

305
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:04.570
And they put me back in my ship and I woke up and, and, and, and he said,

306
00:16:04.571 --> 00:16:06.610
I'm waiting for them to come back. I want them to come back.

307
00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:09.670
And I asked the room, I got up. And I said, of all of you who've been taken.

308
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:10.870
How many of you would,

309
00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:13.240
would want to repeat the experience or have it happen again?

310
00:16:13.241 --> 00:16:15.790
And about half of them said, no, no way. They'd want it to have it.

311
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.230
I have it happen again. And a half said, yeah, we'd like to have half yeah.

312
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.850
Half. Yeah. Yeah. Now I love Bruce too.

313
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.890
And I'm going to give it to you. And it's just got great.

314
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.710
It's got great headlines from the, you know, from the fifties,

315
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.350
which was a massive time for saucers, you know,

316
00:16:32.351 --> 00:16:36.670
that famous photo of the saucers over the, uh, the Capitol, the glowing lights.

317
00:16:36.671 --> 00:16:37.504
And.

318
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:41.380
<v 0>See if you can find that photo of July, 1952.</v>

319
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.790
<v 1>Washington, do you think.</v>

320
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:47.740
<v 0>This was initiated by the detonation of the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and</v>

321
00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:51.760
Nagasaki, where they decided, okay, these monkeys are doing some stupid.

322
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.360
We need to go down there and see what's up and see if there's eminent danger to

323
00:16:55.361 --> 00:16:58.510
the cosmos. Let's find out what kind of capabilities they have,

324
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:04.000
because if you listen to Lasar or if you believe the work of Zechariah Cichon

325
00:17:04.001 --> 00:17:07.870
or any of the people that believe that human beings were engineered,

326
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.810
that there's the,

327
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.600
the reason why this is giant leap between us and the rest of the primates on the

328
00:17:13.601 --> 00:17:18.250
planet is because something came down and manipulated our

329
00:17:18.251 --> 00:17:19.510
genetics. Well, the.

330
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.170
<v 1>Movie mission to Mars with Tim Robbins, you know, basically it says that,</v>

331
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.510
you know, basically it spits, shows the face on Mars,

332
00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:30.010
and that is one of NASA employees. Favorite movies? Yeah, there they are. Yeah.

333
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.260
1952, a four incident. Thank you very.

334
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.480
<v 0>Much. Beautiful.</v>

335
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.120
<v 1>Come on. Let's go here now. Yeah,</v>

336
00:17:37.121 --> 00:17:39.580
that ain't an airplane that ain't a helicopter. Now.

337
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.340
<v 0>I'm crazy photograph. And it's from 1952. I mean the,</v>

338
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:46.500
the special effects back then were incredibly crude. No,

339
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.210
this was something that was reported by people.

340
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.440
<v 1>They've they scrambled jets from, from Andrews for it. And everything.</v>

341
00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.530
<v 0>Was the Phoenix lights. It was the mix lights is fascinating.</v>

342
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.580
<v 1>Because, you know, um, the five Simonton, the governor said he saw them.</v>

343
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:00.870
He made fun of it with an alien.

344
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.200
<v 0>Talked about that afterwards.</v>

345
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:07.790
He was put on the pressure to do so he's in a movie called what is it? Um,

346
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.870
there's a, there's a documentary on Netflix. It's available that he's in, um,

347
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.710
that he talks about the pressure that they put on him to make light of that

348
00:18:15.711 --> 00:18:18.950
incident. And he talks about his own personal experiences with seeing something,

349
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.890
some sort of triangle-shaped craft that was enormous,

350
00:18:21.891 --> 00:18:24.590
the size of several football fields. It was flying overhead.

351
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.010
That was completely silent and how it freaked him out. But triangle.

352
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.370
<v 1>The triangle and doubt Delta crafts are very, very interesting, but, uh,</v>

353
00:18:31.371 --> 00:18:35.090
the Tinley park incidents of the, uh, of the eighties, uh, and, uh,

354
00:18:35.091 --> 00:18:37.970
with Sam Aranta was the investigator there from you fund.

355
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.200
These things would park over the family, barbecue for about half an hour.

356
00:18:42.201 --> 00:18:44.960
And you know, families in suburbs were looking up to them,

357
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.660
the sky being blotted out by these things, parking above them.

358
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:53.390
So I think it comes down to they, I don't think these beings,

359
00:18:53.391 --> 00:18:53.930
I, well,

360
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.770
Lord hill Norton said there were 23 different species visiting the planet in 23

361
00:18:57.771 --> 00:18:58.640
different types of ships.

362
00:18:58.641 --> 00:19:01.280
I don't think they want a formal relationship with people on earth.

363
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.980
They want an informal secret relationship.

364
00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:06.340
I think they probably have one with elements of the,

365
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.840
of black elements of the air force and the government, you know,

366
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:12.010
David's Sarita is I've heard is David Serena. You should have him on,

367
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.470
he's very knowledgeable about this. Uh, he,

368
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:18.200
his history is that the Roswell event may have been precipitated by the Trinity

369
00:19:18.201 --> 00:19:22.130
explosion at because it was such an interdimensional disturbance of the atoms

370
00:19:22.131 --> 00:19:26.240
being split. And that explosion that was there was that,

371
00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:29.540
that saucer there that went down in 47 may have,

372
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.470
may have been influenced somehow negatively by, by that explosion. Now,

373
00:19:33.471 --> 00:19:35.990
Stanton Friedman doesn't didn't buy that. I love Stanton.

374
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.300
He just passed away there. He was the expert on Roswell.

375
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.840
<v 0>I'm upset that I never got to meet him before he died. He was so credible,</v>

376
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.410
interesting guy who believed in UFO's, but believe most people were not,

377
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.490
were lying about them.

378
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.460
<v 1>Uh, really, really well.</v>

379
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.090
<v 0>He believed that there was a lot of horse going on, including what those are.</v>

380
00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.480
He thought Bibles are, was full of. Well.

381
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.840
<v 1>I, again, why would, why would Bob go out there and do that and, and,</v>

382
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.230
and compromise his life.

383
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.041
<v 0>Right. Let me tell you something.</v>

384
00:20:01.041 --> 00:20:03.770
After talking to him for three hours and then to have dinner with him the night

385
00:20:03.771 --> 00:20:06.320
before my, I don't have, I don't,

386
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.470
I used to believe I had the best meter in the world, but as I've gotten older,

387
00:20:09.471 --> 00:20:13.670
I've gotten more honest. And, uh, I, I don't,

388
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.070
I didn't see anything. He's,

389
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:21.200
he's incredibly smart guy and he's not a guy who's like seeking out attention

390
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.770
and he's not profiting from this and his demeanor and everything.

391
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.350
<v 1>Jesus, he's like an accountant. He's a legitimate.</v>

392
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.140
<v 0>Scientist. Yeah. I mean, and I've talked to him, uh,</v>

393
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.080
one of the things that I engaged him with when we had dinner,

394
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.100
we talked about science, just science in general.

395
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.760
And we talked about all sorts of different things. And, um,

396
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.120
and he's a scientist, he's a legit scientist. I've talked to a lot of them.

397
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.490
I know what kind of person he is. He's a, it just.

398
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.670
<v 1>Hassled them again. There they read it as is, is nuclear. Isotope.</v>

399
00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.130
<v 0>Has one 15. That's what they think. Wouldn't we all love to have that. Yeah.</v>

400
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.850
That's what they think. That's some artists created that thing up there.

401
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.160
Element one 15 element.

402
00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.780
<v 1>Dean, indeed. Well, if you get a little sliver of that, that'd be,</v>

403
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.153
it'd be pretty exciting.

404
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.133
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

405
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:08.730
Talked openly about it in the nineties that he had managed to weasel some away

406
00:21:08.731 --> 00:21:12.930
from the area S four. And they think that he still has it. Yeah.

407
00:21:12.931 --> 00:21:15.090
There was some experiments that he had done that, um,

408
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.770
George Knapp had actually filmed that it showed some really bizarre distortions

409
00:21:19.771 --> 00:21:23.370
using this stuff. And then it was able to, it was, it was,

410
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.970
I got to remember exactly what it did that they show,

411
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.910
but they did some experience with like steam or smoke or something like that,

412
00:21:29.911 --> 00:21:34.710
where they showed element one 15, emitting some sort of, um, vapor.

413
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:35.641
Well, no,

414
00:21:35.641 --> 00:21:40.050
it was emitting some sort of a field where you literally couldn't physically

415
00:21:40.051 --> 00:21:41.040
touch this stuff.
