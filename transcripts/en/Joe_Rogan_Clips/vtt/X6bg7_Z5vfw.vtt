00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.600
<v 1>Right now, one of the things that came up real recently was, uh,</v>

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.560
this Jordan Peterson interview with vice which, uh,

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.440
in my opinion, especially when you look at the sound clip, uh,

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.920
they were talking about women in the workplace and women wearing makeup and high

6
00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:23.350
heels and things in the workplace. And I know Jordan very well.

7
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.790
I love him. He's a great guy. He came off aggressive there and I don't know why.

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.110
I don't think, I dunno if he's tired of it or if he's digging his heels in,

9
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.350
I mean, he's, it.

10
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.030
<v 2>Was apparently part of a two hour interview. Yes.</v>

11
00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:35.990
Which he kind of felt like he was on the ropes the whole time.

12
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.870
<v 1>Yes. And he also was coming off of that big Kathy Newman interview in the UK,</v>

13
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.540
which was like a, a assault. I mean, the whole thing was just crazy,

14
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.660
but he came out ahead on that and I think, um, there's,

15
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.090
there's,

16
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.580
it's much easier to make the argument that he didn't come out ahead in the vice

17
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.780
thing. Yeah. Especially in the way that they, they framed it,

18
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.460
but he was talking about women in the workplace and maybe women shouldn't wear

19
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.370
or makeup in the workplace and maybe they shouldn't wear high heels or dresses.

20
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.030
Um.

21
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.250
<v 2>So he did say maybe, maybe yes. And he didn't,</v>

22
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:14.610
he didn't say women shouldn't do this. The interviewer,

23
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.210
I can't remember his name. King king, J king maybe. Um, said,

24
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.930
so do you think women shouldn't wear makeup in high heels?

25
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.440
&lt;affirmative&gt; and he said maybe, yeah. And it was, you know, he's,

26
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.320
he's thinking he's, he's, he's considering options here.

27
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.920
He's not prepared upon first being asked a question to say yes, absolutely.

28
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.520
Or no, absolutely. This is, you know,

29
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:39.480
this is a sign of a nuanced thinking person. Yes.

30
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.480
Brain in action in real.

31
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.060
<v 1>Time.</v>

32
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.710
The problem with the reaction is the exact problem that you're trying to avoid

33
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:47.830
here, though. When you're saying, I don't wanna get in trouble here, you,

34
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.790
you preface that and then you slowly move forward. Whereas Jordan was like,

35
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:54.950
maybe, well, why are they wearing makeup? What are they doing? Well? And.

36
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.270
<v 2>I, but I, I would say that, you know,</v>

37
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.030
the generous interpretation and the evolutionary interpretation of what he said

38
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.870
was look,

39
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.660
the me too movement is arguing that there should be that there can be no

40
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.660
sexual signals in the workplace at all full stop.

41
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.020
That's not going to be possible because look at how many other sexual signals

42
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:20.980
there are, right makeup heels.

43
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.460
Now the response has been those aren't sexual signal.

44
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.250
I wear heels and I'm not sexually signaling. And, you know,

45
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:32.170
to which the evolutionary response is what heels do is

46
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.770
augment sexual signals that you were born with,

47
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.130
whether or not you are conscious of the fact that that is why you were doing it,

48
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.610
that doesn't make it any less of a sexual signal. Right?

49
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.640
And so what Peterson was saying was if we really are going

50
00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:50.080
to accept the argument that all signals of this type need to be abandoned from,

51
00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:52.120
you know, need to be gotten rid of from the workplace,

52
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.280
then maybe we actually need to investigate all of the other things that are

53
00:02:57.281 --> 00:02:59.200
sexual signals that aren't being talked about right now.

54
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.040
<v 3>So there are a couple things, first of all,</v>

55
00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:06.640
have you seen the clip filmed from the audience of him

56
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.040
talking about what happened with that vice interview? No.

57
00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:13.480
It's well worth your time. I think it's seven or eight minutes, um,

58
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.080
of him talking about what happened. I do think Peterson who I also,

59
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.550
I don't think I know, can you give us cliff notes or what? Yeah.

60
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.270
I mean the cliff notes are, he said, look,

61
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.310
this is how one engages in thought one

62
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.070
advances an idea. It doesn't mean something's going to happen. Right.

63
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.470
I think he literally says,

64
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.830
I didn't say women shouldn't wear makeup in the workplace. I said, maybe,

65
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.140
and this is we do. And then he describes, he says, um,

66
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.103
let's, um,

67
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.330
let's agree that I'm gonna put forward 10 things that might happen and then

68
00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:52.490
let's agree that none of them are going to happen.

69
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.130
So now we can discuss the possibilities.

70
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.970
So I don't think we know what the actual interview with,

71
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.160
with J Kang looked like,

72
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.000
because there was two hours of it and I've seen 15 minutes. Yeah.

73
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.880
Why won't they release more of it? I think they should release the whole thing.

74
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.840
I do think what I saw. So we don't know the context. Right. Which my guess is,

75
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.400
uh, Peterson's pretty careful in what he says.

76
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.800
My guess is the context would be revealing.

77
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.470
I think based on the part that we know that he said,

78
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.510
because it is in the clips that we've seen,

79
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.710
we know something's funny because the editing juxtaposes him seeming to

80
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:33.510
contradict himself. And he's actually pretty careful not to do that. Um,

81
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.110
but what he did actually say contains what I regard as

82
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.380
at least one sign an error. So he says,

83
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.540
uh,

84
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.460
I do think that in response to the question of are women hypocrites

85
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.740
for wearing makeup to work. And then, uh,

86
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.420
I don't want to put words in his mouth, but something like demanding not to be,

87
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.250
uh, harassed, harassed, or something like that.

88
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.650
So he's forgetting that many of these signals aren't conscious in doing that,

89
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.410
not conscious, but you know, I saw somebody online discussing this.

90
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.010
They made a very good 0.1. That's actually pretty hard to field.

91
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.050
If these are signals, even unconscious ones, if they are sexual signals,

92
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.290
why am I wearing one to go to a family reunion?

93
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.760
Am I wearing high heels to go to a family reunion?

94
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.280
Am I secretly trying to get lucky at my own family reunion? Um,

95
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.200
and the answer is, no, this is not a matter what,

96
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:36.280
what Peterson said when you know, Peterson has done so many interviews,

97
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.800
the fact that he says a clumsy thing here,

98
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.280
doesn't strike me one way or the other, but I don't want,

99
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.870
wanna be put in the position of defending that women are hypocritical for

100
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.910
wearing makeup and high heels.

101
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.110
There are lots of reasons that you have to wear them, including social pressure,

102
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.520
including the fact that you are in a landscape of other people wearing

103
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.140
them.

104
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.120
And if you stand out as being plain in a world of other women

105
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.360
who are amplifying these things,

106
00:06:04.361 --> 00:06:06.960
it may actually have implications for your ability to earn.

107
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.400
So there are lots of reasons that you might do it that have nothing to do with

108
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:13.080
you as an individual, trying to signal for sexual attention.

109
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.710
It doesn't mean that those things didn't evolve as sexual signals, right?

110
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:22.510
Sexual signals to us, evolutionary biologists. This is no news. I mean,

111
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.190
if you're a woman and you've got breasts and you're walking around in the world,

112
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.590
you're broadcasting a sexual signal and that one's completely unconscious and

113
00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:31.990
involuntary it's physiological, right?

114
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.790
So the idea that these signals are out there and common should be,

115
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.540
should become some thing we become comfortable with. Um,

116
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.580
the fact that males are involved in all kinds of signaling all the time that you

117
00:06:44.581 --> 00:06:47.380
know, that, uh, the coroner office, the mahogany desk, and you know,

118
00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:49.940
it's not that a woman can't have a corner office in a mahogany desk,

119
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.340
but traditionally speaking those hallmarks of, uh,

120
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.780
stage and resource acquisition, yes,

121
00:06:56.781 --> 00:07:00.050
those things have implication in the sexual landscape.

122
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:02.530
That's very powerful as does frankly humor.

123
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.770
The way humor is used has powerful implications in terms of

124
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.290
sexual signaling, as does, who laughs at your jokes. I mean,

125
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:16.330
if the boss makes a joke, everybody laughs whether or not it's funny.

126
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.600
Why is that he's of power. They're trying to get ahead. Um,

127
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.880
so we can't get rid of all of this. We can't get rid of,

128
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.360
can't get rid of all of this. And if we look at something like, um,

129
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.360
an engagement ring, right,

130
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.240
if you were to analyze an engagement ring anthropologically, right?

131
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.400
So there are these stones, actually,

132
00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:38.950
the truth of it is there these stones that aren't really that rare,

133
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:44.150
but they've been made artificially scarce and a man will get one of

134
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:49.150
these stones and he will put it on a thing that can be put on

135
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.870
a woman's finger and the size of the stone and the quality of the stone.

136
00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:55.310
Even though the stone is not actually useful for very much,

137
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.390
it is symbolically important.

138
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.300
And it is evidence of the woman's worth. In some sense,

139
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.380
in other words, the larger the stone,

140
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.580
it indicates that the man values her at a greater level. I mean,

141
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:10.860
this is an absurd, an absurd set of signals.

142
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.980
And we treat it as if it's just nothing. You know,

143
00:08:13.981 --> 00:08:18.020
woman gets an engagement ring. Maybe if she's traditional, her friends will,

144
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.410
you know, look at it it and say, oh, that's marvelous. I mean,

145
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.330
so we're engaged in all of this archaic signaling anyway.

146
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.610
And when you tune into it, it is very jarring,

147
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:34.410
but it does not make sense to isolate one set of these signals and say, ah,

148
00:08:34.411 --> 00:08:36.170
look, they're signaling, right?

149
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:41.000
Because those signals are embedded in a landscape signals that we go

150
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:45.000
through our entire life, not realizing that we are making.

151
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.000
And the last point I would make is that we also need to recognize that we have a

152
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.400
mismatch between

153
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.440
personal signaling and broadcast signaling.

154
00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:00.000
So it may be that a woman, uh,

155
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.720
wears something in order to catch a particular male's attention.

156
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.080
But the fact that she's wearing it may catch other male's attention.

157
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.000
And that fact may confuse the landscape because, um,

158
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.510
men in may take it as a sign that she's interested in something.

159
00:09:17.511 --> 00:09:21.030
When in fact she's not interested in something she's interested in someone who

160
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:22.230
happens to be in this landscape.

161
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:28.070
So what I hope is that we will recognize that the thing

162
00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:33.070
that we should all agree on is that it is desirable to

163
00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:38.020
