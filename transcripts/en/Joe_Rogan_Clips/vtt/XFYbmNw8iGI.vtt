00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.540
And then you have to the Republicans that they have to stick together. They,

3
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:09.420
especially in this time where, you know,

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.020
look w there I'm not a Republican, but if I was,

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.640
I would be extremely concerned about censorship and social media,

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.720
which is a real thing.

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.710
Censorship of Republican ideas and conservative ideas is absolutely a real

8
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:26.070
thing. And is it's not just real,

9
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:29.760
it's accepted as being the right thing to do by certain organizations. I mean,

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.440
they've been caught on camera and hidden camera talking about the

11
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:38.640
ways that you can silence conservative voices. You know,

12
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:43.320
this is not like these. When you look at sodas, social media platforms,

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.300
they're essentially the best way to get ideas out there, right?

14
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:52.770
It's even better than broadcast news because if you put something on Fox or

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.970
CBS or whatever, how many people are really going to watch it? Is it a thousand,

16
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.980
a million? I mean, how many people watch it,

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.680
but if you have a clip that goes viral,

18
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.840
that clip on YouTube or Twitter, or where a Facebook, wherever,

19
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.870
wherever that could get 30 million people,

20
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:14.430
40 million people way more than is ever going to watch you on television.

21
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:17.130
And they've kind of accepted that on late night television,

22
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.310
like late night television is kind of accepted that what they're looking for is

23
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:22.230
these clips, these moments,

24
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.100
and these clips that almost acts as advertisements for the show. Yeah. You know,

25
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:29.400
where it's James cordon, making people sing in this car,

26
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.090
that kind of to try and get these clips that go viral because the show itself,

27
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.020
I mean,

28
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.570
I don't know how many people are watching a few hundred thousand at the most,

29
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:40.110
right? It's nothing in comparison to a lot of the like,

30
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.770
like what's that guy's name, that's the famous makeup kid that, that he's a,

31
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.040
a gay fellow, James Charles,

32
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.110
that guy's videos on makeup get way more views and anything that happens on Fox

33
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:56.190
news. And that's a fact, yeah. Anything that happens on MSNBC and that's a fact,

34
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.090
okay,

35
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.290
social media is way more potent than anything else when it comes to getting a

36
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:02.124
message out.

37
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.110
And for sure conservatives are being discriminated

38
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:09.360
against, on social media, by social media platforms.

39
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.710
<v 1>Well,</v>

40
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.410
and what's weird about it is that when you think about social media and coming

41
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:16.140
out of Silicon valley, which is famously left wing,

42
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.240
the election was really swung by the internet in Trump's favor. You know,

43
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:25.200
whether or not you want to call them bots that were set up by Russia or whether

44
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.470
or not it was just, they were a well-organized campaign. They just,

45
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.640
they were really smart, very sharp about videos that they put out. They,

46
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:36.330
they have a thing now where they put out a lot of memes that they encourage

47
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.230
people to make memes about. Um, they're all over.

48
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:44.640
Democrats are so far behind the Republicans when it comes to using

49
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.910
using it. But you're right. I mean, if you,

50
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.200
if you ban certain people from Twitter and from YouTube,

51
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.520
that's.

52
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.440
<v 0>That's a. Yes, it is censorship.</v>

53
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.670
And even if you're not banning them from those, if you're shadow, banning them,

54
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.910
if you're making it very difficult for people to find them, which is real,

55
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.700
that's a real thing that you do. They, they, they, you know, the, the,

56
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.450
the way your PO, like, if you have a post on social media,

57
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.930
it doesn't just go up in chronological order anymore.

58
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.970
Now it's affected by an algorithm. So I might see your posts,

59
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:21.520
or I might not see your posts in my feed.

60
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.170
It's dependent upon what I like and what I watch and what I see when I go to

61
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:29.500
search. Like, if you look at my search feed, you know, you see,

62
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.400
you see people beating the out of each other and girls doing squats.

63
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.930
That's like my, my, my search, it's all like, uh, like it's,

64
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.380
it's the most cartoonish version of me possible.

65
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.120
It's all like big bull elk screaming and dudes getting head kicked in a muscle

66
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:50.020
car, doing a burnout. That's my, that's all. Oh, you good?

67
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:54.400
Look at my Instagram search. And that's all affected entirely by this algorithm.

68
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:58.630
That figures out what I like. Yeah. And then also recommends things to me,

69
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.170
like in terms of like, there's a lot of sponsored things on Instagram, like,

70
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.500
Ooh, I could use that. Is that good? Yeah. And I'll have to Google it. I'm good.

71
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.260
And it's because it's targeting me.

72
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.760
It's found me that knows that I search for certain things.

73
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:16.120
I look at certain things. These are the sites that I follow.

74
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.360
These are the things that I interact with. So let's sell them something.

75
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.530
And it does the same with you.

76
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:24.640
And it does the same with Jamie does the same with everybody. So they can,

77
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.860
in certain social media platforms use that algorithm to discriminate so they can

78
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:30.850
decide, Hey,

79
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.130
this guy keeps chirping on and on about a Hillary Clinton's war crimes and

80
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:38.440
all this, we don't need this guy around. Okay.

81
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.210
We don't need this guy and all of his right wing and all his make

82
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:45.460
America great. Again. So we'll shadow ban them.

83
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.050
And so they can shove you into this category where it's very difficult to find

84
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.580
your, um, find your page. And it's very difficult for your to show up.

85
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:58.390
And a lot of people have seen their views dropped drastically.

86
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.690
Their interactions dropped drastically because people aren't seeing their

87
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.910
anymore. Right. Andrew Santino had that happen to him. No. Talk to someone,

88
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.440
talk to someone on the phone that told him he was shadow banned.

89
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.840
And he was like, what does that mean? They're like, well,

90
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:16.720
it was it's because of a post that you made. He goes, well, what post is it?

91
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.550
They wouldn't tell him what post it was.

92
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.370
<v 1>What kind of posts would it have been? Is he political?</v>

93
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.510
<v 0>No. He's like, I'm not political at all, but you know, he's a comic.</v>

94
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:28.420
And he says, ridiculous. And he's a redhead.

95
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.690
And so people would probably like, you know, look at this guy,

96
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.980
this super white looking guy who says a bunch of ridiculous. Get rid of him.

97
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.090
Yeah. Off of his head.

98
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.040
<v 1>Yeah, no, I had this guy weird fella, I think, is his handle on Twitter.</v>

99
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.090
And he used to, he used to say stupid. He was goofy, whatever. He, you know,

100
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:47.530
I would interact with them a little bit.

101
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.120
And then he emailed me at my site to say that he got banned from Twitter.

102
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.600
Remember what? Remember on, uh, uh, Halloween,

103
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:58.430
when a kid showed up at the white and, uh,

104
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.940
Trump and Malani were standing there and Trump put candy on top of the kid's

105
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:04.730
head, instead of canning it to them, it was kinda,

106
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.620
it was like a really ridiculous,

107
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:09.920
like this guy can't even just put candy in the kid's bag.

108
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:13.130
He's got to put it on his head. So it was like thumping. It became a meme.

109
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.170
And this guy just wrote, um, I wish the kid had kicked him in the shins,

110
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.860
thrown off Twitter for saying that.

111
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.290
<v 0>Hm there's a woman named Megan Murphy. She's what's called a turf.</v>

112
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.550
Do you know what a terrific trans exclusionary radical feminist.

113
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.840
And, uh,

114
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.040
she w she is one of those radical feminists that don't believe that a trans

115
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.173
person is a woman.

116
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.680
And she was arguing that these people don't have,

117
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.640
they shouldn't have a voice in women's issues. Like you're not a woman.

118
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.860
And so this is her opinion.

119
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.010
And some people think that that opinion is transphobic.

120
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:54.980
Some people think she should be allowed to have that opinion. While on Twitter,

121
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:59.510
she wrote a man has never a woman. They told her,

122
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.970
just take down that tweet. So you know what she did.

123
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.710
She made a screenshot of it.

124
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.070
She took down that tweet and then she posted a picture of the screenshot,

125
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.270
and then they banned it for life. Wow. You know, he's not banned for life.

126
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.180
OJ Simpson. Yeah. Double homicide, armed kidnapping. Right?

127
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.980
Hate Twitter world. Yeah.

128
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.300
Hate Twitter world is your friend OJ with football picks. Hey, Twitter world.

129
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.710
He's fine. But this lady who's just said with her words,

130
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.990
a man is never a woman, which biologically is correct. Banned.

131
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.060
Wow. Do you know what else you get banned for.

132
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.670
Do you know what you get well to get banned for, for life?

133
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.470
Deadnaming do you know? Deadnaming if you call Caitlyn Jenner, Bruce

134
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.230
Really banned.

135
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.190
<v 1>For life. No.</v>

136
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.140
<v 0>Yes. For life ridiculous. Wow.</v>

137
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.380
This is the world we're living in. This is this political ideology world.

138
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:57.620
This is the reason why someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks she has to say,

139
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.220
taxpayer money should pay for prisoners.

140
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.630
Some mass murderer who decides he's a woman now to get this transitionary

141
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:08.660
surgery, transition surgery, reassignment, surgery,

142
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:12.050
whatever you want to call it. Look, I wished it was a pill that you could take.

143
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.560
I wish there was a place where you can go where they zap you like the place

144
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:18.650
where they turned Bruce banner into the Hawk that turns you into a woman,

145
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.390
a legit 100% bonafide, X, Y, or double X chromosome woman.

146
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.630
I wish there was. I wish there was. So this is no argument.

147
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.880
The argument is in changing someone, but not really,

148
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.660
you know, like you're still your chromosomes and your, your,

149
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:40.610
your biological makeup, and then forcing people to comply.

150
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.170
So it's a thing of compliance.

151
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.590
Like you're supposed to not bring up the fact that this person used to be a man.

152
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.300
Look, if your name's Greg, but like my friend, Aubrey. Okay. Perfect. Example.

153
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.680
His name used to be Chris,

154
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.500
but he tripped balls one day and decided you want to change his name.

155
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.850
So he changed his name. We all just call them Aubrey.

156
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:59.670
Now I don't call them Chris anymore. He was Chris for years.

157
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.750
I knew he was Chris for years. And then he became Aubrey. I'm like, all right,

158
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.880
man, you want to be Opry? Now you're robbery. I don't give a.

159
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.230
But if I called him, Chris, would I be dead named.
