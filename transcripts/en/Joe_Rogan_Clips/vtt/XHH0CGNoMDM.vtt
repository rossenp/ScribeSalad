<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.360
<v 1>Experience, I've done radio shows where they tell you,</v>

3
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.440
they want you to bring up certain subjects where you have jokes. You know,

4
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:11.120
there's not even that long ago, man. Like less than 10 years ago,

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.760
I did one of those, uh,

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.920
national radio shows in the Midwest and they asked me to do that.

7
00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:20.400
And I was like, what? And the producer got upset and I go, I don't do that.

8
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.070
I go, I'm not gonna do that. And like, we need subjects.

9
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.630
Like the guy was like pissy with me. Yeah. I'm like, wow.

10
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.070
<v 2>It's hard to do. Cause you feel embarrassed. It's like pro you feel just,</v>

11
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.910
you feel dirty like when someone's doing your bit and you know,

12
00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:35.430
you're doing it and they're ah, they're fake laughing. Oh. That's the worst.

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.310
Who's enjoying.

14
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.910
<v 1>This. That's what radio used to be though. What radio used to be like,</v>

15
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:43.500
you'd go on wa a F in Boston and you know,

16
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.100
you would talk to the guys and you would kind of work in your bits. Yeah.

17
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.740
You know? And like everybody did it. Everybody did their bits.

18
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.260
<v 2>Yeah. I guess it was a part of it, but I was never good at it.</v>

19
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.460
<v 1>Well, cuz you're authentic. But op and Anthony was the first to me,</v>

20
00:00:56.461 --> 00:01:01.380
like Howard's show was much more controlled. You know, Howard's behind the mix.

21
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.090
He's kind of controlling everything.

22
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.530
There's a certain amount of time that he would talk to you and then other people

23
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:09.570
would come in and then, you know, he, he had like a, a more,

24
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:11.650
more of a structure, whereas O and a,

25
00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:15.610
you would go in there and Anthony would have a gun and, you know,

26
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.890
op Opie's behind the mixer. Just sort of watching all this chaos,

27
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.930
go on different comics come filtering in. And you know,

28
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.400
remember the time Marion Barry walked in.

29
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.200
<v 2>Yeah. He was going on sway next door. And we, we,</v>

30
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.160
he was like a little out of it and loopy and we,

31
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.280
we just hijacked him &lt;laugh&gt; and he kind of walked in,

32
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.760
like he had no idea who we were. It was really uncomfortable.

33
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.120
<v 1>And I knew he was gonna leave soon.</v>

34
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.600
So I immediately started asking him about crack. You went right.

35
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.510
<v 2>Into, you knew was in that pipe. And.</v>

36
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.150
<v 1>He, he was like, nobody knows what's in that pipe. I go,</v>

37
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:49.070
nobody knows what's in that pipe. I'm like, you knew what's in that pipe. The.

38
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.270
Are you talking about man?

39
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.190
<v 2>And the publicist was like, come on, let's go. They wanted to get him outta.</v>

40
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.030
<v 1>There. They wanted to get him outta.</v>

41
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.590
<v 2>There immediately. Yeah. That was fun. Marion Barry. He died.</v>

42
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.870
Not too long after that. I don't.

43
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.310
<v 1>Think right. It wasn't that long after that. Yeah. It was funny, man.</v>

44
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.300
I remember there was a, uh, an interview. You,

45
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:05.060
they did where there was a news station.

46
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:08.780
They were talking about to people about his arrest and all this stuff. And uh,

47
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:10.700
they interviewed this guy. He goes, call, come on, man.

48
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:13.260
Everybody smokes a little crack every now and then I'm like,

49
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:16.420
everybody smokes a little crack every now and then that's.

50
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.020
<v 2>A great quote from a mayor. &lt;laugh&gt; that's a great.</v>

51
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.020
<v 1>Mayor's he wasn't him though. He wasn't saying it. Someone else is saying it.</v>

52
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.850
Oh, about defense of him. All right.

53
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.210
If it was him saying that that would be hilarious. Yeah. I'm like,

54
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:29.410
how did I miss that? No, no. It was another guy that was on the street.

55
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.490
Who was like, everybody smokes a little crack every now.

56
00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:34.170
And then did he reelected after that too? Yes, he did. Yeah.

57
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.290
I think he went to jail. Came out and got reelected. Yeah. Yes.

58
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.410
<v 2>People at DC. Very forgiving L ool. Yeah. Yeah. Very forgiving. Strange.</v>

59
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.010
<v 1>Place, man. Uh.</v>

60
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.920
<v 0>You showed me how you can choked me last time with the.</v>

61
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.840
<v 1>Tie. Did you get a breakaway tie? No I didn't. But.</v>

62
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.160
<v 0>You know, I kinda,</v>

63
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.960
I kinda let you have that one cuz I think I can defend it pretty well.

64
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.800
Well you're.

65
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.520
<v 1>Probably very good at defending jokes. Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.240
<v 0>No, no. From, with like with the tie, I don't have a system yet.</v>

67
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.680
I'll have to talk to John donnaher to develop a tie. Wait, all.

68
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.280
<v 1>You have to do, man is just take the back of the tie. Cut it.</v>

69
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.360
Put a little piece of Velcro in each end. You got the same tie. Yeah, the.

70
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.860
<v 0>Snap. No,</v>

71
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.520
but I think you going under the tie to try to start the choke

72
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.440
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; actually, I mean, you're making yourself a,

73
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.750
on their like maybe youeutenant an arm bar or something like that.

74
00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:21.950
Like I think there's a, don't.

75
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.550
<v 1>Silly. Don't be silly. Well, listen, if someone grabs a hold of your collar,</v>

76
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.390
that's the same thing. But theekiel chokes are.

77
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.470
<v 0>Deadly, right? Yeah. But it's not over. Yeah. If you sink it in mm-hmm.</v>

78
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.470
<v 1>&lt;Affirmative&gt; but it it's. So it collars are real problem.</v>

79
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.820
Right? In jujitsu. They're a real problem. If someone gets deep on your collar.

80
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.060
<v 0>Like someone on this with a suit, right. Someone.</v>

81
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.380
<v 1>Starts doing this man. You're. Yeah. Not good. Not good.</v>

82
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.620
Collars are not good.

83
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.660
<v 0>If you go deep, if you get in deep. Yeah.</v>

84
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.493
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

85
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.300
Well the problem with that is it's a handle it's worse than a collar.

86
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.490
Cuz I'll get underneath that knot and I grab a hold of that and then it's all

87
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:01.324
just twisting.

88
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.290
<v 0>Yeah. But it's you have to you're.</v>

89
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.010
<v 1>Right. Have to, I would have to get it. I'd have to get it. And.</v>

90
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.330
<v 0>You also kinda have to hold onto this part cuz it can loosen naturally unless</v>

91
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:14.450
you're really good at like cuz it loosens does it? Yeah.

92
00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:18.090
It loosens naturally. This is a system to this. I think &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

93
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.320
You haven't thought through this. So.

94
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.720
<v 1>You don't think I have, did I try to choke people with ties on?</v>

95
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.680
Have you his friends? Yeah. I'm like lemme grab a hold of that tie real quick.

96
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm like what happens if I do this? Yeah. No, no, not jujitsu.

97
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.160
<v 0>People. And also it's probably a joke. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

98
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:34.760
If I was fighting for my life, I think it'd be different. Well.

99
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.680
<v 1>Sure. You're a tough guy. You are actually trained martial artist. I mean,</v>

100
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.480
I'm not saying it would be easy to grab your tie and choke to death. Well,

101
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.350
what I'm saying is it's one more area of vulnerability that doesn't need.

102
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.310
<v 0>To exist. Yeah. But see,</v>

103
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.310
I'm disagreeing with you and saying like if I was gonna fight to the death,

104
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.030
I would wear the suit. Okay. Cause.

105
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.831
<v 1>That would look good with time.</v>

106
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:55.590
Let me tell you something about CIA agents and secret service guys.

107
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:56.510
They wear breakaway ties.

108
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.670
<v 0>That's because they're not good martial artists. Oh that's not.</v>

109
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.780
<v 1>True. There's a lot of those guys are savages. Are they a? Yeah. You man.</v>

110
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:07.500
You like blue belts or purple belts like black belts, man. If you're a,

111
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.700
if you're a secret service guy and you're supposed to be protecting the

112
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:13.340
president, I guarantee you a bunch of those guys are savages.

113
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.940
<v 0>I think they're smart enough to use guns that too.</v>

114
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.180
<v 1>Yeah. But they don't, you know, if they have to wear a tie,</v>

115
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.740
a lot of people like to wear breakaway.

116
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.610
<v 3>Ties. And that I think is a, a really heartening idea that actually, if you ex,</v>

117
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.290
if you hear more from these people, they are self- discrediting. Right.

118
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:29.490
Mm right. But, but if you, if you ban them,

119
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.290
you're almost giving them a kind of glamor,

120
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.770
a kind of martydo status that they don't deserve. And, and,

121
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.930
and that I think attracts a lot of people to their worldview. Mm.

122
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.160
<v 1>That's. There's definitely something to be for that. Yeah.</v>

123
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:44.720
There's definitely something be said. I mean,

124
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.840
like I'm not in favor of banning these people. Yeah. But I'm not also,

125
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.480
I'm also not in favor of these people.

126
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:53.280
Being able to espouse hate speech everywhere they go.

127
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.880
And to be able to indoctrinate people as well. It's like,

128
00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:57.880
I don't know what the actual well do you trust?

129
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.240
<v 3>Well, I I'll put it as my view.</v>

130
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.240
I do not trust the state to decide what constitutes hate speech. I don't either.

131
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.040
No, I, I don't believe that. Um, I mean, in the UK,

132
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.840
they've proven that they're not capable of doing that same as Canada. Right?

133
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.000
Ex exactly. Absolutely. Clearly. So, so in that case,

134
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.950
I'm for abolishing the idea of hate as a practice, we have,

135
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.590
I dunno how much you know about the UK with this. Right?

136
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.270
We have a thing where the police will investigate you for non-crime

137
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.350
if it's offensive, right? Non-crime so there's a website,

138
00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:32.430
the government's website and hate crime has a paragraph on non-crime hate

139
00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:36.950
incidents. Okay. And what they specifically say is if you've,

140
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.580
if someone said something and it's offensive to you and you believe that that

141
00:06:41.581 --> 00:06:43.380
person said something because of you,

142
00:06:43.381 --> 00:06:45.580
you were one of the protected characteristics because of race, gender,

143
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:47.460
sexuality, disability, whatever.

144
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.140
Then you report that to the police and it gets logged in the hate crime

145
00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:53.380
statistics as a hate crime. Even though there's no crime, I'll,

146
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:54.500
I'll give you a very specific example.

147
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:57.220
This there's a famous case in the UK at the moment, man called Harry.

148
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.090
He was a Docker from humside and uh,

149
00:07:00.091 --> 00:07:03.930
thepoli he retweeted a poem that was perceived to be transphobic.

150
00:07:03.931 --> 00:07:05.770
And people were upset about the, he didn't even write the poem.

151
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:10.490
He just retweetted the poem. The police investigated his retweet and they,

152
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.290
and he said to them, have I broken the law? They said, this isn't a crime.

153
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:15.930
This is a non-crime hate incident.

154
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.840
And the actual phrase the police officer used,

155
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.320
I'm not joking was we have to check your thinking, right? Whoa.

156
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.320
Now that's sinister. What? And then when the police were humhomicide,

157
00:07:28.321 --> 00:07:29.920
police were challenged on this, but in the media,

158
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.160
it turns out this is standard practice in the police.

159
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.280
This isn't just one rogue police officer going a bit mad.

160
00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:36.640
This is standard practice. The,

161
00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:38.480
the commissioning guidelines from the college of police in

162
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.710
actually stipulate that this is what you're meant to do.

163
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.950
This is now finally been challenged in the courts.

164
00:07:43.951 --> 00:07:46.030
But no one stood up to this stuff. You know.

165
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.230
<v 4>I got one of those nest cameras. Oh, the nest.</v>

166
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.110
<v 1>Cameras captured.</v>

167
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.870
<v 4>A ghost. Those yeah. And I was at the comedy, works in Denver and the.</v>

168
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:54.910
<v 1>Ghost comes with you to.</v>

169
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.190
<v 4>Denver. &lt;laugh&gt; he opens for me. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

170
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.900
you know, you want an opener that you can trust. Yeah.

171
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.020
And I got an alert on my email the first time. Like if you,

172
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.700
if it senses movement, it alerts you. And I open it up and there's my dog,

173
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.700
Bella, just in the thing. I'm like, this is so cool. I'm just like, I'm in,

174
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.460
I'm in Denver. And I'm looking at my office and I thought,

175
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.010
wouldn't that be a cool beginning of a horror movie.

176
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.570
If you get an alert on your phone and back at home,

177
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.570
there's a guy just staring in the camera of like, Jesus, Jesus Christ.

178
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.610
That's a good premise for a movie. So then I,

179
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:39.250
as I'm saying that to my opening act, who's who, wasn't a ghost.

180
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.440
I get another alert and then this comes up.

181
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.980
Oh yeah. You can see it up there.

182
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.620
<v 1>Okay. Do, why do you have a picture of Chris? Delali on your wall?</v>

183
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.280
&lt;laugh&gt; he's he's obsessed with Chris Delali we just found out, look at that,

184
00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.440
bro. That's delliaah Chris,

185
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.800
keep away from Tom something you might not know. I love delliaah.

186
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.400
<v 4>But that's.</v>

187
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.520
<v 1>George Carlin. That's a man with a wrench.</v>

188
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:11.200
<v 4>Yeah. Or a man in a trench coat with an uzy. This is 10 o'clock at night.</v>

189
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.550
The only people home or my wife and my daughter this on the second floor,

190
00:09:15.551 --> 00:09:19.830
there is no shadow coming in the thing. It's a ghost.

191
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.670
<v 1>That's a legit. You.</v>

192
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.030
<v 4>Don't think that's a person. That's not a person for sure.</v>

193
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.510
My wife is the only one in the house.

194
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:31.070
<v 1>Hmm. And you think that's a gun? His hand could be a clipboard.</v>

195
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.310
Maybe he's just a really annoying surveyor from the dead.

196
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.223
<v 4>&lt;Laugh&gt;s.</v>

197
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.260
<v 1>He's looking at it.</v>

198
00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:38.580
Just like a few moments of your time to show out this report.

199
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.660
Did you have video of it?

200
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.180
<v 4>Was it moving or something? No,</v>

201
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:45.700
but I have a video of another thing in the same office, which I could show you.

202
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.660
<v 1>This is weird. Yeah. It,</v>

203
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.860
it looks way different in this picture when it's small than it does when it's

204
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:56.290
large, which is scar. When it's large, it looks more like a person.

205
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.330
Can you make it even bigger? Jamie, can you make his image larger?

206
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.050
<v 4>Hmm. I have a ghost in my house and then we hear things.</v>

207
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.570
<v 1>Yeah. See, it does seem, it seems like, you know, the light is behind him,</v>

208
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.170
right? Like, yeah. Like the outside right.

209
00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:15.130
Edge of it is sort of highlighted. Like there's a light behind him.

210
00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:18.240
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it doesn't look very gun though. It is.

211
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.083
<v 4>Weird.</v>

212
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.280
<v 5>The big one that I remember is on,</v>

213
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.800
on my second space walk where connecting this dish antenna and had to go on top

214
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:27.760
of this big boom, like a big pedestal.

215
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.080
And there was a connector that had an electrical connector and we had, uh,

216
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.320
like an hour or so to connect the thing. And without it connected,

217
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.790
wasn't getting any power or data, uh, to that antenna.

218
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.910
And it could get too cold.

219
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.190
And this gazillion dollar antenna could be a worthless hunk of junk.

220
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.630
If you take too long, you're on the clock. Cuz when it was in the shuttle,

221
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:49.990
it was plugged in. It was getting its,

222
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.470
its heaters were on and now you gotta plug it back in and get the heaters back

223
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.740
on in a certain amount of time. And so we're like, okay, we plan this,

224
00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.580
we train this, we get up there and the clinicers won't go together.

225
00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.283
Like it doesn't fit.

226
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.420
And these two pieces of equipment sat next to each other for like a year in

227
00:11:07.421 --> 00:11:09.860
Florida in a, like a warehouse and nobody ever thought, well,

228
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.940
oh maybe we should make sure this thing fits.

229
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.060
<v 1>Oh no. Yeah.</v>

230
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.100
<v 5>And we get up there, like it doesn't fit and we're like, crap, you know,</v>

231
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:21.490
what do we, so, uh, we're shoving and we're shoving so hard.

232
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.450
We're pushing on this thing.

233
00:11:22.451 --> 00:11:24.570
So hard that the guys inside the space station said, they,

234
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:27.890
they feel the space station shaking. Like that's how hard we were trying.

235
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.090
And then we see little metal shavings come off.

236
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.050
And one of those they can get into connectors and we're like, that's bad.

237
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.090
So we stopped. And uh, and then,

238
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.560
and then this like kind of my, my big hero moment, you know, like in the movies,

239
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.880
they like Brad Pitt saves the solar system and stuff. You know,

240
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.560
this is my thing, right? It's not that exciting. But uh, I thought I, I,

241
00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:53.800
I had this idea. I said, Hey, um, the,

242
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.000
the problem we were basically having was that the female side was too small and

243
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.400
uh, and the male side was too big for it to fit together. So I said to the, uh,

244
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.560
one of my crewmates inside, I said, Hey, how long till the sun comes up?

245
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.000
Cuz you know, it takes 90 minutes to go around the,

246
00:12:08.001 --> 00:12:11.440
the earth and every 45 minutes, the sun's either coming up or going down.

247
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.830
So it can't be that long.

248
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.430
And he goes actually about 10 minutes cuz we're behind the earth and it was

249
00:12:17.431 --> 00:12:19.950
dark. And then in 10 minutes the sun was gonna come up. I'm like, perfect.

250
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.590
So I took the um, the, the female side. Um,

251
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.350
oh I'm, I'm sorry. I took the, I took the male side and I held it in my glove.

252
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.180
Okay. And I put it behind the structure wa I sun was gonna be coming from here.

253
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:38.180
So I put it in the shadow and I waited for the sun to come up and it hit the

254
00:12:38.181 --> 00:12:39.014
female side.

255
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.500
And the temperature difference if you're in the sun or in the shade is I can be

256
00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:45.740
up to like 600 degrees, Fahrenheit difference.

257
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.260
So I let the sun hit it and warm it up.

258
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.340
And I took the male side quickly outta my, my insulated hand and away from the,

259
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:58.090
and I slid it in and went right in. Wow. And that was, it saved the day.

260
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.130
<v 1>So you just deduced this,</v>

261
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:03.770
just understanding how things change according to temperature. Yeah.

262
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:08.530
<v 5>Thermalr expansion. Wow. Yeah. That's incredible.</v>

263
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.570
Yeah. That was my thing. Did you yell at the people.

264
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.450
<v 1>Who manufactured it?</v>

265
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:16.360
<v 5>No, we were so happy. We, I, I have video of this. You can. And, and uh,</v>

266
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:17.720
we were, we were going, Woohoo,

267
00:13:17.721 --> 00:13:20.800
give each other high fives in the suits and we were doing like, woo &lt;laugh&gt;.

268
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.080
Wow. That was, uh, that was victory. That's.

269
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.120
<v 1>A great victory though. There really is that you figure that out.</v>

270
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:36.950
<v 6>I.</v>
