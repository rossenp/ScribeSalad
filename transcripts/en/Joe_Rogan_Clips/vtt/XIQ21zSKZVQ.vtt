00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.040
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What,</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.040
what is your perspective after the

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.800
incident versus before the incident? Like how much did it change?

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.240
The way you view the world and our place in the world? For.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.800
<v 1>Me? Um, I, I mean, I always, I never believed that we were alone. It's just me.</v>

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.710
I just look up and go there's way too many stars up there for us to be own life.

7
00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:28.630
Right. Um, after it, you know, it makes it a little more clear to go, you know,

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.190
one, my questions are, where'd it come from? That's,

9
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:36.750
that's the biggest one of where'd it come from? What was it doing? Um,

10
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.220
you know, and then I've asked why me, I mean, why &lt;affirmative&gt;,

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.860
why did I happen to be, cuz you can say wrong place, wrong time, right?

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.860
<v 0>Or right place.</v>

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.020
<v 1>Right time to see or right place. Right time. Um, for me it was, I,</v>

14
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.180
I think there's more out there and if,

15
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.380
if I could get word out to anyone it's like, you know, especially the,

16
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.700
the debbunkers of one quit trying to debunk it. Cuz it is what it is.

17
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:02.290
It wasn't a, it wasn't a system glitch. This, I mean,

18
00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:03.570
this was a real incident that happened.

19
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.810
And number two is let's open our aperture a little bit and start thinking

20
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:11.210
outside of the box. You know, if you go, you know, you look at it and go, Hey,

21
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:12.650
it's this non-reactive propulsion.

22
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.570
Well it's because when we came up with propulsion, we de we, you know,

23
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:20.250
the people long before us came up with a reactionary propulsion system and that

24
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:21.084
became our standard.

25
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.680
We done something different where we developed non-reaction we might look at

26
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:29.720
something like a gasoline engine go, holy cow, how's that thing work. Right.

27
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.160
We wouldn't have that idea. So, you know, I think there's, you know, if,

28
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:35.080
if you look at it and go,

29
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.520
people thought Einstein was kind of nuts and we're still proving his theories

30
00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:43.150
today. And what we're learning is that he was right. And, and he was right.

31
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:46.190
There was a time when the earth was flat, except for some people in California,

32
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.150
the earth isn't flat, it's around &lt;laugh&gt;.

33
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.310
<v 0>It's not people in.</v>

34
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.590
<v 1>California, there's all over the place. There's not a nice wall. Um, so,</v>

35
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.030
so when you look at that and you go, you know,

36
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.270
a lot of the stuff that we thought was true, isn't true.

37
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.830
It it's totally been changed. So for me, I just say,

38
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.860
I think let's get outside of the box and go,

39
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.060
if we can develop a technology that would, and,

40
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.180
and I don't look at it from a military standpoint because it would be a game

41
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:13.900
changer from a military standpoint, technology.

42
00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:17.980
Like that would be a game changer for mankind completely. I mean,

43
00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:21.500
it would literally, uh, everything that we do, you know,

44
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:25.410
and we don't know exactly, you know, you could do you want that system in a car?

45
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.090
You know, people have trouble driving in two dimensions, let alone three. Right.

46
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.170
You know, they we'd, you know, it it's kinda like your joke last night. I mean,

47
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:34.450
you can't even handle the vaping thing,

48
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.170
let alone driving a car that goes up down, works in three dimensions. Well.

49
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.010
<v 0>That was what they originally wanted helicopters to be.</v>

50
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.810
They wanted to be flying cars.

51
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.000
<v 1>Yeah. You could I, out on the road, you see how people drive like yeah.</v>

52
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.920
And I always laugh because people think, well, we're three dimensional.

53
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:50.840
Like we know that this table is not the floor,

54
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.960
but really humans are two dimensional people. And you learn that,

55
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:55.840
especially when we would fight. Um,

56
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.800
if you can really work in the third dimension, which is up and you go, well,

57
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.000
we are three dimension. I go, no, if you look at like a tall building is,

58
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:07.080
you know, 1700 feet high, the big ones and you go, no, you know,

59
00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:10.840
for an F 18 to do a split us, which is go from up here and just do a vertical,

60
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.200
180 degree turn. So you're going this way and you go down here, um, it's,

61
00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:19.710
it's like 2,500 feet. Mm. And that's tight. That's a turn for a jet. Mmhmm.

62
00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:21.430
You know, unless you're running like vector thrust stuff,

63
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.670
but there's everything has a cost. So if you do some big hiaka,

64
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.230
you bleed off energy, there's a cost associated with that. That to a pilot,

65
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.670
that's three dimensions to most people on earth. You go, no, I'm, you know,

66
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.430
I look at a hill and I don't wanna walk up that thing. Right. You know,

67
00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:37.390
and in an airplane, it's a, it's a totally different thing. So just,

68
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.580
if we just open up that expanse, you know,

69
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:42.660
for what we're trying to do for technology and go, is there another way,

70
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.660
because we still build, we still build suckers and blowers,

71
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.460
which is a jet engine. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; we just refine the internals,

72
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.980
the turbines to get them to be more efficient where I go,

73
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.220
why don't you just put your efforts at someplace else? Like I was talking to,

74
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.050
um, there's a whole realm of physics that it really doesn't get explained.

75
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.450
And it's, uh, I was talking to Steve justice about it.

76
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.410
It's more into the magnetics type side, um,

77
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.010
that we don't, we don't spend a lot of time on. And I know when he said,

78
00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:12.450
when he was working at skunkworks,

79
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.250
he did it sort of called IRAD internal research and development money that he

80
00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:21.840
would fund to try and look at some of these other tech GS for propulsion. And,

81
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.800
uh, you know, he's, he's now since retired, but, uh,

82
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.720
really impressive to talk to him at the level that you can, which is, you know,

83
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.360
for us would be an unclassified level &lt;laugh&gt; um, but you know,

84
00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:35.480
the stuff that goes on behind closed doors, there's reasons for it. You know,

85
00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:39.600
because if a technology like that got out where someone could rapidly reproduce

86
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:42.590
it after all you've done and you know, or they got it first,

87
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.430
you think of the atomic bomb, you know, Germans almost had it. We got it.

88
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:49.750
Russians were working on it. We got it. First changed.

89
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.110
The world literally changed the world when we detonated the first one and you

90
00:04:54.111 --> 00:04:58.150
go, I'm not gonna get into the politics behind it, but now we had it.

91
00:04:58.151 --> 00:04:59.470
And now it was the race, everyone else,

92
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:02.500
because they had to get on equal or because it's a destabilizing thing.

93
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:03.101
And all of a sudden,

94
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:06.300
if you develop a technology like this and you keep it to yourself,

95
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.540
you've got something that no one else has. And it's a huge leap. I mean,

96
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.460
it's a quantum leap. Do you, do you share it

97
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.340
because it's, it's a mankind thing or do you keep it for yourself? You know,

98
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.810
and right now it's not for me to decide. I'm just Dave. Well.

99
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.650
<v 0>It's fascinating that some other method of propulsion</v>

100
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.090
could have been established in some other place. Yeah.

101
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.610
And that we are experiencing it or that you've experienced it.

102
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:39.250
And some other folks have experienced it in action.

103
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.920
And I, I just, just think for us, as people,

104
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.000
as human beings in 2019,

105
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.040
it's really easy to think that what we have now is so

106
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:55.560
amazing and that what we have now is the pinnacle of discovery.

107
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.320
And that what we have now is, uh, you know, the,

108
00:05:58.321 --> 00:06:02.880
with our electricity and with our L E D screens and that we are

109
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.760
experiencing like the height of technology, when,

110
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.480
if you are some creature from some other planet that is

111
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.160
got easy access to element one 15 and some gravity propulsion system,

112
00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:18.750
you're looking at us like we're Dick get holes in the side of a mountain to

113
00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:20.870
protect ourself from the rain. We're a cave people.

114
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.750
<v 1>Yes. Yeah. Well, we do that here on earth. Yeah. I mean,</v>

115
00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:27.550
you look at like a first world, you know, like a United States or, you know,

116
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:31.310
these, the developed nations, and then you go to some's other and go, you know,

117
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:33.590
people are still getting their water out of a hole in the ground with a bucket.

118
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.250
Right.

119
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.660
<v 0>Or people in the rainforest are living these indigenous lifestyles. Yeah.</v>

120
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.540
<v 1>So, you know, take them something, I mean,</v>

121
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.340
take 'em one of these flat screens down to one of these tribes that mm-hmm,

122
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.660
&lt;affirmative&gt; no one's ever seen and go, Hey, look,

123
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.700
and start showing 'em pictures of ' themselves.

124
00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:50.500
That you're shooting real time or video that's feeding directly into it.

125
00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:53.140
They'll they'll freak out. They'll think it's magic. Whatd you capture my soul.

126
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.100
Right. Um, so it's it's where are we at? And where are we gonna do?

127
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.170
And &lt;affirmative&gt; what can we.

128
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.410
<v 0>Do? Did it change the way you look at life? I mean, even though you knew that,</v>

129
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.570
or you had this feeling that we were not alone just from looking at the stars

130
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.330
and, but when you actually see the thing, like how, I mean,

131
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.450
I would imagine that that has got to really shift your perspective.

132
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.080
<v 1>I dunno if it shifted my perspective, but it was more of a, it's a validation,</v>

133
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.280
a confirmation to go, you go, yeah. You know, I've always like, yeah, God,

134
00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:26.640
there's a lot of stars. And then you see something like this and go, well,

135
00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:31.320
maybe we're not, cuz that, that pushes you to the next point to go, you know,

136
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.160
you know, one lands in my front yard,

137
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:37.000
then I'll be 100% sure that we are not alone. Cuz it's sitting in my front yard.

138
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.670
But I mean, I got within a half mile of this thing, um,

139
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.550
which is people go well, half mile is pretty far away. Again,

140
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:45.910
not when you're flying an airplane half mile is like really tight.

141
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.110
<v 0>When they bring you in to have these conversations with high level government</v>

142
00:07:49.111 --> 00:07:51.430
officials, how long are these conversations?

143
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.070
<v 1>So I went to the I've been down,</v>

144
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:57.910
I've talked to three different groups of people. This.

145
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.940
<v 0>Is post the, this is New York, York times article article.</v>

146
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.380
So the New York time article comes out in 2017. Yes. And then our,

147
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.353
our government.

148
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.420
<v 1>The other pilot that was involved had been to DC multiple times.</v>

149
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:16.180
This is how kind of I got in touch with Lou. She had called me and said, Hey,

150
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.010
I need to talk to you. So I, I called her and I said, well, what's going on?

151
00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:22.690
She says, Hey, have you been, has anyone called you about the TicTac?

152
00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:24.330
And I said, no. She goes, you know,

153
00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:28.010
I've been to the Pentagon like a half dozen times and they'll take me in and

154
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.730
anywhere from Starbucks to, you know, inside of a vault. And she goes,

155
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:33.570
and they'll talk to me about the story. And then they'll show me a picture.

156
00:08:33.571 --> 00:08:36.170
Something goes to look like this. And then she gets pretty frustrat and goes,

157
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.650
we call it the TicTac cuz it looked like a TicTac what part you get? I mean,

158
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:40.920
go get thing at TicTac and.

159
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.440
<v 0>Look at 'em when they're saying, did it look like this?</v>

160
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:45.800
They showing actual perhaps that they have.

161
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.960
<v 1>No, not pictures that they have, but like a video from someone else,</v>

162
00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:52.240
like they'd show the gible video. Oh, Hey look like this. Oh, okay. And,

163
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.240
and it was no, so, and that's when I told her, I said, well just,

164
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.160
just tell this guy that you're talking to just give my name and number. I go,

165
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:02.040
I'll talk to him. It's not a big deal to me. You know? And that started.

166
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.120
So when we, I got asked, you know, multiple times to go down and talk to,

167
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.240
to people, one of 'em was supposed to be 20 minutes. And these, you know,

168
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:11.680
these are important people getting 20 minutes of some of these folks,

169
00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:15.470
time is like, that's a huge deal that, so we went in thinking, okay,

170
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:18.310
we're gonna do the thing in 20 minutes. And then we're in. And uh,

171
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:23.670
and an hour and a half later we came out. I mean, that's the interest of,

172
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.190
you know, and there were some PE you know, you get the group, you know,

173
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.030
the folks that come in and out, but there's a few, um,

174
00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:32.430
that just sat there and were enamored by what we were saying. Like, you're,

175
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:35.700
you're joking. We're like, no, this is, this is all real you. I mean,

176
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.693
and these are,

177
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:41.300
these are pretty senior officials that are taking the time out of their day to

178
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:43.460
take this serious, to go, you know,

179
00:09:43.461 --> 00:09:48.460
maybe we do need to put a little emphasis on this. I mean, if, if, if literally,

180
00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:51.940
if something can just show up at will and do whatever it wants and I'd probably

181
00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:53.300
at least pay attention. Yeah.

182
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.850
<v 0>Pay attention. But what could be done? I mean, what could do,</v>

183
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.410
if you were put yourself in a position of one of these high level government

184
00:09:59.411 --> 00:10:02.010
officials, what do you do? Just spend more money on looking at.

185
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.570
<v 1>Them. Oh, if you look at money though, I mean,</v>

186
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:06.090
I know when the article came out and they talked about the AIP program that

187
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:09.330
Harry Reed got funded 22 million over five years. Yeah.

188
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:12.450
So it's 4.4 million a year and you go, everyone's freaking out, oh,

189
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:15.850
it's 22 million. I got, no, it wasn't 22 million a year. It was 4.4.

190
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.160
That's not even in the rounding air for the United States.

191
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.000
We just got approved what? It was 750 billion for a defense budget,

192
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:28.480
750 billion. If you took a hundred million out of that,

193
00:10:28.481 --> 00:10:31.960
it's not even gonna put a dent. And I go, why can't you, you know, if you're,

194
00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:32.880
if you're only spending four,

195
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.720
4.4 million a year and you can actually get some good work done,

196
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.550
cuz you don't need a huge team because you figure, if you look at, I think,

197
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.790
I think what's the number like 10, 15% of all these UFOs.

198
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.710
Like if you look at project, blue book really remained unexplained and you go,

199
00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:48.990
okay, so you can weed out. You know,

200
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:51.710
you can read out me flying over someone in a campfire and lighten my

201
00:10:51.711 --> 00:10:56.270
afterburners &lt;laugh&gt; uh, so you can go, no, that was Dave being and Dave. Um,

202
00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.460
so you can weed that stuff out. Now you go,

203
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.380
now I'm really kind of concentrating the funds, the most important thing.

204
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:03.140
And I talked to the folks when we were talking,

205
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.020
cause we talked about funding and I said, let me leave you with this. Um,

206
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.740
and I had got some pretty good stuff. I was talking to Chris Meon,

207
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:12.260
who's a former under secretary and understands how the government works.

208
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.340
It was where he gave me some really good feedback. And I said, I talked to him.

209
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.380
I said, look, I'm all for you guys funding a program.

210
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.730
&lt;affirmative&gt; but what you need to do is fund a program that there's gonna be

211
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:22.570
oversight over. And when I say oversight, I mean,

212
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.810
because what happens is you go here's money,

213
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:26.210
but we're gonna distribute in the government.

214
00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:29.490
So we're gonna distribute it to these three different agencies across the United

215
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.250
States government, you know, just call 'em agency a, B and C.

216
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.850
So you give it to them, you know,

217
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.440
and I'll go back to like the nine 11 stuff or we've really answer.

218
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.760
But all the agencies,

219
00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:41.800
weren't talking to each other to put all the pieces together.

220
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.760
And that's my fear that you go, Hey,

221
00:11:43.761 --> 00:11:45.680
we're gonna take a hundred million dollars of tax payer money.

222
00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:48.800
We're gonna fund a program to actually seriously investigate this stuff and look

223
00:11:48.801 --> 00:11:49.634
at the technology.

224
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.720
But there are three different entities working on their own and not talking to

225
00:11:52.721 --> 00:11:55.520
each other. So there's gotta be a joint collaboration to, we go,

226
00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.120
we're gonna do it. But you know,

227
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.280
Joe's gonna be in charge and you guys are all gonna play nice in the sandbox

228
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.680
together because we want to get our money's worth because people will raise the,

229
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.640
the fraud waste and abuse flag that we're wasting money on something stupid.

230
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.750
<v 2>So.</v>
