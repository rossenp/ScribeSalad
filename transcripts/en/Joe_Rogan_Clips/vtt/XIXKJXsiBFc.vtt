00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 2>So you were a part of this, uh,</v>

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.930
open letter recently about COVID-19 or you want to

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.710
get to the bottom of the origins of it. And, um,

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.930
this is something we've talked about on the podcast before,

6
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:17.460
and a lot of people have been talking about it lately.

7
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:21.060
Now that Trump's out of office, it's sort of freed up the discussion, right? Uh,

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.860
for the longest time discussing that in terms of like it

9
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:30.630
not being just some sort of a random mutation from bats and Corona

10
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:35.250
viruses that it may have been a lab leak was so taboo because it was what Trump

11
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:36.630
was pushing. And it's,

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.160
it's so crazy that something which is science,

13
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:45.600
it says it's a scientific discussion and inquiry that it could be

14
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.800
stunted by these political ideas when someone is so

15
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:51.420
polarizing, like Trump,

16
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.400
that people just completely want to reject like very plausible and possible

17
00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:58.050
ideas just because of him.

18
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.650
<v 1>It's exactly right. I was the lead drafter, uh,</v>

19
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.640
with a community of other of other people and lead scientists around the world,

20
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.680
um, of this letter. And since the beginning of last year,

21
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:15.450
2020, I had maybe the leading website in the world that was just, um,

22
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.280
stating what is the evidence about the origins of COVID-19

23
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:23.460
particularly the evidence for a lab leak. Um,

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.410
and the evidence is actually really strong. It's all circumstantial evidence.

25
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.810
Um, but we don't have any evidence of the other hypotheses of where COVID

26
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:35.760
comes from, like these, this, uh,

27
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.080
series of jumps through different animals in the wild. And so I,

28
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:42.900
for a long time, more than a year have been saying, Hey,

29
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:46.770
we need to look really seriously at this. Not because we know we're certainly,

30
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:50.460
I don't know for sure that's where COVID comes from, but in my view,

31
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:54.600
it's the most likely hypothesis worthy of a full

32
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.120
investigation. And so, uh,

33
00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:00.180
there was a world health organization or, uh,

34
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.030
organized an independent advisory committee and they went on a

35
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.690
study mission, uh, to China, uh, in earlier this year, 2021.

36
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.460
And then they came out with a re uh, with a, they had a press event in Wu Han,

37
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:18.570
which was a joint press event between this committee and their Chinese

38
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:23.280
government counterparts. And in that press event, what they said was, um, we're,

39
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.020
we don't support investigating the possibility of a lab leak any further. Um,

40
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.850
but we should investigate what seems like a much less likely hypothesis that

41
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:36.210
COVID started with frozen foods being shipped to Wu Han.

42
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:40.140
And so we already had a community of scientists and others who'd been meeting

43
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:43.800
virtually, um, for a while trying to say, to really say,

44
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.140
where does this come from? What's the evidence. Uh,

45
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:49.830
we had the academic presentations, challenging the data,

46
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.520
trying to figure out where are the gaps. And we looked at that and said,

47
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:57.780
that that can't be right. And we decided we needed to put out an open letter,

48
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.010
which we, which we recently released.

49
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:03.250
And it was covered in newspapers all around the world.

50
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.220
And the letter made kind of key points.

51
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:08.830
One is that this is a terrible pandemic.

52
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:11.620
We have to understand where it came from too,

53
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.600
that this current investigation is not the kind of full investigation

54
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:20.500
that's needed. And three here's what a full investigation looks like,

55
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.190
and we call on governments to do it. But your point that it's been,

56
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.270
it's been taboo for the year is exactly right.

57
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:32.290
And it's just crazy because it seems, this is a really, in my view,

58
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:35.170
likely possibility. I can't say for sure,

59
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.570
we should be investigating all hypotheses.

60
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.680
Not saying we can't even look at something that that really could be the.

61
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.320
<v 0>And it's also really unfortunate that a lot of people are not</v>

62
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.060
trusting anything that the world health organization says anymore because the

63
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:55.270
world health organization, I'm sure you saw the, uh,

64
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.400
spokesperson for the world health organization,

65
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.110
speaking with a reporter and he wouldn't even mention the name Taiwan.

66
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.990
Did you see that?

67
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.770
<v 1>No. So it's, I did see that and, and he.</v>

68
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.240
<v 0>Logs off and then comes back on and then she asked him again about Taiwan's</v>

69
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:12.970
response to COVID-19 and he says, well,

70
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:15.790
China's done an amazing job and let's just change subjects.

71
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.100
And like the woman keeps getting back to Taiwan and he won't recognize Taiwan

72
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:22.960
because China doesn't recognize Taiwan.

73
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.150
And China has some sort of strange, I don't know what it is,

74
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:31.570
but there's some sort of political influence on the world health organization.

75
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.680
<v 1>Yeah. So there's a lot there. So first full disclosure,</v>

76
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:39.520
I'm a member of the world health organization, international advisory committee,

77
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.750
human cast.

78
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.570
<v 0>What's that? I said exactly, exactly.</v>

79
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.690
<v 1>Um, uh, advisory committee on human genome editing. Um, and, um,</v>

80
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.530
so I'm actually a real supporter of the world health organization,

81
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.210
but there's a big problem.

82
00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.220
And that problem is being realized and we're seeing it through the course of

83
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:04.320
this pandemic. So first in the earliest days of the, uh,

84
00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:05.260
of the pandemic,

85
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.540
why was it that world health organization inspectors weren't able

86
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:11.410
to go to Wu Han?

87
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.020
And the reason was the Chinese government wouldn't give them visas.

88
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:18.580
And there was nothing that who could do. Why was it that, um, the,

89
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:23.380
who was just essentially unfortunately parroting the reporting

90
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.810
from the Chinese government in the earliest days.

91
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:30.160
And part of that at least is because they don't even have the authority to have

92
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.630
their own surveillance network.

93
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.820
Why is it referencing your point about Taiwan that Taiwan has all

94
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.250
kinds of expertise, um, in, uh,

95
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.160
treating and responding to terrible outbreaks like this,

96
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:46.600
which is why they've only had nine COVID deaths in Taiwan since the very

97
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:48.730
beginning. And why is it that the,

98
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:53.290
who is in this weird position it's in part because the,

99
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:57.950
who is created by these member states that have a lot of influence and it's

100
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.341
terrible.

101
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:03.320
And we we're all suffering because Taiwan didn't have a full voice tight on

102
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:04.940
December 31st,

103
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.740
2019 Taiwan declared a national emergency based on COVID.

104
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.540
That was way before we did. I wish Taiwan had had a bigger voice.

105
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.790
So who is in a really,

106
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:19.580
really difficult position because on one hand,

107
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:24.350
we're asking them to investigate and call out a member state. On the other hand,

108
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.180
their governing body essentially is made up of member states,

109
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:30.014
including China.

110
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.970
<v 0>Yeah. It's, it's just so strange to see scientific inquiry and analysis</v>

111
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.720
pushed and manipulated by.

112
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.660
<v 1>Well, that's the whole story here. I mean, that's, that's,</v>

113
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:46.010
unfortunately the story of COVID is that, I mean,

114
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:49.910
it was politics that made it so that you could have a,

115
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.420
this outbreak and we can talk more about where the outbreak started,

116
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.570
but wherever it started, whether it was a lab leak or something else,

117
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.850
if you had had a fully functioning system,

118
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.670
if it hadn't been Chinese politics and the national Institute,

119
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.060
the national and instinct, or the natural instinct,

120
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.690
hadn't been to cover up to silence the whistleblowers to give,

121
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.230
to lie essentially to the world health organization and the international

122
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.010
community.

123
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.960
It could well have been possible to suppress COVID in the first few weeks,

124
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:20.150
and we wouldn't be having any of this. So,

125
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.980
and then it was politics that made China, again, whatever the origin, um,

126
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.240
carry out this massive coverup over the course of the last year,

127
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:33.770
where they destroyed samples, eliminated, or removed databases, uh,

128
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.110
imprisoned journalists, Chinese journalists,

129
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:40.700
asking tough questions and put a universal gag order on their scientists,

130
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.570
uh, making it impossible for them to speak about, about any of this stuff.

131
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.620
That's.

132
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.990
<v 0>Pretty incredible that that's not really well known.</v>

133
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.030
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I I've, so for me,</v>

134
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:54.170
it's been more than a year and I have it on my Jamie Metsul website.

135
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:58.820
And I've been trying to tell everybody not to point fingers, but to say like,

136
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.590
we have a real problem here,

137
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:04.940
unless we can just be really honest about what's the problem that we're facing.

138
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:06.200
How are we possibly going to.

139
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.260
<v 0>Address it now? What is the circumstantial evidence?</v>

140
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.120
<v 1>Sorry. So let me, let me start from the beginning of this. So, um,</v>

141
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.200
we know we have a long history of these pathogenic outbreaks and they tend to

142
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:19.100
happen, uh,

143
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.930
in more tropical parts of China in Southeast Asia and just

144
00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:27.620
tropical, uh, parts of the world. So when SARS,

145
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.610
when this outbreak began, um, uh, for me,

146
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.500
I had a little bit of background.

147
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.240
One of the reasons why I started to get suspicious very early on is I

148
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.350
recently before then been in Wu Han. And I knew what UConn,

149
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.290
wasn't a place where a bunch of yokels are eating bats.

150
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.760
Wu Han is a really sophisticated city, it's their Chicago. Uh,

151
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.290
and I knew that they didn't have horseshoe bats in Wu Han.

152
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:57.330
As a matter of fact, when the outbreak happened, it was, uh,

153
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:00.930
it was winter there. And so there weren't, that's there. Um,

154
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.760
and I knew early on that this whole story of the wet market, uh, was a lie.

155
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.270
And as the Chinese government knew, and they, for many, many months push that,

156
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.710
uh, that story, um, even knowing it wasn't true, how'd, you know,

157
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:18.420
it was a lie well [inaudible] story because there was a paper that

158
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:22.710
came out in the Lancet in January of 2020.

159
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.140
And in that paper, it made clear, uh,

160
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:29.460
that around a third of the first COVID cases had no

161
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:33.840
exposure to the wet to that market. And so if everything started in the market,

162
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.760
you would have expected all of the early cases to have had a market

163
00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:42.360
exposure. And so that was known, their government knew that in January,

164
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:45.600
but they didn't admit it until may of last year. Was there a common.

165
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.250
<v 0>Denominator for all the people that were.</v>

166
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.830
<v 1>Exposed or that's, that's the big question now,</v>

167
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:54.540
so that the finding patient so-called patient zero that's

168
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:56.820
the essential, the essential question.

169
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.880
If the lab lake hypothesis is true,

170
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.300
then either patient zero, um,

171
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:08.070
would be someone who works at one of the, these Chinese virology institutes,

172
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:11.700
probably the one Institute of virology, or, um,

173
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.230
it would be someone who was exposed to a virus that had somehow escaped from

174
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:16.381
that,

175
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:21.120
whether it was through waste or maybe an animal escaped or something like that,

176
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.860
if this,

177
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.930
they alternative story that many scientists believe and could also could well be

178
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:31.980
true, uh, that the patient zero, it comes from a series.

179
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:35.070
There was animal to animal butter called intermediate hosts.

180
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.340
It started with the bat and then went back to a pangolin or whatever,

181
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:39.900
and eventually to a human.

182
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.010
Then you would find a patient zero somewhere.

183
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.220
That was that first human. But if, I mean,

184
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:51.420
I think this is a really important point. Um, if that's the case,

185
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:53.850
you'd have to say, well, what are the chances that,

186
00:10:53.851 --> 00:10:58.050
that patient zero from this series of animal to animal,

187
00:10:58.051 --> 00:11:01.560
to human transmissions, it just happens to be,

188
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.720
it shows up in Wu Han,

189
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.430
which is the only city in China with a level four virology

190
00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:12.870
Institute that has the world's largest collection of bat

191
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.550
coronaviruses that is doing gain of function research,

192
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:21.150
trying to make those viruses more, very lint,

193
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:25.500
particularly by making them more easily able to infect

194
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.200
human cells. So, in my mind, if you,

195
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.600
if patient zero is just somebody who had an exposure to an animal,

196
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:38.250
you have the mathematical odds of that person just showing up in, in Wu Han,

197
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.190
um, would be actually kind of absurd.

198
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.540
<v 0>Also an issue with the actual structure of the virus itself, right?</v>

199
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.250
<v 1>Yes. Yeah. So w well, this is a virus that is, um,</v>

200
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.580
ready-made for getting to humans for the first SARS.

201
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.870
We were able to track how it jumped and you could see in

202
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.770
retrospect how you could see it got closer and closer. And as, as the,

203
00:12:03.771 --> 00:12:05.980
the virus mutated,

204
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.890
it became more able to infect humans.

205
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.600
This virus showed up fully able to infect humans

206
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.890
in a matter of fact,

207
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.020
in the comparative studies of different animals, including humans,

208
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.460
humans are the most susceptible to the SARS cov two virus.

209
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:28.810
So somehow you have to explain how this virus shows up kind of

210
00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:32.800
seemingly out of nowhere in [inaudible] ready for action,

211
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:35.890
ready to fully infect infect humans, no.

212
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.160
<v 0>This level for virology lab it's in Wu Han,</v>

213
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.580
what are they doing those studies for? Like, what is the intent?

214
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.061
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

215
00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:46.540
it's a really important question because there are a lot of people who are,

216
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.650
are saying things that I don't agree with that, oh, this is some kind of

217
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.460
military bio weapon and,

218
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:58.210
and say what you want about Chinese government. They're not stupid.

219
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.310
Um, and so for them, I, I truly believe if you had to ask me,

220
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:05.470
what's the most likely story. Um,

221
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.780
I believe that they recognized that these kinds of pathogens are

222
00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:14.080
a big threat to humans and that we're getting more and more,

223
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:16.060
the frequency of these kinds of outbreaks is growing.

224
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.290
And rather than being behind the curve and waiting for, uh,

225
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.870
for some terrible outbreak, the idea was, well,

226
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:27.850
can we predict how these viruses will evolve? Um,

227
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.710
can we get ahead of the game in developing treatments and vaccines for what we

228
00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:35.140
think may be coming? And that's what this,

229
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:36.880
this gain of function research is about.

230
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.810
And so we know that the Chinese government, uh, that the I'm sorry,

231
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:44.230
the Wuhan Institute of virology was doing this kind of gain of function

232
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.540
research. Some of it is actually funded, um,

233
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.350
with United States government money through the NIH.

234
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.190
And I know you'll get a lot of action in the Twitter sphere on, on this, but,

235
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.460
um, so we know, and I,

236
00:13:56.461 --> 00:14:00.640
and I truly believe that there was well-intentioned work

237
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.130
trying to develop vaccines and treatments,

238
00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:07.480
trying to understand how the most dangerous pathogens might, uh, might develop.

239
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:10.450
And if my hypothesis is, is true,

240
00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:13.570
I think that there was an accident and there's a whole history of people who

241
00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:18.460
were warning saying why we're trying to, um, prevent some kind of future threat,

242
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.920
but in our effort to prevent it,

243
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.470
we're actually increasing the likelihood of it happening.

244
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.590
<v 0>It wasn't that lab cited in 2018 for safety violations.</v>

245
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.410
<v 1>As well. So the U S embassy, uh,</v>

246
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.990
sent a small delegation. They visited the lab, uh,

247
00:14:33.991 --> 00:14:37.000
and then there was, there were two cables about this saying, Hey,

248
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.230
this is really dangerous.

249
00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:42.940
They're doing experimentation with these dangerous Corona viruses, um,

250
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.180
and their safety protocols, aren't up to snuff.

251
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.340
So there was a lot of warning and a lot of fear.
