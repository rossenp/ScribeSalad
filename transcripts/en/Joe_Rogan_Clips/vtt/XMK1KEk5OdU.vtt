00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.710
<v 2>So you were 13 when you, you and your family and you,</v>

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.490
was it you and your mother escaped? Yeah. How did you get out?

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.500
<v 0>So that has initially my sister and I was going to escape,</v>

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.410
but then north Koreans say, when you're escaping,

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.450
of course we don't have phones, we don't have maps. We don't know what's the,

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.900
or the water look like.

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.450
Luckily I was living in this border town of North Korea by then. So at night,

9
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.090
do you know if you see a satellite photo of North Korea,

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.890
it is the literally the darkest place on earth. We don't have electricity.

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.030
So I was seeing this light coming from China. So we,

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.260
I thought like if I call it the lights or be able to be finding some bottle of

13
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:49.170
rice. So as 16,

14
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:53.670
my sister left through to her friend and she left me a note while I was in the

15
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:57.210
hospital and got Mike removing my appendix.

16
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.570
And then as soon as I got out of the hospital, I found a note.

17
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.830
And initially my mom and I went to look for a sister where she went,

18
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.660
but when we found the lady,

19
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.740
she told me that she could help me to go to China that day.

20
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.400
<v 1>And so this was you and your mother and you were 13 years old.</v>

21
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.930
So how did you get across and what does that, what was that experience like?

22
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.150
<v 0>So, uh, this is, uh,</v>

23
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.860
so I told them my mom call me to me to China. And she,

24
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:29.520
my mom was like, no, father is like, my father was home. He was reading.

25
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.880
But the thing is, that's the tragic thing for nurses,

26
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.370
because we can not even say goodbye to our loved ones.

27
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.290
So if we got caught on the journey and if my father knew that we were escaping,

28
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.760
he's going to be punished so much. So it's better off that.

29
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:48.240
He does not know that we were escaping for his own safety,

30
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.570
because they're going to torture you to the point that you're going to say

31
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:54.780
anything. Cause they do this all subconscious,

32
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:59.580
like torture that they make you not sleep in a single

33
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:02.100
room has like no air much air.

34
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.240
If you put there for 40 days alone, you go crazy.

35
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.360
You say whatever they ask you. So if you,

36
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:12.150
he actually knew that we were escaping it wouldn't go for him.

37
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.200
He would repeat that. So I told him, I'm like, you cannot have father day.

38
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:17.070
We are escaping.

39
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.410
So that day we climbed up this several mountains

40
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.330
and then we went to the Riverside, but she had a connection with the cars.

41
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.310
<v 1>Why did you not bring him with you?</v>

42
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.170
<v 0>Because he's a man and he was sick. And somehow she said,</v>

43
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.740
the only women can go. Only women can grow. I did not know why,

44
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.090
what she meant by that. She's like, you,

45
00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:43.050
you should just go with your mom and don't even tell those people.

46
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:46.860
That's your mom. She said like, you are like 18 or something.

47
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.420
And my mom was something 30. So she told me that our wage age, it was different.

48
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.800
<v 1>So, and this would somehow or another help you when you were going across? Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.570
How would that help you?

50
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.120
<v 0>I don't. Oh, she told me what is.</v>

51
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.680
<v 1>Going to be helpful. And well, part of the issue is, um,</v>

52
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.150
in China,

53
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.710
there's a disproportionate number of men in comparison to women.

54
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.720
And so they want as many women to come across

55
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.140
as that are, uh, uh, legally age,

56
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.150
like women that can be married or con right. Is that the idea behind it?

57
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.500
<v 0>It's a smuggling. So like, it is, it is you got it right?</v>

58
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.240
Because of one child policy, a lot of girls, guy aborted in China.

59
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.100
So they kept the boys.

60
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.151
<v 1>So there's many,</v>

61
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:41.770
many men that have no chance of ever finding a woman because there are no women.

62
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.010
Yeah.

63
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.850
<v 0>Over 30 million men in the rural areas can not find the wives.</v>

64
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.890
So they, over 30 million is number going to keep going up right now.

65
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.180
So that's a big problem for Chinese regime.

66
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.440
But the thing is even that they don't allow north Korean women to stay there.

67
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.330
They catch us and they send us back to North Korea last month,

68
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.290
China with Patrick, the 50 north Korean, the factors back to North Korea,

69
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.300
it is sending them our suits. Literally they are sending him to death camp,

70
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.261
but they,

71
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:18.190
Chinese regime still do catch us and send us back because they think we are

72
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.360
posing a threat to the regime and they don't want the regime to collapse.

73
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.910
So they are catching all of the factors,

74
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.170
but the human traffickers seized the opportunity here because we are so

75
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.020
vulnerable why we are running away from Chinese authority.

76
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.630
So even they rape us and kill us.

77
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.460
The last place that we are going to go is going to police and then report on

78
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:40.294
them.

79
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.370
<v 1>Why did they think that women coming over from North Korea are gonna somehow or</v>

80
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:46.780
another collapse? The empire.

81
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.020
<v 0>Because, uh, the that's what Kim dune believes.</v>

82
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.600
He thinks they're going to collapse through the defection,

83
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.440
through the defectors. So after Kim Dawn came into power,

84
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.150
he literally, the country cannot afford the electricity Probo,

85
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.230
electrified the fence, the entire border. Not only that,

86
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:09.250
putting the machine guns with the cars have a sh to kill order, whoever crosses,

87
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.310
they don't even bother to ask you start, they shoot you right there.

88
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.100
And not only that, he buried the land,

89
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:17.800
the mines on top of that.

90
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.060
<v 1>So there's electric fence and then there's guards shooting to kill.</v>

91
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:23.650
And then past that there's landmines.

92
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.543
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.050
Entire country became a concentration camp entire country.

94
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.530
<v 1>When did they start putting the landmines in a few years ago?</v>

95
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.240
So this is after you had already escaped.

96
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.140
<v 0>Yeah, no, there's no, you can't.</v>

97
00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:38.800
You don't see no skin defects escaping from North Korea anymore.

98
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.830
It's impossible to scale at this point.
