00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What you, one of the things.</v>

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.340
<v 1>You talked about was that there was this transference,</v>

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.700
like the Eucharist eventually became a placebo. Do you, do you,

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.390
do you think that, that, what do you think it was initially,

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.670
do you think it was a psychedelic mushroom?

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.550
<v 2>So that's Allegro certainly thought that, right. Uh, John.</v>

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.790
<v 1>Marco Allegro author of the sacred mushroom in the scroll.</v>

8
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.750
<v 2>Uh, so he, he releases that book in 1970 and he claimed that, uh,</v>

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.460
Christianity is the guys for a near Eastern fertility cult. And it's,

10
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.080
I mean, I think it's very interesting,

11
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.800
but there aren't many linguists who support the proposition.

12
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.710
<v 1>Right. There's, there's a lot of people that disagree with them pretty heavily,</v>

13
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:43.544
right.

14
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.670
<v 2>From, from like a purely linguistic perspective. It's uh, I mean,</v>

15
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:50.750
to explain it briefly. So did you read this sacred mushroom in the cross?

16
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.430
Did you, do you read it several times? Did.

17
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.680
<v 1>You read the dead sea scrolls in the Christian myth.</v>

18
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.110
<v 2>As well? Yeah, that's.</v>

19
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.830
<v 1>The one that was, so the Catholic church bought out the original one. Right.</v>

20
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.250
And they,

21
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.910
it was very difficult to get ahold of for the longest time he had to buy copies

22
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:05.360
of it.

23
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.360
<v 2>I've heard rumors to that effect. Yes. And then he.</v>

24
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.860
<v 1>So he comes out with the second book,</v>

25
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.950
the dead sea scrolls and the Christian myth. W what,

26
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.810
what did D knowing as much as you know about language, like w what did you,

27
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.550
did you feel like he made leaps?

28
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.500
Did you feel like he made these connections that maybe were based on speculation.

29
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.030
<v 2>It's pure philology, right. So it's,</v>

30
00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:30.930
it's word games and things that only linguists. I mean, I,

31
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:34.100
I think it's incredible that people who aren't linguists can actually read that

32
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:37.250
it's really, really difficult to read sacred mushroom in the cross.

33
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.750
But the basic premise is that the new Testament written in Greek has this

34
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.430
Semitic substratum. So underneath the Greek, uh, the, the,

35
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.900
the author of the gospel writers and,

36
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:51.410
and Paul are actually referring to different terms in Hebrew or Aramaic.

37
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.280
And that these terms have an intern come from the Sumerian,

38
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.150
which any linguists would say is a language isolate,

39
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.200
that there is no real relationship between Sumerian and the Indo-European

40
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:05.150
languages like Greek and the Semitic.

41
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.170
So the premise of the argument is something that most linguists don't accept,

42
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.950
however, and, and Kroll ruck has written the afterward to, uh,

43
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.560
one of the additions you probably have of sacred mushroom in the cross.

44
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.760
And he gets into some complex theories about psycho linguistics and this

45
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:22.640
interesting idea that just because they, they aren't related,

46
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.640
there are certain words, certain names, certain vocabulary,

47
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:27.350
like plant definitions,

48
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.780
which w which would carry across the different languages.

49
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.780
And I find that somewhat interesting. But when you, when you dig into the,

50
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:35.840
the words that Alegra was recreating,

51
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.740
he's he places an asterix actually next to these words,

52
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:42.830
because they can't be corroborated by the ancient texts.

53
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.660
So some of these Sumerian words, he, he straight up hypothesizes as existing.

54
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.093
Uh, but they're, they're not,

55
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.250
they can't really be found in the existing tablets. Uh, so it's,

56
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:55.520
it's hard to correlate some of those meanings he'd he draws down from the

57
00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:59.920
Sumerian, but that said, he makes very interesting claims, for example,

58
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:02.080
like in one Corinthians 22,

59
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.620
there's this interesting line where he says about the, we, we preach Christ.

60
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.270
Crucified is, um,

61
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.870
is a skandalon for the Jews and a folly for the Greeks.

62
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.040
And skandalon in Greek means like, um, a bolt or a snare, like a trap,

63
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.720
and Allegro ties it to like a, a tickler, uh, in, in Aramaic,

64
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.680
which is like the, what he calls the, the bolt mushroom and in Sumerian cush,

65
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.520
the gala. And so he's saying that Paul is actually telling the Jews that,

66
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.440
you know, the, the Christ crucified is a mushroom instead of a skandalon,

67
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.620
it's like a, like a code word, like the skandalon is a mushroom.

68
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.060
And then for the Greeks, he says, it's a folly, which is Moya in, in Greek,

69
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:42.850
which actually means Mandrake, which is another psychedelic plant.

70
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.360
So there's all this, this different, you know, wordplay going on,

71
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.650
but it's really hard to tease out any physical forensic evidence for this stuff,

72
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.040
which.

73
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.450
<v 0>Was what I was, what was a Legros position.</v>

74
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:59.220
If I recall correctly that the sacred mushroom was a Amanita muscarinic.

75
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.690
Yeah.

76
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.770
<v 1>That was even the cover of his book was a photo of [inaudible].</v>

77
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.330
<v 0>And that, and that's where I have a, I think Alegra did amazing work,</v>

78
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.900
but that's, that's one area where I, where I have a problem with,

79
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.360
with Amanita muscarinic as the, as the psychedelic of choice in,

80
00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:18.600
in early Christianity,

81
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:23.250
because in sh in shamonic cultures where I'm a muscarinic is

82
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:28.140
used, it's recognized that the potion that the mushroom is much more effective

83
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.050
after it's been passed through a human body,

84
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:35.730
or indeed through the body of a reindeer and emerged in your end. And so,

85
00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:37.860
so the, the, those, those, uh,

86
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.510
shamanistic cultures of Siberia use Amanita mascaras by

87
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:47.430
drinking it in the urine of a shaman who has previously consumed the mushroom.

88
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:50.040
And I don't see a lot of evidence for that in early Christianity.

89
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:53.700
And it's why I like, uh, the work that Brian has done, uh,

90
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.560
looking at the really hard evidence for psychedelics in early Christianity,

91
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:02.280
which are not, which are not in this case. I'm need [inaudible] if I'm correct.

92
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:03.690
Brian, isn't the.

93
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.860
<v 1>Speculation about Amanita mascara that it's seasonable. Uh, it's it's,</v>

94
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:11.820
it's seasonal, it's also genetically variable. Like there's, there's,

95
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.080
there's different species of like much like different fruits tastes differently.

96
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.430
There's different versions of the eMoney miscarry that have more psychedelic

97
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.570
compounds in them.

98
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.770
And then there's all sorts of ways of preparing them that we've completely lost.

99
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.650
Isn't it? Am I getting this wrong? Cause I've only had one,

100
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.980
how many of them were scary experience and it wasn't very convincing. Hmm.

101
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.980
<v 0>Yeah. And this is, this is often, often the case,</v>

102
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.340
but I I'm told I've not had the experience myself,

103
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.990
but I'm told that if you can bear the idea of drinking the Sherman's urine after

104
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:45.660
he, or she has consumed the Amanita [inaudible]

105
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.493
, you will have a really powerful journey, but you don't want to, Sharmane.

106
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.310
<v 1>Just laughing hysterically after you drink. Absolutely. The jokes on you.</v>

107
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:57.260
Stupid. Yeah. There's, there's also so many correlations between, uh,

108
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.150
the Amanita mascara and Santa Claus and Santa Claus to shamans there's.

109
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.550
<v 0>Some red wine. Yeah. There's.</v>

110
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.380
<v 1>Also the, the, you know, the bag, the toys, the,</v>

111
00:06:08.381 --> 00:06:12.440
the fact that they would drive them on, on these, uh, coniferous trees,

112
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.730
the fact that this,

113
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:17.000
these mushrooms have this microrisal relationship with coniferous trees,

114
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.610
where they, they tend to grow under pine trees,

115
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.700
which is the tree that we use for Christmas sheath for the fact that they're

116
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.080
bright red,

117
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.700
like a toy that is in a package waiting for a child to open it up.

118
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.940
It's there's so many of these weird connections, the colors,

119
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.760
the fact that reindeer, or with Santa Claus,

120
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.140
the fact these reindeer fly through the heaven. I mean,

121
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.360
it's that caribou are notoriously attracted to, uh,

122
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:46.460
Amanita miscarry a mushrooms. In fact,

123
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:50.900
people that have had psychedelic rituals and gone outside to urinate have talked

124
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:51.734
about caribou,

125
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.760
knocking them over to try to get to their urine and caribou are reindeer,

126
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.000
and they have been observed eating these things.

127
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.340
So they have this weird relationship.

128
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.090
All those things are together connected in some sort of a strange way.

129
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:09.860
And there's also a history of shamonic rituals being outlawed in

130
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:13.880
Siberia. And the way they got around it was they would come through the chimney,

131
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.020
which is just crazy. They would, they would climb onto people's roofs and,

132
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.500
and slide down the chimney to, uh, deliver the mushrooms. It's.

133
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.051
<v 0>Just another,</v>

134
00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:27.490
another example of the way that our culture takes an ancient historical truth

135
00:07:27.491 --> 00:07:31.780
and completely castrated and turns and turns it into Santa Claus.

136
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.400
You know, whereas what we're at,

137
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:37.810
what we're actually dealing with are profound experiences in deeply altered

138
00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:39.730
states of consciousness. It's also.

139
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.900
<v 1>This information seems to have been lost fairly recently,</v>

140
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.030
because if you go back to the early 19,

141
00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:50.890
fifties and forties in look at birthday or Christmas cards that Christmas

142
00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:52.510
cards and depictions of Christmas,

143
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.890
almost always contained elves and Amanita mascara mushrooms,

144
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.090
the Amanita miscarry,

145
00:07:58.091 --> 00:08:01.690
a mushroom was synonymous with Christmas for some strange reason.

146
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.380
Have you ever seen those old? Yeah, yeah. It's crazy. Right? Like what is that.

147
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.030
<v 2>A little bit the, the, the fairytale books too. You can't, you can't avoid the,</v>

148
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:10.930
the Amanita yeah. Everywhere you look,

149
00:08:10.931 --> 00:08:14.710
which is why I think Allegro was also interested writing in 1970 and studying it

150
00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:17.790
in the fifties and sixties. I think that's why he glommed onto the Amanita, but.

151
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.630
<v 1>Chin unconvincing, mushroom,</v>

152
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.570
like the people that I know that have experienced it,

153
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.240
and in terms of a psychedelic ritual, it's just,

154
00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:28.400
I don't know anybody who's really blown their brains out with it. No. And.

155
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.070
<v 2>And Gordon Wasson also thought it was the, the ingredient behind Soma as well.</v>

156
00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:37.760
He writes a book about this in 1968, Soma divine mushroom of immortality. That,

157
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:40.270
that, that was his guest to, for, for Soma, but.

158
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.690
<v 1>Was experienced with siliciden,</v>

159
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.870
which is so universally regarded as being effective.

160
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.130
That's why it's so confusing.

161
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.060
<v 2>I always found that strange too, to be honest. So, so, so Wasson, I mean,</v>

162
00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:53.500
to explain where this, where this comes from,

163
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.680
Watson has this incredible experience with Maria Sabina in 1955 in Wahaca,

164
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:03.180
Mexico. And when he consumes the SA we think philosophy Mexicana,

165
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.000
and, uh, he is catapulted to the heavens and he has this vision, uh, that,

166
00:09:08.001 --> 00:09:11.490
that he describes as the realest thing he's ever experienced, uh,

167
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:14.850
under the influence of the, of the psilocybin and the thought occurs to him.

168
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:18.810
He writes later in 1957 in life magazine, he says that the,

169
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.320
could it be the case that the divine mushrooms are in fact,

170
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:24.450
the answer behind the ancient mysteries,

171
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.950
which is why he then went and started looking at the Amanita perhaps, um,

172
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.100
or eventually ergot, which is where I pick up the scent. Uh,

173
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.780
at some point in his correspondence with Albert health MUN, they, they together,

174
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.850
uh, began focusing on ergot, like we said,

175
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:43.260
because it's so common and so natural, but so highly toxic to,

176
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.540
uh, and Albert claimed to have this experience with it. And so for,

177
00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:49.950
for years and years after teaming up with Carl ruck,

178
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.540
they were convinced that ERCOT had had to somehow be involved. Episodes.

179
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.770
<v 1>Of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>
