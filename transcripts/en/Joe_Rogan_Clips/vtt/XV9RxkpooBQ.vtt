00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And so, you know, for example,</v>

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.140
and this is something that I think would be kind of interesting to talk about.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.760
Um,

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.690
everybody is losing their mind at the moment in the space that you and I sort of

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.640
co inhabit of ideas and trying to figure out how do we remain sane and

6
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.840
plugged in and open-hearted and open to new things, but also rigorous and fair.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.730
Like all of these weird pressures.

8
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.960
<v 1>The ideas behind the intellectual dark web that you coined this</v>

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.070
concept of having a bunch of people that have different ideologies,

10
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:36.420
but yet share this common theme of wanting to have real honest

11
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.480
communication and honest conversations and try to figure out,

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.940
instead of looking at things from an ideological perspective,

13
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:46.170
look at things from an honest objective point and try to see the way the other

14
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.700
people view things in hearted.

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.460
<v 0>And I'm not trying to destroy each other right.</v>

16
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.500
And effectively trying to become the adults in the room as we watch the kids

17
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:59.250
run. Right. Right. And, and, and not always, not always achieving that now,

18
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.120
because I refuse to actually say what it was or who was in it,

19
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.090
because there was a lot of pressure to codify it. I knew that if I codified it.

20
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.260
<v 1>Uh, it would die. I want a membership card. You have, you have one,</v>

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.180
but if I don't, if I don't get one, you have.

22
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.430
<v 0>We just don't tell the members where it is because it's.</v>

23
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.310
<v 1>Um, there's an article about the IDW that doesn't mention me. I'm like, yes.</v>

24
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.010
So taking away slipping away.

25
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.310
<v 0>Well, I do like Pachino in three, always going to drag you back.</v>

26
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.170
<v 1>But there are,</v>

27
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.920
there's been some discussion about certain members in certain people that are

28
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:35.970
losing their marbles. Yeah. I think it's pressure, you know, and I think, um,

29
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.620
one of the things that we're all recognizing from whether it's the internet

30
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.830
and the, or just celebrity in general, which is,

31
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:48.630
I think part of the culprit is especially if you're reading comments and

32
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:49.890
articles that are written about you,

33
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:54.300
which I do not recommend if you are doing that, don't do that.

34
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.950
If you're doing that, you are subject to a massive amount of pressure. Yeah.

35
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.620
It's a, it's a lot of pressure. And sometimes people,

36
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.120
they apply that sometimes that pressure can help you.

37
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.130
Like if it's a good friend or someone who you trust and it's done with

38
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.420
intellectual honesty and they just really,

39
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.540
they think that there's maybe a flaw in your thinking,

40
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:21.750
or maybe this could help you, or maybe this is an issue.

41
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:24.630
And then you realize that and you self-correct. That's great,

42
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.740
but there's a lot of people that are bending to the will of the masses.

43
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.100
And they also are responding to the pressure of the masses.

44
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.350
<v 0>I even think it's the massive reasons I read my comments is because I</v>

45
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.890
want to know what Russia's thinking. I'm not kidding. Listen to me, Joe,

46
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.840
here we go. Let's go down the rabbit hole.

47
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.630
<v 1>Well, for sure. And we went, we talked about this recently,</v>

48
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.100
let me just say this before you get going. Yeah.

49
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.310
We knew that something was going on years ago.

50
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.560
I used to have a message board and uh, on my message board on my website, um,

51
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.720
it became problematic for legal reasons.

52
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:00.460
People were putting a bunch of illegal up there and I was kind of responsible

53
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.820
for them. A few issues came up where I was like, oh Jesus, I'm going to,

54
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.110
I'm going to get in real trouble. We had an influx and by an influx,

55
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:12.580
I mean thousands and thousands of Russian emails

56
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.190
signing up for my message board. I mean,

57
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:19.960
thousands with really similar email addresses and

58
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.730
they would post and pretend they're from Cleveland or post and be mad

59
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.810
that we don't have enough Nazis on or whatever the it would be, you know? Right.

60
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.890
It would just be the same thing that the IRA was doing.

61
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:35.830
The internet research agency was doing with Facebook and Google and Twitter.

62
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.760
We were seeing this like four or five years ago that this stuff was kind of

63
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.460
happening where they were re recognizing that the disease,

64
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.860
large portals of discussion.

65
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.700
And so they're trying to manipulate the discussion and turn certain discussions

66
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:52.750
toxic and, and, and, you know, and come up with preposterous,

67
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:57.040
conspiracy theories and attack people for nonsensical reasons.

68
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.870
<v 0>Well, this is the thing I keep seeing the same message,</v>

69
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.460
modified a hundred different ways from a bunch of accounts that have

70
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:07.720
suspicious similarity,

71
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.020
not one of these accounts usually is followed by anyone I care about.

72
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.640
And then they have a few high value accounts with blurry photographs of a person

73
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:16.810
that like, I,

74
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.590
I think somebody is like putting real money into that account to create a fake

75
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:25.540
person who just dog doggedly follows you and is constantly trying to

76
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.010
talk to you in your ear, that account.

77
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.380
<v 1>But how do you know that that's what that is.</v>

78
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.440
And how do you know it's not just some person schizophrenia that really is

79
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:34.660
really interested in Eric Weinstock.

80
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.010
<v 0>A couple of times I've tried to like talk to the person, uh,</v>

81
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.920
and suddenly the thing vanishes it's like, you're so disgusting.

82
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:44.050
I would never talk to you. It's like goodbye click.

83
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.170
<v 1>It's like, well, maybe they just panicked. It could be just a person.</v>

84
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.240
<v 0>Well, that's the thing we, we, you never know. On the other hand, um,</v>

85
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.390
you remember when we took that photograph at that dinner, um,

86
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.750
there was this huge number of jokes about Ben Shapiro and a booster

87
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:04.390
seat that were all slightly different versions of the joke.

88
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.000
And all of the accounts were like striking with similar.

89
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.280
I was just thinking like, well, I, I could imagine a little bit of this,

90
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.890
but it's way too many.

91
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.400
And this is part of what I believe.

92
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:23.080
I believe that we are in a new world in which a lot of the

93
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:25.270
grassroots stuff is, is AstroTurf.

94
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.590
And if you start to listen to it, you start to get pushed.

95
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:33.430
And I start to watch certain tactics and I make models of the tactics. You know,

96
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:36.070
like one of the tactics is, gosh, Eric,

97
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:40.660
I once thought that you had a lot of integrity and now I know that X, you know,

98
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.030
if you don't, if you don't address this situation, uh, I'm done following.

99
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.570
It's like, oh really goodbye click. But,

100
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.090
uh, I believe that, um,

101
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.320
I believe that there are sophisticated players who were engaged in trying to

102
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.080
either boost our signal or start to alter the signal.

103
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.990
Somebody will be up, somebody will be down. Uh,

104
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.260
and then there's like really weird dynamics. Um,

105
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.090
I think that there's a very strange thing going on, not with Dave Rubin,

106
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:18.870
but with the crowd of people that is just trying to eat Dave Rubin and

107
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.720
blind him and confuse him and this, uh, you know, this, this guy, Sam,

108
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.010
Cedar, who do you think he's a Russian, I hope he is. Well, I don't know.

109
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.640
I don't think he's Russian, but I do think that his, his,

110
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.330
I think he has a grassroots following. I don't think this is inauthentic.

111
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.580
That just loves to, um,

112
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.750
dark harass. Well, dunk, drag. I hate this language. I just can't.

113
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.550
<v 1>I like the word Dunkin. Oh really?</v>

114
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.260
<v 0>Yeah. That's fine. No, I'm not. I'm not a fan. No, no, no, because it's just,</v>

115
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:54.650
it cheapens all conversation. Oh, you got dunked on, you got dragged.

116
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.130
It's just like, oh, this is that thing. In third grade that I ever figured.

117
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.770
<v 1>Well, they found out that he won't engage with them.</v>

118
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.610
And so they think it's cute to just constantly on them.

119
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.230
And they also think it's cute to take anything that he says and interpret it in

120
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:13.910
the worst possible way possible and not think of it as him

121
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.290
just being a guy.

122
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:20.240
Who's trying to talk about things on the fly and maybe isn't even prepared

123
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:23.360
about the subject at hand. Like one of the things that comes up on this show,

124
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.780
like, you know, we, we were talking before we were going to go on there.

125
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.930
We're going to talk about Mike, come on. Let's just talk. Yeah.

126
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.990
And so when you do that, come on, let's just talk thing.

127
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.210
You never know what the is going to come up and you might have a poorly

128
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:42.380
formed idea of what a subject is and you just start rambling.

129
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.630
<v 0>This is what I've done in my two previous.</v>

130
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.400
<v 1>Have not, but it seems, you know, it's easy to think that you did that,</v>

131
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.750
but with Dave, um, you know,

132
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.890
there's enough moments where he's misstepped,

133
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.210
where they just feel like, okay, we got a wounded antelope.

134
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.790
<v 0>Yeah. They're trying to pick him off. And, you know,</v>

135
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:07.670
I think there was probably a move to do Shapiro.

136
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:10.280
And there was a period where you were seemingly in the cross hairs,

137
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:13.300
but you're hard to kill. And, you know, I have no doubt that.

138
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.880
<v 1>I wouldn't even notice it. See, that's the,</v>

139
00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:18.470
that's the benefit of not paying attention.

140
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.680
And this is something that I've been pretty rigorous about over the last like

141
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.610
six months.

142
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.473
<v 0>Well,</v>

143
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.100
Sam Harris and Dave Rubin have all given me versions of this advice.

144
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.870
And I worry about it because I'm not large enough yet

145
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.490
that I've been the target of a steady campaign.

146
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.200
But what happens is you see people's feedback loops interrupted

147
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.630
and in part to course, correct, you kind of want to know was I,

148
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.810
was I too harsh with that? Kind of like when I went on with Jordan Peterson, uh,

149
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:51.680
on Dave show,

150
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.940
I was more aggressive because I think I'd seen Jordan and Brett on your show

151
00:08:56.941 --> 00:09:01.410
together. And, uh, I come from an ethnic family, we interrupt each other.

152
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:06.180
That's normal and Jordan is an interrupter. And so, um,

153
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.230
what I found is,

154
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:11.070
is that I probably was intuiting that I had to be more forceful.

155
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.810
And a lot of the comments said, wow, Eric,

156
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:14.940
I haven't really seen you this aggressive. Was.

157
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.640
<v 1>It the three of you on the conversation? It started.</v>

158
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.320
<v 0>Off Dave, Jordan and myself, and then Ben Shapiro came in for an hour.</v>

159
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.250
And I think Sam Harris might've been, uh, scheduled to come in.

160
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.093
I don't remember.

161
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.260
<v 1>Here's an issue always with more than one person. There's a reason why I do.</v>

162
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:33.150
One-on-ones almost exclusively.

163
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.280
Like even when I had a Bob Lasar with Jeremy, Corbell, uh, just,

164
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:42.660
just having a third person that wants to chime in like oftentimes interrupts the

165
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:44.940
flow of conversation. Like in that case,

166
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.150
it was because I wanted to lock in on Bob Lasar right.

167
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.240
I wanted to get all my feedback. I want to find out is this guy full of,

168
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.230
but what I want to, I want to lock in with him. And there's another one. And,

169
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.720
and also, and also this is another person,

170
00:09:57.721 --> 00:10:00.780
even if they have a good thing to say, it's a distraction. It becomes a.

171
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.360
<v 0>Well, you never know when one of these is going to work. And when one of the,</v>

172
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.680
when it works, it can be magical. And when it, when it doesn't, you know,

173
00:10:06.681 --> 00:10:09.150
it's a little bit like jazz guys,

174
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.710
if that group is meant to be, then they don't trip over each other solos.

175
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:15.330
And they're trying to come up with something, even.

176
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.120
<v 1>With three great friends. I have this issue. I mean.</v>

177
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.360
<v 0>I've seen great stuff with multiple people on your show and I've seen stuff that</v>

178
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:21.900
doesn't work.
