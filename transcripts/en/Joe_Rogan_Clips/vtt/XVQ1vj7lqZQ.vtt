<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.900
<v 2>I mean, I think that is kind of a root of anxiety is like modern life,</v>

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.840
like things trigger, fight, or flight that shouldn't necessarily, you know,

4
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.610
it's like stress at work and your boss or whatever.

5
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:15.120
And it like triggers that same thing. Yes. But, um, yeah, it is true that,

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.230
that in my life,

7
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:19.410
at least the things that trigger fight or flight are like legitimate life or

8
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:21.420
death sorts of situations where it's like, oh, you, you know,

9
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.820
you are about to fall off a cliff or like, uh, you know,

10
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:26.610
like the storm is coming and you're out in the middle of nowhere and you're

11
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:28.260
like, I'm about to get worked. You know,

12
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.320
like typically when I feel that kind of major anxiety,

13
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:35.100
it's like for a real reason. And, um, I mean, it is interesting. Yeah. I mean,

14
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.680
it is, it is appropriate that way. It's like, it's like,

15
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.720
it's like the correct outlet for that kind of stress.

16
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.420
<v 0>It really does completely make sense as to,</v>

17
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.590
and also most of the guys that I've met that do what you do.

18
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.800
And I don't know if they met anybody that does exactly what you do, but yeah,

19
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.460
guys that climb a lot. They're pretty chill. Yeah. Yeah.

20
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.391
<v 1>It's a pretty well, dude.</v>

21
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:58.440
I think part of that is because you get worked by nature so often that then when

22
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.960
you're in sort of normal life, everything feels pretty relaxed.

23
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.750
Cause you're kind of like, oh, I'm physically comfortable. I'm fed,

24
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.630
I'm hydrated. I'm like, you know, my body is fine.

25
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:09.060
I'm not about to just get hammered by them by nature, you know?

26
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.770
<v 0>Yeah. That's my philosophy about really difficult exercise.</v>

27
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:16.620
It's really important because it makes other things seem easy.

28
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.820
And the stress of regular,

29
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.720
I think we have just like a standard base level of stress.

30
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.580
And when you artificially impose a higher base level electively,

31
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.100
like whether it's through climbing or other kinds of exercise,

32
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.840
whatever you're doing, it makes the rest of life seem easier to see me.

33
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.520
<v 1>Yeah, dude, I had, uh,</v>

34
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.000
earlier this year there was a winter storm warning for Vegas.

35
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.180
It does snow in Vegas, sometimes in the mountains, especially like get gets.

36
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.660
Now there's a winter storm warning for this like storm coming through and I'd

37
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:48.890
climbed like 20 days in a row basically or something.

38
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:52.170
And I wanted to use the storm day to try to hike this one section of the

39
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.970
traverse. And I'm trying to do of all these peaks.

40
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.300
I figured I would like take advantage of a non climbing day to do the one

41
00:01:57.301 --> 00:01:59.520
walking section to like figure out where the route goes.

42
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.520
And so I went out in this crazy storm and when I started,

43
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.170
it was like snowing a little and I was like, ah,

44
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.730
and crazy when it's really cold.

45
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.940
And I was trying out these new like waterproof layers just to see how actually I

46
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:11.820
wanted to try them out before the jungle to see if they'd be good jungle layers.

47
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.780
And um, and so I go up into the mountain anyway, long story short,

48
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.110
I get completely worked. It turns out visibility's nothing.

49
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:19.950
I didn't know where I was going.

50
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:23.250
I get lost in the mountains and it wound up being basically too difficult to

51
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:26.310
train, to travel through, uh, in the snow, like, uh,

52
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.340
because I'd sort of taken it for granted, but in red rock, on those mountains,

53
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.490
you, you walk on these like exposed sandstone slabs all the time,

54
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.620
but when you cover them in like six inches of snow,

55
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.300
it's like really kind of horrifying.

56
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:37.860
You can't just like walk up the slabs anymore.

57
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:40.860
It's like now a total tobogganing death drop where you're going to like slide,

58
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.100
you know? So I was like, anyway, so I go up quite a ways.

59
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.030
Eventually I just had to give up and like turn around, but I'm now, you know,

60
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.400
2,500 feet, like up this mountain side.

61
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.660
And then I turned around and then it all is way more socked in.

62
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:56.130
I couldn't even see my tracks anymore.

63
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.920
Cause everything's like filled in and visibility is nothing. And so I,

64
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.310
it like a Garmin watch on.

65
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:02.560
So I kept like looking at the little track on my watch being like,

66
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.110
am I to the left or the right of the track that I came up, you know,

67
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:09.070
like full mountains, mountainside keep falling down and you know,

68
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.080
there's like you were falling. Yeah.

69
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.700
But like sliding over things or tripping on,

70
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:16.090
Roxy's really steep hillside with like, and you're stepping through, you know,

71
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:17.830
say six or eight inches of fresh powder,

72
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.890
but underneath it's still like loose rocks and cactuses and things like that.

73
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:24.850
So it's like, you know, the terrain is not like a snow base or something. Right.

74
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:27.640
Like you're just stepping through it and falling over anyway.

75
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.200
So I fell into cactuses a bunch of times.

76
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.700
And so the thing is I was totally hypothermic, completely wet, totally worked.

77
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.260
And my hand had all these gag distortions in it and my other hand was too numb

78
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:39.700
to like manipulate anything.

79
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.700
So I wanted like biting the biggest thorns out and then just left the rest of

80
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:44.050
them. Cause it's just, I was just,

81
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.560
I just couldn't use my hands and just keep staggering down the mountain. Anyway.

82
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.120
Eventually I like made it back to the car, made it back to the house.

83
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.240
And then I had my wife, all the thorns out. Cause I like,

84
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:54.820
I couldn't really use my hands. I was so worked, but I was kinda like,

85
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.940
but that was like my rest day adventure. You know what I mean? I mean,

86
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:01.630
it turned out being, it turned out being way more. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

87
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:03.910
I was hoping that it was going to go better than that and it didn't really work

88
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:07.120
out, but that is kind of the point that when you take on that elective low,

89
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.850
you know, I was like, I had a goal that I wanted to piece together.

90
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:12.490
The section of a hike didn't work out that way. I wound up, you know,

91
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.340
building a bunch of character instead, but you know, you're just like,

92
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.780
that's just a normal day out. You know?

93
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.700
It's like when you're adventuring in the mountains, sometimes,

94
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.760
sometimes there's winter storm advisory has actually happened. You know,

95
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.120
it's just easy living in the desert. You're like, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.

96
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:27.460
And then you're like, no, it was not fine. It was totally Krug.

97
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.690
<v 0>That's pretty crazy in that. That does speak to what we're saying.</v>

98
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.553
Like if you're doing.

99
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.350
<v 1>Yeah. And that's just like a normal day, you know,</v>

100
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:38.950
like that's not even like the crazy like, oh, I thought I was going to die.

101
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:40.810
I was just like, oh, it was just deeply uncomfortable.

102
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:43.750
And like sort of on edge for a while.
