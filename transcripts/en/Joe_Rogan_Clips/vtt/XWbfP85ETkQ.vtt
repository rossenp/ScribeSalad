00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How's I, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.760
I had my sunglasses on top of my hat and looked for them for 10 minutes before I

3
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:10.590
was looking at my phone the other day. I'm like,

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.860
I'm with my I'm with my son and I'm looking for my phone. And I'm like,

5
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:18.240
where the is my phone? Where the is it? He's he's next to me.

6
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:22.860
I'm on my phone playing a game. Oh, right next to me, statue a phone up.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.550
Yeah. Those kids love those God phone and downloaded the game for him. Oh,

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:31.440
you forgot? Yeah. Getting old. Yeah. He was playing a sniper game and I said,

9
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:32.790
you're not allowed to play that at all.

10
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.790
And then I saw how cool it was and I ended up planet. Whoa.

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You try to keep him from violent games. I do. But it's a,

12
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.820
it's like telling a tree not to blow in the wind. It's interesting.

13
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:46.800
Dakota Meyer. Who's a, you know, decorated veteran and you know,

14
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.270
medal of honor, one of the very few would ever when it was alive. Yeah.

15
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.920
He thinks that video games and violent video games,

16
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:58.380
desensitize people. Now, when someone like that,

17
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.420
who's open with the struggles with PTSD, share, killed a man with a rock. Okay.

18
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.840
Tell me the story about, he was in a fist fight with a guy, you know,

19
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.670
in war with the enemy and picked up a rock and beat his brains in

20
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.770
Jesus. This guy is telling you that video games can desensitize you.

21
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.100
I'm going to listen. Yeah, I am. I'm going to listen to him. I am too.

22
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.370
He's you know, he understands. Yeah.

23
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.700
You certainly get very good at these kids who have the guns, but it also,

24
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:30.630
for some people that don't have any tendency towards violence like you or me or

25
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:33.720
Jamie or anybody else that we know that's fine and healthy.

26
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.170
They're not going to make you more likely to go shoot people. And that's a fact.

27
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.250
Yeah. That's the thing it's like, are you saying that you playing red,

28
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:44.580
dead redemption is going to make you want to go out and shoot people? No,

29
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:47.880
it's not going to have any effect on you as at all,

30
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.130
but will it have an effect on minors?

31
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.760
I think there are a couple of things going on. One is I think they're addictive.

32
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.610
Oh yeah. I've seen that with my own eyes, with my children. They're addictive.

33
00:01:56.611 --> 00:02:00.900
And when you, and when you take the game away, they exhibit withdrawal.

34
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.730
They freak the out, man. Come on, turn one more game. Yeah. Genius.

35
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.230
Crazy. They stomped the ground. I know. And then, um,

36
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.450
and then also I think when you play video games,

37
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:16.530
you can get so addicted that you will isolate and you'll play those games all

38
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:20.820
day. Oh, what's that? What's that do to your social interaction?

39
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:23.400
What's that do to your body? Should you be doing a sport?

40
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:25.650
What's that do to you later on? Can you get a girl?

41
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.570
But when you've been sitting in front of it, there,

42
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.300
lots of things that we don't know. I mean, do they lend,

43
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.290
did do video games when you play them on that level,

44
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:38.670
do they retard your social skills and your, you know, I mean,

45
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:40.740
there's a lot of considerations. Well,

46
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:43.470
I'm also in favor of you doing anything you want.

47
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:46.650
If there's some people that would make the same argument about someone who's

48
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:50.010
addicted to reading. Sure. There's a lot of people that are in their head,

49
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:52.050
just reading novels. But yeah,

50
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.080
but those arguments word you against before video games,

51
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:57.960
you just don't hear it anymore because you just hear the more accelerated

52
00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.440
version.

53
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.250
What it is is basically an engaging human co creation and engaging human

54
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:05.470
creation. That's designed to captivate your attention,

55
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:09.400
whether it's a novel or a film or anything, like things are designed.

56
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:11.110
That's what art is in a lot of ways.

57
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:14.230
And you go to an art gallery and you stare at someone's work.

58
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.680
It's like some human creation that captivates your attention and it gets you

59
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.760
locked in. And we see a really beautiful piece. Like we were in Italy and, uh,

60
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:26.050
we were in Florence and we went to the same ancient, um, ancient church.

61
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.690
And they had this beautiful works of art on the wall.

62
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.120
And they're just fascinating, fascinating stuff.

63
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.870
And you try to picture like the people that painted this a thousand years ago

64
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:38.320
and what life was like, and you're looking at the intricacies of these dresses,

65
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:42.430
like that's an engaging human creation that captivates your attention. We just,

66
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.320
we have merit in that kind of engaging captivated piece of art.

67
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.760
We, we have put merit in that,

68
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.860
but we don't put merit in video games for some reason.

69
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.060
It's almost like it's too engaging. It's too much. It's too captivated.

70
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.610
It's too. It's an interesting question. Why, why not? You know,

71
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.020
cause we know it's detrimental.

72
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.350
We inherently know that you're going to waste giant chunks of your life.

73
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.070
Unless you're someone who liked got a trust fund, you never have to work again.

74
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.330
You got $10 million in the bank and you can just chill forever and you want to

75
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:12.880
play video games all day. I'm like, all right, look, if you w I mean,

76
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:15.490
I don't know what to tell you. You don't have. Yeah. But what is it?

77
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:19.300
Something like Picasso's where Anka or, you know, that, that painting of, uh,

78
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.880
when Spain was bombed by the Luftwaffe, um,

79
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.840
before world war II and to bring that up because it's a kind of a haunting

80
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:26.800
painting, but why does that,

81
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.860
why is that still something that's considered a masterpiece?

82
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.580
And then like you said, there's like these incredible images,

83
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.390
there's incredible imagery and what we can do with an iPad. Well,

84
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.720
it's all the same thing in some way, it's a human creation.

85
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.530
But the thing about these digital human creations is they have this alien,

86
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.300
like cold feel to them. Like there's something about digital things,

87
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:51.910
even if they're spectacular, like there's no emotion in this thing,

88
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:55.940
this thing is a creation. It's a one and a zero it's it's it's computer.

89
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.660
Whereas like, if you're just reading novels all day,

90
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.200
like if you're that person that just the world, I'm going to go in my house.

91
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:04.420
I'm gonna shut the door. I'm going to light a candle.

92
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.120
I'm going to sit there and I'm going to read novels all day.

93
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.610
I have $10 million in the bank that I got from my trust fund.

94
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.120
I just like reading. Noah would say, you're a loser. Like what does Brian do?

95
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.030
He's amazing. You know, he got his trust fund and then said,

96
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:17.710
I want to educate myself. I just want to read.

97
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.480
And he just reads all the great works.

98
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.910
And he sits at home all day and just reads. It's amazing. Yeah.

99
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.570
But that is somehow more intriguing because what you're doing is,

100
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.050
is developing and expanding your understanding.

101
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.910
And so when you do that,

102
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.980
what that means is you're someone who is worth speaking to you might have some

103
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:38.590
secrets and some understanding that I can use.

104
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.130
So when you talk to somebody who's really gone down that rabbit hole,

105
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.240
like Joseph Campbell,

106
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.260
who read all the philosophers and everybody who influenced them, you want to,

107
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.490
you want to hear what he has to say,

108
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:53.050
because he's organized his brain and his thoughts in a way that might shed some

109
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:57.620
light on the things that are confusing to you that are, you know,

110
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.980
that are depressing or that are scaring you or whatever.

111
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.830
And you do need leaders like that.

112
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.060
The leaders of thought that can put things into perspective, you know,

113
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.530
that can kind of tell you why there's a difference between say Picasso and this

114
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:17.120
other artist. I don't know. No. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, for sure.

115
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:20.450
But you also need people that know how to play the out of a video game.

116
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.640
The thing is those people don't get any credit.

117
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.820
When you see these kids today that are winning these video game tournaments and

118
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:28.520
winning a million dollars. And their parents told them to not play games.

119
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.540
Meanwhile, the dad works at iHub like, Hey. You know,

120
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:35.870
these guys are making real money from his stupid game that you told him to never

121
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:39.560
play. And they're filling like arenas crazy.

122
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.330
This is where the world goes.

123
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:46.220
The world goes to the most engaging creation that human beings have that locks

124
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:47.300
in other people's attention.

125
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.380
And the most engaging creations for young people are these video games. Yeah.

126
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.460
They're just group efforts. They're giant group corporate efforts, whether it's,

127
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.860
you know, a grand theft auto or the new doom, when's that new doom coming out.

128
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.970
But I feel like doom. And I do think there's a difference.

129
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.930
I do think that when you're really good at a video game,

130
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.800
there's, there is an addictive quality to it. Yes.

131
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:15.950
You're really good at doing this thing. Right. But at the end of the day,

132
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:17.570
it's a game, right.

133
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.980
And that game is somewhat masturbatory that game.

134
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:25.730
I don't know that when you really get good at Fort, not Knight or doom,

135
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.800
I don't know if that game in any way expands

136
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.630
your understanding or your ability to contribute to the larger

137
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:41.120
conversation. Okay. But I'm just saying, does Snoke,

138
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.090
uh, so is that the strategy game? No. How dare you? What is it? What,

139
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.210
no. Chess. Chess is a good one, but, well, no,

140
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:51.770
there's a reason why I said snugger. Yeah.

141
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.770
The reason why I said snookers cause you're executing, you're actually doing,

142
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.400
you have to do,

143
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.610
you have to keep it together and you have to physically execute a move.

144
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.780
It's a giant pool table that they played in England and they play with red balls

145
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:07.040
and blue balls and pink balls and black balls. And I don't know,

146
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.090
I don't understand the game. I've watched it a bunch. Yeah. But, uh,

147
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.860
there's these people that play it and you know, it's less popular.

148
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:20.360
Now. One of the guys, one of the bedtime guys got busted. He got busted.

149
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.760
I'm doing a fixed game. Like someone,

150
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.440
someone paid them off to lose and he agreed to do it for a certain amount of

151
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:27.710
money.

152
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.490
But the thing is that a game like that is well respected because someone has to

153
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:35.390
execute. It's not just thinking you have to ask to kill off the shot. Yes.

154
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.590
It's a skill. Yeah. And also people love to watch it. Who play snooker.

155
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.370
Probably not me, but people will know the difference. Right. A video game.

156
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.170
You have to execute as well.

157
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.440
But it doesn't seem like you're doing it because you're not physically,

158
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.140
you just moving your hands around and moving a keyboard.

159
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:55.920
And it doesn't seem like it's as skillful, but it is. Yeah.

160
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.570
That's a really interesting question. I don't know.

161
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.000
You're you're asking a really interesting question. I think so,

162
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.600
because what they are doing is they're providing entertainment for people,

163
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:07.470
just like a great pool player. Right? Right. So when you watch pool,

164
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.300
you're doing it for stakes. You're doing it for money,

165
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:13.500
but you're also watching these people who have mastered this insane geometry.

166
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:18.090
What? We respect some versions of that. Like golf. Yeah. We respect golf. Yeah.

167
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.600
You want some land and also the, the, the money that's available.

168
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.080
That's why we don't respect bowling. Yeah. If someone's a good bowler,

169
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:27.600
like congratulate, pat them on the head. Good for you. Good for you.

170
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.490
Nobody cares. But if you're one of the best golf players of all time,

171
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.940
you know, that golfer is going to make millions and millions of dollars a year.

172
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.790
But that guy is a baller. He's a golfer.

173
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:41.940
And he's at the top of the food chain when it comes to any of those skills

174
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:45.660
require you to master yourself and in many ways. Oh yeah, sure.

175
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.260
But the thing is that the video games, it seems like it's,

176
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.080
it's happening in a digital realm. And because of that,

177
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:54.780
it's not taken as seriously. Even if you found out they made more money,

178
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.300
like when you find out someone's a successful video game player,

179
00:09:57.301 --> 00:09:58.710
there's a certain party. You'll be like, oh,

180
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:00.570
why are you wasting your time with that? Even if you go,

181
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.430
he makes $5 million a year. You're like, oh, well, huh, good for him. Yeah.

182
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.940
Huh. It seems weird. Right? There's like a weird, you don't,

183
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.480
it's still not good. Even though you know what it is for us who are older,

184
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.370
it's subversive. Yes. For guys that are our age, it's subversive.

185
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.270
It's we don't trust it. We don't like it. We don't understand it.

186
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.680
And it scares us a little bit because it's also reminds us of our own

187
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.180
mortality.

188
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.420
We're also brainwashed the thing in the video games are for losing that. So, so,

189
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.100
so we have a, we have an stereotypical idea of what a field game player is,

190
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.370
all that stuff. So, so for older people, I'm, I'm feeling,

191
00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:44.520
I feel left out. I don't understand it. Uh, and I, uh,

192
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.520
and I feel like they're being bad and they should listen to me.

193
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.590
Whereas chess is noble. Well, chess is someone playing chess. That's noble,

194
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.550
sexual special. You find out someone who's really good at chess. Like, okay.

195
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.950
Is impressive. They can orient. They can think deeply.

196
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.200
If a girl could be TJ beat your at chess,

197
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.900
I dated a girl once she was really good at chess. So humiliating.

198
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.540
Shut me down.
