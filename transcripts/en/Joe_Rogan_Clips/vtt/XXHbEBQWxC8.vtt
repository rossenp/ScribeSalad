00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>The general Hogan experience. Now, Donald Trump has 74.</v>

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:07.260
He's overweight needs cheeseburgers every day.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.090
When a guy like that catches COVID and is fine in four

4
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:16.260
days, people get very dismissive of it,

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.650
unfortunately. Right. What did he receive?

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.580
What kind of treatment did he receive and how different is it than what the

7
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:25.620
average person would receive if they got sick?

8
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.920
<v 1>So he, he faced a very significant risk of death and I think he got lucky.</v>

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.450
Um, so remember his doctors put them on dexamethazone. So,

10
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:40.250
so far we only have one proven drug, uh, that lowers your risk of death.

11
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:41.600
If you're seriously ill from COVID.

12
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:45.770
And that's a very simple steroid called dexamethazone and, um,

13
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.260
Ramdev severe has not been shown to lower mortality. Um,

14
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.200
it has been shown to lower your length of hospital stay.

15
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:55.370
So there's some benefit to it,

16
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:57.740
but it doesn't appear to lower your risk of death.

17
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.070
<v 0>And the difference between lowering your risk of hospital,</v>

18
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:03.050
stay and lowering your risk of death.

19
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:06.620
Why would they let you out of the hospital if you hadn't shown significant

20
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:10.640
health improvements and wouldn't significant health improvements when

21
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:15.230
significant health improvements, SIG signify that your body's recovering better.

22
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.930
<v 1>Yeah, it's a mystery and it's confusing.</v>

23
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:21.050
And when the first room desk of your trial was published a few months ago,

24
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.150
it didn't show a benefit for mortality, but it showed, but it showed a trend.

25
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:27.890
It looked like it would help. And it made sense.

26
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:31.340
Like if it's lowering your hospital duration, probably it's good for you.

27
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:32.750
And it'll also lower your risk of death,

28
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.440
but then another trial came out much bigger trial as part of the, um,

29
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.140
think it was called the solidarity consortium,

30
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.320
either the solidarity or the recovery. I can't remember right now,

31
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.430
consortium out of England, which show that actually roomed us of your head,

32
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:50.720
no benefit for, um, mortality. Now, how can that be? Imagine that,

33
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.250
imagine that, uh,

34
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.430
you have a hundred people who are sick and in the group that gets from this

35
00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:56.570
severe, uh,

36
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.160
they only wind up Spain spending an average of 10 days in the hospital, but, um,

37
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.030
10 of the people die. And in the other study, uh,

38
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:06.890
the people that did not get REM death severe,

39
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.850
a a hundred people get sick and they spend an average of 12 days in the

40
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:13.130
hospital, but again, 10 of them die.

41
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.840
So the rum death severe has lowered the hospital duration from 12 to 10 days,

42
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.680
but it hasn't affected the probability of people dying that's entirely possible.

43
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.600
And that is in fact what appears to have. Yeah.

44
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.660
<v 0>And this was a study you said that was in England.</v>

45
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.200
<v 1>Yes. It was a large study. That was, I think,</v>

46
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.810
I think the subjects were not just in England.

47
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:35.240
It was organized by a group of English scientists,

48
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.730
either the solidarity or the recovery consortium.

49
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:41.070
And I just don't remember right now the name of it, but,

50
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.190
but I want to go back to your question about the president.

51
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.840
So the president was given dexamethazone and when that happened,

52
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.910
I stated publicly that either the president was

53
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:54.500
sicker than they were telling us.

54
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.950
So he was sufficiently sick that they wanted to give him because giving

55
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.940
dexamethazone early in the course of the disease before you're very sick,

56
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.470
actually can harm you.

57
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.380
So you don't want to give it to someone at the beginning of their disease.

58
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:12.250
You need to wait until they're sufficiently sick, and then it helps you.

59
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.130
So either he was sicker than they told us.

60
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.330
And so they were lying to us or he was, uh,

61
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.010
really needed the dexamethazone.

62
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.050
In which case he faced a significant risk of death.

63
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.280
So people in the trials that show that the dexamethazone worked

64
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.250
74 year old overweight people,

65
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.230
men and men are much greater risk of dying than women of this condition who

66
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:38.320
got the dexamethazone. They had about a 20% chance of death.

67
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.300
So I think the president actually faced a 20% chance of death when he was at the

68
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:47.620
hospital, which is a big risk of death. And I think he, he got lucky. He,

69
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:51.850
you know, he survived. He was also given the, this cocktail of, of, um,

70
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.770
artificial antibodies to the disease,

71
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:57.220
which I think is another promising approach to treating this condition.

72
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:00.280
We don't yet have the results of those randomized controlled trials,

73
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.710
but we'll also know soon if those drugs.

74
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.300
<v 0>So this was an experimental treatment that they gave him.</v>

75
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.190
<v 1>Yes. They gave him not the dexamethazone. That was a well-documented treatment.</v>

76
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.230
But the antibody antibody cocktail was apparently the CEO of the company

77
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.340
of Regeneron was his golfing buddy or something. I'm not exactly sure.

78
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.570
<v 0>So whatever it was, it seemed to be very effective.</v>

79
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.980
And then immediately that he went on a wild tweet storm.

80
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.450
It seemed like he had a lot of energy.

81
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.560
<v 1>Well, the dexamethazone may have given him a steroid high.</v>

82
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.430
I wouldn't conclude that the antibody cocktail was necessarily effective.

83
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.120
We don't know.

84
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.840
<v 0>I didn't, I didn't mean that I meant all the treatment, the overall treatment,</v>

85
00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:45.360
whatever they gave him when he was in the hospital,

86
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.040
the response was for a 74 year old guy to be back on the campaign trail with

87
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:54.150
this rigorous campaign that he was doing four or five days later.

88
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.610
<v 1>Yes, yes. I did not expect that at all. And, uh, and I,</v>

89
00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:03.990
as I said, I think he got lucky and I do think, you know, steroids can give you,

90
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.130
um, can make you a little psychotic and a little manic actually. And I,

91
00:05:08.131 --> 00:05:12.120
and I think, I mean, you know, you can't really know from a distance, but to me,

92
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:14.430
he had, uh, as a doctor, I looking at him,

93
00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:17.910
I thought this man has a little bit of a manic feel to him, but then, you know,

94
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.250
even that went.

95
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.870
<v 0>Away just from the Twitter feed.</v>

96
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.480
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, isn't, that is how we always is. Well,</v>

97
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:29.100
I'm not an expert on Donald Trump's tweets,

98
00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:31.450
but if you just looked at some of the things you're right.

99
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.670
Maybe he was always that way. But if you look at, if you look at

100
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.990
some of the things he did, like, I think the,

101
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.830
that little having the secret service drive him around the hospital was a bit,

102
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.840
you know, it was a bit manic, you know,

103
00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:49.410
that was like a very irresponsible thing to do would expose people to risk it,

104
00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:51.870
put his own health at risk. I mean, you and I,

105
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.770
if you and I were in the hospital with COVID and we told our, our doctors,

106
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:59.030
you know, I just want to, for a drive around the block right now, let me,

107
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.300
I mean, they would, they would say no, you know, uh,

108
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:07.250
that would not be an okay thing to do. I wanted to wave to people, right? Yes.

109
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.660
Yeah. Hilarious.

110
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.470
<v 2>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

111
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.620
They're free from September 1st is September 1st.

112
00:06:17.621 --> 00:06:20.050
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

113
00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:23.740
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

114
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.760
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

115
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.560
That's all we're asking you just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
