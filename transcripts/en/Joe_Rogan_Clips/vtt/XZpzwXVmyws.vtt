00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 2>My dad has a lot of salmon. He's big in the salmon. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.500
<v 1>We'd dad's like a hundred years old. Just doing.</v>

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.820
<v 0>Great then 91 91.</v>

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.050
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, yeah. How bad as is he? He's born on Memorial day. Bad.</v>

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.970
<v 0>I know he, you know, he almost, oh my gosh, this is a crazy story.</v>

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.931
I don't know if you know this story,

8
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:23.610
but he was about two seconds from being deployed to the Korean

9
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:24.444
war.

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.010
And he was in a plane crash off San

11
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:33.060
Francisco when he was 21 years old. Wow. He was,

12
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.900
he was in the army and he was doing a flight somewhere.

13
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:39.570
He'd done some like a training flight or something. They said, oh, you know,

14
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:43.410
hop on this thing. And uh, he said, okay, cool, last minute, I'll go do it.

15
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.730
He was in a plane crash. The crash landed in Sanford,

16
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.960
outside of San Francisco bay.

17
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.060
And because he ultimately ended up there,

18
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:58.500
I think one person died him, him in the pilot or co-pilot,

19
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:03.330
I can't remember had to swim to shore like at night. Geez.

20
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.440
Over two miles. I want to say something crazy. And you know,

21
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.330
there's tons of sharks, tons of out there, San Francisco. And, um,

22
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.760
this was, you know, 1950. So at the time my grandmother,

23
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.710
uh, they,

24
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:22.830
they had told him that they had told my grandmother that he had gone down in a

25
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:24.780
plane crash. I thought he thought they, uh,

26
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.130
she thought he was dead and there was no cell phones. There was no social media.

27
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.910
There's no anything. It took a week for him.

28
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.280
By the time he got back and got back to the thing,

29
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.480
to be able to call her after, I don't think I made it to go to the hospital.

30
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:43.800
I can't remember, um, for him to be able to call his mother and say, Hey,

31
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.500
I'm alive. Wow.

32
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.700
And that is what kept him from going to the Korean war because he was supposed

33
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:53.040
to be deployed. But because he was in this plane crash,

34
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.310
he had to stay and testify and do the whole do this whole thing.

35
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:59.190
And they had just deployed without him. Wow.

36
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.020
Isn't it crazy how one moment in time can change the whole course of someone's

37
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:04.854
life.

38
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.810
<v 1>Yeah. In a moment that's completely out of your control.</v>

39
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.700
There's there's these weird,

40
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.920
like sort of pathways that you come to in life gateways

41
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.080
and you go left and you're okay. You go right. And the trip ends it trips over.

42
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.760
Yeah. My.

43
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.650
<v 0>Dad was born in 1930. That's.</v>

44
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.520
<v 1>Great. Before the war, before world war II. That's crazy.</v>

45
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.780
Which is nuts. What is it like talking to him? Was it first of all?

46
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:36.510
What is it like being Clint, Eastwood son,

47
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.110
and also being a movie star yourself. That's gotta be weird.

48
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.750
<v 0>It's well, it look, I'm, I'm stumbling through it.</v>

49
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:48.150
Just like anyone else in life, you know, you're just, you're trying,

50
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.540
you're taking the information you have trying to make the best decisions at the

51
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:54.300
time. Speaking to my dad,

52
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.353
it's like,

53
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.290
there's a wealth of knowledge Fort Knox and your trying to dislike,

54
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.580
pull little slivers out when you speak to him,

55
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.350
because he'll just say things casually, like yeah.

56
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.260
And everyone shuts the up. Like at dinner, you know,

57
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.820
you finally steal you'll know he's about to say something and then he'll say,

58
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.740
yeah, well that was, you know,

59
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.930
ag in the sixties was with a Frank Sinatra at that

60
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:30.550
place at the time. And oh yeah, we did. We met her in the thing and you go,

61
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.650
wait, what did you say? You were with Frank Sinatra? Like, wait, hold on.

62
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.650
Let's stop, stop. Like more and more, give us more. And then he'll,

63
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.200
he'll be on to something else. And you know, you can't get it out of him,

64
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:45.550
but it's like, it's, he's just lived this incredible life.

65
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.470
Incredible credible. So it's, you know, I'm trying to, right now,

66
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.350
I'm trying to just soak up every piece of knowledge I can

67
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.670
from him, listened to him, sit with him as much as possible.

68
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.680
So I know he's not gonna be around forever. And, and that's, that's terrifying,

69
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.430
you know, to think about, but it's um, it's like, oh man, this is,

70
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:13.330
I got to like spend every moment I can. Does he exercise? Yeah.

71
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.850
Super active. Um, obviously he's he's 91. So how old are you?

72
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.580
35. So he had you

73
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.300
[inaudible] late in life, but he had three kids after me. Whoa.

74
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.760
What's the youngest. The youngest is two

75
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.250
20. Has had some younger, younger wives. He has a 20 year old kid at 23.

76
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.930
Holy. Yeah. Shooting live rounds, like deep,

77
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.910
deep in his sixties machine gun rounds. Wow. That's crazy. Yeah.

78
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.230
That was that newscaster lady. Right? Was that her? It was, it was yeah. Yeah.

79
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.330
She is. She's great. Actually. She was great, but yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

80
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.400
you had a few, few younger ladies around such a throwback. Yeah.

81
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:06.520
It really is. You know, and what's interesting though,

82
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:08.290
is like what people think about him.

83
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:12.730
They think they see this bigger than life character,

84
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.730
but he's so much more complex than what you see in the

85
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:22.960
movies he's in. He's, there's a lot of nuance. It's like humans, you know,

86
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:24.400
it's like, I'm sure all humans,

87
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.540
people would think about you just because of whatever. And they're like, oh,

88
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:31.840
well he's just the thing it's like, they don't know about your personal life.

89
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.650
They don't know about how you are with your kids, how you are, you know,

90
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:39.460
how you think, you know, esoterically about things. And you know,

91
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.570
when you're speaking to your wife,

92
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:45.550
like he's like much different than just that he's got a lot of shades and he's,

93
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.190
he's very, I think middle of the road, a lot of things, he,

94
00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:53.650
he looks at issues and says, well, this is that. And this, that,

95
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:56.500
and maybe there's a middle ground. And I don't know, you know, well,

96
00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:57.520
there's always this.

97
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.870
<v 1>Urge to dismiss people. Any,</v>

98
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:04.220
any person is if you have this reductionist perspective of who that person is.

99
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.620
And it's hard to just go to just be curious and

100
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:11.090
it's just to say, huh,

101
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.920
I abandoned all your preconceived notions and go, uh,

102
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.660
imagine, imagine being that guy, like imagine being Clint, Eastwood.

103
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.520
Yeah. I mean.

104
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.900
<v 0>A lot of lives lived like a lot of lives.</v>

105
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.140
<v 1>Did you ever talk to him about what it was like to be the mayor of Carmel?</v>

106
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.940
<v 0>He was the mayor when I was, uh, when I was a young kid, I was, uh,</v>

107
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.450
I know a few years old. Um,

108
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.630
I think he had his fill of politics. That was it because they asked him, they,

109
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.090
they, they were kind of like, well, you know, you've been the mayor now,

110
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.230
why don't you, you know, go for governor, you know? And he's like, nah,

111
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.980
this ain't for me, it was just a shot. Yeah. It was, you know,

112
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.530
I think it was good. It was what he did, what he did. But he, you know,

113
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.800
you can never please everybody everyone's, there's always someone off.

114
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:04.820
There's always some conflicting point of view. Always.

115
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.870
<v 1>We talked to him about that time that he pretended Obama was sitting next to</v>

116
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:11.150
him, was on the podium. And.

117
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.580
<v 0>That was bizarre.</v>

118
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.170
<v 1>And it was it's like impromptu, you know, like he just like was winging it.</v>

119
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.940
<v 0>Because we got it. Yeah. It was doing a bit more crazy thing to do. Well,</v>

120
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:25.130
you see if you do the same thing more or less.

121
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.890
<v 1>Like, yeah. But I do it in comedy clubs. No.</v>

122
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.370
<v 0>Difference. Right. It's like, you go out, you practice material,</v>

123
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.690
you're working material out. Right. It's like, you know,

124
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.860
there's, you're getting up in front of people doing something it's it's,

125
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.240
it's like, we call it different because it's like, oh, well that was that thing.

126
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.113
But.

127
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.590
<v 1>I guarantee you Obama would not have said the things that he thought Obama would</v>

128
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.010
have said Obama would have probably had some pretty nuanced perspectives

129
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:54.890
himself. Sure. You know, like it again,

130
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.430
same sort of thing that people wanted to do to him or want to do to other folks.

131
00:07:58.431 --> 00:07:59.960
Like he was kind of doing it to Obama.

132
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.720
<v 0>Look, maybe it didn't work out as material.</v>

133
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.580
<v 1>Yeah, no, I'm sure he didn't, but it's a, it was a bold choice. I was like, wow,</v>

134
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.820
how bad-ass is Clint Eastwood? And Richard prior to that too,

135
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.270
if you go back and listen to Richard, Pryor's old cassettes. There's like,

136
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.210
there's some of them that are available from the red Fox comedy club.

137
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.860
And he could find them online.

138
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.120
But I bought them from a gas station one day in life. Then the nineties,

139
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:30.230
these cassette tapes. And they were all like him at red Fox's comedy club.

140
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.650
And it was just him. Like, you could hear drinks clinking,

141
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.020
you can hear things in the background, ice and.

142
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.030
And you could hear people talking.

143
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:42.470
And it was just like this small crowd where he was just around.

144
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.370
And that's where a lot of like his most brilliant bits came from.

145
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.660
Interesting. So it's similar to what your dad was doing, but different.

146
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.450
<v 0>Hey, look, I don't, I don't pretend to speak for him. That's, you know.</v>

147
00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.720
<v 1>That's the thing. He can do, whatever the he wants. He's Clint Eastwood,</v>

148
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.950
you know, and you know what, I,

149
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.660
one of the things I love your dad did unforgiven because like he went

150
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:10.380
back and made like this. I mean, he did,

151
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.280
obviously he did all those great spaghetti westerns, all those amazing.

152
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.680
And they call them spaghetti westerns for people don't know because they live in

153
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:19.800
Italy, they just, right. Yeah. And it's um,

154
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.260
so he did all these American Western films,

155
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:24.900
but they were all done in Italy and they were all like,

156
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.350
people didn't think those are going to be like real successful at the time.

157
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:29.184
Right?

158
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.260
<v 0>Yeah. He, he was coming off a show called raw hide if you remember that</v>

159
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.060
[inaudible] um, and, and he was actually sick of doing westerns at the time.

160
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.280
Cause he was like been known for seven years and he got an offer to

161
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:51.450
do the spaghetti Western. I was like in Italy, he was like, I don't know,

162
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.500
you know, what should I do? It's like, I want to go to Italy. Never been there.

163
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.780
Okay. Pretty good.

164
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.650
And he goes out there and he works with Sergio Leoni and

165
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.040
crazy story. He comes back actually,

166
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:09.870
I think he might've done all three or he came back and did one and he

167
00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:13.860
came back and people started talking about this movie,

168
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.630
but it was the movie he had done. He known was an Italian.

169
00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:23.340
So it was like poor UNO, dollar poor, you know, dull style.

170
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.140
And so he was like, people are saying, you know, this is great movie out. It's,

171
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.460
you know, a fist full of dollars or it was. And uh,

172
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.350
he's like, oh, that's cool. I want to go check it out. No one, no, no, no, no.

173
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:38.370
He didn't even know.

174
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.810
He didn't know his movie that was catching fire

175
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.740
in America. And so he's like, oh, I got to check this movie,

176
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.650
his movie that it caught fire and it was overnight sensation. Um,

177
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.610
and then yeah, he just kinda just, I dunno, fell into doing those movies,

178
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.960
did a few of them. Um, and then he did his own.

179
00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:06.270
Then he started directing and doing his own westerns,

180
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.040
but bringing it back to unforgiven. What's really,

181
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.730
I think most interesting about that film is that it is,

182
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.670
it's an amalgamation or it's,

183
00:11:18.671 --> 00:11:22.230
it's the whole history of his westerns, but,

184
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:27.330
but really looking back as what would it be like to be an older man and having

185
00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:31.950
regret, having things he did wrong, you know, looking back.

186
00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:36.870
And so it's, it's kind of using the history that he had created and

187
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.270
talking about, you know, what it's like to look back at life and you know,

188
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:45.720
one last ride to do things different for his family.

189
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.150
So there was like a lot going into that movie. You know what I mean?

190
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.013
Yeah.

191
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.100
<v 1>Well, it was a, uh,</v>

192
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.990
a much more sober and realistic depiction.

193
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:04.000
<v 0>Of like a killer in the west. Yeah. You know,</v>

194
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.580
we have the money being paid, you know, probably not that much money,

195
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.721
but like, Hey,

196
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:15.490
like we need this person dead and you're the mandate go do it. And it's like.

197
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.240
<v 1>Also the D there was a much more realistic depiction of the way.</v>

198
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:23.860
Some people react to the idea that they're about to be killed. Yeah.

199
00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.560
They're going to have to kill someone or they're going to be in a gunfight where

200
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:31.000
they might, they might die. That's a great movie, man.

201
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.510
It was almost like a, he wanted in my,

202
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:38.230
the way I felt to me is like he had all these amazing westerns that he did.

203
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.800
But then there was, this one is like, eh, you know what, let me do a real one.

204
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.070
Like, let me go back and make this thing where.

205
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.310
<v 0>He sat on that script for 10, almost 10 years. Wow. For a minute.</v>

206
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.920
And I was like, this is amazing. I don't think I'm old enough yet. Oh,

207
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.740
wisdom. Wow. Yeah.

208
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.760
<v 1>Wow. You know what else? I love high Plains drifter. Yup.</v>

209
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.640
I watched that one every couple of years. That's.

210
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.473
<v 0>A good one. That's a.</v>

211
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:08.763
<v 1>Great one.</v>

212
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.390
<v 0>I like outlaw Josey Wales.</v>

213
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.800
<v 1>Oh my God. Yeah. loved that. Loved that movie.</v>

214
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.920
That's a great one. Yeah. That's a great one.

215
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.400
Was there's something about high Plains drifter. That's like a ghost movie.

216
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.530
You don't realize it. It is.

217
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.620
<v 0>There's a supernatural element to it.</v>

218
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.790
<v 1>Yeah. What is happening here? Yeah, yeah.</v>

219
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:31.600
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

220
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.930
<v 1>I forgot about that one. That's one of my favorites. Yeah.</v>

221
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:39.790
Your dad made some God classics. And then he also made some comedies,

222
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.110
you know, every which way but loose. I mean, what a crazy career.

223
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.150
<v 0>That's when I think they should remake.</v>

224
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.730
<v 1>With who? How about you maybe? Would you do it? That'd be weird.</v>

225
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.470
Could you imagine though? Why not? You know?

226
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.450
<v 0>Yeah. Big old Orangutang. I don't.</v>

227
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.070
<v 1>Want to around with rang tanks, bro.</v>
