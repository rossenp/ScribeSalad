00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.400
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.280
<v 1>The brain reacting to danger. Do you, did you,</v>

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.040
did you do any interviews with people who are soldiers or inter interview

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.120
fighters or people that are involved in extreme activities? That.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.400
<v 2>Yeah, no, I haven't. Uh, I haven't done a lot of interviews. Um, I mean,</v>

6
00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:23.590
I have talked to people like that and, um, you know,

7
00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:28.390
every individual cases are interesting because they give you stuff,

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.830
but it's not data. So the, the data you have to go out and collect.

9
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.390
<v 1>Yeah. What do you got there for notes? You gotta pile notes or just, oh,</v>

10
00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:38.070
I don't know. Wanted to.

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.660
<v 2>Discuss, uh, I, I just thought, uh, just brought this,</v>

12
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.300
I think we covered most of what I wanna say. You know,

13
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:52.460
the amygdala is not a fear center. Behavior's not primarily a tool of the mind.

14
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:53.540
It's a tool of survival.

15
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.060
We think we know why we do the things we do and others do them. But, uh,

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.180
we don't really because we,

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.330
our conscious mind is not privy to all of the,

18
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.450
the things that the body and brain are doing.

19
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.371
<v 1>Now,</v>

20
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:11.370
when you wanted to examine danger and you want to examine the mind and how it

21
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.930
reacts to danger and fear and threats, what,

22
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.290
what were you trying to get out of this?

23
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.690
<v 2>Well, I started out thinking this was a way to study emotion and, um,</v>

24
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.200
&lt;affirmative&gt; at the time I, you know, I'd been studying these, these, uh,

25
00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:27.960
human patients with the split brain surgery.

26
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.080
<v 1>And can you explain that? Cause you, you, you glossed over that earlier,</v>

27
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520
but the split brain surgery is alleviation of epilepsy.

28
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.880
<v 2>It's a way to control epilepsy that can't be controlled in any other way.</v>

29
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.400
Medications are not working. So you have like young kids,

30
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.550
teenagers that have lived most of their life, uh,

31
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.350
is paralyzed by epilepsy and not being able to lead a life.

32
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.231
Uh,

33
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:55.150
there was one patient who basically his parents were constantly having to hold

34
00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:58.550
him down on a mattress. He was seizing so often. So,

35
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.030
and this is not, this is only done in a, uh,

36
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.020
in a very extreme set of conditions and it's not

37
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:11.260
done that much anymore, but when it's done, it's, um,

38
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.820
the connections between the two sides of the brain are, are separated.

39
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.420
So information on one side, doesn't cross over to the other,

40
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.260
how do they do that? Uh,

41
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.130
they open up the skull, pull the two, you know,

42
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:28.450
you've got kind of two loaves of bread sitting next to each other,

43
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.170
and they're connected by threads, which are axons that go between them.

44
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.250
And so you pull apart here and you can see where those axons are when you open

45
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:42.410
up from the top. So imagine like a hot dog bun. Okay. Uh,

46
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.240
and so you open it up at the top and you can look

47
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:51.120
down in the center and imagine that there was like a, a bunch of, uh,

48
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.400
wires crossing between the two sides of the bun. So those wires would then be,

49
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.160
uh, surgically sectioned.

50
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.800
And so now you end up with two sides of the brain separate

51
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.800
and independent. So typically language is on the left side.

52
00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:12.520
So you can talk to that side, the right side, doesn't have language. Um,

53
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.880
so you have to ask, well, what can it do?

54
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.230
So if you present a stimulus that only the right Hemis for, or seas,

55
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.870
and you do that by flashing a, a, a,

56
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.270
say a picture of an apple on the left side of space,

57
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.710
cuz everything to the left of the center goes to the right hemisphere and

58
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:31.950
everything to the right of center goes to the left hemisphere.

59
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.470
So you send a stimulus to the right hemisphere and you say, what did you see?

60
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.420
And the left hemisphere. Cause that's where the language is. He says,

61
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.180
I didn't say anything. So, okay.

62
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.780
You said reach into this bag and see what's in there. If the right hand goes in,

63
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.420
that's connected to the left atmosphere, can't find it.

64
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.180
The left hand goes in connected to the right atmosphere that which saw the

65
00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:58.460
apple, it pulls out the apple. Whoa.

66
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.530
So the right hemisphere has information that the left hemisphere

67
00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:04.970
can't talk about. What is.

68
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.610
<v 1>Life like for people once they've done that operation?</v>

69
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.970
<v 2>Um, well slowly it,</v>

70
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.770
the left hemisphere kind of comes to dominate again. And, uh, the, uh,

71
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.320
you know, they, they come to live with it. How.

72
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.153
<v 1>Does it prevent.</v>

73
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.920
<v 2>Seizures? Well, the, the folklore of it,</v>

74
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.760
I don't know if this is actually true,

75
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.360
but what is often said is that it prevents the seizures from jumping back and

76
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:34.600
forth, uh, and having, you know, because the, um,

77
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.640
the electrical activity jumping back and forth sort of gets into kind of UN

78
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:41.190
endless loop that can't stop.

79
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.350
But cutting that isolates the seizures in the two hemispheres and makes

80
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.310
each one more controllable by taking a medication. Jesus.

81
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.230
<v 1>So imagine being the first, gotta try that out. Yeah, really.</v>

82
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.390
&lt;laugh&gt; I got an idea. &lt;laugh&gt; split your brain, like a hot dog bun &lt;laugh&gt;.

83
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.020
<v 2>So you, um, but it, it, what we were interested in, in,</v>

84
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:08.340
in these patients that we were studying, my, this was my mentor, Michael Guana,

85
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.380
um, and I were, were studying these at, uh, Dartmouth medical school.

86
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.980
We were at Stony Brook out on long island.

87
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.420
We would drive up to Dartmouth to see these patients, um,

88
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.290
was how does the left hemisphere cope with the fact that

89
00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:27.570
the right hemisphere is performed a behavior that the it,

90
00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:32.410
the left hemisphere that you talked to didn't in. So we would,

91
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.610
you know, put information in the right hemisphere. The guy would stand up say,

92
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.690
why'd you do that? I needed to stretch, or, you know,

93
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.640
scratch his hand and say, oh, I had an itch. So I needed to, to scratch it.

94
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.920
And so time after time,

95
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.600
the left hemisphere would generate a narrative that made its behavior make

96
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:53.600
sense. Oh, wow.

97
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.520
So that's why I got interested in how non conscious systems would be generating

98
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.400
behaviors that we generate narratives to explain,

99
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.480
because at the time, uh, that we were doing this,

100
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.160
the idea of cognitive dissonance was very popular.

101
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.200
And what that means is that when cognitively,

102
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.440
when you do something behave,

103
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.310
that is incongruent with what you cognitively know,

104
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.030
it's disturbing, it causes dissonance.

105
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.750
And so you have to engage in some kind of dissonance reduction.

106
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.630
So our hypothesis was these narratives that the left hemisphere is generating

107
00:06:31.631 --> 00:06:35.910
about, right? Hemisphere behaviors was a way of, of left hemispheres,

108
00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:40.820
conscious mind. &lt;affirmative&gt;, um, kind of keeping it all together. The,

109
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.940
the consciousness thinks that it's in charge that, you know,

110
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:48.460
the brain and body are it's, you know, it's, uh, it's the, the,

111
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.500
the control center and everything else is, uh, there to,

112
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.820
to satisfy its whims.

113
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.530
And so it generates these narratives to keep that of unity going,

114
00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:00.050
even though it's no longer unified.

115
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.650
<v 1>That is so fascinating that the brain tries to seek some sort of an explanation</v>

116
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.210
for the actions that you've provoked right.

117
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.210
<v 2>Externally. And that's why I got into a motion. Cause well,</v>

118
00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:11.370
maybe a motion systems.

119
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.570
<v 1>Produced these, you.</v>

120
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.650
<v 3>Got something, Jamie. Yeah. When I'm looking this up, uh,</v>

121
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.360
alien hand syndrome came up. Do you know anything about I don't? I'm sorry.

122
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.321
Okay. It's a,

123
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:23.840
there's a long article explaining this thing called alien hand syndrome and also

124
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:27.040
known as Dr. Strange lo syndrome, a picture of Dr. Strange,

125
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.240
the explanations are very strange about people's hands doing something that

126
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:31.074
they're not explaining.

127
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.880
<v 2>They dunno. It's, it's kind of the same. Yeah.</v>

128
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.600
Do they generate an explanation when they do that?

129
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.000
<v 3>It just explains different, uh, scenarios.</v>

130
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:41.030
People have had like a leg walk in the wrong direction or, uh,

131
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.710
buttoning up your shirt with your left hand,

132
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.230
the right hand starts unbuttoning it. That.

133
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.150
<v 1>Seems to be like some sort of a neurological problem.</v>

134
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.630
<v 2>Well, they split brain patients with, you know, they right after surgery,</v>

135
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.510
when things are really like up scrolling,

136
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.670
it would be like pulling the pants down with one hand and pulling 'em up with

137
00:07:56.671 --> 00:08:00.420
the other. Oh, wow. There's a, there's one patient I saw in the hospital,

138
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.540
the young kid, the left hand reaches out to grab the nurse on the.

139
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.460
Can I say that? Yeah. Grab the nerve and the right hand is pulling it back.

140
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.120
&lt;laugh&gt; oh my.

141
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.860
<v 1>God. Oh my God. So there's like a physical.</v>

142
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.740
<v 2>Struggle. Yeah. There's like this. And you know,</v>

143
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:19.220
and it all kind of like over time they don't come back together, but the,

144
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.250
they negotiate something where it's not so dramatic.

145
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.650
<v 1>The woman who thinks her alien hand wants her to be a better person.</v>

146
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.970
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah. See, I'm thinking these are some sort of physiologic. Yeah. Well,

147
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.530
it's, uh, what a crazy solution to epilepsy.

148
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.970
I know there's other solutions that, but that.

149
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.930
<v 2>That is, that is a last ditch effort. Yeah.</v>

150
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.880
<v 1>And so for severe severe cases. Yeah. And.</v>

151
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.760
<v 2>I, those done that often to.</v>

152
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.360
<v 1>Eventually sort of achieve some sort of a normalization. Yeah.</v>

153
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.760
<v 2>Um, you know, the they've lived,</v>

154
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.720
the kids have lived so long in the state, by the time they get their, their,

155
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.480
um, brains changed like that, that, um,

156
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.560
I don't know really ultimately, uh, what, what became of all these people.

157
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.590
Cause I, I moved on to other fields and um, &lt;affirmative&gt; but I,

158
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.710
I think in general they live a somewhat better life,

159
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.870
but I doubt they ever live a completely full normal life. I mean,

160
00:09:23.871 --> 00:09:25.510
how could you after all that, but.

161
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.870
<v 1>I'm really interested in the, the,</v>

162
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.990
the brain creating these narratives to explain. Yeah. That's,

163
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.030
there's so many people that do things like that. Yeah. Right.

164
00:09:34.031 --> 00:09:38.660
They'll try to explain their life away and give themselves excuses and give

165
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.580
themselves reasons for behavior.

166
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.620
And one of the things you see with the more irrational people is it's never

167
00:09:45.621 --> 00:09:47.500
their fault. Right. It's always someone else's fault.

168
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.900
<v 2>Well, that's the 4 billion year story that I tell how we,</v>

169
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.220
how we got to these narratives. That's what it's all about.
