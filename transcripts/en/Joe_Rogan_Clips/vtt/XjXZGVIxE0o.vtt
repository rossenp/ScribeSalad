00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.140
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How about Richard Branson guy?</v>

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:07.620
Just shoot himself off in the space. And people are so mad at him.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.520
I said on Twitter.

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.310
<v 1>I feel like my invite got lost in the mail. I should've been on that ship.</v>

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.750
<v 0>Would you, would you have gone? No, I wouldn't have gone talk to him also.</v>

6
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:19.830
When you asked to be died, you'll go, Jamie, doesn't give a. Richard.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.810
<v 1>Brandon said, if you're listening to Jamie, we'll join you on your.</v>

8
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.670
<v 0>Next boy. Amy's at least part alien.</v>

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.290
Jamie's immune to edibles and Eddie got to go. Yeah. Eddie should go.

10
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:31.830
I got to go with Eddie. We think it's a hologram. It's a hologram.

11
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.890
Imagine if you took Eddie up into space and he still didn't believe that the

12
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:39.840
earth was round, we're both gonna have a camera and a not edited, bro.

13
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:44.010
They took you to hologram. You don't even understand, um, master, if he's right.

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.350
[inaudible], you're

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 crazy. That's why there's no good video from the thing. And as we get up there and 

16
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.350
Eddie's right all along and I got to eat Crow

17
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.350
, we're going to go here. Sorry, Eddie. There was flat. Um,

18
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 yeah. I mean, imagine if you died right next to Richard Branson, like

19
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.183
 dumb, make me go up and your stupid rocket.

20
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.280
<v 1>Rocket.</v>

21
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.390
<v 0>Ship, Elan Musk has a ticket to ride. I'm Richard Branson space, plane.</v>

22
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.150
Um, do you trust it? I don't know if I trust it.

23
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.430
Like those things, they blow up a lot.

24
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.620
They blow up one person is to blow up. They'd blown up a few times,

25
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:24.960
right on the launch pad and trying to land.

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.980
<v 1>Still. I still don't understand how airplanes work, like how they're safe.</v>

27
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:29.900
So I'm not I'm looking at.

28
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.990
<v 0>Well, Ilan was explaining to me that the, uh,</v>

29
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.640
below ups and the failure was actually built in into the equation of, uh,

30
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.580
you know, like the, the way they're designing these things.

31
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:44.970
There's going to be failure because they're trying to test the tolerance is to

32
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.310
figure things out. That's the whole idea of tests is it,

33
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:49.800
some of them were going to fail. So it wasn't disturbing to him at all.

34
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.840
When these rockets are blowing up and he's like,

35
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.540
now we know why it blew up and we'll fix that.

36
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:55.860
And now this one won't blow up and then.

37
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.800
<v 1>He's not going to come out. It'd be like, wow.</v>

38
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.190
<v 0>Yeah, we're. Well, he wouldn't look. No, no, no, no, no. He would,</v>

39
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.370
he would a hundred percent. That guy does not.

40
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.660
He is not interested in lying. You can say whatever you want about Elon Musk.

41
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.170
He, he might be wildly eccentric and, and, and,

42
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.620
and maybe even stretched too thin because he has so many different projects.

43
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:17.431
He works on constantly.

44
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:19.770
And that guy is not a liar by any stretch of the imagination.

45
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.360
He's discussing the way they've designed this protocol for engineering,

46
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:27.240
these rockets, that they knew that they were going to have failures.

47
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.780
It's part of the process, I guess. I mean, it made sense, right?

48
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.930
Like how the else are you going to build a rock? And you got up,

49
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.850
you got to test of test them. They're going to blow up. And when they blow up,

50
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.410
it's spectacular. Beautiful fill with rocket juice. No,

51
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.110
I'm not interested though, man. I mean, not until they got that down,

52
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.690
you know, down to a it, if it was.

53
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.523
<v 1>Like.</v>

54
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.510
<v 0>Yeah, I like that. Yeah. But until then, off. I'll let other people do it.</v>

55
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.810
What am I going to do? But to get up and then go down. This is,

56
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.540
it's just like the video. you. I'm staying right here.

57
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.360
And then the other thing that freaks me out, if you get into real space,

58
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:09.200
like orbit is space junk, you know, they're just kicking you out.

59
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.530
So Russian satellites in 1965,

60
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.580
so random Chinese bolt hits you in the forehead going 500,000 miles an hour or

61
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:16.510
whatever the it's called.

62
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.220
<v 2>Yeah. I think there's not, but is there a chance to accidentally go too far?</v>

63
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:22.750
I'm like, oh nah, we got to go around.

64
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.330
<v 0>I can come back. No food.</v>

65
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:28.000
And you get the weeks we're going to have to eat each other. Yeah. Yeah.

66
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.730
I don't think so house. I just, uh,

67
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.650
I would hate to see Richard Branson blow up in space because that would set

68
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:39.850
back space traveling. That's kind of crazy that, I mean,

69
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.740
I don't know how long they planned it in advance,

70
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:46.180
but he only went like 50 miles. Right. Is that the idea of space?

71
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.140
So it's very disputed. Like what it is like was it even dark where he was at?

72
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.740
<v 2>I saw a picture, it looked like half, half dark, half, half ours,</v>

73
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.180
but you got to go dark and then it turns upside down. Can see whatever. Yeah.

74
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.480
<v 0>I mean, you know what I'm saying? Like, you can't go camping during the day,</v>

75
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.680
but they did slept during the day, camping in the woods.

76
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.460
<v 2>Or hip and beat Jeff Bezos. Who's going next week. He's supposed to go next.</v>

77
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.750
<v 0>He must be stay or something. He must be so mad, mad if he does,</v>

78
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.220
because he just handed over the CEO of his company. He's not the CEO anymore.

79
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.420
Right. I miss that. I,

80
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.360
his wife married a science teacher and he's probably going, ah,

81
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.040
let me get some that rocket blows up. Is he going to deep space? Is he.

82
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.020
<v 2>Going out? I kind of think it's the same thing.</v>

83
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:30.970
But instead of going like a roller coaster on a plane,

84
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:34.060
they're going up in a balloon and then come back down in a balloon.

85
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.253
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

86
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.280
<v 2>I take that back. But they come down on a parachute, a parachute. Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.480
I was picturing something like that.

88
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.710
<v 0>So you always got a way better system. His rocket is actually going to land,</v>

89
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.760
you know, he's got it down. That's better. Yeah.
