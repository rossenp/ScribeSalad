00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah, Jersey's an unusual place.</v>

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.410
Jersey has more black bears per capita than any state in the unit.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.290
<v 1>I don't know if that's a fact, but I believe you. Cause I've seen them myself.</v>

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.550
They're everywhere.

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.360
<v 0>You see bears on.</v>

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.860
<v 1>Your property. Not on my property,</v>

7
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:17.070
but when I used to stay with my aunt in the Poconos,

8
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.290
the bears used to come in her backyard.

9
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.680
Cause there was like a scream in the backyard and they would like come in there

10
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.770
and just grab a fish out of there.

11
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.480
<v 0>They killed the kid. One,</v>

12
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:26.910
bear killed a kid a couple of years ago from one of the colleges.

13
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:29.760
What college was it? The one near new Brunswick. What was it?

14
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.880
<v 1>And you've never seen the video in Jersey at a walking bed,</v>

15
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:34.980
a bed that would walk on two feet through people's back yards.

16
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.080
Hell yeah. That happened.

17
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.320
<v 0>There it is. Look at it. A little video. The bear walking around.</v>

18
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.570
<v 2>Oh yeah. That's uh, yeah. That's uh, you know who believes in big foot? Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.660
You have a believer in the studio right now. Who believes in big foot.

20
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.973
<v 0>Do you really?</v>

21
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.940
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

22
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.330
<v 2>100% Believe.</v>

23
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.120
<v 1>But you know what? I believe in big foot because of like mousses,</v>

24
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.313
you know what I'm saying?

25
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.770
[inaudible] you see something. If you see a, a species like a mousse, God,

26
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.880
look at this. At some point in life,

27
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.400
somebody was trying to explain that to somebody else. It's like, man,

28
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:18.420
get the outta here.

29
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.180
<v 2>Right now. When he's trying to explain it to me, we look at the size of that.</v>

30
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.030
God, that's insane. And elegant. Look at those legs.

31
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.220
<v 0>The you up to there's a, those are the rare deer species that will stop death.</v>

32
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.250
Yeah. They used to dealing with wolves. If they think you're a threat,

33
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.140
they just run up on you and stomp you to death.

34
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.540
Why don't you believe in Bigfoot that? Well,

35
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.120
I actually did a television show where I went hunting for them.

36
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.910
<v 1>Finding.</v>

37
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.230
<v 0>The no, no, no. It was, I did a show called Joe Rogan questions,</v>

38
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:46.680
everything we spent a whole week in the Pacific Northwest talking to Bigfoot

39
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:48.300
hunters. We camped out there.

40
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:52.650
Me and Duncan Trussell went and interviewed scientists and interviewed all these

41
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:54.420
different archeologists,

42
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.510
all these different people that didn't believe and did believe it.

43
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:59.310
Wasn't real animal at one point in time.

44
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.830
<v 1>I don't think it exists now. I think it existed.</v>

45
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:03.300
It's just a primate in the woods.

46
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.770
<v 0>Okay. You don't think it exists.</v>

47
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.570
<v 2>You believe that exists. Now.</v>

48
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.140
<v 1>I did up to a certain point when I was like in this era with all of the cameras</v>

49
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:11.610
and everything else, somebody would have caught one.

50
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.950
<v 0>I was a little worried.</v>

51
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.540
<v 1>I was like, I don't believe in it now. I believe it existed at some point,</v>

52
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:19.440
but I don't believe it exists.

53
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.970
<v 2>Tell you something Charlemagne has this amazing power to manifest. Okay.</v>

54
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.160
So I see how it could lend itself when you believe something

55
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:31.080
so much, it becomes real. Right? Right.

56
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.050
I could see how it manifests itself into things like Bigfoot.
