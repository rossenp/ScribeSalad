00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. There's not clear cut solutions.</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.000
And the problem law enforcement to me is a kin to the problem of education

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.130
in that there's not a lot of money in it,

4
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:15.000
but it's an incredibly important part of the world and incredibly important part

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.140
of our society. But yet the people that do it don't get paid well. Right.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.771
You know, I mean,

7
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:23.100
some police officers can make a really good living if they do a lot of overtime.

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.530
Right. That is true. But also you got to think about what kind of,

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.900
what are you talking about?

10
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.160
You're talking about someone literally giving up 80 hours a week of their,

11
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.033
of their life.

12
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.390
<v 1>To make the kind of money officer wellness.</v>

13
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.790
That's one of the things I recommend against.

14
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.510
<v 0>Is overtime. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right about that.</v>

15
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.120
It's very tempting financially or.

16
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.590
<v 2>Like I honestly,</v>

17
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.000
the best description of what happens mentally, how,

18
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.810
how the mental state of an officer kind of can get off track over time was

19
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.130
written in a book it's it's older now. I think it was early two thousands,

20
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:01.130
a guy named Kevin Gilmartin wrote a book called, um,

21
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.270
it's like emotional survival for law enforcement officers and their families.

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.530
But that's probably not exactly right,

23
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:10.340
but that's close best book I've ever read on police mental health.

24
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:13.820
And he describes in such a, an easily digestible way. What,

25
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.690
what happens with police officers in their mental state, right?

26
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:19.580
He talks about your normal humans. We kind of,

27
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.700
we live between the lines like this is a normal state of alertness and

28
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:23.330
functioning.

29
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.890
So we all are kind of in here when you're on the job and have as a police

30
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:30.710
officer, you've got to live in this state of hyper-vigilance like,

31
00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:32.960
you're on you're alert. You're looking around. You're, you're,

32
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:35.150
you're always ready and, you know,

33
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:37.610
sort of energized a little bit of adrenaline flowing.

34
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.550
And so they have to live up there and that's that's,

35
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:42.890
our bodies are meant to do that for short term. You know,

36
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:44.420
that's our nervous system, you know,

37
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.310
parasympathetic nervous system kicks in we're we're,

38
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.450
we're alert and you stay up there. And then when they come off the job,

39
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.140
it dips down. But instead of going back into that, like middle zone,

40
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.420
the normal zone, where most of us are functioning, you know,

41
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:58.100
kind of going about normal level of energy,

42
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.440
they dip down below because once you've been on that high kind of that, that,

43
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.810
that rush while you've been on the job, your body needs to recover.

44
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:10.340
So it goes down into this low state. And while it's down there, you know, you,

45
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:14.240
again, this is your, your nervous, system's kicking back in. You're recovering,

46
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:17.960
you're out of that beast mode and you're in, you don't feel great. You're tired.

47
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.880
You kind of want to be alone. You want to get isolated detached, you know, and,

48
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:25.130
and a lot of cops kind of go and retreat when they get home and they need that,

49
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.150
that go to my cave time. Your body can recover from this.

50
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:32.420
So the cycle for cops is that they're up. And then when they come home,

51
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:37.340
they go down and it usually takes the body 18 to 24 hours to

52
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:40.100
get back into the normal zone. Great. So if,

53
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.920
if we did that one day and then we dipped down and recover, we come back.

54
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.280
But what happens within 24 hours while you go back to work again?

55
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.340
So what happens for cops is they're up then they're low,

56
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.610
then they're way up and they're low and that's not the way our bodies were made

57
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:55.910
to function. You're in this state of hypervigilance for so long,

58
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.700
it starts to wear on you. It wears on you physically. It wears on you mentally.

59
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.800
It wears on you emotionally and, and,

60
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.130
and you never get that recovery time to get back to a normal state.

61
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:10.480
So they constantly are in this life, shorter and shorter fuse tense and alert,

62
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.840
and it makes you, it sort of just wears on you over time.

63
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.700
The other thing it does that, you know,

64
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:19.060
cops are notorious for having kind of trouble functioning at home if they're

65
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:20.620
working too much. And they're so into it,

66
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.110
that on 10 state feels good. You're energized, you're alert, you're active.

67
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:27.790
And then when you dip down, you don't feel good.

68
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:31.720
So they start associating home with negative feelings and work with positive

69
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:35.140
feelings. And so then what do they do? They crave work more.

70
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.920
So they go and take overtime shifts and they hang out with other police officers

71
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:43.720
and they start to kind of become their police self and they lose their

72
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:46.210
personal self. And so this is,

73
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.730
I love Gilmartin's book for this.

74
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:51.850
And I recommend it to any officer that I've come across if they haven't read it,

75
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:56.170
because it really beautifully explains this cycle and kind of what it does over

76
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:59.860
time. And he also goes on to recommend, well, how do you,

77
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:02.470
and what the lungs long and short of it is at the end.

78
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:05.320
If you stay in that and you lose too much of your personal self,

79
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.420
you become that burned out, bitter angry, going to snap and you know,

80
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.950
and do some, make a bad decision kind of place. So how do you resolve that?

81
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.590
You know, you've got to protect your personal self.

82
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.310
You've got to keep from getting hard and bitter and becoming too much of that

83
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.420
police self.

84
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.190
And so one of the things is you protect your off time and you use it,

85
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.390
you engage, you, you do the things you love. You don't give up your hobbies.

86
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.200
You, if you have a family and kids, you do things with your children.

87
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.050
You have to get back into the real world.

88
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.060
So you remember that the real world is out there because if you are only in that

89
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.420
state, where all you're seeing is the things that cops see,

90
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.400
which is negativity and stress and horror and trauma and angry people

91
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.860
and hurt people and victimized people.

92
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.370
If that's all you're seeing and you're spending all your life in that state,

93
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.970
you forget what happens on the outside. Um,

94
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.950
and I think it's really hard to understand from the outside looking in, um,

95
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.630
and, uh, I've told millions of people, this story that I got a little bit,

96
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.380
little bit of a taste of it from my years when I was,

97
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:18.220
before I went into the academic route and I was working in the prisons and

98
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:23.200
forensic hospitals. And so here's maximum security setting. Um, you know,

99
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.870
being a young, small female in a maximum security setting,

100
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:27.940
I'm surrounded by offenders who are mentally ill.

101
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.550
It's not an easy gig and you gotta really kinda,

102
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.840
you gotta be in that state of hyper vigilance. And so after a few years of that,

103
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.500
I didn't notice it was having any effect on me until, uh,

104
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.690
I was working at a federal prison at the time.

105
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.720
And one of my college roommates came to visit me. And, uh,

106
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.990
we were hanging out and having a drink or whatever and joking, and,

107
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.790
and after a while, she was like, Hey, Nance. And I was like, yeah, she's like,

108
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.890
you're different. Like, what are you talking about? I'm not different. I'm what,

109
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.490
like, no, I'm not. She's like, you're really hard. You're,

110
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.230
I'm a little bit scared of you. And I was like, what do you mean? She's like,

111
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.910
you're just kinda hard. Like, you know, and I thought,

112
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.590
no, like she's she's. And when she said that, it really kind of struck me.

113
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.790
And like two weeks after that, I went to visit my sister.

114
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:22.940
And at the time she had young kids and I remember sitting outside watching

115
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.540
somebody playing a ball game and looking at all these families.

116
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:31.370
And I remember having the thought, like, what are they doing? Don't they,

117
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:35.060
why are they all so happy? Don't they know what all that's going on.

118
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.760
Don't they know about all the horrible people in the, are they scared to be?

119
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.630
I thought, oh my gosh, she was right. Like I've,

120
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.970
my brain has started to go into a place where,

121
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:47.810
because every day I had to steal up, get tough,

122
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.780
be ready for anything, have eyes in the back of my head.

123
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.870
Cause I was working in a really dangerous setting at that time.

124
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.220
And I had to protect myself. And when I flash, you know, after that,

125
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:01.640
I stopped working in the prisons and I softened back up and came back to like a

126
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:04.100
normal state of functioning where I can turn it on or off,

127
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:05.450
depending on if I need to.

128
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.790
But it really was telling to me to see how much your, just your,

129
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:15.620
your daily persona can shift when that's your day-to-day functioning.

130
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:18.960
So that Gilmartin stuff with the, you know, the,

131
00:07:18.961 --> 00:07:21.440
the waves and the hypervigilance and the recovery,

132
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.640
and the more people start to become their police self more and more and lose

133
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:26.630
their personal self.

134
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.550
It's a really important thing for officers to be aware of and to track and to

135
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:36.440
monitor if they want to stay balanced the best of the cops that I

136
00:07:36.441 --> 00:07:38.360
know. And I know a lot of really good ones,

137
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:42.530
but I think of a few that stand out who I just simply adore as humans and our

138
00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:47.090
really wonderful officers. They have that balance really down when they're on,

139
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.010
they're on, but then when they're off,

140
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.370
they're doing stuff with their families or coaching their kids, ball teams,

141
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:57.260
they're, you know, active, physically they're fit, they're mentally sharp.

142
00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:58.020
They, they,

143
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.510
they have a real personal life that they hang on to that balances out what they

144
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:07.010
see and the negativity that comes at them constantly in their, in their day job.

145
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.790
Um,

146
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.480
that's just not something that most of us have to deal with in our daily lives.

147
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.500
Um, and it's a really big deal and that's, you know,

148
00:08:15.501 --> 00:08:17.960
those mental health checks that I pushed so hard for.

149
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:21.170
And then I really want to get going and to,

150
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.600
and to study and figure out how can we do these well,

151
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.370
can check in on that stuff and to help stop that cycle help to get people into a

152
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:33.200
healthier place so that they don't become bitter and jaded and angry and

153
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:37.360
more likely to do to, you know, to be the bad apple as well. Yeah. The.

154
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.110
<v 0>Description of that cycle. So important for people to recognize that. Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.160
W you know, even though some human beings might be better at managing things,

156
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.210
it's like, there is, there's an actual physical thing that's going on is.

157
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.750
<v 2>And when I, when I meet with cops after an incident, or, you know,</v>

158
00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:54.850
if they're coming in, that's the first place I,

159
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.100
because it feels so comforting to know this isn't me being weak,

160
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:04.080
or me losing it. This is something physiological that's going on, you know?

161
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:04.850
<v 0>Um,</v>

162
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.940
don't you think that a lot of these cops are tempted to do overtime just because

163
00:09:07.941 --> 00:09:08.780
the money's so great.

164
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.150
<v 1>Absolutely. Yeah. Yes.</v>

165
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.550
<v 0>And that's one of the perks of the job.</v>

166
00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:16.100
That's one of the things they love that they can, I mean,

167
00:09:16.101 --> 00:09:19.400
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, they could literally double their pay.

168
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.420
And.

169
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.840
<v 2>It's great to have that option, but again,</v>

170
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.950
at what cost there to have a balance, you know, some overtime is fine,

171
00:09:27.951 --> 00:09:30.920
but if that's all you're doing right, and if you're doing it,

172
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.910
this is probably really important key if you're doing it to avoid being at home,

173
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:40.610
because being on the job is the only place you feel functional and

174
00:09:40.611 --> 00:09:44.540
alive and good. That's where the danger sets in. If you're doing it, because,

175
00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:47.450
you know, you're, you're trying to make extra money to get that, you know,

176
00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:51.710
to take your family on a trip, summer vacation or whatever. Absolutely. Like,

177
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.500
do it, get that extra money. Cause that's great.

178
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:59.090
But if you're doing it because that's the only place you feel alive and on an

179
00:09:59.091 --> 00:10:00.920
alert, you might be in trouble. Yeah.

180
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:05.210
You might be getting a little bit off and that's going to lead probably to a

181
00:10:05.211 --> 00:10:06.110
place it's not great.
