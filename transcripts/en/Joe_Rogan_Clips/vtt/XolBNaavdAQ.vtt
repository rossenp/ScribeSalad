00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 1>All these old boxers coming back.</v>

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.170
A Vander field is coming back now. Yes. Have you seen the Mike Tyson?

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:14.280
He's like 65. Mike Tyson's coming back. What? Yes.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.200
You haven't seen dude now. Okay.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.830
Go to Mike Tyson's page for his most recent video on his Instagram.

7
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.450
Get ready for this. Oh, really? Get ready for this. Cause he looks sensational.

8
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:25.284
What is he?

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.820
<v 0>55 53.</v>

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.120
<v 1>I think. Yeah. I think he's a year older than I am. I'm 52,</v>

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.310
but he looks incredible terrifying, dude. He was.

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.460
<v 0>A terrible, even more exciting than his fights.</v>

13
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.070
<v 1>They were, they were a cultural event. Oh my.</v>

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.933
<v 0>God.</v>

15
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.070
<v 1>Yeah. So exciting.</v>

16
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.950
The only concern was that you were going to spend money and you weren't going to

17
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.860
get it back. Look at this. Right? You needed volume. So you can hear this too.

18
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.703
<v 0>Whoa.</v>

19
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.120
<v 1>I mean, what in the?</v>

20
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.090
He looks like a bag and what's really funny.

21
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.850
Oh my God said on the podcast, when he was in here,

22
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:11.940
he said he didn't want to work out again because his ego would get fired up

23
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:15.600
again. And he's actually said that in his post that my,

24
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.340
my ego had been reignited. Is that mean his rage? No. See if you can find it.

25
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.360
That is ego. There's a UN UN. He says he's.

26
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.100
<v 0>Like being Zen and doesn't want to.</v>

27
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.810
<v 1>He gave a statement about it saying that like his ego has been reignited.</v>

28
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.140
<v 0>Uh, good for him. Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.910
<v 1>Always for us. He said something about how the gods of war have, uh,</v>

30
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.960
brought them out again. It was like really heavy. I think it's real recent.

31
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.710
Real recent. Wow. See if you could find the quote, but it was like,

32
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.930
oh my gods of war reignited, my ego. Oh my God.

33
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.590
I'm ready to go again. Geez.

34
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.850
<v 0>Do you think you have, you think you'd fair against a 28 year old?</v>

35
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.730
<v 1>I don't know. It depends on the 28 year old, but I think that you,</v>

36
00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:03.430
you for sure need, uh,

37
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.740
a guy who's really good at fighting to keep him off you. Yeah.

38
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.870
Even if you're in your twenties right here,

39
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.910
Mike Tyson explains his desire to fight again.

40
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.860
I feel unstoppable now the gods of war have reawakened and

41
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:20.040
he said something about his ego firing up. See if he could find that quote.

42
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.530
That was one of the things that he actually talked about in the podcast. Yeah.

43
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:27.390
The gods of war have awakened me.

44
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:31.110
They've reignited my ego and want me to go to war again?

45
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.150
[inaudible] Here's the thing, man. If they don't drug test them,

46
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.000
they don't test them for hormones. Yeah. Things are way different.

47
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.910
The, the main cause if he takes hormones,

48
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:52.170
if he's taking like testosterone and growth, hormone,

49
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.250
thyroid hormone,

50
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.920
all the things that people do when they take hormone replacement therapy,

51
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.550
your body functions way better at a way later age, it's different,

52
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.840
very different.

53
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.520
So if we're talking about like being a 53 year old man in 1985

54
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.320
is no chance everybody fell apart. Like you you'd have to like be a really,

55
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:11.711
really,

56
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:16.600
really rare person who doesn't take hormones and can

57
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:20.920
perform like a 30 year old right. In your fifties. But when you're on hormones,

58
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.530
you can kind of do it. It's in you.

59
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.930
There's like a guy there's a few guys that were in the UFC. The,

60
00:03:26.931 --> 00:03:30.070
one of the bigger examples is VTR Belfort, Vito Belfort.

61
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.670
Who's a phenomenal fighter, a real legend. He was in the first,

62
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.940
he won the first tournament that I ever worked on.

63
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.360
That was at UFC 12 in 1997.

64
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.310
So he was 19 years old back then.

65
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.410
And then when he was in his late thirties, he had a giant resurgence.

66
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.880
And it was when they made testosterone replacement therapy, legal for fighters.

67
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.370
Ah, yeah. So there was a bunch of fighters that got on these, uh,

68
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.840
testosterone replacement therapy exemptions. And they,

69
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.440
so they're taking testosterone, but they had an old man's brain,

70
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.920
but the body moved like a younger man. So it's basically,

71
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.550
they had all of the experience of a lifetime of fighting because of the

72
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:15.760
hormones. Their body actually performed like someone way, way younger than that.

73
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:18.940
Like how much younger do you think? I don't know. It depends on the body.

74
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:22.270
Depends on what kind of damage you're dealing with. What's wrong with you.

75
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.960
Whether or not it can bring you back 10 years or five years or who knows.

76
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:28.900
But with these fighters, the thing is they were never really out of shape.

77
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.810
And some of them, there's quite a few of them, in fact,

78
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.860
and I'm not going to name any names,

79
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:36.040
but some of them needed those hormones because they had done steroids.

80
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.280
So when you do steroids, it shuts down your endocrine system,

81
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:42.130
your endocrine system doesn't make the proper hormones anymore.

82
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.110
And so they needed,

83
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.000
it was a real weird sort of conundrum because everyone was kind of new this.

84
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.090
Yeah. But there was a weird loophole that went on for a few years.

85
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.950
It was a real gray area in MMA.

86
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.850
And so say a fighter could go to the doctor and say, Hey,

87
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.710
I want to get a blood test and see what my testosterone levels are because I am

88
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:05.680
feeling very tired. Right? And they look at it and they test, they go, oh,

89
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.240
look at this. Your testosterone levels are low. You are, you are,

90
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.920
you could take this hormone and inject it into your body every week.

91
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.360
Now you you're eligible for testosterone replacement therapy. Right.

92
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.470
But the thing is,

93
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.010
they might've liked the whole reason why they needed in the first place.

94
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:27.100
Might've been that they, they were using it illegally.

95
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.270
So it's a weird thing to reward, right? Because the testing wasn't very good.

96
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:34.960
And some of these guys that are a part of this,

97
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.570
we're a part of this testosterone replacement therapy thing.

98
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.490
They were ones that were kind of accused of possibly using performance enhancing

99
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:43.360
drugs in the past.

100
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.170
Then they get to use them legally Vittorio dude, I'm telling you,

101
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.140
everyone in the MMA community would talk about T R T V. Tour T R T V.

102
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.560
Tour was a guy who was in his thirties. He'd been fighting a long time.

103
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.010
But all of a sudden he was moving like a demon again and just smashing people.

104
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.490
Right? You ever see him fight? No. Do me a favor,

105
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:07.580
pull up detour Belfort versus Luke Rockhold.

106
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.310
Cause that was one of the perfect examples. And they're fighting.

107
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.230
I don't know if it was in Brazil or what,

108
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.790
but V2 war had muscles on his teeth and he's weighing in for that fight.

109
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.300
It was crazy. And he just Blitzkrieg.

110
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.820
<v 0>And it was legal.</v>

111
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.640
<v 1>Right. What he was doing was legal. It was, it was.</v>

112
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.850
And then it took a while for everybody went, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.

113
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.423
<v 0>What's.</v>

114
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.980
<v 1>Going on? This is not, we can't do this.</v>

115
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.020
And so then the UFC went the whole other way and they brought in USADA and U

116
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:42.950
S anti-doping agency narrow handles everything and they randomly test fighters

117
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:45.350
in the middle of the night and people get pops and stuff all the time.

118
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.360
Oh really? Yeah. They're really strict, man.

119
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.840
Do you think they just got popped for marijuana? He was,

120
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.060
they have a pretty liberal range.

121
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.060
It's a pretty generous range that you can have. So watch this. First of all,

122
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.770
look at Victoria. He's the one in the red. Yeah.

123
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.720
She just shredded and watched this wheel kick, check this out. Set it up.

124
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.260
Bang. Oh Dude, dude,

125
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.850
V tour.

126
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.720
When he was on the TRT was one of the scariest guys that have ever lived up.

127
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.240
<v 0>Into his trap. Look at him. Oh my God.</v>

128
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.900
<v 1>Dudes avoided the out of him. God.</v>

129
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:18.530
<v 0>Too.</v>

130
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.040
<v 1>It's like a pit bull. Oh my goodness. He looked like a demon.</v>

131
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.030
He looked like a Neiman back then. There's a few of his fights from that area.

132
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.060
From that era rather that were just absolutely terrifying.

133
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.830
<v 0>I think that you should,</v>

134
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.850
that it should be that strict against these drugs in the fighting. It should.

135
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:35.600
Yes.

136
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.370
<v 1>Because it's complicated. Yeah. It's not, it's not, um, for your health.</v>

137
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.460
I take testosterone placement, I think for your health. It's a good move.

138
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:46.790
When you get older, it makes your body work better. But for fighting,

139
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.360
there's a weird gray area. Like when, when should it be legal?

140
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.430
You're going to let people take it after they're 45. Right?

141
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.970
My point is if they don't test Tyson and Holyfield

142
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.210
and all these guys for testosterone replacement and growth,

143
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:03.950
we might see some crazy.

144
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.560
<v 0>We might see some grain bites. He's.</v>

145
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.520
<v 1>A perfect, funny paper. I do not know. Maybe he's on, not on anything.</v>

146
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.000
And maybe he's just a special athlete. Lord knows.

147
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.770
Herschel Walker was Herschel.

148
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:20.600
Walker was a guy who fought in Strikeforce after he played in the

149
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:24.500
NFL and was really successful. It was terrifying. Like people were avoiding him.

150
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.500
People that were like lifelong martial artists, like that guy,

151
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.270
because he was a super athlete.

152
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.470
And obviously Mike Tyson was a super athlete when you chunk no one when they're

153
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.540
20, usually move like that.

154
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:40.310
And here he is 53 moving like a world champ throwing bombs.

155
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.510
Again. It's only on the pads. We don't know what happens if you've spars. Right.

156
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.650
But, but still.

157
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.010
<v 0>You have to like the praying mantis. If he makes the first move,</v>

158
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.320
he's going to rip your head off.

159
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:56.190
<v 1>Have to look at that and go live. Look like let's not get crazy. He's going.</v>

160
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:57.910
I know how scary he is.

161
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.410
That's what makes us think of Mike Tyson when he was in his prime.

162
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.130
<v 0>Oh, and he'd come out. No socks. Oh my God. Just those leathers.</v>

163
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.800
<v 1>My favorite ever was the Marvis Frazier fight.</v>

164
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.830
Cause it was really like an execution. It was Marvis.

165
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:14.760
Frazier also was like a really good fighter. And was Joe Frazier son.

166
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.410
And you knew what was going to happen? Tyson was 20 seconds.

167
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.530
He was a different thing. Yeah.

168
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.730
<v 0>He just came different.</v>

169
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.563
<v 1>Thing.</v>

170
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.810
He'd never seen a boxer like him before where it was just like every fight was

171
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:28.680
an execution.

172
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.260
<v 0>Brutal brute, no frills, no nothing.</v>

173
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.130
No.

174
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.700
<v 1>No socks, no socks, no robe.</v>

175
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.370
Most of the time they'll come into the rain.

176
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.280
Sometimes he had a towel around his neck. Sometimes it didn't even have that.

177
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.600
<v 0>He wasn't going to be.</v>

178
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.340
<v 1>There long now, man. He was.</v>

179
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.640
And you would see the look in the guy's eyes when he was see him across the

180
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:53.250
ring. Like, oh my God, what the did I sign up for? Okay.

181
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.680
<v 0>Oh exciting. When you were with him, when he was here,</v>

182
00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.570
do you feel like this is still a menacing physical guy?

183
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.830
Or did you feel like.

184
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.690
<v 1>Well he's real nice. Real nice guy, but he's, he's still.</v>

185
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.230
<v 0>She has, they still have that, you know, guys that were tough in their youth.</v>

186
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:11.430
You still feel that thing.

187
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.570
<v 1>Yeah, but he's terrifying. Yeah. Yeah. Who was that? A pass?</v>

188
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.490
What was the UFC fighter? That was saying like,

189
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.650
it's like hanging out with a low. Oh, was it Kevin Lee?

190
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.980
I think it was Kevin Lee. Yeah. It was Kevin.

191
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.070
That sounds like something Kevin would say, because like he goes, it's like,

192
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.660
you're next to a lion. Cause he's like, oh yeah.

193
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.890
That's Mike Tyson. Like that way. I describe it.

194
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.080
It's the perfect way to describe being around him.

195
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.810
You just want him to like you, you want,

196
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.500
you want to be nice to him and you all cool. Be cool. Can't believe he's here.

197
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:44.663
You know, he's here.

198
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.040
<v 0>It's like a miracle figured sitting next to you.</v>

199
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.650
<v 1>Did he ask me about fighting? Like what about, what did I ever do?</v>

200
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:51.570
And I've never felt more like a fraud in my life.

201
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.790
The stupid that I've died to a little TaeKwonDo tournaments and had a couple of

202
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.740
Kickbox fights. Like felt like such a big feel it. Yeah.

203
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.450
It's the worst. He's a, like a cultural icon.

204
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.190
If you stop and think about it, like from our generation now to be around him,

205
00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:13.080
it's like, what are your real thing? You're.

206
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.270
<v 0>Right here. It's like being with Thor or Zeus.</v>
