00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, Jessica and Drudge right there.</v>

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.310
Rose not my Uranus. Let's see, let's see,

3
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.590
this is a straw weight, obviously, right? No, I think it's flyweight.

4
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.660
Oh no. It's strawweight right. Let's try. Wait. It's drawing. Yeah,

5
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.850
she was just trying to be a champion. Yeah. Yeah.

6
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.670
This is a battle of the two girls with the shortest hair in the UFC, right?

7
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.320
<v 1>Yeah, for sure.</v>

8
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.120
<v 0>It's crazy. That rose just decided to cut her hair off. She was like, I don't,</v>

9
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.740
it just gets in the way. Cause like she's beautiful.

10
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.940
I mean her face. Yeah. I mean, she's like, she is like a cover girl,

11
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.830
like a model. Her, she has perfect bone structure, but she doesn't give a.

12
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.950
She's not even remotely concentrating on that.

13
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.960
Oh. She looks good. She hasn't fought. I don't think since then.

14
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.210
And she looks very sharp. She's at Trevor Whitman disciple.

15
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.000
<v 2>I mean, it's just crazy what she did to Joanna the momentum of the train.</v>

16
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.840
That how,

17
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.490
how fast the Joani train was rolling to put a stop to that is completely

18
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:28.910
insane out of nowhere with that left hook. Yeah. How.

19
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.550
<v 3>Crazy is it? The momentum of women and now it's amazing.</v>

20
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.250
My whole greatest. This is so good. That's so good.

21
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.420
I think the little Polish girl, I love Valentina Shevchenko,

22
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.510
Yolanda and Jay chat. That's my all time favorite course.

23
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.780
She paints a false toenails. No matter who she fights or toenails, always.

24
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.850
<v 0>Valentina is not Polish. Right. And she's Russian. She's right?</v>

25
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.320
<v 3>Yeah. More than yeah, but Joel, what am my favorite technical?</v>

26
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.100
<v 2>You follow her on Instagram. She's beautiful. All the time. She's such a,</v>

27
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.600
she's such a, such a girl.

28
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.950
<v 0>Joey. The can of worms. You just opened up. Tony's in love with her.</v>

29
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.540
He's been in love with her forever.

30
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.510
<v 3>Why don't you? Didn't she come to a fight and you were going to take her out.</v>

31
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:14.570
My friends, we're friends. We text Valentina. What is it?

32
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.790
<v 2>She comes to my shows when I'm in, uh.</v>

33
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.600
<v 0>Palm beach or Dora trigger. You haven't asked around.</v>

34
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.000
<v 2>I mean, we've, we've, you know.</v>

35
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.640
<v 0>Find out Florida. Yeah. Okay. What does that mean?</v>

36
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.770
<v 4>No, you stop it right now.</v>

37
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.830
<v 3>Beautiful. And the way she fights makes me more attracted to it.</v>

38
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:35.150
Like I like how she fights.

39
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.810
<v 0>She's gotten a lot better at the weight. Cut too.</v>

40
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:41.600
She was having real problems with weight cutting in the past. Oh,

41
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.980
bros looks good. Real sharp counters. She's working well off the jab.

42
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.690
Look at that job that you have snappy. Yeah.

43
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.740
On drugs. Lost some muscle mass. She used to be a lot thicker.

44
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.810
She used to look like a tank.

45
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.640
She used to go in there and looked like a small female Vandelay Silva.

46
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.930
But now she's a, I guess you probably realize is after awhile,

47
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.430
most of them do you carry around all that muscle mass that cost in your,

48
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:13.570
in your conditioning and endurance also like harder to the cut, the weight.

49
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.350
She probably had to cut a lot of weight. She was very thick. Before

50
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.320
I.

51
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.160
<v 2>Can tell you from experience, the smaller your frame, the lighter you are,</v>

52
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.300
the so much harder it is to cut weight. Like I know that's common sense,

53
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:29.790
but those last few pounds,

54
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.970
that's all just your liver in your lungs.

55
00:03:32.971 --> 00:03:34.980
Just the little bit of liquid you have left.

56
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.850
<v 0>Yeah. They say the guys who cut the easiest actually are big muscular guys.</v>

57
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.390
Those big thick muscular guys, because muscle's like, you know,

58
00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:46.260
90 something percent water, not really water it's, you know,

59
00:03:46.261 --> 00:03:49.560
it's plasma and all kinds of other. But it's a lot of fluid. You can,

60
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.640
you can lose water.

61
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.390
<v 2>Yeah. In our, we did back in high school. That's for sure. Nice.</v>

62
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.290
<v 0>One too. In the outside. Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:01.260
I didn't realize it was easier for people that are muscular to cut.

64
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.540
Wait until George Lockhart slick.

65
00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:06.930
One of the best coaches for weight cutting in the sport. He explained it to me.

66
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:09.000
And I was like, oh, okay. That actually makes sense.

67
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:10.200
Like I never thought about it before,

68
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.990
but then he's like the more muscle mass you have,

69
00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:14.610
the easier it is to lose water weight.

70
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.140
<v 2>There was a couple of times where I weighed in with just straight up bone skin</v>

71
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.230
and the innards like that crazy thing about.

72
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.820
<v 0>Rustlers is you have to compete that day.</v>

73
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.290
So you cut that weight and then you put as much back on as he can before he rest

74
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.390
that that's ridiculous. Ridiculous. I.

75
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.090
<v 3>Got a problem, Joe Rogan. What's the problem. My last physical,</v>

76
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:35.100
the doctor calls. He goes, everything is beautiful,

77
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:38.040
except your potassium is too low. What does that mean?

78
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.580
<v 0>Oh, well that's easy. That's nothing new. Well, you don't even need bananas.</v>

79
00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:45.600
Just take some of this, this right here, liquid Ivy.

80
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.800
I drink that every day. You take that in a bottle of water.

81
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:53.820
It's got way more potassium than a banana. It's got all kinds of vitamins in it.

82
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.400
Why am I alone? Potassium? Cause you probably don't take any,

83
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.050
you don't take it into your body. If you're not.

84
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.420
<v 3>Seem like a variation of salt lake.</v>

85
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.390
<v 0>I was told to stay. No, no, no, no. That's sodium. That's sodium.</v>

86
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.900
Potassium is something different. Potassium is just another electrolyte,

87
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.370
but it's a critical electrolyte.

88
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.360
Uh it's I think they stay potassium when people are low in potassium.

89
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.770
That's when they get cramps that liquid Ivy like started taking electrolytes on

90
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:20.520
a daily basis, changed how my body operates. Cause I was always getting cramps.

91
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.960
Now I don't ever get them anymore.

92
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.490
Literally stopped getting cramps again because I was dehydrated. And I,

93
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.540
you know, most people run around dehydrating dehydrated. You,

94
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:35.280
you don't realize like you have to drink water all the time, man. You really do.

95
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.060
You have to drink water all the time. And if you don't do that,

96
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:43.950
you're operating at a less than optimal method. You know, your, your,

97
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.140
your brain is not functioning the way it should.

98
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.140
<v 2>In football a lot, you know, in, in, uh,</v>

99
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.620
obviously in the hotter places like, you know,

100
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:57.090
those games it's stalls so much of the game. Oh yeah, man. All those cramps.

101
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.110
Oh yeah. And they're trying to drink water the whole time, those big boys,

102
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:03.070
but they're sweating it out faster than their body can absorb it.

103
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.510
<v 0>They're going full tilt. You know? I mean, imagine,</v>

104
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.200
imagine being a 290 pound super athlete,

105
00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:15.190
just going full tilt. Just full stri.

106
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.010
Woo woo. Woo. Woo.

107
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.640
I mean the amount of explosive exertion,

108
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.480
those guys put out in a game it's nuts. It's not like anything else.

109
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.120
If you really think about it, even in fights, you know,

110
00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.730
there's a lot of moments in fights where they're pacing themselves.

111
00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:32.980
They're like this they're moving. And then they explode.

112
00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:37.750
Occasionally football has these giant bursts where you're running at each other

113
00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:41.530
full clip, just all full sprinting, you know?

114
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.470
<v 2>And then you stop. They just sit there.</v>

115
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.160
They also have longer breaks than even here because when you're on defense,

116
00:06:48.161 --> 00:06:51.550
you're on that sideline for maybe, you know, five to eight, 10 minutes,

117
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.240
they all.

118
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.130
<v 0>Get injured. It's a hundred percent. They all get injured. They all get injured.</v>

119
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.001
Joey,

120
00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:02.680
you would love this Aaron Hernandez series that they have on Wondery.

121
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.190
Do you ever listen to wandery the podcast network? It's very good.

122
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.240
They're really well-produced they have this really good one on

123
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.400
Aaron Hernandez and his life and why he was so up. Whoo. It's crazy,

124
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.940
bro. He killed a bunch of people, killed people and got away with it.

125
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.250
He killed more than the people he got in trouble with.

126
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.790
He killed a guy in Florida. Yeah. He killed a few people.

127
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.410
<v 2>Did you watch the Netflix one? I did not know. Yeah. They cover a lot of that.</v>

128
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:31.150
It's crazy. Crazy story.

129
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.120
<v 0>That man is his brain damage</v>

130
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.810
at 28 years old, when he killed himself,

131
00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:40.990
they said he had some of the worst CT they had ever seen.

132
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.640
And you know, he grew up playing football. So he, they,

133
00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:52.600
they did a study on kids, like, uh, all the way up through a professional,

134
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:57.220
all the way down to high school football players who had CTE.

135
00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.380
And they were like it's most kids it's.

136
00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:01.870
Most people play football on a regular basis.

137
00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:03.550
Like more habit that don't have it.

138
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.670
<v 3>It's crazy. My town's a very big football town. We won the state championship.</v>

139
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.930
Kids went to Penn state from there and I watch them.

140
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.820
I've been watching them just for purposes. One guy.

141
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.640
<v 1>Killed himself. Um.</v>

142
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.810
<v 3>But I'm watching these guys and he's uh,</v>

143
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.820
either the solid or like one buddy is in the hospital.

144
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.560
<v 1>Oh absolutely. You know.</v>

145
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.290
<v 3>So it's, it's all those football.</v>

146
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.620
<v 0>Wait bro. Roses, roses teeing off on drugs,</v>

147
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.090
on drugs is getting really pieced up here. Look at that one too.

148
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.520
Rose is just sharper and her foot work is better like constant movement and

149
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:52.210
her counters are on point. Look at it. Look at that block. Perfect timing.

150
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.370
New one that punches coming. And I'm drawing. Just looking for openings.

151
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.530
You're just looking to swing big hammer shots.

152
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.310
Whereas rose is kind of piecing her up. Oh, she messed with that flying knee.

153
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.110
<v 3>I think when it comes to that CT, it really starts in college.</v>

154
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.280
It starts when you're in high school colleges. I think it starts in high school,

155
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.500
but college is where it really,

156
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.330
because it's so competitive college and you're really banging it out there and

157
00:09:20.331 --> 00:09:22.880
you're young. You're strong as. Yeah.

158
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.520
You're juicing your season.

159
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.850
You train basically 11 months out of the year,

160
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:34.010
six of those months with a helmet. I mean you do a summers with helmet,

161
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.980
no helmets and shoulder pads. No contact.

162
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:43.010
<v 2>Yeah. And usually the better you are, the more you're going to naturally.</v>

163
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.963
Well you got.

164
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.470
<v 0>Watch this fight. This fight is wild. This is a wild fight.</v>

165
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.170
Bros is catching her with all kinds of big shots coming in,

166
00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:57.170
but our driver keeps coming. Do you remember when, uh,

167
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.090
yo you wanna fought Jessica and Drudge Tony sort of.

168
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.300
<v 2>I don't remember it being that dangerous of a fight for.</v>

169
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.630
<v 0>At all. It was dangerous, but Yolanda was so technical. She's so good.</v>

170
00:10:08.631 --> 00:10:12.350
That was when she was like legit in her prime. I got to say,

171
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.570
I went back over the way young fight.

172
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.020
And you could see her winning and decision. Oh,

173
00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:21.350
look at that combination by your entourage. That was a hard combination.

174
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.320
Good left kick to the body there too. You could see,

175
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.940
but it's not bad enough where you couldn't see, uh,

176
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.570
Zhang winning it either. Uh, she could, she could have won too.

177
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:33.081
<v 2>You know,</v>

178
00:10:33.081 --> 00:10:37.520
it reminded me a lot of that sorta like Nate Diaz effect to cause the damage

179
00:10:37.521 --> 00:10:38.420
that Yohanna,

180
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.460
what she looked like has to affect the judge's decisions and perception.

181
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.630
There's no doubt about it.

182
00:10:44.631 --> 00:10:48.620
Same every Nate Diaz fight where it looks like he's gotten beat up just cause he

183
00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:52.430
has a two cuts that open it in his eyes as soon as he starts. Right.

184
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.880
<v 0>You want to had that enormous swelling on her forehead. It was crazy.</v>

185
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.450
But meanwhile, she acted like it was nothing like it didn't even exist.

186
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.850
She didn't even didn't even slow down.

187
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.930
<v 2>It was unbelievable.</v>

188
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.720
She looked totally different by the end and to keep fighting.

189
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.980
<v 0>God. She's so good. Just so aggressive.</v>

190
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.610
Both of them mean that was absolutely one of my favorite foods.

191
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.700
There's a painting of it out in the hallway here. You saw it. Yeah. I mean,

192
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.890
I mean, there's a reason why that pain is there.

193
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:23.000
It's one of my favorite fights of all time. The first time that.

194
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:27.080
<v 3>You watched the UFC, that you didn't even care, she saw that fight.</v>

195
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.470
Suck the air out of you. Hmm. I watched other friend's house.

196
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.740
It was amazing after that the party was over. Like nobody cared about.

197
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.251
<v 0>That. Well,</v>

198
00:11:34.251 --> 00:11:37.550
the problem was that that was style bender versus yall remainder house.

199
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.480
And that was a very tactical fighters. Yellow would just stand. Right. But,

200
00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:43.550
but you got to remember for 25.

201
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.740
<v 3>Minutes you were pinned to the TV. Like you haven't been.</v>

202
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.190
<v 2>That you want a Wang fight.</v>

203
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:54.160
I actually got to watch in the bar at LA Jolla like that main and like

204
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:58.480
half the it, cause I closed out. I took off five minutes from the, uh,

205
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.430
opener and five minutes from the feature.

206
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:02.560
The only time I ever did that in my life,

207
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.630
just because I wanted to do my time to not miss a thing.

208
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.580
And that was one of those times. Cause I go,

209
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.500
I said light me when the second fighter in the main event gets to the octagon,

210
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.640
give me a safety light.

211
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:19.000
And I was already in the middle of my closer and it was so cool.

212
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.290
And the majority of that audience, I mean they were slammed in there.

213
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:24.430
You could never, never,

214
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.300
there won't be five people slammed or in five years there won't be that many

215
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:31.690
people slammed in that room for any reason. All on top of one another,

216
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.790
because they all knew that the fight was on. Yeah.

217
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.230
<v 0>You mean that room? Meaning the bar, the bar area.</v>

218
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.450
<v 2>Yeah. It's a, it's like this size basically.</v>

219
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.320
<v 0>That LA Jolla club is awesome. They're doing standup again. Now they closed.</v>

220
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.730
They closed again. Yeah.

221
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.950
<v 2>Very close. I was supposed to be there this weekend.</v>

222
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.260
When did they reclose Tuesday?

223
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.770
<v 0>Because of the COVID yeah, it ramped up.</v>

224
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.550
It's crazy because San Diego is virtually open.

225
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.620
They don't have that many cases down there,

226
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.420
but there's one county outside of San Diego that has a load of cases.

227
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.670
<v 2>I also think they're realizing like, people just can't be that close to that.</v>

228
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.880
When people see other people doing things, they're like, well, I can do it.

229
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.390
We'll just do it ourselves. We'll just all hang out. Yup.

230
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.440
<v 3>Today's the big day guys. What's that we should get shut down.</v>

231
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.650
So if the numbers, what happens on Tuesday, we get shut down.

232
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.000
<v 0>What do you mean? We get shut down. What are you hearing? We'll go.</v>

233
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.870
<v 3>Back to level one really? Tuesday who told you this?</v>

234
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.450
What'd you say we want orange.

235
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.070
He's waiting for the results from the weekend to see what the goes on.

236
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.510
It takes just to make the announcement Monday. They say deaths are down though.

237
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.590
That's the day.

238
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.090
<v 0>But the cases are up high.</v>

239
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.550
So the cases are as high as they've ever been or higher.

240
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.020
<v 3>I believe they opened up Disney world in Florida. Did they open it today?</v>

241
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.490
Like today? Yeah. Florida. Doesn't give a. I don't give a. They don't.

242
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:01.260
That dude is goofy as the governor. Yeah. Goofy as dog.

243
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.880
That's not a good situation.

244
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.070
<v 2>Did you see him not be able to put on his mask?</v>

245
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.600
<v 4>He was trying to put it on vertical.</v>

246
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.640
<v 3>You guys have no idea like that guy. He had to follow other kids.</v>

247
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.430
When he went to school every day to remember where it was,

248
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.910
he was one of those morons. Look how beautiful.

249
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.170
<v 0>That Chavez of rose.</v>

250
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.100
She keeps popping that Jabin she's pleading out of her nose. Real good. Rosie.

251
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.630
Yeah. Oh.

252
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.490
<v 3>Jesus. West Palm beach is open, but Miami is DOE Jesus.</v>

253
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.370
<v 0>West Palm beach is open. Yeah. Really? That's so close to Miami though.</v>

254
00:14:35.371 --> 00:14:36.204
That's what's crazy.

255
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.100
<v 3>He's done. Yeah. Miami's got like.</v>

256
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:42.210
<v 0>So the improv in Miami shutdown. Yeah, but west Palm still open. Yeah.</v>

257
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.300
Those clubs that are still open. They just roll those dice.

258
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.870
I wonder what happened with that LOL comedy club after Callen and Shaw,

259
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.570
both tested positive end, Stevie blue. Ooh. I wonder what they did. Oh,

260
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.080
shows is in trouble. Rose is in trouble. Yeah. Rose's in trouble.

261
00:14:57.081 --> 00:15:01.960
She got rocked. Ooh, good control here.

262
00:15:01.961 --> 00:15:06.130
But oh my God, her nose is a mess. Oh Jesus Christ.

263
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.200
I might faint. Yeah.

264
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.760
Her eyes a mess. Hoof

265
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.550
on Drudge is a tank man. Uh oh. Rose is looking for that arm bar,

266
00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:21.820
but she didn't get have it. Didn't have it. Good technique here. Good guard.

267
00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:26.110
Use two minutes on her legs up there. Oh, nice. Good job. Kicking her off.

268
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.210
Yeah, she might, might be too busted up, man.

269
00:15:31.211 --> 00:15:33.820
Whatever's going on with her face is not good.

270
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:40.060
She has sh how quickly she covers up that undrawn chick is hard.

271
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.213
Strong them hammers.

272
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.390
<v 2>That power comes from this thick thighs lawn jobs because it's tree trunks.</v>

273
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.630
Yeah.

274
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.900
<v 0>Everything about her stick. I just wish I saw we were, we were talking so much.</v>

275
00:15:52.901 --> 00:15:57.190
I didn't really see what happened. I heard her. Oh.

276
00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:00.640
<v 1>Oh man. Oh it hurt.</v>

277
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.340
<v 0>She had to hit with a big right-hand there on that counter</v>

278
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.880
and that's right where the part of her face that's injured. Oh man. Oh my God.

279
00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:13.960
She has busted up. Dude. Look at her face, shape everything.

280
00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:15.850
Her whole face is a bloody mask.

281
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:18.543
<v 1>Ooh.</v>

282
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.030
<v 0>Oh my goodness. What a fight?</v>

283
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.320
Oh man. See, when,

284
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:33.850
when people slow down and then you get into these exchanges and one of them is

285
00:16:33.851 --> 00:16:38.770
just throwing hammers and you keep getting hit. Like when andraj gets close,

286
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.570
she's just winging these big shots.

287
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.540
So every time they're having these exchanges, so that's a nice left hook there,

288
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.900
but rose doesn't have enough energy to really keep her off of her seat.

289
00:16:46.901 --> 00:16:49.960
Like she's kind of, she's tired. So she's hitting her,

290
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.840
but she doesn't have enough energy to really keep her off of her.

291
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.530
And then in these exchanges. Oh, look at that. Take down. Oh, look at this.

292
00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.490
She does. She got mounted. Wow. tough. She's very tough.

293
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.350
She's called him. I got her face is a mess, dude. That left eye is up.

294
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.030
Oh, she just got here. Oh my God. Her.

295
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.610
<v 2>Eye is swelling fast.</v>

296
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.910
<v 0>Gotcha. It's so nasty. She got hit on it again and again.</v>

297
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.590
And she can't see anything coming from that side and she's got eight seconds to

298
00:17:23.591 --> 00:17:26.800
go here. Mm.

299
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:32.350
When you have a, an eye that's that closed. You're so susceptible on that side.

300
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.670
This might be it. They might stop it. Oh, it's over. That's the end? The third.

301
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.540
Oh my God. Look at her eyes, dude. Jesus Christ.

302
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.670
That's one of the worst I've ever seen her.

303
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.480
<v 3>I'll give you a little, remind them, getting the potato. Oh my God. Look.</v>

304
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.190
You're gonna stop.

305
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.350
<v 0>Joey Diaz brought Cuban food for us and I around</v>

306
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.200
filet right before.

307
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.540
<v 3>Cuban balls of debt. What are those?</v>

308
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.480
These are potato balls with the meat in the middle. Oh,

309
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.650
I got a little talking like you don't meet the dog.

310
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:07.170
I show up with my own artist. So I was, I don't want no misunderstandings.

311
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.200
I understand why people usually have the basket.

312
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.840
Like I'm supposed to be impressed. You know what I'm saying? The.

313
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.740
<v 4>Mary's I'm with you. Am I making buddy.</v>

314
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.550
<v 2>Man understand Tabasco? Go. I like.</v>

315
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.520
<v 0>It. Glasgow on eggs is very good. Very good.</v>

316
00:18:22.521 --> 00:18:26.690
But not as good as any other hot sauce. Yeah, this is,

317
00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:31.340
I'm a big fan of like L U Kotecha. I liked that real Mexican.

318
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.120
<v 5>Too. But this is what we were French.</v>

319
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:40.160
<v 0>Fries. This red hot. And this is a wing that's legit. Anything else?</v>

320
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.940
Go you. Mocha. Who makes great hot sauce? Gringo.

321
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.260
Bendito the offspring lead spring of OBS spring. Dexter.

322
00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:53.180
He's got his own hot sauce. Yeah, it's great, man. It's really good.

323
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.440
Real tasty. It's got a real kick to it. We don't even know who won this.

324
00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:02.330
It looks like rose one on looks like at least the first two rounds

325
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.690
in terms of like total strikes. But we were talking too much.

326
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.230
It looked to me like she was winning the first two rounds.

327
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:13.160
But when someone gets that badly beat up in the third,

328
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.960
their faces that much of a mess that infects the judges depends on how

329
00:19:17.961 --> 00:19:21.290
liberal they are with those 10, eight rounds too, you know? Oh my God.

330
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.143
Look at her eye.

331
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.740
That's bad.
