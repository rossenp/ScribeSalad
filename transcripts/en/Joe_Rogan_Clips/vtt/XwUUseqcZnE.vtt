1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. But yeah,</v>

2
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:06.540
the next 10 rounds you started to take over and you were solving the riddle.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.510
It's interesting that the difference in power puncher.

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.450
So like there's levels of power punchers.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.150
We always thought of him as this power puncher, like the crusher,

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.080
he knocked a lot of people out, but then there's like a Julian Jackson level.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.800
There's a difference. Some people just go stiff and George Foreman.

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.620
<v 1>Yes. He like Doug, George could kill you. Yeah. See.</v>

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.430
<v 0>It's right. The Joe Frazier fight like Jesus Christ. Yes. Terrifying. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.430
Yeah. George was one of them. I mean, there was a,

11
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.710
there's been a bunch of guys like that, but that's that,

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.910
that different level of power punching, I mean, Earnie shavers was another one.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.460
There was certain guys, you know, I mean, man, Thomas Herns in his prime,

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
the way, the way he put away, Roberto Duran, holy, kill you.

15
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.810
And it also the torque, you know, the,

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.550
there was so much distance between like the, the, the length of his arms,

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.140
the width of his shoulders. And then when that punch would come in, jeez.

18
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.250
<v 1>Catch you on the end. You got.</v>

19
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.580
<v 0>Trouble get caught on that last, that last power area.</v>

20
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.710
It would just put the lights out.

21
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.780
Kurt Coldwell I've never had that kind of power. It was like a snapping power.

22
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.630
<v 1>I mean, listen, he did have power. I don't want to take away from him,</v>

23
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.810
but he definitely, he beat a lot of guys in their home towns, home countries.

24
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.210
Like, and that's a reason why, like at a certain point in the fight,

25
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.710
you would see him hit a guy.

26
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:21.450
And then all of a sudden their body language was different.

27
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.260
And I think one thing that was lost on my whole career that nobody ever talked

28
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:28.170
about was I probably had one of the best teams in the sport of boxing over the

29
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.950
last, you know, at that time, 10 years, like I had beaten the best,

30
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.950
the heaviest punchers in, in the game. And in my weight class,

31
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.580
like if you look at COVID live out of all the damage that he's done in the light

32
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:42.660
heavyweight division, he had 20 rounds.

33
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.660
He had one moment, he didn't have a wobble.

34
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.260
He didn't have a sh he didn't shake me up anywhere, but one moment,

35
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:51.840
and it was a flash moment. So just quantify that,

36
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:54.630
like a guy who his name was the crusher, like he is who he is.

37
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.260
He had one moment in 20 rounds. So a lot of it had to do with my chin.

38
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:01.890
A lot of it had to do with my toughness, um, which is also underrated.

39
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.370
And I just like, I know this is going to sound dramatic.

40
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.660
I know it's going to sound dramatic, but I didn't like to lose.

41
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.120
And for me it was kind of like either win or die. Like that's a fact, like,

42
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:17.190
that's how I felt like it wasn't that serious,

43
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.260
but that's how it felt like I always thought about Sunday morning. Like, dude,

44
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:25.770
if you lose, it's gonna be a crazy ride home on that plane.

45
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.350
Family's going to be looking crazy, feeling bad.

46
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.020
Everybody's going to be looking at you different, like,

47
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.050
and you're gonna feel crazy. Like I remember being curled up,

48
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.000
like in a ball on a Southwest flight coming back from Lenexa, Kansas,

49
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.960
uh, losing my, the last fight ever lost against John ravish,

50
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.180
a guy from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

51
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.970
<v 0>14, that is hilarious. 14, 14 years old, retired,</v>

52
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.500
never lost again. And.

53
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.430
<v 1>John was, it was a 14, 15 year old bracket.</v>

54
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.040
So he was a little bit older and he was kind of a stocky again, country strong.

55
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.650
And we were watching these other ones separate back. And so, you know,

56
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:03.820
it's like a five-day tournament.

57
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:05.680
You could fight four to five times to get to the finals.

58
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.300
And I'm looking at him and I was a little bit intimidated.

59
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.900
He didn't punk me like, oh, I'm scared to death. But like, I was like, man,

60
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:14.734
I'm a little leery.

61
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.710
And he was knocking guys out and I was decisioning guys along the way.

62
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.760
It could have went either way. I think he won a three, two decision,

63
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.000
three judges, one his way, two judges went my way, but that would,

64
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.700
but if I was honest with myself, like I got beat before the fight.

65
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.690
And at that moment, like feeling the way I felt coming home,

66
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.060
I made up my mind like, dude, as much as that's up to me,

67
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:40.120
like that's never going to happen again. Like I can't control every,

68
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:42.250
every aspect of the fight gang stuff happens,

69
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.220
but it's not going to be because you beat me before the fight.

70
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.100
I can't live with this anymore. So that was my motivation man,

71
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:51.520
that just to drive, like it was like win or die. And then,

72
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:55.540
and then here's the thing about boxing. The only, I don't know about MMA,

73
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.340
but the only sport that I know of where one loss changes your pay scale.

74
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.150
Like if you have a minimum, okay, you win a title.

75
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:06.970
Your first defense is this second defense is that these are your minimums.

76
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.640
We'll negotiate beyond that. You know, whatever, whatever,

77
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.730
go ahead and lose one. That's going to get cut in half.

78
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.300
So a loss literally takes food off my family's table.

79
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.930
I also knew that my critics and my supporters, but namely my critics,

80
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.880
they had a front row seat, every fight.

81
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.543
<v 0>At the time.</v>

82
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.070
<v 1>They're looking down or looking up, looking down, looking up.</v>

83
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.020
So I get in the ring, you know,

84
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:32.170
before the first bell would ring and I go around and kind of just feel the ring

85
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.310
out and kind of look out and I'd always see them looking is tonight going to be

86
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:38.350
the night. So I had that weigh in on me.

87
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.800
I had the supporters that believed in me and was riding for me. And I looked,

88
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.290
you know, first couple of roles, my family's right there. My wife,

89
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:45.430
my kids would always blow her a kiss.

90
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.520
Like all of this stuff was like tangible and real to me.

91
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.860
And that's the stuff that would drive me.

92
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.170
And so when I get knocked down by COVID live like that's fight or flight time,

93
00:04:56.171 --> 00:05:01.030
baby, like whatever's in, you is going to come out. If you got some turn in you,

94
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.470
that's the time you going to turn,

95
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.890
it's going to be self preservation mode and he's going to be,

96
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:09.610
so you're going to be more focused on surviving than you are trying to win.

97
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.510
And I thank God man, that, that, that he had his hand on me that night, bro.

98
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.370
And that what was in me was real. And it was enough to break him.

99
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.770
And the rest is history.

100
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.660
<v 0>The rest is history. It isn't,</v>

101
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.220
it is amazing how much energy people get from haters. I mean,

102
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.960
I don't, I don't recommend reading negative comments or negative articles,

103
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.160
but it's amazing how people with a certain kind of resolve a championship

104
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:37.900
resolve will take that hate or.

105
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.360
And you'll get up 15 minutes earlier than you're supposed to.

106
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.540
And you'll have more intensity and your shadow boxing and you'll,

107
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:44.650
you'll just push harder.

108
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.090
<v 1>But I don't want to give the haters too much credit that it's, what's all you,</v>

109
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.630
I don't want to get too much credit. They gave you fuel though. But it was,

110
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:54.990
it was weird though. And I don't even know how to quantify.

111
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.270
I don't even know how to like explain it, but like early in my career, uh,

112
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.120
they got a lot more credit and you know, I got great mentors,

113
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:08.840
man. Um, my pastor Napoleon Kaufman, former Raider, um,

114
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.160
it's a great man of God, just a great, great man. He would always come like,

115
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:16.700
man, pastor, man, they're hating on me and he'd be like, listen, son, listen,

116
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.020
stop giving these people all this credit man. He said, listen, man, they got,

117
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.070
they can't do anything to you unless God allows it. Man.

118
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:26.630
Stay focused on what you got to do.

119
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.020
So I started to get it as I evolved in my pro career.

120
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.470
And as I started to mature as a man, so I knew they were there.

121
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.540
That element was always going to be there.

122
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:38.300
But I started letting that element of work for me. Like I wouldn't like,

123
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.840
I wouldn't just, you know, just, just be enamored with it.

124
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:44.450
And I wouldn't just sit there and read comments and stuff. You know, frankly,

125
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:47.210
the last three or four years of my career, I didn't read a mention,

126
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.940
not one mention on Twitter.

127
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:52.340
I didn't look at comments on Instagram every now and again,

128
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.100
some would slip through, but I knew they were there.

129
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.590
And I knew generally what was being said.

130
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:01.850
I knew generally what the articles in the headline would read. So it was there,

131
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.870
but the real driving force was the people that were writing for me fighting for

132
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:09.170
me, supporting me, believing in me, that element was there.

133
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.680
And I was going to address that element through my performance. But they didn't,

134
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.520
I don't want to give them too much credit though. They don't deserve.

135
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.230
<v 0>That much. They don't deserve that much credit, but they're good though.</v>

136
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:18.320
They're.

137
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.153
<v 1>Good to have.</v>

138
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.701
<v 0>It's in there,</v>

139
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:24.650
but you were very wise in the way you manage their influence by not reading

140
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:25.070
those kinds.

141
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.440
<v 1>Not all the time, but like I got the revelation, like I said,</v>

142
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:29.240
at a certain point, like, man, I'm done with this, bro.

143
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.590
I only started to read comments again. Um,

144
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.130
frankly I didn't watch boxing for the past three or four years of my career.

145
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.630
Really? And, and I'm a boxing buff. Why didn't you watch?

146
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.030
I was burnt out the opinions, the biased, the,

147
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.580
the, the double standards. Good stuff too,

148
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.510
but I would just burn and it was so weird for me because I'm the guy that would

149
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:57.290
break his neck to go watch Tuesday night, Gillette fights as a kid like, dude,

150
00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:00.110
I gotta get back, dude. You don't even know who's fighting. It doesn't matter.

151
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:02.980
It's two guys in the ring. I'm watching it Friday night fights.

152
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.100
So many years I was over it going through what I went through with the lawsuit,

153
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.900
going through what I went through with the injuries,

154
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:11.690
the highs and lows and everything in between. I was just burnt.

155
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.650
<v 0>Uh, well, can you refresh my memory? The loss was a promotion lawsuit.</v>

156
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.250
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was, it was, uh, you know, I can't get too much into it,</v>

157
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:21.330
but it was just something that man, I, I just, I,

158
00:08:21.331 --> 00:08:26.120
I fought for myself and you know, but it was, it was a long two year journey.

159
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.240
Um, on my best day, I'm like, you're doing the right thing. So I stayed, stay,

160
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.470
stay in the race, keep fighting. It may not look. It,

161
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.890
it may not be going your way now, but just stay in. Like you're not fighting.

162
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.260
Money's not coming in, but just stay the course.

163
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:42.230
You're doing the right thing on my worst day. I'm like, oh, you're blowing it.

164
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.600
You getting arrested on you. And you know,

165
00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:47.660
people are writing on war with brother fight in the courtroom and fighting the

166
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:49.520
ring and I'm like, look, that's not, Hey, I'm just trying to,

167
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.970
I'm trying to fight for what I believe is true. So, but, but I grew up a lot,

168
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.240
but coming out of that house, like, man, I'm done with all that stuff, man.

169
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:59.160
Like, I don't know how many years I got left in this sport,

170
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.290
but I'm not focused on y'all.

171
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:06.300
I got to focus on me and it wasn't until I retired and got full-time in a

172
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:09.420
broadcasting and commentating that I started to watch again, I started to,

173
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.580
you know, understand who was out there on the, you know,

174
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.060
in the landscape and research in it. But I didn't watch it for many years.

175
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:15.930
That's crazy.

176
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.310
<v 0>Yeah. I was done. It makes sense. I mean,</v>

177
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:21.960
you probably in your early days were so hungry for boxing because you had so

178
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:25.050
much desire that you wanted to watch it all the time. Excuse me.

179
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.630
But the amount of effort required to become a champion.

180
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.120
<v 1>And see the behind the scenes though. Hmm.</v>

181
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.040
Then you grow up and you see the business side and you see the dark side.

182
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.430
It's like, mm it's different. The darkness dark side.

183
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.160
<v 0>Yeah. There's a lot of that man in boxing. I mean,</v>

184
00:09:41.161 --> 00:09:45.480
it's historical that Don king Mike Tyson stories. I mean,

185
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.840
there's so many stories like that. And Don king Muhammad Ali,

186
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.620
there's so many stories like that. It's it's so sad.

187
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.050
It's it's an awful side of the business. It is.
