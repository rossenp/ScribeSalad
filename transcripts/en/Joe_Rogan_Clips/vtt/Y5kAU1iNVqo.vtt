00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.080
<v 2>Like I remember the first time I ever met Anthony Bordain, I said, uh,</v>

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.060
my wife says, you're my boyfriend. I'm just like,

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:14.670
what the? Because I, my wife used to say, oh,

5
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:15.900
you're watching your boyfriend on TV.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.020
She would always joke around because I loved that. No reservation show.

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.390
So I said that to him, it came out totally wrong, but that's, uh, you know,

8
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.450
he's a guy like really admired and here he is, he's right there.

9
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.580
And you you're all uncomfortable and weird.

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.410
And so people are going to be like that with you.

11
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.240
<v 0>I bet he was so down to.</v>

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.250
<v 1>Earth. Super normal. Yeah. He was great. Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.230
<v 0>So was DeNiro. Like I worked with DeNiro though. Yeah. DeNiro. Oh, Joe,</v>

14
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:43.410
this is the best story. I was at the seller late at night.

15
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:47.970
And he was there with Taylor Hackford looking. He's a huge director,

16
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.010
married to Helen Mirren. He was the head of the directors Guild, um,

17
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.550
directed Ray and an officer and a gentleman like a huge amount of movies.

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.630
And deniera was looking for comics to be in his movie.

19
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.970
And I was doing a set and I do this thing in my act where I turn around and talk

20
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:07.650
to myself. Um,

21
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.210
my special's called talking to myself where I have an inner dialogue and I'm

22
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.090
like, doesn't matter how this goes. You'll never make it. You know,

23
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:18.960
like I have a whole back to my back to the audience and,

24
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.890
and he loved it. And I was,

25
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.790
I went to Florida to do an old age community Jewish show.

26
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.950
Yeah. And that Saturday I get a call and it's Taylor Hackford. And he's like,

27
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:35.340
this is Taylor Hackford. And I'm like, okay. I had no idea who the hell he was.

28
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.460
And he's like, Bob would like to meet with you on Wednesday. And I'm like, Bob,

29
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:43.200
who? I, no idea.

30
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.800
I'm like Bob, the builder. I had no idea. And he's like Bob DeNiro.

31
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:50.370
And I'm like, okay. So I'm like, I can make it.

32
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.800
So I walk into the office and I walk in the room and he's sitting

33
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:58.770
there and I was not star struck. It was the weirdest thing.

34
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.010
Cause he looked like a, just a guy from off the street. Like he had jeans on.

35
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:05.490
And I don't know, I just, he was like a regular guy to me.

36
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.950
And I sat with him for three hours and I hit it off with him and to make a very

37
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:15.030
long story short, I ended up being his right-hand person in this movie.

38
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.190
I became, I had a producer credit.

39
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.400
I was in his ear the whole time on a microphone. I,

40
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.020
I taught him how to do stand up.

41
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.890
And he played a comic who had been doing it for 36 years in a movie called the

42
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:30.390
comedian. I ended up directing some of the scenes. Um,

43
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.140
I mean, it might've been like six years ago. Something like that.

44
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.970
How do I not know about this? Oh, you got it. Yeah. Yeah. That's he and I, yeah,

45
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.590
we became very close.

46
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.310
<v 1>South comedian gives tips to Robert DeNiro.</v>

47
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.230
<v 0>He's a, he's an amazing person. He really is cool.</v>

48
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.270
So down to earth, you would think he has the biggest ego. He has no ego.

49
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.410
<v 1>It can't be that good.</v>

50
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.743
<v 0>Hey.</v>

51
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.240
<v 1>I mean to be as good as he is you to have a pretty strong mind. Yeah.</v>

52
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.510
<v 0>Not. And he, I think like that,</v>

53
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:08.710
I never was star struck with him. Like I didn't care.

54
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.600
I just sat with him and was like, and we've still very close. And I,

55
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.170
I love him. I really do. Like, he just,

56
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.510
he just doesn't give a. He's so he's so funny. Like he,

57
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.210
he has all these kids. He's like, he's just really amazing. He's really amazing.

58
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.673
<v 1>His six kids.</v>

59
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.513
<v 0>Wow.</v>

60
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.250
<v 1>Yeah. It was one lady or a gang at, you know, a.</v>

61
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.200
<v 0>Couple of, couple of.</v>

62
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.180
<v 1>Different, different.</v>

63
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.700
<v 0>Baby moms. We like talking about women together. Like he's amazing. Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.770
He just got divorced. I know the second time to same woman. Yeah, yeah.

65
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.830
<v 1>Yeah. When guys are that old and they get divorced, I'm like,</v>

66
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.120
how bad must it be?

67
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.580
<v 0>Yeah. For the second time.</v>

68
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.400
<v 1>When you're like, you want to be alone and you're 78 or whatever it is.</v>

69
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.890
<v 0>Well, the guy, let me tell you something. He's hot.</v>

70
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.330
He works out every morning at five in the morning with a trainer he's built.

71
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:04.360
He has tattoos all over him. I mean, I used to sit in a trail. Yeah.

72
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:06.490
He's tatted up. He's got muscles.

73
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.180
<v 1>His tattoos all over the place. Now his chest, Jamie find these.</v>

74
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.140
<v 0>There might be, I mean, there might be photos on it,</v>

75
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:16.600
but I would sit with him and his trailer. He was getting his makeup done,

76
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.840
but hung out with Harvey Keitel they were all in the movie.

77
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:21.310
Harvey Keitel Danny DeVito.

78
00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:24.040
And I used to go out to dinner with them at lunch with them every day and,

79
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.890
and harvest like, yo Harvey was like,

80
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:29.410
I want to take you to lunch and want you to teach me how to do standup.

81
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.620
So I went to lunch with him. I'm like, I am not teaching every old actor now,

82
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.320
but I said to Harvey, why did you, you know, you're Jewish guy from New York.

83
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.750
Why'd you become a Marine. He goes so I could kill people.

84
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.270
That's what he said to me. Whoa. Yeah. He's a tough.

85
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.190
<v 1>Dude. He might not want you to tell people that.</v>

86
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.080
<v 0>And he, no, he doesn't give a. He's a mate to Harvey. Keitel is amazing.</v>

87
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.160
I love.

88
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.993
<v 1>This tough.</v>

89
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.800
<v 0>Heat. What an actor.</v>

90
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.990
<v 1>One little tattoo.</v>

91
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.700
<v 0>But he has more than that. No, he.</v>

92
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.460
<v 1>Has more than the enemy. He's a hundred years old in this movie. No.</v>

93
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.870
<v 0>No. He has more than that. On the other arm. He does.</v>

94
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.240
He has more than that for sure.

95
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.210
<v 1>Like.</v>

96
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.220
<v 0>Me. No, not like you.</v>

97
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.280
<v 1>Like you said, it doesn't have any tattoos. Wow. He must've got them after,</v>

98
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.610
but that looks really recently click on that. Robert de Niro at the beach.

99
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.580
<v 0>Now he doesn't have them. Like you.</v>

100
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.960
<v 1>Does three years ago. You crazy line. You son.</v>

101
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.220
First of all, you lied about Robert now his tattoos.

102
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.730
<v 0>Because they might've put more on him for the movie. I'm an idiot,</v>

103
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.230
but he does have.

104
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.820
<v 1>Them. Okay. They're not real.</v>

105
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.770
<v 0>No, he has one in that photo.</v>

106
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.520
<v 1>One little tattoo. Look at that stupid little tiger crawling up his leg.</v>

107
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.060
<v 0>Seriously. It was after he had makeup done. Maybe they put extra on him.</v>

108
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.310
I don't know. I don't know if they did. Yeah.

109
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.900
<v 1>How weird though? Did they appear in the movie? The tattoos,</v>

110
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.413
maybe you got to remember.

111
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.700
<v 0>He did have more tattoos in the movie. He did.</v>

112
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.470
<v 1>Maybe he got him removed. He.</v>

113
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.340
<v 0>Did, because he was playing younger. They, they, uh, painted his beard, black,</v>

114
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.330
you know, his black, he had a black mustache and black,

115
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.440
it wasn't gray in the movie. He was like in his sixties, in the movie.

116
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.710
Um, but he was great. And he has no, he has no, uh,

117
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.900
like he's not stuck up or like he's not egotistical.

118
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.520
He's not what youth people would think of you.

119
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.430
<v 1>As well. He's a real artist amaz. I mean,</v>

120
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:32.330
if you want to do a film like taxi driver or Cape fear or,

121
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.380
I mean any of the transformative movies, raging bull. I mean,

122
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:39.980
he was literally the first active decided he's going to gain weight for a movie,

123
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.020
right? No one did that before him. He transformed his literal body.

124
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.660
I mean, he was shredded.

125
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.100
And then he became like really overweight for that movie. Raging bull.

126
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.770
<v 0>Oh. Want to hear the best story?</v>

127
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.990
The first day of filming was at a deli in Brooklyn and Taylor Hackford didn't

128
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:04.790
even know that he like hired me to be his right-hand person. So Denise says,

129
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.030
Jessica calls me and he's like, why don't you to come to Brooklyn? Come to the,

130
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.560
to the filming today. I need you to punch up some jokes for me. I'm like,

131
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.530
oh boy, does Taylor know I'm coming? And he's like, I don't care.

132
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:17.030
I just want you to show up and help me out.

133
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.270
So I show up he's in the middle. I get there a little late because of traffic.

134
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.180
He's in the middle of doing a scene with, uh,

135
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.940
with Danny DeVito and uh,

136
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.410
Patty LuPone who plays Danny DeVito's wife. Right?

137
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.670
So I walk in, do Niro, runs up to me. He goes, I need a joke for this line.

138
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.180
So I give him a joke. So I go wait in the side. And uh,

139
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.080
he says the line and Patty and Danny start hysterically laughing.

140
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.460
So Taylor starts yelling, what the is going on here? We got to get through this.

141
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:52.760
Why are they laughing? She goes, well, Jessica came in and gave me a joke.

142
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:54.740
So he comes over and he starts yelling at me.

143
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.430
This is the first day of filming goes. You can't just do this.

144
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:02.150
You can't just come in here and screw up everything. And DeNiro took his arm.

145
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:06.530
And he goes, if you ever talk to her, like he starts screaming. I'm like,

146
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:08.720
what is happening? Where am I?

147
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.630
I'm in the filming with Robert DeNiro. I was just at the seller doing a set,

148
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:19.280
like what is happening? He goes, don't you ever talk to her like that again?

149
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.770
I mean, that set the tone for the next six months,

150
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.850
because he knew not to talk to me. And like, he set the tone,

151
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.350
like don't ever talk to her and I'm just sitting there like eating a free

152
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:35.030
condition. Like, where am I what's happening? It was amazing.

153
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:40.040
Oh, I was treated like gold after that. His temper is,
