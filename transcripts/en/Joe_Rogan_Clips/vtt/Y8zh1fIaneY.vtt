00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Joshua, you, you were talking about Kamala Harris,</v>

2
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:08.760
and I think this might be a good time to talk about this because she might be

3
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:11.220
the vice presidential nominee. What,

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.010
what specifically did she do,

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.870
where there was someone who was innocent or someone who was

6
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:20.070
wrongfully convicted?

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.300
<v 1>Let me give a caveat caveat is that I know I'll catch from some people that say</v>

8
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:30.920
you have to do everything you can to make sure that Trump is not elected. Um,

9
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.360
and I will say that even, or even she's an improvement as vice-president,

10
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.720
um, if he does pick our anything's an improvement of my mind.

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.550
So with that caveat, we,

12
00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:44.270
it would take this podcast and four more to go through.

13
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.640
She fiercely fought wrongful convictions and

14
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.320
was shamed by judges who,

15
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:56.360
when she was district attorney in San Francisco, what was the case? The gate,

16
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.860
the gauge case George gave the George gage case where her

17
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.340
prosecutors hit evidence. Um,

18
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.920
and they tried to protect once.

19
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:10.190
She knew that there was, um,

20
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.080
evidence that was withheld from defense attorneys.

21
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.420
Once she should have known, in my opinion, that people were innocent.

22
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.120
She tried to protect those convictions. Why?

23
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.290
Because she wanted to continue winning. She blocked DNA. She,

24
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.000
she went to great lengths to try to

25
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:36.920
block access to DNA for people that were accused of or convicted of felonies.

26
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:37.341
Think about it.

27
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:42.140
We're talking about a $12 DNA test to see if the biological material

28
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:44.210
from a crime, um,

29
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.050
that has been preserved is actually the defendant's right.

30
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.910
She blocked access to that.

31
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.580
<v 0>I mean, how do you block access to something like that?</v>

32
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:54.650
That seems like that should be a right? Yeah. It.

33
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.730
<v 1>Seems like it should be a right,</v>

34
00:01:55.731 --> 00:02:00.710
but in a lot of states there's legislation that says you cannot get access to

35
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:05.180
it. And the rationale behind that is that it'll open up a flood gate of criminal

36
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:08.630
defendants asking for the biological evidence in their case to be tested.

37
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.900
<v 0>Oh, that's the last thing we would want is more innocent people being freed.</v>

38
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.150
So what was her justification for.

39
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.410
<v 1>That? You know, when she's asked for her justification of it,</v>

40
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.490
it's always been on a debate stage and she'll always default to,

41
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:26.870
I stand by my record as a prosecutor. And, um,

42
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.850
she's never had an explanation that I have ever seen. I don't know, Jason,

43
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.900
there was Jason and I were talking about this before we came on today because

44
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:39.200
there was a New York times piece by, um, her name is escaping me,

45
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.530
Lara basil and Leora basil on which if,

46
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.970
if any of your listeners want to listen to it or she goes into, you know,

47
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:51.830
exhaustive detail about specific cases and things that Kamala Harris

48
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:56.300
did and you know, the sad part about it. Yeah. That's it right there. York.

49
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.910
<v 0>Times, Kamel Harris was not a progressive prosecutor.</v>

50
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.720
<v 1>Yeah. She was often on the wrong side of history. Um, well, and.</v>

51
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.000
<v 0>Is that the highlight? The marijuana one that you just.</v>

52
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.250
<v 2>Don't, she, she, she stood.</v>

53
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.350
<v 1>By criminalizing marijuana in this state.</v>

54
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.090
<v 3>Now listen,</v>

55
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.420
what we can hope is that she's certainly been saying all the right things

56
00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:18.420
lately. I don't know what to believe, to be honest,

57
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.170
she wants to be the president. Well, okay. Fair enough. I mean,

58
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.130
I like to believe that people are going to evolve and I hope that her viewpoints

59
00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:30.720
have evolved now. She supports, um, legalization, uh, I believe,

60
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.950
but the fact is it's, it's impossible to ignore and I hope, I hope, uh,

61
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:38.550
Biden picked someone else personally, but you know, we'll see. Um,

62
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.830
and I don't mean picking anything. I will,

63
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.980
they're doing it for them at this point. Well, I'll support him no matter what,

64
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.930
uh, who he picks, uh, if he picks her.

65
00:03:45.931 --> 00:03:49.920
So be it because I believe we're in an existential crisis and we need to, uh,

66
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.500
to see the results. Look at this. This is crazy. She.

67
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.960
<v 1>Could have demanded DNA testing in Cooper's case.</v>

68
00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:59.820
Now Kevin Cooper is on death row. All right. You think about this could,

69
00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:03.150
if they had denied DNA testing and Clemente's case,

70
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.450
he would have been either dead or still on death row.

71
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.580
What are we talking about here? We're talking about a test. She has constantly,

72
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.150
in case after case issue, after issue, and look,

73
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.680
the people that she hurts the most or people of color in this country,

74
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.470
because they make up, you know.

75
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.540
<v 2>The big portion of disproportionate. And so it's, it's, it's kind of true.</v>

76
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.660
<v 0>Children think made me sick, awful.</v>

77
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.130
She went after the parents of truant children and threatened them with jail

78
00:04:35.131 --> 00:04:37.470
time. Imagine you're a single mom,

79
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.240
you're just doing your best to put food on the table.

80
00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:40.770
You have to work two jobs and your,

81
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.000
your kids are understandably up and not going to school.

82
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.200
Cause there's no father around.

83
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.390
<v 2>You know, how'd you, you know? Yeah. You know.</v>

84
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.780
<v 1>Devastating. This is, think about it this way,</v>

85
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.410
because I can only think about it in real life. Examples. Okay. This is.

86
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.840
<v 2>How there's enough of a show.</v>

87
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.030
<v 1>And a fight to get out. Even at look, I have a client in New York who is like,</v>

88
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.130
and these people become like family to us. I mean,

89
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:10.080
he's adopted one of the exonerees is his daughter. Now, you know,

90
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.130
John Restivo was convicted of raping and murdering someone with two of his

91
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:16.380
friends. Two people that worked for him.

92
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.440
He is framed by a cop.

93
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.420
They take a hair from the victim and they planted in his moving truck. Oh,

94
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.320
Jesus Christ.

95
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.700
The way that they found out that it was planted is that when your hair

96
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.890
you're going to love this, right? When the hair is attached to the human head,

97
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.210
when you die,

98
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.590
there's a physiological phenomenon that happens called

99
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.330
post-mortem root banding,

100
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.980
where a band goes around the root of your hair. Okay.

101
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.170
And it happens after you've been dead.

102
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.940
The minimum four hours prosecution's theory is that he picks up this

103
00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:58.460
girl, 16 year old girl, walking home from the roller rink with his two buddies,

104
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.230
throws her in a van. They rape her killer and dumper near a cemetery.

105
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.180
And it all happens in 45 minutes.

106
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.760
The way that they finally find out that he was framed is it's a moving

107
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:11.300
truck.

108
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.800
They searched his moving truck and they find hundreds of hairs because you

109
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.250
should, we all shed hair. They find one hair from the victim.

110
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.500
And it's pristine. It's the only pristine hair in the truck. No kinks on it.

111
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:28.790
No dirt, no debris. And there's a post-mortem root band around it,

112
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.960
which means they had to have taken it from the autopsy after four,

113
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:33.950
after four hours.

114
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:38.330
And we ended up finding out that the cop had access to the envelopes where the

115
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:41.060
autopsy was in any event,

116
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.680
John Restivo back to the DNA, the perpetrator.

117
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.500
And they had a lot of semen, a lot of biological material DNA.

118
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.220
He fought for years to get access to the DNA,

119
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.560
finally gets access to it.

120
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.250
They test the DNA and he's excluded.

121
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.830
And his two co-defendants are excluded. All right.

122
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.160
What the prosecutor does is they say, okay, well,

123
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:11.210
there must have been a fourth perpetrator. So they start testing.

124
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.590
And this is a process that till years they start five years,

125
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.600
they start testing every single known male associate of John Restivo,

126
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.980
Dennis Halstadt and John Kogut. And they can't. And it's only after that,

127
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.690
that he gets out,

128
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.800
he spent 18 years for a rape and murder.

129
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:34.820
He didn't commit he's, you know, I love him. He's like a,

130
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.240
like a brother to me now, but you know, he's destroyed. You.

131
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.390
<v 0>Don't come back from it. What happens to someone like that?</v>

132
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:43.210
Did they have any recourse? Is there anything that they can do.

133
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.630
<v 1>Happy ending in that regard? In John's sorta, I was one of his,</v>

134
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.760
one of the lawyers that represented him in his civil rights trial. Um,

135
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.960
he was awarded $18 million,

136
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:59.770
a million dollars for every year that he was incarcerated.

137
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.560
And, you know, to show you like what the lasting psychological damage.

138
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.760
So we got to go to a civil jury for civil rights violations against Nassau

139
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.970
county, which indemnified this cop that framed him.

140
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.620
And he got some closure that way to the extent that you can get any closure.

141
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.570
And we were outside waiting for the verdict outside of the courthouse and he's

142
00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:26.380
smoking a cigarette and he put out the cigarette and he took a paper bag.

143
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.330
He took a plastic bag out of his pocket,

144
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.260
grabbed the bud and put it in the plastic bag and sealed it and put it in his

145
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.110
pocket. I said, John, what the are you doing? He said,

146
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:40.150
you think I'm going to let someone take my DNA and free me

147
00:08:40.151 --> 00:08:44.200
again? You know? And I, you know, that's how bad it is.

148
00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:48.700
So think about that in the context of Kamala Harris to block

149
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:51.700
access to DNA. Once you get the DNA,

150
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.550
you're still sometimes in a crazy uphill battle because there's prosecutors,

151
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:58.680
in my opinion, just like Kamala Harris,

152
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.660
the one-on-one that want to win and want to protect that conviction. Okay.
