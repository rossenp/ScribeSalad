1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.880
<v 0>You know, let's talk about something. I think you guys can both agree on. Cause,</v>

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.240
uh, I am baffled by this carnivore diet. Yes. And baffled. Yes.

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.120
I'm baffled by how many people are, are clinging to it as a panacea.

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.760
I'm baffled by whether or not it's a physiological effect or whether

5
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.910
there's a placebo effect going on. I have a theory please.

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.710
<v 1>Yeah. So my theory is that it mimics some of the benefits of fasting,</v>

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.530
um,

8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.630
but allows people to persist for longer because it's providing some nutrition,

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.390
you know, most, if you look in the scientific literature,

10
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.230
fasting is like the cure all for everything. I agree with you. I mean,

11
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.980
like you can look at any condition and fasting is the cure. We're time water.

12
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.220
<v 2>Fasting. So you can do it for 2, 3, 4.</v>

13
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.900
<v 1>Weeks. Right? The problem is try that for a year &lt;laugh&gt; you know,</v>

14
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.580
and that will be the cure for life in that case. &lt;laugh&gt; wow. Um.

15
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.380
<v 2>The longest example is a year of water fasting.</v>

16
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.420
<v 1>So most people are not guy that lost. It.</v>

17
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.253
<v 0>Was 300.</v>

18
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.300
<v 1>He, he was extremely obese. You know, he was a.</v>

19
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.250
<v 2>Lot of G stores living.</v>

20
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.090
<v 1>Living off of his fat stores. Right. But the.</v>

21
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.010
<v 0>Fascinating thing about that was that he actually is skinran too right. Which.</v>

22
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.570
<v 1>Is really no. Yeah. Which doesn't usually happen with weight loss. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.450
So this is just a theory. I have nothing to, you know,

24
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:14.370
I don't have any evidence,

25
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.090
but when meat is absorbed very high up in the digestive tract.

26
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.400
And so when you only eat meat, it's a low residue diet,

27
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.400
and there's nothing left over to irritate or inflame the gut.

28
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.360
My theory is a lot of people who are benefiting from this have a really

29
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:34.240
disrupted gut microbiome alesioph fsano has argued that leaky gut is kind of

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.600
a pre-condition for auto immunity. And this,

31
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.920
the carnivore diet is essentially like a gut rest or a fast.

32
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.150
And so I don't, you know, the out that people are benefiting from it.

33
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.350
The question is what is the long term implication? Well, there.

34
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.790
<v 0>Is no, I mean, there's a few people that have been doing it.</v>

35
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:54.030
There's some anecdotal evidence we've been doing it for a few.

36
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.230
<v 2>Decades. Well, you know, it's pretty cool. I'm actually going on my homeboy,</v>

37
00:01:57.231 --> 00:02:00.310
Sean bakerker's podcast in a few weeks. We, we guys are homeboys.

38
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.260
We start Sean and I started as enemies. We love other Sean. I love you, brother.

39
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.180
We're gonna have an honest discussion as much as you can to say,

40
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.620
why is michaelkayla Peterson feeling good? And you gotta love that.

41
00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:14.020
And honor that if she had done water, fasting,

42
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:17.900
transitioning to an ultra cleanan diet, would she have done as well? Who knows,

43
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:22.740
but to look at Sean Baker's labs and say pre-diabetic low testosterone

44
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.770
high B N I'm concerned. Although he just published his Corona artery,

45
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.890
calcium scan of zero. And I honor that he's got little kids.

46
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.930
I don't want the guy to drop dead, but you know,

47
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:35.450
there's it's way preliminary for the bandwagon. The problem with.

48
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.610
<v 0>The testosterone thing though,</v>

49
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.930
is he said that he had been deadlifting the day before. And uh,

50
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.930
the day before he took his test, could that have sign significantly?

51
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:45.880
Do he increase his testosterone? Well, he.

52
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.000
<v 2>Said he repeated it a few times and it stayed low. But if your serumm total,</v>

53
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.320
yeah, it raised quite a bit. It could have didn raise.

54
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:55.080
I think it raised by a hundred percent. Nah, it was it's. It was like 237.

55
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.040
I can't memorize his last, but there's it's its low though.

56
00:02:57.041 --> 00:03:00.120
There's plenty of data. If your serumm total testosterone is less than 250,

57
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.040
it's an adverse mortality predictor. And you know, he wants to be alive.

58
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.120
He doesn't need to do it.

59
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.560
Kayeb Peterson and Jordan might need to do it until they find a better path.

60
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.480
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; Sean's, you know, uh, adopted it. So there's, you know,

61
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:16.560
the biggest puzzle is let quickly quickly one of the things that plant-based

62
00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:18.160
eaters and uh,

63
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.070
P people that fill three quarters of their plate with food and vegetables get

64
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:21.871
way more than everybody.

65
00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:25.190
Else's lots of vitamin C and vitamin C builds healthy walls and builds healthy

66
00:03:25.191 --> 00:03:28.830
immune systems. You love vitamin C. I love vitamin C. I love it from foods.

67
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.950
I don't mind it as a supplement. I don't mind it.

68
00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:35.590
Intravenous vitamin C is line is polling. There's so many, uh, uh,

69
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.390
benefits to the body. Where are these people?

70
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.300
When every art says the meat has no vitamin C, are they eating raw meat?

71
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:45.540
Which might have vitamin C, are they eating organ meat?

72
00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:46.900
Which might have some vitamins. Let me.

73
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.820
<v 0>Let me stop you there because I'll tell you what the explanation's been to me.</v>

74
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:50.120
Yeah.

75
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.940
The explanation to me has been that there is a decrease in absorption of vitamin

76
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.980
C when you're consuming vitamin C with all these other things,

77
00:03:56.981 --> 00:04:00.570
chrisaerous vegetables, right? Ofbohydrate rates all these different things.

78
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.570
If there's some sort of a, there's an adverse effect, is that, is that a fact?

79
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.070
Well.

80
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.610
<v 2>The per if you take a thousand milligrams of vitamin C, you absorb a lot of it.</v>

81
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:12.650
You take 10,000 milligrams on percentage. You won't absorb as much,

82
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.770
but you'll still get more than a thousand milligrams.

83
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.170
But there's also this theory that since they're eating basically and no added

84
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.960
glucose, yet that there's some kind of competition in us. Yes.

85
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:26.520
Between glucose and C. So even if they get a, a touch of sea,

86
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:29.960
they're absorbing it hyper, efficiently, nobody knows they haven't developed.

87
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.960
<v 0>Then they're getting glucose from glucose Genesis.</v>

88
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.400
<v 2>Uh, internally. Right. Cuz they're adding, you know,</v>

89
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:38.520
certainly it's a low carb diet. No doubt. About's getting a car, a little,

90
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.470
a little alpha gal in there. Maybe that's 's about feel like her.

91
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.790
<v 1>I think, I mean the point is we just don't know. We don't know. And, and I,</v>

92
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.270
it seems so riskym, I mean, as a, as a practitioner, myself,

93
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.030
and as someone who's dealt with chronic illness who wasn't able to find help

94
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.310
anywhere else. I mean, I,

95
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.670
I do not be grudgge people for sticking with something that,

96
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:00.750
that works when they've tried everything and nothing is worked and they do this

97
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.540
and feel good. I mean, who can blame them? It's it's really well. I've gone.

98
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.100
<v 0>To dinner with Jordan, Jordan Peterson,</v>

99
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.460
and he's eating these big giant steaks and he looks great. Well, you know,

100
00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:11.220
he's lighter than he is been since he was 25. That's true. And.

101
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.100
<v 1>I, and I'm, I'm 100% empathetic with that,</v>

102
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.580
cuz I've been through something like that myself. But to,

103
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.860
to then take that and say that we're certain that it's safe is a big leap.

104
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.210
<v 2>Yeah. And really thing is, you know,</v>

105
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.610
my field atherosclcrosis takes years to develop and I wish him well,

106
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.490
he's contributing amazing things in the world,

107
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.730
but unless he's tracking carotid and coronary and doing it year after year after

108
00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:35.250
year, you know, it's an experiment. You might not wanna run. You find.

109
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.610
<v 0>But on did run those testss baseline. Resultsbaseline.</v>

110
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.210
<v 1>Baseline. Yeah. Some, some nutrient deficiencies also take many years to run.</v>

111
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.920
So that's another thing.

112
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.920
<v 0>To consider Sean. There's another guy that I follow online. I'm sorry.</v>

113
00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:48.600
I forget the gentleman's name, but he advocates organ meat.

114
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.080
And he's saying that organ meat,

115
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.480
if you're just eating steak that you've got an issue.

116
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.400
But if you take in account liver and heart kidneys,

117
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.680
that you are gonna get all these essential nutrients.

118
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 1>From that you're, you're still not getting vitamin C that I'm aware of. Okay.</v>

119
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:06.880
In any significant amount you're not getting uh crottenoids and flaoids and so

120
00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:07.280
how these people.

121
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.600
<v 0>Not gettingenols.</v>

122
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.840
<v 2>Yeah, we dunno. We dunno. Yeah. So.</v>

123
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.800
<v 1>Yeah, we don't know is a good summation of, of,</v>

124
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.670
is it possible that there's some mechanism that's going on on the absolutely.

125
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.070
Sean.

126
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.270
<v 2>Posted a picture. He was eating steak and cheese.</v>

127
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.310
So it's apparently not an all meat diet and I'm not slamming him.

128
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.470
I really wish him well and he can do what he wants. I don't know.

129
00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:30.510
He's a very nice guy. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I mean, I'm not slamming, but he's.

130
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.231
<v 1>Not. So the nose, nose,</v>

131
00:06:31.231 --> 00:06:35.270
tail is important though because the organ meats and then likeara fatier cuts of

132
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:38.620
meat have glycine and other neutral means that are really important if you're

133
00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:42.940
only eating lean meat. I think, yeah. I would be very concerned about that.

134
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.740
<v 2>Children did not try this at home.</v>

135
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.660
<v 0>Is someone tried to get me, they were saying,</v>

136
00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:50.500
you should try a carnivore diet for 90 days. And I said, well,

137
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.500
the real problem with that would be I eat game and that's extremely low,

138
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:58.890
very lean. Yeah. It's not smart. And I like veget, Ables. I like vegetables.

139
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.450
I like to eat them. I mean, I eat,

140
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.050
I eat vegetables with essentially every single meal. Yeah. That's very smart.

141
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.930
<v 2>As I told you, it's an antidote. If nothing else. I mean, it's.</v>

142
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:07.150
<v 0>Awesome.</v>

143
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.250
But I do think that it's entirely possible that maybe it's people that have this

144
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.850
disruptedm gut microbiome, but that some people might be alert.

145
00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:17.970
Like one of the things that Michaela Peterson brought up when she,

146
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.680
she was on the podcast, that it,

147
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.120
it might very well be that she's allergic to almost everything. Right.

148
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.800
She has some sort of an all allergic reaction. You,

149
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.920
I think you both think that that could be because of a up gut. My no.

150
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.760
<v 2>Doubt. Doubt. Absolutely. Absolutely. She just hasn't had evaluated. She,</v>

151
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.520
she started to laugh when I talked to my nauropath,

152
00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:38.320
that's what she should have kept on doing and gotten her gut analyze and gotten

153
00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:41.350
her gut healed. I mean, maybe that would've helped her, you know.

154
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.750
<v 0>Conject the problem with those nauropaths it's like good psychics.</v>

155
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.110
Can I try to find one? I'll tell you.

156
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.990
<v 1>It's also not look, not all problems are solvable. Yeah. Right. That's we,</v>

157
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.950
that's a really hard thing to accept. Yeah. Um,

158
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.990
but let's say you get in a car accident and your spine is crushed, you know,

159
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.060
know most in short of a miracle, you know,

160
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:06.820
that's not that person's not gonna re fully regain their 100% of their,

161
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.140
uh, you know, musculoskeletal capabilities. Right. Right.

162
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.620
But we don't have that same understanding with other conditions that health

163
00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:18.140
conditions let's say, I go, you know, to, uh,

164
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.810
Indonesia and I get at 10 parasites and you know, like, and,

165
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.970
and then I have to take tons of antibiotics to deal with that is my gut ever

166
00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:30.290
gonna return to 100% of the function that it,

167
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:33.330
that it had before that even with all the right things, maybe not.

168
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.210
And so I'm not saying that they should, the people should give up hope. And I'm,

169
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.930
I'm saying that like there, we,

170
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.880
we have to separate between this is helping me and it's making me feel great and

171
00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:46.280
nothing else worked. Right.

172
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.960
And we know with a hundred percent certainty that this is safe for the long

173
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:53.680
term. Right. Those are two very different questions. And again,

174
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.440
I'm totally empathetic to that, you know?

175
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.040
And I would probably do the same thing, especi their situally.

176
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.760
<v 0>Yourself that has gone through this process of being extremely.</v>

177
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.200
<v 1>Unhealthy. Yeah. And, and I might even say, Hey, Hey, you know,</v>

178
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.160
if I maybe I'll die five years earlier, but I'll enjoy the re you know,

179
00:09:09.161 --> 00:09:12.440
those years of my life, I won't be in pain and discomfort the entire time.

180
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.150
Then sign me up. Or I might, I might say to myself, well, wait,

181
00:09:16.151 --> 00:09:20.150
it can't be that good for me to be inflamed all the time. And like, right.

182
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.790
You know, it, it, that can't be good for me. So maybe even though the,

183
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.190
the all meat diet might have some downsides, it,

184
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.310
it actually might be reducing inflammation. And,

185
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.350
and therefore that will cancel out. We just don't know. But what about an.

186
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.750
<v 0>All meat diet? The thing that gets me is there's no vitamin supplementation.</v>

187
00:09:34.751 --> 00:09:38.980
Am I? What about an all meat diet with a good supplementation of multivitamins?

188
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.380
<v 2>They a pretty smart idea. &lt;laugh&gt; what about fiber?</v>

189
00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:44.420
Where's omega three coming from, yeah. There's no fiber is fiber essential.

190
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.580
Well, it's being questioned. I mean,

191
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.340
is it as central to health in the medical literature?

192
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.380
Dr. Dennis burkeett from England went to africadescribe fiber described it

193
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.730
reduced all kinds of, uh, chronic diseases.

194
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.250
You wrote a book called the fiberman and all it's being questioned.

195
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.290
Now it's so entrenched. Have we got it all wrong?

196
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.690
And only plants have fiber is a good question where they get in their fiber.

197
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.850
Their meat is sticking in their colon.

198
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.930
It's called pre faction for days and days. That's is it? Yeah. Well, it's,

199
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.360
that is what happens. High meat died. There's a process, but is it a hundred.

200
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.880
<v 0>Percent with every single person when you chew it well and drink water?</v>

201
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.240
Does it always get stuck? Well.

202
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.920
<v 2>It's generally thought that it's fiber.</v>

203
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.680
That is the process of moving abdominal contents, whether you eat, uh, uh,

204
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.880
an all plant diet or.

205
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.960
<v 1>Mixture. No, I mean, I, I think there's,</v>

206
00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:34.080
there's definitely controversy about fiber,

207
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.480
but I think the weight of the evidence, the,

208
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.590
it still does suggest that fermentable carbohydrates, fiber essentially,

209
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:45.310
and likeer acid are beneficial because be they are very important for the

210
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:48.470
microbiome. And we have, you know, people like Justin Sonberg at Stanford,

211
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.990
who's done a lot of good work here. Um,

212
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.110
do we know with a hundred percent certainty know,

213
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.380
but we also know that virtually every human population that's ever have been

214
00:10:57.381 --> 00:11:01.500
studied had significant amounts of fiber in their diet. So,

215
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.700
so if we're going the messai right. No, they, they,

216
00:11:04.701 --> 00:11:08.460
they did so that the very high, when the warriors,

217
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.540
they consumed the warriors consumed milk and meat and blood at certain times of

218
00:11:13.541 --> 00:11:16.700
year when they were, you know, and, and other times you,

219
00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:18.930
they did eat more plant foods. So yeah.

220
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.850
<v 2>The wise, the Wises were lots of plants, even.</v>

221
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.610
<v 1>Even the, even the Inuit, the traditional Innuit, you know,</v>

222
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.570
they had D during time, certain times of year, like the winter, when the,

223
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.330
the ground was covered with snow, they had a very low intake of plant foods,

224
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.930
but they would still trade for them. And then during the win, uh, summer, when,

225
00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:38.440
when they were able to collect berries and things like at that,

226
00:11:38.441 --> 00:11:40.040
they would definitely do that.

227
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.960
So every culture that we know of that's been studied,

228
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.360
ate some combination of animal and plant foods. You know, what ratio,

229
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.680
what amount, you know, that varies from place to place,

230
00:11:50.681 --> 00:11:54.600
depending on where they are. Um, but that's, that's what the AR uh,

231
00:11:54.601 --> 00:11:55.800
anthropological data.

232
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.600
<v 2>Show. Yeah. There's actually, you know, when you talk about this two super,</v>

233
00:11:59.601 --> 00:12:01.480
super cool piece of data, I'll go quick.

234
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:04.120
There's a professor university of Pittsburgh, Stephen okieff,

235
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:07.680
who took 20 African Americans in Pittsburgh, eating an inner city,

236
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.120
not healthy diet and 20 rural Africans in South Africa,

237
00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:13.110
eating from the Bush in the largely plants.

238
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.790
And they switched them for 20 days and they measured every single thing they can

239
00:12:16.791 --> 00:12:20.550
measure in the microbiome, in their stool, metabolites, TMAO, and all the rest.

240
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.950
Your body is so amazing that 20 days on a better diet, well,

241
00:12:24.951 --> 00:12:27.470
what I would call the rural African diet, a better diet, you know,

242
00:12:27.471 --> 00:12:31.790
there was in incredible changes towards health making buterric acid,

243
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.380
having bacterioid is in prevatella, I mean, changes and the,

244
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.740
the rural African suffered American illness in terms of what you can measure

245
00:12:39.741 --> 00:12:41.420
within two weeks. Now, there's data.

246
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.900
I just learned yesterday in Los Angeles that our microbiome changes in five

247
00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:48.180
days, you go to a low sugar, low protein plant diet.

248
00:12:48.181 --> 00:12:50.980
This is univers of Southern California. I can tell you, in five days,

249
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.850
maialapeterson's microbiome would change. Would you feel better? I don't know.

250
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.090
I'm just pointing out just the remarkable resiliency in the.
