00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. The military.</v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.910
<v 1>Um, if you really did become president, when, excuse me,</v>

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:10.230
when you do become president,

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.310
you're going to have to deal with hostile governments.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.820
You're going to have to deal with hostile militaries and, uh,

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.180
dictators, you know, people in, uh,

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.740
in other country that and other countries that don't have a value of human life

8
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.390
and throughout history,

9
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:32.160
we've had immense problems because of that, because of military conflicts,

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.440
how do you think you will approach that

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.510
mean you will be the commander in chief of the greatest army in the world has

12
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:43.560
ever known if you're in that position and we have to deal with some sort of, uh,

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.280
uh, military action with China. What if China takes over Taiwan?

14
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.410
What if they invade Taiwan?

15
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.410
What if something happens with Syria? What if something happens with Iran?

16
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.600
What if something happens with Russia and you have to make decisions

17
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.790
about military action? Have you thought about this?

18
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.623
Yes, I would.

19
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.430
<v 2>I have to say again, like COVID,</v>

20
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.430
I'm a civilian and people can have all their perspectives that they can have of

21
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:26.920
what they would do in that situation.

22
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.460
But I would have the greatest professionals on the planet,

23
00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:35.140
the most skill people that have all the experience that would

24
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:39.820
present the information and I would make the most sound rational

25
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.860
decisions. And I would

26
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.340
follow God's will in my approach,

27
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.070
two, to dealing with these other countries,

28
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.050
to dealing with these other leaders. There's, there's something about, you know,

29
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.900
our president's personality and the,

30
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:12.350
the leader of North Korea is personality where there's,

31
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.730
there's a level of common respect and,

32
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.840
and that's the reason why they were able to talk. And we, we,

33
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.990
the fear had been taken off of us,

34
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.490
like people who are, uh,

35
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.700
God-fearing self-made, uh,

36
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.590
servants of their people,

37
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.250
these, these other, you know, scary, uh, dictators,

38
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.170
they feel like they're that for their country. And if they see

39
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.790
a president that they know is just taking a check or a part of a bigger

40
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.890
conglomerate, nah, I don't want it. Like I said,

41
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:07.870
I don't want to denounce any of the, uh, uh, candidates

42
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.710
then it's,

43
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.930
it's very, it's very transactional. It's um,

44
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.573
and

45
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.940
as I said, a prayer in this situation, this isn't.

46
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.400
<v 1>You said a prayer because of what, what, what,</v>

47
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:44.800
what motivated you to say a prayer right there?

48
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.180
The seriousness, the significance of it, the subject. Yeah.

49
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.950
<v 2>Absolutely. We can't, we can't jump from jokes about this to, you know,</v>

50
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.790
joking about people's lives, right? We have to completely

51
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.000
be still in this moment,

52
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.120
allow God to guide our steps and ask the right questions

53
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.940
with the highest ranking officials possible.

54
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.410
This isn't something that you just wing,

55
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.940
but that you just come in and say, I did a bit bit of research.

56
00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:27.800
I got this like political answer is going to get a rise out of people like this

57
00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:31.640
is, this is people's lives. This is, you know,

58
00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:34.610
this is a whole different, you know,

59
00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:39.110
setting or mood than what this whole, uh, interview has,

60
00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:42.560
has been about. This is, you know,

61
00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:47.210
people are suffering and throughout all sides

62
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.090
and,

63
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.060
and in Israel and in Nigeria and Haiti where we're

64
00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:58.040
suffering the police force in, in, in, in Chicago and that the people,

65
00:04:58.041 --> 00:05:01.670
the people have been harmed by police and the police were like,

66
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.310
this all is going to take serious time.

67
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.280
Like time is love. It's going to take that love. And that time and

68
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.140
moments of listening, moments of understanding moments,

69
00:05:15.141 --> 00:05:19.940
like when my wife goes and visits people in prison and she hears their

70
00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:23.000
stories, she says, I understand,

71
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.600
I understand why you're into,

72
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.150
in why you're in that situation.

73
00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:33.590
I would have did the same thing in this situation and for us to go to foreign

74
00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:38.090
countries and really understand why that they're,

75
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.660
you know,

76
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.430
that they're in these situations or why the killing has gone for

77
00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:48.230
so long or why the hate has gone so long. The why the pain just keeps on,

78
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.270
you know, compounding and compacting. Um,

79
00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.200
there's an empathy that I just have as an artist that it doesn't

80
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:04.670
become a two plus two equals four situation.

81
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.100
My dad was actually a, uh,

82
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.170
a psychology major and a, uh, Christian, uh, therapist.

83
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.960
And this therapy, we talk about therapy period.

84
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.943
It's like,

85
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.700
we need healing internationally, not just selfishly for America.

86
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:30.110
America's number one, internationally. We need healing.

87
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.933
And

88
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.880
I would lead. I would,

89
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.070
I would lead with, with love

90
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.530
dignity, the responsibility to our country,

91
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.880
the coverage of our families, of our soldiers,

92
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.890
and in full service to God and to the American people. Uh,

93
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.780
it's the,

94
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.480
there's a mode that I would be in, in that position.

95
00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:21.190
Like when I was a producer and I was at really young man,

96
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.220
I was running around hopping on trains or,

97
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.600
you know, hopping turnstiles and stuff, and like stealing from cars. And I mean,

98
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.230
that's the only cars, but still in clothes from stores. And, um,

99
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.720
then I was selling music and,

100
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.760
uh, you know, going and buying leather jackets and stuff, then, you know,

101
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.860
dating a whole bunch of girls going on tour.

102
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.720
And then I had a family and I had to

103
00:07:55.721 --> 00:08:00.460
adjust a lot of my mentality and behavior to grow

104
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.940
and be the man that I needed to be.

105
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.230
Then God called me and I gave my life to Christ

106
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.450
and God is helping him to be the Christian that I need to be.

107
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.650
And when it's in God's will that I become the leader.

108
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:23.170
I will become the leader that I need to be. So right now, as I said,

109
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:27.940
I'm a civilian, but my heart, my mind,

110
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.870
and my spirit is in a place where I feel,

111
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.130
I know that I'm being, I'm being called to captain this ship,

112
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.720
like when Roosevelt went in, America was in shambles.

113
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.770
When I, when I say those things about those numbers, when I went to Adidas,

114
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:46.780
when I went to gap, like,

115
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.850
I'm the person that you actually call when things are

116
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:55.710
not going so well. You know, they had that, the mob movies, the guy that goes,

117
00:08:55.711 --> 00:09:00.420
cleans up everything and puts everything. I'm like the forensic,

118
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.270
where in the same way, how you saw my mind touch on 10 things at a time.

119
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.730
And then I had to say 10 sentences at a time.

120
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.680
If I could say I'm and maybe narrow them down to seven,

121
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.670
that's the way my mind takes, you know, information in and then synthesize it.

122
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.530
And it comes out as a song where it comes out as a product using that mentality

123
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.000
as a leader, fearless God-fearing,

124
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.250
we will heal. We will show the world what America

125
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.530
should be, the dream, all this.

126
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.690
<v 1>All the things that you've said in the most non-politician way I've ever heard</v>

127
00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:45.110
anybody describe these things. I know you really mean these things. This is,

128
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:47.480
this is resonating with me,

129
00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:51.770
that you're being a hundred percent honest and natural. And that's,

130
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.260
that's what we're missing.

131
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:59.330
<v 3>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

132
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.450
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

133
00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:04.880
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

134
00:10:04.881 --> 00:10:08.570
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

135
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.590
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

136
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.390
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
