00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.180
<v 1>Experience. My first computer was the, um, Sinclair ZX,</v>

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:07.740
80 Sinclair.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.370
<v 0>ZX. I've.</v>

5
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.300
<v 1>Never even heard. And I built my own modem, uh, which was,</v>

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.980
I think basically like, I dunno, five bod, I guess, um, to commute.

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.730
And it was an acoustic modem, you know, so we basically ripped open a phone,

8
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.930
put the two pieces in boxes and then put another hand site on top.

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.700
<v 0>Here. Jamie's got it. That's.</v>

10
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.560
<v 1>It, man. Sinclair ZX, 80.</v>

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.140
<v 0>Duty. You did that at five bod.</v>

12
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.200
I remember when they switched from 14 for.

13
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.020
<v 1>But this is way before that.</v>

14
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
And then my dad always had computers around the house and I was online on, uh,

15
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.790
uh, very early in. That's amazing. Look at that thing.

16
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:47.490
So I was hacking with that stuff. Wow. And then, you know,

17
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:50.580
the trash 80 T no T rest 100,

18
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:55.380
which was kind of a laptop on batteries, uh, Vic 20 Commodore 64.

19
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.820
<v 0>So when this first started happening and you started getting going unused net,</v>

20
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.070
and when you started to getting a taste of the internet,

21
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:04.340
like my experience was all I got,

22
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.030
I picked up an apple home computer from one of them office stores,

23
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.140
whatever the chain was. I don't even think they're around anymore. It was like,

24
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.520
it was actually oh, comp USA. That's what it was. That's what it was.

25
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.740
So a computer Superstore. Yeah.

26
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.430
My friend Robbie used to actually make computers or sell computers for a living.

27
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:26.250
So he was telling me what to get and I got home and I somehow,

28
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:27.690
or another connected to AOL.

29
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.430
And then I remember going to the first thing I did was go and try to find UFO

30
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:34.590
files. That's all I was trying to find, like,

31
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:37.950
what are the government's files on UFO's I want to read whatever the you can

32
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:40.380
read. I want to, you know, I want to know what they know.

33
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.720
I was downloading all this from these like crude AOL boards

34
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.590
and like these online searches, we get online search things.

35
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:52.620
He needs just Archie. Yeah. You would get all the paperwork.

36
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.580
<v 1>The search engine, Archie, Archie. And then you had Veronica,</v>

37
00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:59.430
they would search different types of servers. Remember gopher.

38
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.800
Do you ever get into gopher gopher? I don't remember either.

39
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:03.540
That was PR so check this out.

40
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.830
Jamie does Jamie's go for was basically the worldwide web only.

41
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:08.664
There was no web.

42
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.260
And so you could log on to a terminal and you could use a menu system.

43
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.730
So basically with the arrow keys,

44
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.990
but if you go to the right and you might be connecting to a different computer

45
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:23.240
at a different university, I E different server, and then you could have a, uh,

46
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.130
so it was basically all these, um,

47
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.180
information documents linking to each other. And I started one,

48
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.650
I registered mtv.com, which was, and I went to him and said, Hey,

49
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.060
I want to, uh, I'm gonna do this thing on the internet, uh,

50
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.290
where a lot of our audiences, uh, and I want to register mtv.com. Yeah,

51
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:46.080
that's cool. Don't worry about it. We have the AOL keywords.

52
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:48.270
So you go ahead and do your little unit, that thing there, son,

53
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:49.800
do whatever you want. We have the AOL.

54
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.620
<v 0>Key is literally what they said, locked up, bro. I got the internet.</v>

55
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.830
<v 1>So I had this goal and I'm promoting it on air, you know,</v>

56
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.560
go to mtv.com for my gopher server. Yeah. It wild.

57
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:03.350
You could do then at MTV. Yeah. And uh, in fact, I,

58
00:03:03.351 --> 00:03:06.850
I first I got an email from the university of Michigan or that the gophers is

59
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:11.260
that their symbol, I dunno, Michigan, Michigan, Minnesota, Minnesota. Oh my God.

60
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.340
Thank you. Um, and they said, dude,

61
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.850
you're using this commercially. You have to pay us $5,000 for a license.

62
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.930
I'm like just for the server software, which is open, you know, free. But they,

63
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.720
something in the license, I'm doing this just on my own. They don't give a.

64
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.160
I'm just doing this. I don't have $5,000. It really didn't. I don't $5,000.

65
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.290
I said, if you send me a t-shirt, I'll wear it on MTV. And I said, okay.

66
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:36.460
And I asked him, I have a document.

67
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.350
You can see that there's a video on YouTube of me with a gopher t-shirt on MTV

68
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:44.230
and then went like, oh man. Cause it's cool. Anyway,

69
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.550
then that's cool on them too.

70
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.080
So I got this set up and then I got an email from this guy in sham, uh,

71
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.710
champagne, Urbana, Illinois. And he's like, Hey Adam,

72
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.660
see what you're doing with mtv.com. Look,

73
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.420
I got this thing that I've created this mosaic browser.

74
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.310
And can you install the server HTTP D one dot four or whatever.

75
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.440
And that was Marc Andreessen, the guy who went on to create a Netscape. Wow.

76
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.850
And you know, it was now one of the biggest, uh, VC in, uh, in Silicon valley.

77
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.050
And when I saw that, oh,

78
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.020
this is like graphic, like a webpage.

79
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.890
Remember we used to images would take a long time to load first would be black

80
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:27.280
and white progressively loading and become color like, oh,

81
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.820
like a porn picture took an hour to download just poop. Poop.

82
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.860
<v 0>Yeah. I remember the first time a friend sent me a porn video. He's like,</v>

83
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.510
look at this. I was like, what? They can send a.

84
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.550
<v 1>Video and it wasn't. Do you remember what it was? The girl giving.</v>

85
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.370
<v 0>The guy a blow job. And it only lasted like 15 of course.</v>

86
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.233
<v 1>And that was, you know,</v>

87
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.140
and it took you two hours to download forever to download you.

88
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:47.980
Remember I using it,

89
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.340
you would download from 15 different things and you'd get like all these

90
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:54.010
different files. And you had a program that put it back together.

91
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.230
<v 0>Yeah. When you remember the birth of the internet,</v>

92
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.040
when you remember first getting on it and seeing the expansion,

93
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.910
was there ever a moment? When was the moment I should say, well, obviously now,

94
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:10.060
today we all realize it's how to out of control and it's just wild.

95
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.390
So it's a very strange thing that's taking over our lives.

96
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.390
And then w w I want to talk about neural link to woods.

97
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.920
I'm sure you know something about that. About Elon Musk's invention link.

98
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.330
<v 1>I know a little bit about it.</v>

99
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.440
<v 0>But when you, when you saw it kind of getting away,</v>

100
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:29.710
like when was the moment or w where you were like,

101
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.850
this is a very strange thing. That's never happened to people before?

102
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.060
<v 1>Well, I knew I had the online part figured out because I ran a bulletin board.</v>

103
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.990
You might remember though,

104
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.860
as you could call in only be like five lines and you go in and do your business

105
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:49.090
and then get out. And, oh, this has gotta be,

106
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.010
uh, early eighties, maybe even late seventies.

107
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.610
<v 0>Time for innovation there, right? This big, long stretches where.</v>

108
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.150
<v 1>Things don't get any better. Well, the speeds got marginally better.</v>

109
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:06.080
People got more phone lines that the computers were able to do more.

110
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.580
Then there are also some other things happening. We had, um, windows, windows,

111
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:13.640
95 came into play. So now people were, you know,

112
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.990
were in a different world of computing. It used to be dos, uh, and people have,

113
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.950
you know, WordPerfect, and then all of a sudden, you know,

114
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.150
we have a, an interface on top of it. You know, we didn't have that.

115
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.430
So that starts to teach people how to deal with the environment. Um,

116
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:35.000
so that was all there, but the internet itself would be

117
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.040
1987. And I logged in to get on the internet.

118
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:43.370
You had to log into a dial-up account, launch,

119
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:45.620
a PPP session or slip,

120
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.560
and then you had to launch the software on your computer,

121
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.670
and then you could open a terminal and you could type things like Telnet,

122
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.540
and then, uh, a domain name or even an IP address.

123
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.030
It could connect to someone else's thing and kind of look around.

124
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:02.660
It was just all text-based. But that for me was like, holy,

125
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.230
you can connect from one to the next. I understood the hyperlinking.

126
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.150
I understood how powerful that would be.

127
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.600
And if I just had a little computer today on my desk,

128
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:16.040
I had a Mac plus with a gigantic external 20

129
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.140
megabytes, scuzzy hard drive, 20 megabytes. I mean, that's an empty word doc,

130
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.820
you know? So that big thing like that, um, I just knew it was like, oh my God,

131
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.890
this is, this is, this is going to be it. So the second moment, um,

132
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.750
was the Andreessen with is httpd mosaic browser, browser, the web.

133
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.570
And then the third moment was Karl Jacob. Um, I think he's an investor,

134
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:43.370
maybe even on the board at Facebook,

135
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.870
but he worked at sun Microsystems at the time. And, uh,

136
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.630
he contacted me, so, okay. May I see what you're doing?

137
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:54.230
I'm gonna send you a computer. And he sent me a son Voyager,

138
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.120
which is like a portable a luggable with a LCD color screen.

139
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.770
This is now 86, 88, something like that. Um, it was Unix,

140
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.220
which was even crazier. And, uh,

141
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.660
so he started to show me stuff and he actually streamed a song

142
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.850
from his workstation in San Francisco to my computer in, uh,

143
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.470
Montclair, New Jersey. And it played, I had him on the phone here.

144
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:25.280
I heard him start it. And then it came through and it played on my,

145
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.870
on my computer that I'd never seen this before or heard it. I was like, oh,

146
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.100
broadcast. We can use this to broadcast. And since that moment,

147
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.460
I think that's the mission I've been on. And look at mama,

148
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.950
I have a ride here we are.

149
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.400
<v 0>That's an amazing story, man. That's cool as.</v>

150
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.480
I love hearing it from someone who was there from the various first steps.

151
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.260
<v 1>And you're we used to have the yellow pages, the internet yellow pages,</v>

152
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:55.710
which was a book. I still have it, it was published. It was published.

153
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.330
You can look up everything in the yellow pages. That was the business areas.

154
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.370
That was a business. The yellow pages got. Right? Of course that fell apart.

155
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.410
Here's what happened with newspapers.

156
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.480
Here's where the newspapers up with the news.

157
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:14.040
When the internet came around and there were, I saw it. Other people saw it,

158
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.530
Craig Newmark saw it. Uh,

159
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.000
and it's classified because they were all holding toity about their advertising

160
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:23.820
model. But people, they were really making the money off the classified ads.

161
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:28.140
Everybody knows it. Everybody knew it. And that's what Craigslist, who,

162
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.590
who tried to sell it to Tribune, Tribune or Hearst.

163
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.600
Maybe it was Hearst for just a couple million bucks. And it's like, no,

164
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:39.120
we're not interested. We don't need it. Not invented here, whatever.

165
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.700
And so he ate up their, their,

166
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:45.840
their classified business overnight and they were left holding the bag saying,

167
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.870
well, we have cool news to advertise on. Well known. And I'm,

168
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:51.300
we'll put some in there, but not always about the classifies.

169
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.920
That's where the money came from. Wow. Devorah can tell the story of I'll ask.

170
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.150
I'll ask them to do it on the show.

171
00:09:57.151 --> 00:09:59.940
You can tell the story about Craig Newmark and how they passed on it.

172
00:09:59.941 --> 00:10:03.420
And he's he, he does that very well. The classified ads,

173
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.710
do they even have them? No. Newspapers are gone. Obits.

174
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.990
Dead people is still a good business. Yeah, of course they have some, but no,

175
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.920
not really. How often do you hold a physical newspaper in your hand and read it?

176
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.310
Whenever I, whenever I'm at the airport, I always buy the newspapers. Yeah.

177
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.620
Cause I don't want to be on my phone. Right, right.

178
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.210
And we just read the newspaper.
