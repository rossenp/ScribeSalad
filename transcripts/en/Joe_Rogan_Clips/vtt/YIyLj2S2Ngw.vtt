00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.010
<v 1>But this is a good time for people to recognize the importance of community.</v>

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.930
It's a terrible time for humanity.

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.870
It's a terrible time for us and terrible time for the people that are sick.

5
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:16.470
But it's a really good time for us to understand why community is important.

6
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:18.810
We live in this illusionary world.

7
00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:21.390
That's provided to us by the culture that we've created,

8
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:23.430
where you can just buy things. Anytime you want.

9
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:25.920
You don't need people to come home. You watch Netflix,

10
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.900
you don't engage with anyone you get in your car.

11
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.320
You barely say hi to anybody at work. We're detached from each other.

12
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:34.140
And this is the only time ever in life.

13
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.050
We've been detached from each other and were being detached by these

14
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.180
electronics. They're sneaking up on us electronics and cars,

15
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:46.050
which has also, you know, it's, uh, it's also a creation, a mechanical creation,

16
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:48.720
and now more than ever they're driving computers.

17
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.880
<v 2>Yeah, man. It's true. What I'm.</v>

18
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.410
<v 1>Trying to say is Ted Kaczynski was right.</v>

19
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.770
<v 2>Oh my God. We all know that. Did you ever read his manifesto? No, I'm scared.</v>

20
00:00:57.771 --> 00:00:58.604
It's catchy.

21
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.250
That's I went through a period of like doing ketamine and like trying to watch

22
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.900
the worst thing I like at Charles Manson, uh, Kozinski.

23
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.940
And, uh, yeah, it is, you know,

24
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.860
it is a little bit like kind of interestingly, not that off,

25
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:19.850
but then the tone is so Imperial or something. When you're reading it,

26
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:22.520
there's like this it's a manifested. That's how you have to write up, you know?

27
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.430
But the one thing, uh,

28
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.390
my wife is part of like some, like it's called a mommy group.

29
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.010
So it's like a connection of online of all these mommies and on like all over

30
00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:38.210
LA. And what they do is they post people will post. They need.

31
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.650
So like one of the moms just had a kid, they don't have any wet wipes.

32
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.370
And so then all the other moms will be like, oh, we've got wet wipes.

33
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.920
And then right now they're just leaving them on the door.

34
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.960
So people come and get them. So it's like,

35
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.380
I think the community thing is exactly right.

36
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.390
But also people have to maybe transcend money for a second and figure out ways

37
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:03.470
to set up in their community. Like, what do you need?

38
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.480
What do I have? And then start some form of like trade or just giving people,

39
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.770
you know, there was someone who set up a toilet paper exchange in LA,

40
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.010
where he was just like, if you have extra toilet paper, bring it.

41
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.130
And then he had toilet paper and you're just giving it out to people who are,

42
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.323
you know, that's,

43
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.470
I think that's the sort of thing we're going to have to start doing if we can,

44
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.790
you know, it's like right now there's old people who they they're,

45
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.960
they can't do, man. They're terrified. They can't even get up. If you know.

46
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.930
<v 1>Them, you got to help them. And this is, uh, you know,</v>

47
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:40.070
this is a weird time for us, but it's a time for us to reset. You know,

48
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:42.860
it's not, it's not good. I'm not saying it's good, but I'm saying there's a,

49
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.870
we can get a positive out of this.

50
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.630
The people that make through the people that make it through,

51
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:51.680
we can get a positive out of this. And the positive is community is important.

52
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.210
It's really important. And it,

53
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.900
it seemed like it wasn't important cause it seemed like we had everything set

54
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.070
up. So he didn't have to engage with people. It's not right way to do it.

55
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.480
It's not good for anybody now that that kind of life is not good.

56
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.490
And the detachment that we have, I mean, that's why,

57
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.950
why do you think people have road rage on the highway? You know, when they're,

58
00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:14.110
they're locked in their little box, separated from people in a way that they,

59
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.650
they wouldn't have it in person. It was just, I mean,

60
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:21.700
it's only a thin piece of metal and glass separating you from these people with

61
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:21.941
that.

62
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:25.330
There's the other added factor of the heightened senses because you're driving

63
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:27.370
fast and you realize you might have to make quick movements.

64
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.300
So dumb things people do are elevated. They're even no more dumb. Yeah.

65
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.020
But it's also that you're detached. You're you're in these boxes, right?

66
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.510
It's like a weird dream. We've done weird to each other. Yeah. Because of that,

67
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.720
we're.

68
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.320
<v 2>All gummed up in that way. It's like something it's like,</v>

69
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.340
it's like a fungus that grew on the circuitry of society and started,

70
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.790
or it's like, we know when they talk about the, uh,

71
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.470
dolphins and the whales being up by the high-tech sonar they're using and

72
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:59.640
washing up on the beach because the sonar is messing up their ability to

73
00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:01.110
communicate with each other. It's like,

74
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.330
there's this kind of technological sonar that is completely made

75
00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:08.940
us disconnected from the earth.

76
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.320
Essentially like our earth connection has been replaced by a

77
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.440
technological connection. Now technology comes from the earth,

78
00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:21.060
but we're talking about a secondary thing. Can compare it to,

79
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.100
you know, your feet touching the ground,

80
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.380
being around another human and like recognizing them as having exactly the same

81
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.530
thing you have, which is they want to be happy. You know,

82
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.860
feeling the connection between people when you're with someone. I mean,

83
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.180
I don't know if you've ever done that,

84
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:40.530
but just like the next time you're around anybody that you're like buying from

85
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:44.310
or that you don't normally just kind of go by feel that, that connect,

86
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:48.240
you could feel it there's an energetic connection that you can feel there.

87
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:49.410
That's easy to overlook.

88
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.000
<v 1>Yeah. We we've lost the biggest one, which is through light pollution.</v>

89
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.460
I think every night people are humbled and re reminded of the

90
00:04:59.461 --> 00:05:03.030
majesty of the universe when they looked up and saw the infinite skies on a

91
00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:06.510
clear night. Yeah. The infinite stars, just the, the whole Milky way.

92
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:08.340
You could see the whole thing, you know,

93
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:12.960
and there's parts of the country where there's plenty of darkness and you could

94
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:16.830
literally see the whole Milky way. And it makes you think like, oh,

95
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:20.010
our ancestors saw this freaky all the time.

96
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.990
We decided to shut off the greatest art the world has ever known because we want

97
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:28.370
to be able to see better at night, the greatest art, uh,

98
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.180
an art that literally not,

99
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.770
not just as inspired science and wonder too and fueled it.

100
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.390
Right. But also as, as kind of always put people in place,

101
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.160
always just, just understand, this is not a backdrop. It's not a tapestry.

102
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.810
The up there is madness. It's forever and you're not protected.

103
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.100
There's just a thin layer,

104
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.930
fear of gas between you and the universe,

105
00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:56.070
which is infinite.

106
00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.320
You're this tiny speck of nothingness in this

107
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.910
impossible to understand spans of

108
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.990
planets and stars. It just goes on forever, literally forever.

109
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.820
And we're one little tiny piece of it.

110
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.420
And we're being held here with a spin and some air.

111
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.060
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

112
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.320
<v 1>And there's a giant fireball in the sky that keeps us alive.</v>

113
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.810
And it's a million times bigger than the.

114
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.970
<v 3>Earth. Yeah. And it's right there.</v>

115
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.430
<v 1>And this is, this is the reality that we live in.</v>

116
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.470
It is almost too crazy to put in your consciousness on a

117
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:36.110
daily basis. So we forget about it all the time. It's the,

118
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:40.040
one of the most important things about our existence here as it were of part of

119
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:43.970
the universe. It's not just that we're in, you know,

120
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.450
Sherman Oaks or we're hanging out in Montana. No,

121
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:52.250
we're right there connected in the universe and it

122
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:54.530
doesn't get brought up. And one of the reasons, cause we don't see it.

123
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.540
We don't freak out. W if you go to the country and camping, you freak out.

124
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:03.680
You're like, wow, you see the stars. You're like, this is nuts, man.

125
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.830
You can see them all. It's, it's a reset button.

126
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.080
It changes how you feel about life.

127
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.420
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

128
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.220
Well also it seems like a lot of us have forgotten that we're going to die on

129
00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:16.300
top of all that. I mean,

130
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.650
not only are you like looking up at this void filled with stars,

131
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.840
but the thing you are is a temporary. And that to me is,

132
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.250
you know, the other day, I'm like just washing dishes during this pandemic.

133
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.010
And I'm thinking to myself, man,

134
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:37.960
I feel so lucky to be washing dishes right now. I'm alive.

135
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.300
I'm healthy. This is,

136
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.430
it was a different kind of washing dishes than a week ago when I was able to,

137
00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:47.530
or two weeks before this started.

138
00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:51.490
When I get ordered anything I wanted off the internet. It,

139
00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:54.870
it suddenly I'm in a different world. Like this is a world where, well,

140
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.290
we got to wash these dishes because man, if I get like, if thugs come,

141
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.660
I don't know if I want to call an exterminator right now.

142
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.090
I don't know how many people I want in my house right now.

143
00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:06.040
I don't know what this is. So it's like,

144
00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:09.940
suddenly these are what you're experiencing. Is this kind of like, um,

145
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.420
well what does it say in the Bible that we both love so much,

146
00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:17.110
a fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

147
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.790
And I think you could easily translate that to understanding

148
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:27.070
your place in the universe should produce a kind of positive

149
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:30.520
fear and trembling, not like you're, you're anxious or terrified,

150
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.780
but just to kind of like, whoa, this doesn't last,

151
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.060
nothing about this last.

152
00:08:37.061 --> 00:08:41.950
And right now everyone around the planet is getting a firsthand

153
00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:46.060
glimpse of that very truth, right? Yeah. All at once. One big dose,

154
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.550
one big dose of it all at once. One.

155
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.030
<v 1>Big dose for people to recognize how much of what they concentrate on a daily</v>

156
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:55.140
basis. How much of what fills their consciousness is.

157
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.540
It's utter nonsense. And we got tricked. We got tricked into thinking.

158
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:04.740
It would go on forever. And now we know it's not going to. And now we know, Hey,

159
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.680
look, this is a, this is a terrible thing.

160
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.990
But relatively speaking,

161
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.700
compared to super volcano, asteroid impact,

162
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.550
it's compared to something solar flare,

163
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.880
something really crazy that can happen and blow out all the power,

164
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.250
which is a hundred percent of possibility.

165
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.970
Solar flares are 100% a possibility.

166
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.290
And for people to not recognize that and just go through the life.

167
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.880
It's just because we, we,

168
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.830
we look at life as if what we've experienced while

169
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:41.310
we're alive is the norm, but it's not, it's not the norm.

170
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.000
It's just hard for you to recognize that your life is so short.

171
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.680
Your life is so short that when they're measuring all the different catastrophes

172
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:51.240
that have happened over the earth,

173
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:55.650
whether it's proven sites of asteroid impacts are proven sites of

174
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:59.760
volcano eruptions or all these different things that have happened for sure and

175
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:04.440
wiped out millions of people all over the world, they happen over a time span.

176
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:07.560
That's too big. Our head doesn't get in their head.

177
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:08.730
Doesn't go with what is third,

178
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.800
13,000 years is just some scratches on some paper in my head,

179
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:17.040
my stupid head. I don't know what 13,000 years means. I can't,

180
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.560
I can't do it but 13,000 years ago, they think,

181
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.920
and there's more and more evidence every day that there was some big impact on

182
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:27.570
earth. Yeah. And who, who knows how many of those humans have gone through?

183
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.920
Who knows for the, the, whatever. I think scientists believe what, what is it?

184
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.720
It's like 300,000 plus years. We've been this right?

185
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.800
Is that the idea? Homosapien, something like that. Yeah. Something like that.

186
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:45.300
Right, bro. That ain't. Right? That's so short. That's so short.

187
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.960
Just in the time that the earth has been here in the four point,

188
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:51.330
whatever billion years the earth has been here.

189
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:55.860
And that's so short in terms of the almost 14 billion years,

190
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:59.790
the known universe has been here. All of its madness,

191
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.060
every single step along the way is madness.

192
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:07.260
But we get stuck in these little time periods where nothing changes.

193
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.150
And so we think that this is life.

194
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.870
So we've built all these houses that only can work on electricity.

195
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:17.040
How many people have a real fireplace in their house? They live in cold places.

196
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.360
They're banning those.

197
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:21.720
Now they're banning fireplaces because they don't want to start fires.

198
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.561
That's great.

199
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:25.200
As long as you can ensure the gas and the power is going to stay on.

200
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.990
And I don't think you could do that. Yeah. I just think you can,

201
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:30.410
because you've done it for a hundred years, right?

202
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.100
That's the thing a hundred years is this a hundred years,

203
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.820
the industrial revolution, the roaring twenties from, from then to today,

204
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.760
let's go 150. Let's get crazy. That ain't.

205
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.050
That ain't to say. This is how things are.

206
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:49.700
Every day is so dumb. It's especially to say with, in terms of the earth,

207
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.520
natural disasters, space, anomalies, like not even anomalies,

208
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.080
but things that happen like solar flares, they happen all the time, man. Yeah.

209
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.490
<v 2>Man. Well, I mean, and, we don't even know. That's the only thing we don't know.</v>

210
00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:04.260
All the sudden, all the data in the universe,

211
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.010
we don't know that there isn't something called like a quad Trizzy and ripple

212
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.850
that happens every, you know, 16, million years that.

213
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.320
<v 1>Just Sean Carroll right now, uh, need information, you.</v>

214
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.720
<v 2>Know, do you know that poem Ozymandias.</v>

215
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.820
<v 1>Ozymandias by.</v>

216
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.420
<v 2>Shelley? I think it's like, I don't have it memorized,</v>

217
00:12:23.421 --> 00:12:27.750
but the basically it's like diplomas about someone who sees the broken

218
00:12:27.751 --> 00:12:32.640
legs of a statue in the desert and written on a plaque

219
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.050
is my name is Ozymandias. Ruler of rulers,

220
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:41.580
king of Kings, behold, my works. He mighty and despair.

221
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.090
<v 3>All or I guess he just the broken legs.</v>

222
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.030
<v 2>You think you have power. We think you have all this control. It's like,</v>

223
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.110
we don't like, I guarantee you. Of course, like in ancient Egypt,

224
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.270
there was probably, I'm not talking about the Pharaoh,

225
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.850
but there's at least like a thousand dudes who are like,

226
00:12:59.851 --> 00:13:04.830
I'm like the hot in Egypt. And they're going to remember me for a long time.

227
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.690
It's like, we don't know who you are. It's all gone. Orotic gated, wiped out.

228
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.980
And this to me is like one of the really side effects of this thing.

229
00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:17.880
This technology thing is we've all become completely self obsessed.

230
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.610
Self-absorbed putting our images out there,

231
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.210
making sure that our profiles are updated making, you know what I mean?

232
00:13:24.211 --> 00:13:27.720
Like we have this insane idea of like,

233
00:13:27.721 --> 00:13:32.400
we're so deeply rooted in our identity instead of in the connections between our

234
00:13:32.401 --> 00:13:33.234
identities.

235
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.410
That we're all the only way that we can finally see how connected we are is some

236
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.030
eats a bat.

237
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.243
<v 3>You know what I mean?</v>

238
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.570
[inaudible] weird, dude. It's really crazy. Man. Think.

239
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:51.980
<v 1>Of this.</v>

240
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.850
If technology really did have an effect on the

241
00:13:56.851 --> 00:14:00.810
programming of human beings and human beings, interacting with technology,

242
00:14:00.811 --> 00:14:05.070
think we're internet innocently, interacting with a nonsense, giant thing,

243
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.970
but all the while this technology and you could call T we,

244
00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:10.771
we get confused.

245
00:14:10.771 --> 00:14:15.600
We think the technology is like a digital clock or a television or a

246
00:14:15.601 --> 00:14:19.650
computer. It is, but it's also like a fish hook, right? Like,

247
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.360
so there's so many it's innovation.

248
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.280
So someone had to figure that out and imagine creating an ape

249
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.580
that is aware of its environment.

250
00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:33.210
Like this is like really the perfect storm aware of its environment,

251
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.770
but obsessed with itself knows in the back of its head

252
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:42.870
that it's it's temporary, but it's, uh, it's, it's got a finite lifespan,

253
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.160
but lives like it's going to live forever and lives in the moment,

254
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:52.130
lives in the moment and wants to things.

255
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.260
Are you seen as the number one goal for the, you know,

256
00:14:56.261 --> 00:15:00.670
the Uber wealthy or the Uber successful with Jeff Bezos types characters, right?

257
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.570
Or at the top of the food chain financially acquire things. Yeah.

258
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.980
They're always acquiring things,

259
00:15:05.981 --> 00:15:09.320
which means people have to make things which means that like, they're,

260
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.770
they're a big consumer as well as, as,

261
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:16.150
as someone who's is making a ton of money. Right?

262
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.470
And this also fuels innovation. Cause you gotta keep up with these people.

263
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.030
Can I keep giving them bigger and better things every year? So it all this,

264
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.840
all these resources go into innovation of technology.

265
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.210
It's the thing that progress is quicker than anything. Right?

266
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.010
Look at cell phones every year I need 150 megapixel camera or you're a loser.

267
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.990
You're a loser, you know,

268
00:15:37.991 --> 00:15:40.750
these Samsung phones that have like seven inch screens.

269
00:15:40.751 --> 00:15:44.200
Now everyone's going crazy. Right. But what is the goal though?

270
00:15:44.201 --> 00:15:48.970
The goal is to make better. And the goal along the way let's go is, um,

271
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.260
it's working, but you know,

272
00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:53.470
it'd be even better if we made it so they don't touch each other anymore. If we,

273
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.290
maybe if we could come up with a disease where they can't shake hands,

274
00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:01.360
they don't, they don't come close and yeah, just keep them a little further.

275
00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:04.480
Apart from each other, it'll make them more interested in the things,

276
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.970
more interested in the technology, more,

277
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.750
more separate from each other and encourage technology that connects them with

278
00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:13.690
each other. So through technology, they'll,

279
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.430
they'll find this human longing for contact that they were missing in their

280
00:16:18.431 --> 00:16:21.040
life. They're going to get an emulated version of it,

281
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.220
but that emulated version of it just going to keep getting better and it's going

282
00:16:24.221 --> 00:16:25.330
to keep getting better.

283
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.460
And it's going to get to a point where it's better than real life,

284
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.670
way better than real life, because you're like Jumanji, you get to be the rock.

285
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.260
You know, you, you get to be like a superhero like in, you could,

286
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:39.720
you could live a magical life with no boundaries of physics and that they're

287
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.920
going to do that. People are going to do that. They're going to give in.

288
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:47.440
If I was a little form that was trying to haunt another life form and trick

289
00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:51.100
it into giving birth to me, that's I would create a person. I'd create people.

290
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.560
We, but like some aunt, we're like some aunt manufacturing,

291
00:16:56.561 --> 00:16:59.810
our successors, that's what we are. And we don't even know what we're doing.

292
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.830
Just showing up everyday, watch it. And I got all his diamond chain, chain,

293
00:17:02.831 --> 00:17:06.220
chain blank, but just my house is bigger than the rocks.

294
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.120
The rocks off was just big. My hustle, like that's,

295
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.990
that's what people are doing. That's what we're doing. We're just buying more.

296
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:19.150
And one good thing of something like this.

297
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.960
Anytime a tragedy happens, people bond together afterwards.

298
00:17:22.961 --> 00:17:25.150
It's a terrible thing that it happened,

299
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.530
but for the victims and the family members of the victims, we all know this,

300
00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.270
but it can be a good reset for us. Economically.

301
00:17:34.271 --> 00:17:35.260
People are going to have to get through it.

302
00:17:35.261 --> 00:17:37.780
That's going to be the most difficult part. But I think there's,

303
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.700
there's going to be an opportunity for us to just assume a

304
00:17:42.701 --> 00:17:46.540
nicer stance towards our neighbors and towards our friends and towards our

305
00:17:46.541 --> 00:17:50.700
community. And instead of embracing this idea, like you better get guns.

306
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.730
Cause they're coming. Maybe we can all come together. I think people.

307
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.760
<v 2>Need to find if that's going to happen,</v>

308
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:04.610
then we've got to find a better metric for whether things

309
00:18:04.611 --> 00:18:07.310
are right wrong. Yeah. And the news, yes.

310
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.770
Something to retune ourselves like we're right now we're tuning the

311
00:18:12.771 --> 00:18:17.030
guitar of our identities to these, to like the most terrifying,

312
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.980
which is the news or like what people are saying. And so if that's, if,

313
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:27.110
and I think many people have become so accustomed to getting their idea of

314
00:18:27.111 --> 00:18:29.180
what's happening in reality from the TV,

315
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.200
instead of from like how they feel inside what's going on with their friends and

316
00:18:33.201 --> 00:18:37.580
their family that puts people at incredible

317
00:18:37.581 --> 00:18:41.990
disadvantage because they're timed as being rippled by.

318
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.660
You know, I was thinking it's like, I'm one of those little, not Prairie dogs.

319
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.530
Those they stand and look around at the Hawks. You know what I'm talking about?

320
00:18:51.531 --> 00:18:52.430
What are those things called?

321
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.510
They're like are social little marmots or something like that. You know,

322
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.520
there was a show like lemur, palace.

323
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.640
I don't remember what they're called something, but they're like, they're like,

324
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.120
they're.

325
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.090
<v 1>Really cute. A seam of the zoo, adorable. The most,</v>

326
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.580
one of the most durable animals ever. They stand.

327
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.030
<v 2>In line.</v>

328
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.270
Somehow they ignore all the humans around them and just look in the sky for a

329
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.150
hook. It's kind of sad, but that's their life though.

330
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:19.160
But imagine if that one looking for the Huck had like the internet and

331
00:19:19.161 --> 00:19:21.890
could see Hawks, thousands of miles away,

332
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.340
how anxious all of them would be. Cause he would always be like,

333
00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:29.180
get underground, get underground, get underground. So, you know, I think this,

334
00:19:29.181 --> 00:19:33.290
this is what has happened is that we're all constantly being told. I mean,

335
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.300
I remember when I was growing up in the old days,

336
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.330
when the news had an alert that was serious,

337
00:19:38.331 --> 00:19:43.100
some serious went down would be what the? Fox news or any of the news stations.

338
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.170
They have an alert like every four minutes.

339
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.970
<v 4>Now, alert.</v>

340
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.890
<v 2>I'm alert. And it's all telling us just what you're saying. Get underground,</v>

341
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.450
go inside, go inside danger out here, danger out here. And so we're all like,

342
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.910
even before this, we were huddled up a little bit.

343
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.200
Now we can rationalize the huddling, you know, and that's what we're doing.

344
00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:05.000
We're just huddling inside right now.

345
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.510
That's an incredibly vulnerable place to be. I mean,

346
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.780
I'm not going to get conspiratorial here.
