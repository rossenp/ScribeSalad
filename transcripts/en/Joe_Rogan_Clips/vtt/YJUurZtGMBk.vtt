WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>Yeah, it was, um, the last fight out there is, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.320
I was sitting in that hot tub and then cuz I didn't have the sauna, uh,

3
00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.120
hooked up. I just wanted to go on the hot tub and,

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.960
and then I laid on like the partition and I had like one leg dangling and the

5
00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:17.600
cold pool and one leg dangling and then the water was really good looking I'm

6
00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:21.110
sure &lt;laugh&gt; but when you're starving and dying and giving a anymore,

7
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.870
it was just like I'm laying there.

8
00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:26.310
Like that Mackenzie D was laying over there looking a little worse than me,

9
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:27.144
but it was like.

10
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.030
<v 1>I guess, I don't know. What did you think?</v>

11
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:32.390
Would she miss weight by seven pounds? That kind of crazy. Isn't it?

12
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.470
<v 0>It's crazy because she, like,</v>

13
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.910
I was literally sitting in the locker room with her.

14
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.500
Like we are giggling at UFC, uh, two 20 you like,

15
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.380
because we're both like curvy, right.

16
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.180
And we're sitting in the locker room laughing about how much that weighs,

17
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.940
you know? And it's like, what can you do about that? And even if you could,

18
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.300
you really wanna like, right. I mean, I don't hate it, you know,

19
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.460
but sitting in there and um, like laughing about it and,

20
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:00.340
and that was what,

21
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.570
what was the data of that March 3rd and then mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to come

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.810
that much over, like she got her fight right away, announced right away.

23
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.210
You know that she was fighting may what was it? 19th or something. Yeah.

24
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.930
And it's just like that, like when you have that data in mind, I mean,

25
00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:21.050
and granted it's, it's not me. It's her it's I don't have her body.

26
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:24.080
I don't have her problems. I don't have her life. I don't it's you know, not my,

27
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.160
not doesn't mean anything to me,

28
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.440
but to know you have a fight and it's signed up and it's ready.

29
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.920
Like at that point it's maintenance. Yeah. You know, it's maintenance like that.

30
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.960
That's not even doing anything different. It's just maintenance.

31
00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:42.360
But like these weight cuts are harder and harder on us. As we get older.

32
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.350
I don't know what her body's doing. I don't know. Yeah. She's I think she's 25.

33
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.390
Yeah. She's young. And I don't, I don't know.

34
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.790
I don't know what that to make 115 pounds asks of her. And,

35
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.550
and I don't know if she's on her period or not.

36
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.830
I don't know if that makes a difference to her with me. I always,

37
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.070
I always get mine the day of weigh-ins. Oh, I have other,

38
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.470
I have like three other girls.

39
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.940
Four are girls that I know that it's the exact same thing.

40
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:09.100
Like the morning of made weight, about to go downstairs.

41
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:13.460
And there's that looking at you right there. &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; she's like there's,

42
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:15.220
there's why I couldn't lose the last two pounds.

43
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.700
<v 1>Sweet. I would like to talk to John crouch about what happened cuz uh,</v>

44
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.340
he asked her to leave the lab.

45
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.340
<v 0>Oh, that was where she was at when they asked her to leave. Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.890
Did she ever say.

47
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.330
<v 1>Why? She didn't say why? He didn't say why either. Huh?</v>

48
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.370
They're both playing it professional. Huh? I dunno what.

49
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.770
<v 0>Happened. But she was there a long time too though. Wasn't she?</v>

50
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:38.090
Well like cuz when I went to go train down there, she, she was already,

51
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.210
she was there one of the days. Yeah. I don't know.

52
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.210
<v 1>I'm not sure. I'm not sure,</v>

53
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.280
but I know her dad he's doesn't he teach in Arizona megaton.

54
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.640
I think so. Yeah. Um, her jujitsu is nasty though. Isn't it?

55
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.700
So gnarly.

56
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.360
<v 0>Woo. Yeah. She's good. We competed against each other. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.960
I was beating her were yeah. Well it is rough.

58
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.880
It is rough because I, I, it was worlds. We were both purple belts.

59
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.600
I think it was the open division. So I was like,

60
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.880
I was heavier than her by the next weight class. And um, I,

61
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.880
I went to take her down a double egg Dal big and then like where we landed.

62
00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:20.950
So if this is like the square we landed like right here mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and

63
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:25.070
so they called it out and so they reset us in the middle. So no points. Oh,

64
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.550
so we get in the middle with you because she's Mackenzie D because I'm not

65
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.390
resilient enough, right? Maybe. Yeah. Let's so I, they start us again.

66
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.950
I'm like, okay, noted. I can't don't go near that line. Right.

67
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.900
So I go and I shoot another double, pick her up, go take her down again.

68
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.420
Same thing. But like, I it's out of bounds again,

69
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.700
cuz it's too close because my double is like a tackle, you know? Right.

70
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.793
And then, um,

71
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.180
so we go back in the middle and we shake hands and we go,

72
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.740
so this time I go, shoot, I pick her up and I look at the ref like, like here,

73
00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:00.290
good. Is this good? Put her down here. Yeah. So put her down,

74
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.090
go to pass her guard. And I passed. And then, um,

75
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.050
I think she had, I, I sat back for a straight ankle lock and they're like,

76
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.410
and they disqualified me. What? And they're like, can't have an ankle lock.

77
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:16.690
They're like, you can't do that. I was like, can't do what? And they're like,

78
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:18.970
you can't do that. And it's in the rule books. I'm like, okay,

79
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:22.520
if I'm gonna look in the real of books, what am I looking up? What can't I do?

80
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.920
Like you can't, you can't do that. You need to go you're disqualified. I'm like,

81
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.640
tell me what I did. And they said that I reaped the knee, but I like,

82
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.760
I didn't like, I don't, I really don't think I did. You.

83
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.480
<v 1>Know? So you think they were just ju in the system to try to get her to win cuz</v>

84
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.723
she's Brazil.

85
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.670
<v 0>I don't know. I don't know. It happens. It does, does happen some tournaments.</v>

86
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.310
Yeah. And I mean, they, they, they, and the thing is, is like,

87
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.550
I love I BJ JF tournaments and I wanna compete in them for the rest of my life.

88
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.710
Like I, you know, so, but, but yeah, there is,

89
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.710
there is some themes that go on there.

90
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.780
Like there's definitely birthrights that get you places that like birthrights

91
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.460
that I would really like to have, but at the same time, but not really. No, no,

92
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:07.820
I don't wanna have been born into, I,

93
00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:10.540
I want to make the statement of like happier birthright. Like I got this,

94
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.020
you know, I made it to some pretty badass tournaments and, and you know,

95
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.460
just like fighting the way I fight and try not to give a about all of that.

96
00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:23.650
And like, I continue to do that. I want to do the same, you know? Um,

97
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.250
but you know, that, that was, that was a rough one for me.

98
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.770
Like I was excited about that tournament.

99
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.210
I trained hard for that tournament and I think we were each other's like,

100
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.850
I don't remember what match into the tournament. It was, but to be disqualified.

101
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.090
And it was like, but I still like, what.

102
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.010
<v 1>Do they call specifically? Reaping the need. Don't you have to go again.</v>

103
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.933
End the joint.

104
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.360
<v 0>I don't know. I don't know.</v>

105
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:48.920
Like I wish I could draw you a picture or show you a finger bent.

106
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.600
You think they were.

107
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.640
<v 1>Just trying to like come up with an excuse?</v>

108
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.120
<v 0>Well, be, I mean the first two takedowns like we weren't okay.</v>

109
00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:59.320
Maybe first one about maybe the first one we were on the line. I fine.

110
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.080
The second one, like we hit the ground and then we skided a little so,

111
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.040
but we were in, you know, and then the third one, I'm being a Dick, you know?

112
00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:10.960
And I'm just like, yeah, yeah, you're good. You know? And so they're like, mm,

113
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.440
they gave me the points and then I pass and mm.

114
00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:16.200
They gimme the points and then I sit back for that. And now I'm just qualified

115
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.750
and it just like, that's hard to swallow. It is that sucks. And I like her,

116
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.310
you know what I mean? Like I like her,

117
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.070
her dad was at my gym teaching a seminar at my gym in Colorado,

118
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.590
like months earlier.

119
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.270
And so when the matches over and we go and we're like standing next to them,

120
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:36.150
they're like, sorry. &lt;laugh&gt; you know, like, did you see.

121
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.380
<v 1>The video that somebody made on Instagram of her after one day in Liverpool?</v>

122
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.873
<v 0>No. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

123
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.340
<v 1>What do you know? People make fun of her accent that it's not real. Oh, Brazil.</v>

124
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.660
<v 0>Yeah. Someone just told me that recently. Yeah.</v>

125
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.500
<v 1>She apparently, I don't know. I mean, people accents are weird to begin with.</v>

126
00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:55.700
Like why do people talk the way they talk in the first place?

127
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.250
Because they sound like the people around them is geographical. Yeah. I mean,

128
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.070
it's, it's weird,

129
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.290
but there's a video that somebody made of Mackenzie do after one day in

130
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:05.250
Liverpool. And it's basically her talking,

131
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.250
but Darren Till's voice instead &lt;laugh&gt;

132
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.210
Oh my God. It's rough. It's rough. I'm not playing it. Don't play it.

133
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.610
JB don't even pull it up. I will not do that to her. Oh,

134
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.560
but it's pretty funny. Yeah. Cause I was super confused when I interviewed her.

135
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.840
Um, when she won in the UFC, uh,

136
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.080
they wanted a translator and I was like, what are you talking about?

137
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.840
Like she speaks perfect English. Oh, like, this is really bizarre.

138
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:39.510
So George Gael came in with me. He's like,

139
00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:41.950
just in case she gets messed up anymore. And like, I didn't even question.

140
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.710
I was like, okay. I was confused. I'm like, but wait a minute.

141
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.310
I know she speaks perfect English. Like this is ridiculous, like.

142
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.190
<v 0>Raised in Arizona, right? Yeah. But.</v>

143
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.630
<v 1>She speaks perfect English. So I don't know if they were selling it.</v>

144
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.950
You know? I don't know whose idea it was. I don't know. I don't know.

145
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.780
I don't get it, but the internet got it. &lt;laugh&gt; they went crazy.

146
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.890
<v 0>Oh really?</v>

147
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.540
<v 1>They, they went crazy. Everybody was like, what in the is happening?</v>

148
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.020
I didn't question it. I'm like, look, I'm just here to interview her.

149
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.060
I just want her, I mean, she wants to speak in Portuguese.

150
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:16.580
She wants to speak in English. I don't give a, but I was like,

151
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.370
why do you need to translate her? Like, that's, that's insane.

152
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.610
<v 0>I don't know all of that. I don't.</v>

153
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.730
<v 1>Know all that either. You know,</v>

154
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.690
she definitely speaks English really well though. Does.

155
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.770
<v 0>It, is there a benefit to not being Brazilian? Well, yeah. I mean,</v>

156
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.370
obviously that's a huge demographic in sport. Huge, huge.

157
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.480
Primarily the biggest other than American. Yeah.

158
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.960
But I'm curious if there's like a benefit or a marketing, like is there,

159
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.320
is there something to that that would make that more?

160
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.400
<v 1>Well, Brazilians have immense national pride. Yeah. I see. Yeah. You know,</v>

161
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:57.040
and her being a Brazilian and the daughter of a Brazilian jujitsu,

162
00:08:57.041 --> 00:08:58.320
legend mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you know,

163
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.080
speaking perfect Portuguese and English, you know, just,

164
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.320
I guess maybe that's the idea behind it. I don't know. She's.

165
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320
<v 0>Killing it though.</v>

166
00:09:05.321 --> 00:09:10.280
Like technically and with her style and I mean like everything that she

167
00:09:10.281 --> 00:09:14.790
brings to the table is, is already good. You know? It's like the don't.

168
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.430
<v 1>That up. &lt;laugh&gt; don't fact up with it. Some yeah.</v>

169
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.750
Who knows it is so shenanigans.

170
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.590
<v 0>Yeah. I don't know. You know what, sometimes when I get around people, like,</v>

171
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.710
I feel bad because like I try to be like really empathetic and,

172
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.550
and when I'm around like foreigners and like,

173
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.950
I will totally slow down my speaking,

174
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.510
so they will get it to the point where sometimes I think I look condescending

175
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.020
well. Right. You know where I'm like,

176
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.660
I just want this conversation to go as easy as possible for you because yeah.

177
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.780
I'm already awkward. And like, let me help you.

178
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.260
<v 1>Out. You know, that's a different thing.</v>

179
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.620
It's like you remember when Madonna had a fake English accent and everybody's

180
00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.900
like, you're from Brooklyn or wherever the you're from.

181
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.300
You are not from England. If you can't do that stop.

182
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.650
<v 0>Well, well, yeah. I mean, depending who she's around, I guess, I don't know.</v>

183
00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:57.490
That's.

184
00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:57.731
<v 1>The thing,</v>

185
00:09:57.731 --> 00:10:02.290
like if you're around people that have that accent you'll you will pick it up.

186
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.010
Yeah. Like when I was a kid, I definitely had a Boston accent,

187
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:10.170
but I heard myself talk on TV once when I was like 19 with a Boston accent,

188
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.890
I was like, oh no, I gotta get rid of that.

189
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.490
Like how did I pick that up so quick? Yeah. And.

190
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.760
<v 0>My family of Minnesota rural, you know? And so when I go home,</v>

191
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.280
I get that and it'll stick around for a few weeks for sure. Yeah. Especially.

192
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.200
<v 1>If you drink, right. Yeah.</v>

193
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.760
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. Or I'm real tired. Yeah.</v>

194
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.800
<v 1>Or yeah, if you're around all those people,</v>

195
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.640
it's like comforting mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; accents are strange. Yeah. You know,

196
00:10:30.641 --> 00:10:33.720
they're they really are strange that they're like specific to regions.

197
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:37.070
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I mean, it just shows you how pliable people are. Yeah.

198
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:38.630
You know, like Southern accents. Oh.
