00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 2>How I got introduced to you. I I'd heard about reservoir dogs,</v>

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.600
but the first film I saw was pulp fiction. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.520
And I saw pulp fiction with this girl that I was dating when I first moved to

5
00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:14.180
Los Angeles.

6
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.960
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I remember being in man's Chinese theater watching

7
00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:20.910
this. Yeah. And for me it was like this crazy change in life. And.

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.350
<v 1>That was in the first, that was in the first few weeks of it opening. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.590
Cuz that's where it opened. Yeah.

10
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.590
<v 0>Uh, crazy change in my life, moving to Los Angeles and then seeing this film.</v>

11
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.670
And then I remember very clearly, like at the end of the film,

12
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.590
like even in the middle of the film going,

13
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.590
this is the craziest movie I've ever seen in my life.

14
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.660
And this scene it's symbolized to me. Like the world world was changing.

15
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.180
Like everything was changing. It was so wild and so crazy.

16
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.740
<v 2>It was a film, not, it was unlike anything I'd ever seen before all the,</v>

17
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.340
the different timelines, how you interwove everything together. But the,

18
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.500
the violence and the chaos and the humor mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; of all of it.

19
00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:59.100
Like people walked outta that movie theater up. Yeah.

20
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.010
And I remember thinking like, wow, like the, the world is different.

21
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.650
Like sometimes you'll see a work of art, a something,

22
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.410
and you'll say that thing just changed everything. It just,

23
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.010
it was so wild that it, it,

24
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.970
it influenced so many other films afterwards.

25
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.290
They tried to be like a pulp fiction movie or they tried to be wild. Well,

26
00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:20.450
people.

27
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.770
<v 1>Would ask me about that and they'd go, Hey,</v>

28
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:24.800
did that of really bug you when there was a period of,

29
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:28.920
it seemed like five years in the nineties where like every crime film kind of

30
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.320
had this like ironic bit and,

31
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.920
and they talked about TV shows and played music in a weird way. And yeah.

32
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.840
And everybody was a smart. Right. Um, and they asked me like, well,

33
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.910
does that, did that bother you? And I go, well, no,

34
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.270
it doesn't bother me when I don't think any of them are as good as mine.

35
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:48.870
So it just makes mine look better and better.

36
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.750
And my dialogue look better and better, but you know,

37
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.750
one of my favorite directors is se Leoni and I always considered,

38
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.750
I was doing two traditional gangster films, like, you know,

39
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.310
Scorsese kind of good fellow kind of movies,

40
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.980
what he was doing to traditional westerns when he did his spaghetti westerns.

41
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.140
So then the fact that mine hit, and now the fact that I've it not,

42
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.940
it wasn't that they were just trying to do pulp fiction or reservoir dogs.

43
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.100
<v 2>They were trying to exist in the same sub sub genre of crime film that I had</v>

44
00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:21.870
created,

45
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.290
which is what all the other spa Getty westerns that came after Leon's had done.

46
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.170
So the fact that it wasn't, they were doing just reservoir dogs or pulp fiction.

47
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.730
Ripoffs uh,

48
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.410
I created a sub genre in gangster films that did not exist before.

49
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:41.210
And they were trying to fill that sub genre. And that was awesome.

50
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.643
&lt;laugh&gt;.

51
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.840
<v 0>That's gotta be a wild. It was great. I created a.</v>

52
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.720
<v 1>Sub, I had affected gangster film. I mean,</v>

53
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.360
by that point to do kind of a Scorsese kind of thing was like almost passe.

54
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.823
Yeah.

55
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.400
<v 0>Well you brought back John Travolta. Yeah. Uhhuh, which is.</v>

56
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.400
<v 1>Pretty wild too. Well, I remember even asking somebody, I go, uh, okay,</v>

57
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.800
well people say Tarantino esque, what do they mean?

58
00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:05.680
And there was a guy I knew he was a, a, he's like a film analyst, his name,

59
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.560
Dave SCO. And he goes, well,

60
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.440
okay. Just to give you an idea. It's like, okay, so in bad boys or yeah,

61
00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:19.950
I think maybe no, it's like bad boys. Like go, well again, bad boys. Okay.

62
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:23.390
You have a couple of henchmen working for the bad guy and they're sitting in

63
00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:27.750
their car and all of a sudden they have a conversation about an,

64
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.190
I love Lucy episode. Okay. That wouldn't have happened without you.

65
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.463
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

66
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.390
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; it's true. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. Yeah. Well, what is that from?</v>

67
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.700
I mean, where have you had this, uh, this flare for references and then this,

68
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.860
uh, this way of layering.

69
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.820
<v 1>That just comes from being gen X, man. I mean, that was, uh,</v>

70
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:48.420
that was the whole thing about like, uh,

71
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.580
about that generation is the idea that, um, okay. In the, okay.

72
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.660
The generation before us, that like lived through the sixties,

73
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.420
they had the sixties, they had the AMA in the six,

74
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.210
they had all that sixties music.

75
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.810
<v 2>Um, and they looked down on the generation that grew up in the sixties, uh,</v>

76
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.810
in the seventies. Like you didn't have that, any of that,

77
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.810
you didn't have the music that we had. Well,

78
00:04:11.811 --> 00:04:15.210
maybe we didn't have the music you had. We had our music,

79
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.130
but what we did have is we had television.

80
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.360
We had the Saturday morning cartoon two that we dug, we had schoolhouse rock.

81
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.240
We had all the TV shows. We liked, we had speed racer.

82
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.120
We had all these kind of things and they meant something to us.

83
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.560
<v 1>And, you know, um, kids back then who,</v>

84
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:38.560
if their parents didn't let them watch TV at a certain point, well,

85
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.150
the parents might have actually had like the best intentions,

86
00:04:41.151 --> 00:04:46.150
but they were actually robbing their children of the pop cultural glue.

87
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.110
That's gonna tie them to their generation when they get older. Mm. And so,

88
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.870
you know, we had a, the ABC movies of the week. I mean, we just, you know,

89
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:55.350
we had all that stuff and we had great movies.

90
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:58.870
<v 2>If you're going out and seeing the movies of new Hollywood, we had all that.</v>

91
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.260
And so, um, when we got older, it, it,

92
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.020
it was about talking about that stuff. That was,

93
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.020
that was what was worth talking about.

94
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.260
And then to actually have characters in a movie, talk about that.

95
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:15.300
That was making them sound realistic. And to be specific about it.

96
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.580
You remember that old sitcom? No, no, no. Talk about, no, you mean,

97
00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:23.410
you mean Alice? Okay. So talk about, you talk about Mel and Alice.
