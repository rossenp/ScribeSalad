00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.120
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.760
<v 1>It's almost just like, if you embrace it,</v>

3
00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:11.520
then there's something just like everything's dead and miserable

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.440
for a period of time.

5
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.480
And then it blooms and then you get to experience like this rebirth and then

6
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:19.520
it, you know, flourishes and then it dies again.

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.670
That there's other perspective on that actually being, I don't know,

8
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:24.670
like if you work with it,

9
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:29.110
it's sort of like a woman who's on birth control has no idea that there's any

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.990
point to, uh, you know, a cycle of energy over the course of the month.

11
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.230
Right. She sort of thinks is that that's annoying,

12
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.590
but there's a way you can wrap your mind around it where you work.

13
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:41.500
What do do you mean? Like, okay. So like if you're earth control,

14
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.140
you have no menstrual cycle. Right? Right. So you're just like a,

15
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:47.540
you're like a man you're like a flat line the whole month,

16
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.340
but there's actually something really empowering.

17
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.980
If you understand how to work with your energy shifts,

18
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.540
cuz naturally like a woman's natural men.

19
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.340
I know this is really what you wanna be talking about. I do.

20
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.090
<v 0>I don't, I mean, it's alien to me, so I do wanna, I hear it. So.</v>

21
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.170
<v 1>Like I figured this out I'm 39. I was on birth control for 12 years.</v>

22
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.730
So I never knew what it was,

23
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.970
what it meant to have like a menstrual cycle until very recently.

24
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:15.490
Cause then I had two kids breastfeeding. So couple decades into my life.

25
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.490
I'm just figuring this out.

26
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.370
But you have like totally different kinds of energy over the course of the month

27
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.800
and you have to know how to work with at that. So there's a kind of energy that,

28
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.321
you know,

29
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:27.520
you wanna go out and socialize or you wanna stay in and work or you wanna sleep

30
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:31.000
more or less. And if you don't know how to ride that,

31
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.240
then you could be sort of taken off guard by it.

32
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.680
But if you know how to work with it,

33
00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:40.120
it's so much more powerful than just having this like artificial hijacking of

34
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:41.440
your endocrine system.

35
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.281
<v 0>That's interesting.</v>

36
00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:45.790
So the there's like some sort of analogy to be drawn between the cycles of

37
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:49.910
nature and the cycles of your body month to month it's yeah. Huh?

38
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.030
I would've never considered that. I never even thought about it, but I,

39
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.710
I have thought about birth control before,

40
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:58.430
about how crazy it is that you give a woman a hormone that convinces her body

41
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:02.950
that she's perpetually pregnant and that a giant percentage of women are on it

42
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.020
for convenience. Yes. Or even from other medical issues like skin issues. Right?

43
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:07.490
Exactly.

44
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.020
<v 1>Exactly. Yeah. I mean, when I I've always been a feminist, right.</v>

45
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.340
So even when I was younger and very much asleep,

46
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.500
I identified as a feminist and I thought was one of those people who thought

47
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:20.860
that birth control was like a female entitlement.

48
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.250
Like how dare you not make this free and why widely available.

49
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.690
But as I begin to research more about it and more about how it's in many ways,

50
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.850
like the ultimate, you know, not to sound too inflammatory,

51
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:37.130
but the ultimate tool for oppression of, you know, the modern woman.

52
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.250
Now I find it incredible that we, you know,

53
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.840
that we're still taking it because it seems like a good idea, right?

54
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.640
Who wants to deal with your annoying menstrual cycle? Who wants to get pregnant?

55
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.440
Who wants to have endometriosis or polycystic ovary, you know,

56
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:54.280
who wants to have acne or like hair growing in weird places,

57
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.320
but it's the magic pill illusion. There's no free lunch.

58
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:02.520
There's never gonna be something that just fixes it for you.

59
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.360
And you just waltz off into the sunset.

60
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.000
There's always a cost and the cost is so much more vast,

61
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:12.880
like ranging from literally death all the way to just like subtle alterations in

62
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:17.680
your personality and like the fear moons you secrete, you know?

63
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.230
And there, there was just a million woman study, um,

64
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.590
in Scandinavia that showed about the vast, uh,

65
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.070
increase in antidepressant prescribing for teenagers who are prescribed birth

66
00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:31.310
control. So it's the beginning of sort of,

67
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:34.190
it's like a gateway drug sometimes for psych meds too.

68
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.950
<v 0>Yeah. I heard, I had a friend who one of his good friends is done.</v>

69
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.420
Oter died from some complications with taking birth control pills and smoking

70
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.820
cigarettes. Yes.

71
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.580
<v 1>Pulmonary embolism, probably that.</v>

72
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.820
<v 0>Smoking cigarettes,</v>

73
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.220
apparently along with the birth control pills are extremely dangerous,

74
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.260
but so many do it.

75
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.420
<v 1>Of course. And you don't even have to have that additional risk factor,</v>

76
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.540
you know, cuz birth control,

77
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.370
whether it's the pill or something called maneuvering by itself has that,

78
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.870
you know,

79
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.810
I'm contacted often by parents of girls who have died from pulmonary

80
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.730
embolism. Who've now become like activists in this realm and it's because of.

81
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.730
<v 0>Birth control pills. Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.130
<v 1>Yeah, no, it's like a known mechanism and it's a known risk factor.</v>

83
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:17.370
Like I think that's not being suppressed or hidden.

84
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.960
It's just that we are sort of to dismiss the risks as we

85
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:27.480
attach to the promise. So we sort of like collude in ignoring that potential.

86
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.980
You know.

87
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.240
<v 0>That's so interesting because most people,</v>

88
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.280
when they think about the birth control pill,

89
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:34.320
they think about it as something that liberated women,

90
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:38.440
because exactly they can control whether or not they got pregnant and they were

91
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.190
allowed for the first time to have careers and do whatever they wanted to

92
00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:46.150
because they didn't have to worry about being trapped. That's right.

93
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.230
<v 1>Right. That's.</v>

94
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.950
<v 0>The story. But that's the biological free lunch thing, right? There's exactly.</v>

95
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.310
Isn't there also a lot of issues. Chris Ryan was on here, Dr. Chris Ryan,

96
00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.030
the author of sex at Dawn. He was on here and he was talking about how women,

97
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.100
like, if you smell the clothes of other men,

98
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.700
you can literally tell the men that you are attracted to.

99
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.260
You would be biologically compatible with those men.

100
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.900
And that when they did these same studies on women who were on the birth control

101
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:14.980
pill, they couldn't smell the.

102
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.020
<v 1>Difference. That's right. It's called the t-shirt study. Yeah. How.</v>

103
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.900
<v 0>Does that work? Could you explain that?</v>

104
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.380
<v 1>Well, essentially</v>

105
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.490
the premise of pharmaceutical medicine is that you can just pull like one little

106
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.850
thread of the spiderweb and leave the rest of it intact.

107
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.290
Like everything else is gonna be fine. We're only working on this one area.

108
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.090
So with birth control, for example, the idea is we're just, you know,

109
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.370
taking over the management of your sex hormones,

110
00:05:40.371 --> 00:05:43.320
but the rest of your body is gonna be totally unaffected. And of course,

111
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.360
as we learn more about how all of these systems are totally and

112
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.120
inextricably interconnected, we have a better understanding of how, you know,

113
00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:56.120
when you, um, interfere with sex hormones,

114
00:05:56.121 --> 00:06:00.840
you also potentially have other effects, including, um, raising things called,

115
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.000
um, binding globulins, including inflammatory response.

116
00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:07.720
You're depleting a number of nutrients and we're having, you know,

117
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.560
it's possible that we,

118
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.880
we haven't even begun to look through the keyhole of the effects on brain and

119
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.920
you know, sort of neuro peptides.

120
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.590
And these is where we don't have any idea what hormonal secretion is about.

121
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.710
Like we just have to defer to the probability that our bodies are more complex

122
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.750
than we've right. Like begun to understand.

123
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.630
So your biology is meant to guide you. It's meant to empower you.

124
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.220
And it's meant to, you know, create a sense of vitality.

125
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.860
If you can inhabit your body and be in a truce with it.

126
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.980
That's part of the problem with the mindset of birth control is I'm just gonna,

127
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.020
you know, take this over, I'm gonna manage this. Right. And so who knows,

128
00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:54.500
maybe even it's a top down like mindset thing that begins to sort of divorce you

129
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:57.020
from your sensibilities.

130
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.170
We don't really know is the point that's going, that's gonna be a common answer.

131
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.130
I think, yeah, I have to give you, is that we, we don't really know, but it,

132
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.490
it does make sense that your, you know,

133
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.450
the subtle nature of your biology that involves, you know,

134
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.570
sort of guiding your human interactions and particularly sex related

135
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:17.930
interactions is gonna be derailed. I mean, low libido,

136
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.120
one of ironically the most common, um, disclosed side effects of birth control.

137
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.320
So you're, you're taking it so that you can have unprotected sex.

138
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.880
We don't feel like having sex ultimately anyway.

139
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.760
So it's not even really that well thought out. I think by most of us.

140
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.480
<v 0>It's very bizarre, but what other alternatives are there? I mean,</v>

141
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.070
if you're a woman and you want to have control of whether or not you get

142
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.791
pregnant. Yeah.

143
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:45.190
There's not a whole lot of options other than weird ones like IUDs, which seem.

144
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.990
<v 1>Real weird. Yeah. I mean, there's,</v>

145
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.110
some of my patients use what's called a copper. I U D you know,

146
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:53.870
it's funny cuz I had one put in and two and a half.

147
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:57.230
It costs like $700 and two and a half weeks later I had it taken out cuz I just

148
00:07:57.231 --> 00:08:01.780
felt weird about having like a pharmaceutical metal in my &lt;laugh&gt; my body was,

149
00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:05.940
felt like a tracking device. Could you feel it in there? No, no, no you can't.

150
00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:06.860
It's not really. You just were freaking out.

151
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.740
It's just like psychologically felt weird. Oh. But um,

152
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.220
I use something called a Daisy,

153
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.700
which is like this highly calibrated thermometer. I, you track your, you know,

154
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:18.380
cuz you have six fertil days a month, this isn't, you know,

155
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.170
like some major sacrifice you have to make in order to learn how your cycle

156
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:27.850
works and then you get the benefits of being in your hormonal,

157
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.970
Amelia, you know, like it's not, um, it's not that complicated. Mm.

158
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.090
But it there's a learning curve, you know,

159
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.970
requires like learning how to be a woman and also sharing the onus because

160
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.960
you know, with all of these side effects we've been talking about, you know,

161
00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:46.520
there was like a male birth control study that was just terminated because of

162
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:49.760
how many side effects like the men didn't wanna deal with. You know?

163
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:52.520
So there's such a sociocultural double standard around this,

164
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.400
but if we're talking about six days a month,

165
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:57.360
like how do we collaborate and try and figure something out, you know,

166
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:59.560
that doesn't involve a risk of death perhaps.

167
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.280
<v 0>So this Daisy thing just monitors your temperature and tells you exactly what's.</v>

168
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.800
<v 1>Going on. Yeah. I mean it's a little more sophisticated than that.</v>

169
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.800
It actually has the efficacy like above 99% efficacy. If you listen to it,

170
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.640
that's part of the, you know, right. Room for human error,

171
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.790
but it basically just tells you like have sex now if you wanna conceive or if

172
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:21.510
you don't then don't right. So it's a little, like a little light it's green,

173
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:22.763
red or yellow.

174
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.510
<v 0>How many women are on birth control if you had to guess nationwide?</v>

175
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.830
<v 1>You know, I would, that's a good question.</v>

176
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.540
I dunno. The stat off hand upward of like 10 million, I would say.

177
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.580
<v 0>That's a staggering number of people taking some sort of a substance that</v>

178
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.100
alters the, the very nature of who they are.

179
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.980
<v 1>Exactly. Yeah. I mean,</v>

180
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.100
my interest in it really came from looking at the psychiatric side effects

181
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:54.220
because I'm very interested in medications that have potential, you know,

182
00:09:54.221 --> 00:09:59.210
gateway effects or around psychiatric meds that we aren't informing

183
00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:03.010
women of before. You know, they start the prescription. So, you know,

184
00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:07.770
whether it's like acid blocking medications, you know, or antibiotics, um,

185
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.570
you know, birth control, vaccines,

186
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.410
these things have known psycho biological effects.

187
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.560
If you don't know that, then you'll never connect the dots.

188
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.480
And then you end up in the polypharmacy realm where you're taking multiple meds,

189
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.240
right. Without ever knowing where the dominoes like started to fall.
