00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.240
<v 2>It's just the, the idea of pulling up at a yacht is the end.</v>

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.760
It's the opposite of what everybody tells you about fighting, right? Fighting.

4
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:14.560
You have to stay hungry, like stay humble, you know, like, like, you know,

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.400
Rocky three style. Yeah. Like you don't, you don't pull up in a yacht.

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.361
And if you,

7
00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:24.070
but if you do the only person who's been able to do like that is Floyd M

8
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.390
ayweather. He's the only guy who's been able to just be balling outta control,

9
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.670
constantly flashing money, million dollar watches, you know,

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.790
a fleet of super expensive cars and still everybody up.

11
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.270
He does. He's the only guy. Yeah. Literally.

12
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.140
<v 0>The only thing other guys besides like him Oconnor who really Adrian Broner.</v>

13
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:44.974
But he he's.

14
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.780
<v 1>He's he just won. I think he won disputed decision,</v>

15
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
but he seems to be more concerned with having fun

16
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.460
and being crazy. The thing about Floyd is he never lost his discipline.

17
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.180
Like Floyd's discipline was, uh, undeniable. Right. But.

18
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.330
<v 0>Through that at balling nights, he never,</v>

19
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.330
I don't think he was doing drugs or drinking. You know, he kept his.

20
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.370
<v 1>Pretty Floyd would famously run home from the nightclub.</v>

21
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.210
So he would go out in Vegas, he'd be partying. It looked like he's party,

22
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:15.044
he's drinking water.

23
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.130
And then he would have his driver drive and with his pants

24
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.440
on with jeans on, he would home mean the dude was always training,

25
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.080
always training, never got outta.

26
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.080
<v 0>Shape. Dude, the jog home and jeans. Isn't a torture.</v>

27
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.200
The torture is sitting around a bunch of drunk people drinking water in a club.

28
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.600
I jog home all night.

29
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.920
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; rather than that. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.840
It's an interesting thing though. The,

31
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.830
the keeping your motivation as you reach a certain level of fame

32
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.110
and success, because that's a lot of the motivation for fighters is to,

33
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.910
to one day be that champion one day,

34
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.710
have that money where your family's gonna be taken care of for life.

35
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.030
You don't have to worry anymore. Do you hit that spot? Like,

36
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:58.910
and then what keeps you going? Yeah. How.

37
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.990
<v 0>Do you remain a student in that spot? Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:03.300
There's the famous quote that is hard to wake up in and,

39
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.620
and run the miles when you sleeping in silk pajamas.

40
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.860
I forget what boxer said that, but yeah, it's gotta be true, you know? Um, what,

41
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.180
unless you just keep setting goals, maybe he's trying to,

42
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.020
to do something that's never been done. Maybe that's the driving factor now,

43
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.620
you know, cuz a lot of guys money might be the driving factor,

44
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.380
but once you get the money, maybe you set it up to try to leave legend.

45
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.603
He thinks behind like.

46
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.010
<v 1>Well the thing about Floyd is he spend so much money.</v>

47
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.330
Maybe that maybe money's still the motivation because he's just always about to

48
00:02:31.331 --> 00:02:34.410
go broke. Cuz he is just, he spends like a Manc.

49
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.210
<v 0>I would like to think, even though he is spending like that,</v>

50
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.050
he's made some great investments and yeah.

51
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.450
<v 1>I'd like to think that too, but I, I bet it's not the case. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

52
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.880
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. Definitely spend a lot of money,</v>

53
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.400
but he's made so much man, over a billion, right? Isn't that crazy.

54
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.240
<v 1>Over a billion, over a billion dollars in fighting a billion, a with a B,</v>

55
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.400
and now he's about to fight Logan Paul in a boxing match in Japan.

56
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.640
But apparently they postponed that.

57
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640
<v 0>Right. I thought, I thought it was a different fight, uh, in Japan.</v>

58
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.640
<v 1>No, I think it's Logan Paul, right? It is. Yeah, no it's Logan Paul.</v>

59
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.480
They postponed it though because they weren't,

60
00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:14.080
they didn't have enough paper view interest. Right. Is that the Jamie, you know,

61
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.040
the, not according to.

62
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.160
<v 0>Them, but uh, not according to them probably to cover uh,</v>

63
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.590
I mean Mayweather side. Yeah, yeah. A new date's coming soon. Yeah.

64
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.190
<v 1>Whatever that means. I mean he's, he's fighting 200 pounders.</v>

65
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.910
I mean obviously Logan, Paul's not a, a real professional boxer in,

66
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.950
in terms of like, certainly not in the caliber of Floyd Mayweather,

67
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:35.790
but it's big dude.

68
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.380
<v 0>Yeah. Huge. Cuz Floyd's not a big guy. No. You know, I've never seen um,</v>

69
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.860
the other guy in person. I don't know how big he is. I met him. He's.

70
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.740
<v 1>A big. Yeah. Yeah. He's big.</v>

71
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.980
<v 0>Skills pay the bills man. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

72
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.180
<v 1>Guess so he, he doesn't give a, man. Well, he also fought tension.</v>

73
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.860
Nazo Kawa the, the little tiny dude in Japan,

74
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:59.730
which was ridiculous when that guy fights at like 1 26. Yeah. &lt;affirmative&gt;.

75
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.490
<v 0>I was surprised how that went. I, I, I thought Floyd was gonna beat him,</v>

76
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:06.010
but I thought it would be a little bit more happening than that. That.

77
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.410
<v 1>Was I Floyd didn't even look like he trained a day for that fight.</v>

78
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.090
He looked like he was a little bit outta shape.

79
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.890
Like he had a little ring around the midsection and smiling like

80
00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:18.650
smiling. Like he knew what he was gonna do. Like how you gonna beat me?

81
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.883
He was so little.

82
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.280
You like he's been fighting these big power punchers and he's fighting this

83
00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:27.200
little guy who's known for his kicks. Right? Catch new episodes.
