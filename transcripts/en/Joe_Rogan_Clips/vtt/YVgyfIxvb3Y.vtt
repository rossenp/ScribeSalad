<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.513
<v 1>Experience.</v>

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.940
I think where you and I agree is that law and order needs to be re-established.

4
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:09.030
And one of the reasons why I think that it needs to be reestablished is if

5
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:13.710
there's a fire of consciousness and this fire is you're allowed to

6
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:16.860
loot and smash and steal, and people are doing that now.

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.410
And I don't think they're doing it in the memory of George Floyd.

8
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.950
And I think you've got to put that fire out because once you allow people to do

9
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:26.490
it, like the Blasio did in New York city and forced the police to stand back,

10
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.580
people know they can get away with it. I've seen some horrific things,

11
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:32.550
people running over people with cars and smashing into buildings.

12
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:37.410
And it's madness. When madness happens, you have to crack down,

13
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:38.700
you have to do something about it.

14
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.350
That's where I support whether it's the national guard or if the police have the

15
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:46.170
resources, use the police, but something has to be done.

16
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.770
When you're saying like president Trump, deescalating on television,

17
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:52.920
that is not going to do a thing about those kids, smashing windows.

18
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.980
It's not going to change their attitude. They're not watching the news.

19
00:00:55.981 --> 00:01:00.270
They're not paying attention. They know they have a very simplistic perspective.

20
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.220
George Floyd, this is bad. Black lives matter. Chaos. Smashed that window.

21
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.730
Take that. They're not going to say, Hey, you know, when Trump got on his knees,

22
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:10.800
I was going to Luke Gucci, but I'm not going to do that anymore.

23
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.790
He did not think like that. There's, there's both fake on both sides,

24
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.210
but he's got to do something to stop the fire.

25
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.390
You got to put that fire out then deescalate.

26
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.140
But first the fire has to stop because there's a,

27
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:28.410
it's an obvious mob mentality thing because no one's ever seen this before.

28
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.080
No one's ever, there was a Santa Monica was a guy running around with a gun,

29
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:34.890
pointing it at people. People were driving into people and knocking them over.

30
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.540
It's crazy. It's not something that anyone expected seven days ago.

31
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.610
<v 0>And it is a sign of like a breakdown of a society like there's storm.</v>

32
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:45.444
There's no doubt.

33
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.110
<v 1>And despair from three months of not working is unprecedented.</v>

34
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.890
You've never had a time where through no fault of your own, you are broke.

35
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:55.500
You can't pay for food. You can't pay your mortgage.

36
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:58.890
You can't pay your rent and you're and there's no jobs to be had.

37
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.120
It's not like there's anything.

38
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:03.090
These kids can go out and do to better their position,

39
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.450
the amount of jobs that existed just three months ago,

40
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.310
it's trustingly reduced.

41
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.610
So there are opportunities which are already slim to none have w you know,

42
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:14.700
we're talking about people getting out of college in 2020,

43
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.260
that how bad their economic opportunities are before all this.

44
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.850
<v 0>And how much,</v>

45
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.580
how about if you're coming out of high school and aren't going to go to college.

46
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.780
I mean, most, most people don't go to college. Right? And so my,

47
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.950
my only, my only point is that the military is not a solution for that.

48
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.020
That's the solution though. Well,

49
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:37.350
the solution is to actually do something about the material condition

50
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.243
ultimately.

51
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.530
<v 1>But right now there's a solution about the fire. How do you put out the fire?</v>

52
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.700
Because there's a fire.

53
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.570
When these people are smashing windows all down fifth avenue, that's a fire.

54
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.030
<v 0>I think where we view it differently is that in my view, the tactics,</v>

55
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:57.780
the aggressive tactics that the police have used have only made that worse

56
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.530
because they, right. And so my view is if you bring in the military,

57
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.990
first of all, I find it. I find all of,

58
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.450
I think we are getting far too comfortable,

59
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:10.030
and this is partly part of the perfect storm with the pandemic.

60
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:14.170
Like we've become very comfortable with all these extreme limitations on our

61
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.440
actions, behavior, wearing the masks in public,

62
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.910
which creates a level of anonymity. Like all of that goes into this. So when,

63
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.990
when we have a curfew imposed of 1:00 PM or 5:00 PM or 6:00 PM,

64
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.550
we're just good to go with that.

65
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:31.960
But that should be taken in and of itself very seriously as an infringement on

66
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.850
first amendment rights.

67
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.290
So my point is that if you bring in the military,

68
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:41.800
it is frightening in terms of our liberties,

69
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:44.260
our ability to protest our first amendment rights,

70
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:45.700
which are incredibly important.

71
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:48.640
And I think ultimately only leads to additional violence.

72
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.350
<v 1>Yeah. Well, I think we're going around in circles here,</v>

73
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.880
because I agree with you on all those things.

74
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.600
And I am a hundred percent in support of the people protesting, right?

75
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:59.680
People that are walking on the street with signs about George Floyd and black

76
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:02.890
lives matter. I'm a hundred percent in favor of that. It's the looting.

77
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.160
So how do you stop the looting? You've got to do something to stop the looting.

78
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.310
If you don't stop diluting, it is going to continue.

79
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.960
<v 0>The thing on tear, gassing protestors, and start focusing on.</v>

80
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.300
<v 1>I don't think so. They started tear gassing protestors after the looting,</v>

81
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.440
after all that got crazy. That's when they started cracking down on the protest.

82
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.350
I think it's a mistake because I don't think they're connected.

83
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.010
I think the people that are doing all the looting and the smashing are not the

84
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:31.300
people that are peacefully protesting.

85
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.380
And there's a ton of videos of people who were screaming.

86
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.030
There's a one video of this girl. Who's yelling at these,

87
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.030
these girls in front of a Starbucks that are spray painting, black lives better.

88
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.970
It's an African-American girl. And these white girls who sprained. She was like,

89
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:46.120
why the are you doing? They're going to blame us.

90
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.170
<v 2>She's white. That look, that's a huge part of this whole thing,</v>

91
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.010
which is that there's just upper middle-class white liberalism and their

92
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.670
inability. I mean, just as a whole element of white guilt and so much more,

93
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.770
there's an entire industrial, um,

94
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.430
industrial complex set up to make white people and upper middle class white

95
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:05.200
people in particular feel uncomfortable,

96
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:08.290
condemning looting and violence in this particular scenario,

97
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.930
even though everybody agrees with you, Joe, I mean,

98
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:14.620
pretty much everybody is like, yeah, protests are fine. Looting is bad.

99
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.590
Protests have been great. Right. And what happened to George Floyd was up.

100
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.680
That's like 1, 2, 3 90 5% of the people in this,

101
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.990
in this country would agree with something like that.

102
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.580
And so that's why I think that, that, I mean, look,

103
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.590
that that shows you that there is again, a political weight to be forged here,

104
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:31.150
which is like, like you said,

105
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.840
nobody thinks that this is nobody was defending George Floyd.

106
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.640
<v 0>What has been interesting is that these riots have not just been in the poor</v>

107
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:42.670
neighborhood or in the black neighborhood. I mean, they have been all,

108
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:46.180
I think that's part of why people are so freaked out is they've been sort of

109
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:50.560
intentionally in the wealthy parts of town is part of what makes it

110
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:55.300
so unsettling for everyone across the board. And so, you know,

111
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:59.210
look, I, my only point is, you know, yes,

112
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.990
looting bad violence, bad, absolutely. All of that.

113
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.210
But you can't imagine that the military is an answer to the situation that.

114
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.710
<v 1>Yeah. I don't know what the answer is, but when people see the chaos and the,</v>

115
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.280
the randomness of it all, that's,

116
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:16.640
what's really frightening when people saw what was happening,

117
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.390
happening in Minneapolis as a direct result of a bad cop,

118
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.160
killing a man that was handcuffed and not a threat whatsoever, then people say,

119
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.900
okay, I get these people.

120
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.540
But then when you see them smashing windows and Beverly Hills, you're like,

121
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:31.550
what the does this have to do with George Floyd? Yeah.

122
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.730
Like what is going on here? And how are you justifying this? And they're not.

123
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.190
<v 0>But that's the thing is it's not just a bad one bad cop or even just</v>

124
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:43.930
policing. Right. I mean, let's remember right. It wasn't just one bad guy there,

125
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:44.930
three other guys just standing.

126
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.780
<v 1>Around watching. Sure. But.</v>

127
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.010
<v 0>What I'm saying is that's why the spread across the country is because the</v>

128
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.190
grievances aren't specific. That was the, that was the flashpoint.

129
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.150
But the grievances are not just specific to that one.

130
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.780
<v 1>Marches and protests not smashing the windows of target, you know? And they did,</v>

131
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.520
they did a target right down the street from here.

132
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:06.230
Like what the does that have to do with anything?

133
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:08.300
And it's do nothing it has to do with lawlessness.

134
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.970
And that's do with people taking advantage of the situation.

135
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:14.590
And escalating also, it's probably exciting people,

136
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.580
people who have been locked up and bored as,

137
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.920
and all of a sudden they got something, look,

138
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.390
it is in many ways similar to war. And this is why,

139
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.520
because when people are, they have a real cause and when war is going on,

140
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.330
there's a lot of people that I know that have served overseas.

141
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.650
And one of the hard kind of scary truth is that some of the best times of their

142
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:40.910
life. Yeah. I have a Sebastian younger wrote a great book about it called tribe.

143
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.600
It's a fantastic book that really gets to the psychology of it. And you know,

144
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:47.840
this is a guy who was over there for long periods of time as a journalist,

145
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.430
when you are involved in this and you feel like you're fighting the good fight

146
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.210
and you're like, corporate America. But you know, you're 20 years old.

147
00:07:56.211 --> 00:08:00.350
You believe that. You know, my friend, Bridget, fetisi, she's a,

148
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.530
she's a brilliant writer. And she's really hilarious. And she,

149
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.600
she was talking about some papers that she found that she wrote when she was 24.

150
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.020
And she was like, I was reading. I was like, holy. Like I was so dumb.

151
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.460
She was like, I was such a radical. She was like, I was like, AOC,

152
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:20.420
I satellite AOC. But I'm looking back, back at it now as a grown,

153
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:23.570
grown woman going, what the was I doing? What was I thinking?

154
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.110
I think that's what you're dealing with. A lot of these idealistic kids,

155
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:30.080
they think they're going to tear it all down and burn to the ground,

156
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.960
but they don't know where their their cell phone comes from.

157
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.360
They don't know who makes their sneakers. They don't know what it,

158
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.990
what it costs to keep the electricity on. They have no foot,

159
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.450
they have no shoe in the game.

160
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.070
<v 0>A lot. I mean, but a lot of, a lot of those young people though, I mean, look,</v>

161
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:48.650
what is their life been? And they're graduating from high school.

162
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:51.410
They're graduating from college. They know very well what the,

163
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.140
what the cost is and what the rent is and what it looks like for them in their

164
00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:56.220
life going forward.

165
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.390
And that's exactly why where that hopelessness and nihilism comes from in this.

166
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.060
<v 1>Great video. And I've talked about this before, but I'll say it again,</v>

167
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.380
have a Flint sheriff from Flint, Michigan talking to these people and saying,

168
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.000
look, I'm going to put the Baton down. We're going to,

169
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:10.190
we're going to March with you.

170
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.690
<v 0>The answer is that is the answer as opposed to military cause that, that,</v>

171
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:18.750
and what did that lead to that deescalated escalated that led to less.

172
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.670
<v 1>That's not looting, right? That doesn't stop. Not while there's looting. He's,</v>

173
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.690
he's immediately.

174
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:30.360
<v 0>As a result of that approach rather than crack down, tear gas,</v>

175
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:34.560
rubber bullets, you know, in this contentious us versus them. And the, you know,

176
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.890
in the militarization, all of that, that approach led to.

177
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.361
<v 1>I agree with you,</v>

178
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:44.100
but all that approach that the crackdown tear gas happened after the looting.

179
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.020
That's the, that's the impetus for it.

180
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:48.360
It's not like they saw these people protesting.

181
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:49.380
They were just going to start shooting,

182
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:53.280
tear gas into the first couple of protests, but that's not what we saw in here.

183
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.143
That's all we saw here.

184
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.350
The first people we saw were burning down things in Minneapolis and they allowed

185
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:00.300
that. And as Sandra was talking about like, that's,

186
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.620
that's really where it all took place. Seeing people get away with like that.

187
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.440
It's like, okay, now there's a fire of the mind. And that fire needs to be.

188
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.780
<v 2>I know people understand this in a war context, right? Like three fires.</v>

189
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.240
Like that's why we have very like strong rules of engage.

190
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.260
Like people understand that the way the psychology of taking on this can happen.

191
00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:23.100
And that, that Minneapolis looting that target, it was a beacon.

192
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:26.310
It was a message to any of these shitheads or you're talking about like, Hey,

193
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.000
we can get away with this. And then night after night after night after night,

194
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.820
that's our fifth app. I mean, you saw I'm sure the same videos I did.

195
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.570
You had like organized gangs, like people with car getaway, cars,

196
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.650
lookouts posted on the corner, all that, where are the where's the NYP D?

197
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.180
And that, that is the good, that breakdown is a very precious thing.

198
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:49.020
And this is, you know, on the riots front, I mean, look Baltimore, 2015,

199
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:53.130
they had these level of riots. What happened? Massive economic destruction,

200
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.510
but worse than that is that police and many of the others have took a much more

201
00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:00.180
risk averse approach to the way that they were going to that community.

202
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:03.810
The community is screaming for police pacifically for this reason,

203
00:11:03.811 --> 00:11:07.980
which is that in the aftermath we know from many of these rides from the MLK

204
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:09.360
times and after Baltimore,

205
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.870
it caused massive economic destruction to these cities.

206
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.080
It is not a noble thing to allow this to continue.

207
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:19.410
It's actually your job as a city. I mean, there's a whole movement. I mean,

208
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:20.820
underground. Nobody wants to say this.

209
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.610
A lot of people don't want to live in cities now because of what happened.

210
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.600
First of all, LA I live in an 800 square foot apartment. You don't terrible.

211
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:30.420
This be locked down in an 800 square foot apartment.

212
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.210
And like the only thing you do is like go to the grocery store and you can't go

213
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:37.290
out to eat or do anything. And now I've got like being blown up in the streets,

214
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:39.390
like a couple blocks from my house. Like,

215
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.690
I don't really know if that's the city, life is all that enticing.

216
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.740
<v 1>Crystal out to get your internet from the sky.</v>

217
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.070
<v 2>We're thinking that, which is that, Hey, you know, this.</v>

218
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.980
Am I paying all this rent to live in a soulless box? And then maybe get,

219
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.870
you know, maybe of my get working.
