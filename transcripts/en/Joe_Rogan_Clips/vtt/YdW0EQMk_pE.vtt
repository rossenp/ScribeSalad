00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 1>How does one,</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.000
just in the middle of doing all the things you do decide to just make flame

3
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.710
thrower, or do you have the time for that?

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.470
<v 2>Well, we didn't put a lot of time into the flame thrower.</v>

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.110
This was an off the cuff thing.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.290
So I have sort of a hobby company called the boring company,

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.660
which started out as a joke.

8
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.200
And we decided to make a reel and dig a tunnel under LA.

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.570
And then we have a merchandise section that only has one piece of merchandise at

10
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:31.404
a time.

11
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.090
And we started off with a cap and then I'm big fan of Spaceballs, the movie.

12
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.980
And in Spaceballs,

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.320
yogurt goes through the merchandising section and they have a flame thrower

14
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.630
and the merchandising section and like the kids love that one. That's the line.

15
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.480
When he pulls up the claim, I was like, we should do a flame thrower.

16
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.470
<v 1>Anybody tell you, you know, does anybody go Elan? Um,</v>

17
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.960
maybe for yourself, but selling a flame thrower, the liabilities,

18
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.040
all the people you're selling this device to what kind of unhinged people are

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.020
going to be buying a flame thrower in the first place.

20
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:10.110
Do we really want to connect ourselves to all these potential arsonists?

21
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.570
<v 2>Yeah. It's a terrible idea. Terrible one by one. I don't, I said,</v>

22
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:19.410
don't buy this flame thrower don't to buy it. Don't buy it.

23
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.930
That's what I said a bit. Still people bought it.

24
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.030
There's nothing I can do to stop them. It's stop them. I said, don't buy it.

25
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.810
It's a bad idea. How many did you make your w it's dangerous.

26
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.460
It's got it's wrong. Don't buy it. And still people bought it.

27
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.500
I just couldn't stop them.

28
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.573
<v 1>How many did you make?</v>

29
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.253
<v 2>20,000.</v>

30
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.493
<v 1>And they're all gone.</v>

31
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.450
<v 2>But it sold out in four days.</v>

32
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.730
<v 1>Are you going to do a, another run? No, no, that's it. Yes.</v>

33
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.760
<v 2>We did 50,000 hats and, um, that was a million dollars and he's like, okay,</v>

34
00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:58.800
well we'll sell something for 10 million.

35
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.610
And that was 20,000 flame throwers at $500 each.

36
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.330
They went fast. Boom.

37
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.480
<v 1>Thank you. Thanks for doing this man. Really appreciate it. Hey, welcome.</v>

38
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.790
Thanks for not lighting this place on fire. You're welcome.
