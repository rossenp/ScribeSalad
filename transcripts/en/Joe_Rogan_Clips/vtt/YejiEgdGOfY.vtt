00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So to go back to when you, when we met,</v>

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:06.210
I think I was sober already.

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:09.570
I think it was like newly sober just to circle back to that.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.760
And to anyone wondering when I actually did get sober, sober, sober,

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.410
it wasn't when I was 35. So like eight years ago. And,

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.280
but it was like a long time coming from the,

7
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.590
when I was first in rehab, I was 19.

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.830
And then from 20 to 35,

9
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:33.390
it was like Coke and Molly and weed and drink.

10
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:37.920
And it was, I, I, I lived my life to the fullest,

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.600
but I should probably should have died. I mean, it it's a miracle. I didn't die.

12
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.780
So right before I got sober, I was doing lots of Molly at, um,

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.320
Coachella, which sounds as disgusting as you just heard it,

14
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.350
but wait, it gets grocer. And,

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.180
um, the,

16
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.380
I was probably dehydrated because I don't think I had any water in like two

17
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:05.214
days.

18
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.600
It was like doing Molly during the day and doing blow at night and drinking

19
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:10.411
through the whole thing.

20
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:13.650
And I was really obsessed with this like blueberry red bull that they had,

21
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:16.290
I hate red bull, but I was just drinking it with,

22
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.620
and it was like laced with Molly or whatever. So that was like,

23
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.520
and then we were in VIP. This is why I'm saying it's going to get grosser guys.

24
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:26.640
So bear with me and we're walking.

25
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.620
And I went down, like I just blacked out. I was like,

26
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.310
I looked at my friend and I was like, I am roll.

27
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:36.870
And that's the last thing I remember.

28
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.740
And I just went down like a,

29
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.480
like just a bowling pen and apparently into some Australian

30
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:49.980
checks of all things. And I wake up, come to,

31
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.130
and there's like four cops standing around me and they're like, what day is it?

32
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.360
And I somehow knew it was Sunday. And I mean, you've been to festivals.

33
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:00.840
You have no idea what day it is, even if you're sober or what time it is.

34
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.650
And I knew what time it was. Like my brain got a hard reset. I really,

35
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:08.520
I really think my brain was like, we're shutting it down.

36
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.380
Like we need to reset this

37
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.310
reboot. I came to, I was like freezing called.

38
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.550
And the Australians were like, you have the worst friends,

39
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.570
you have the worst friends, the worst because they were too, they were like,

40
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.831
she'll be fine.

41
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:30.120
And one of my friends is one of my best friends from high school. And she and I,

42
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.040
she was around during the heroin days.

43
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:34.890
And we used to go to raves together and do like speed.

44
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.300
And so we had been through a lot and she was like, ah, she's taking a disco nap.

45
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:40.134
And they were like, Hey.

46
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.940
<v 1>Uh, disco now,</v>

47
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.450
A very funny, a.

48
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.940
<v 0>Disco nap. She's taking a disco nap.</v>

49
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.560
<v 1>That's a good phrase.</v>

50
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.840
<v 0>So I came, I came to luckily, but it was like a bit of a wake up call.</v>

51
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.770
And I wasn't young.

52
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.300
I was like about to be 35 or maybe I already was 35.

53
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:12.280
Like it was a little bit old to be blacking out count going down

54
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:17.260
and VIP like, ah, just so gross. So gross. I mean,

55
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.180
pitiful, demoralization.

56
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.220
<v 1>Fred, since you're taking a disco nap, they're like, gosh, she's fine.</v>

57
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:25.054
Let's keep.

58
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.020
<v 0>And I found a Yankee sat and I put it on and that's when I knew I had to get</v>

59
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:29.854
sober.

60
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.200
<v 1>So where did you go to get, did you go to get sober on, did you do it on your.</v>

61
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.360
<v 0>Yeah, I just, so I had tried everything like every, I mean, I was,</v>

62
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.830
I was the classic, like only drink, only drink booze only drink alone,

63
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:48.190
only drink with friends. Only some I did the whole like marijuana maintenance,

64
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:52.780
only smoke weed. I got certified in yoga, become a yoga instructor.

65
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.460
I went to therapy,

66
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.470
literally anything other than 12 step because I had been in

67
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.260
12 step when I was 1920 that first time.

68
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.480
And I hated it because I couldn't drink at all and I couldn't

69
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:11.320
do anything. And I just, I came up with a big, you know, I,

70
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.830
I came up with a big case against 12 step. I was like,

71
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.280
it's fear-based and blah, blah, blah. And all the God stuff.

72
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.290
And I was off and running and I was out my first husband

73
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:25.840
and I were raging alcoholics were in the restaurant and just,

74
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:28.540
I was in the restaurant industry for a long time in my life.

75
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.040
That industry is riddled with alcoholism and drugs and partying.

76
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.230
And so I was just around it too all the time. And then,

77
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.390
um, around 35, after that Coachella, that summer,

78
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.390
I had just gotten back from traveling around the world for like two years.

79
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.130
I was very lost. I was in LA and I didn't know what I was doing anymore.

80
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.290
I felt confused. I went back east, worked in a restaurant where I had been,

81
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.680
and it was like this whole, I fell immediately into the rut.

82
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.540
I was like sleeping with the same I slept with when I'd been there like seven

83
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:09.490
years before having doing tons of drugs, burning bridges with my family.

84
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.170
And I was coming back to LA after just my sister wouldn't let me stay with her

85
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.460
and rightfully, and I was a mess and I was coming back and I was like,

86
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:21.400
I'm going to cop heroin and kill myself. Basically.

87
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.730
I was just so internally,

88
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.170
it was not necessarily like many of my rock bottoms were actually

89
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:32.230
physical or my first one, I lost everything.

90
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.450
This was more emotional. And um, yeah, I was,

91
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.230
uh, I went for a hike. I went up to like Temescal because I was like, well,

92
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:45.010
before I cop heroin, I should maybe pause and go for a hike.

93
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:48.430
And sometime on that hike, I decided to go to a meeting that night.

94
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.420
Cause I'd done an experimental year of sobriety in like 2010. What.

95
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.530
<v 1>Was it about the hike that.</v>

96
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.830
<v 0>I was sweating? Am I, I was like sweating out. I was just toxic.</v>

97
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:59.660
I could feel how toxic I was.

98
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:03.470
I could smell how toxic I was and oh,

99
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.090
like chemicals and blow and probably like baby powder,

100
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.110
you know, like everything just booze. And then,

101
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.000
and I had been smoking a lot of weed to try and chemically balance all of it.

102
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:21.320
And I ended up getting to the top and something. It was like,

103
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:23.990
they call it like, it was like a window of grade. I don't know.

104
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:28.100
It was like one small window of willingness. I don't, I don't know.

105
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.200
Yeah. It was like,

106
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.460
there they say there are these kind of like opportunities where you can walk

107
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:39.140
through a like door of willingness if you're you're really at

108
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.970
rock bottom and trying to get,

109
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:44.930
and I made I've joked about this before I made alcoholism look amazing. Like I,

110
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.060
I had a lot of fun. I was, I was killed. I was like,

111
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.450
oh, from the outside it looked okay. It was just internally.

112
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:58.040
I felt like I was rotting to the core and I also couldn't really get out of my

113
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.820
own way. And so I went to a meeting and I didn't even,

114
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.110
I wasn't like I'm getting sober. I just didn't know what else to do.

115
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.940
And I was miserable. I mean,

116
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:11.690
I was miserable the first two years of my sobriety,

117
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.350
but it was better than feeling like I wanted to kill myself.

118
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.450
And so I just kept walking through it and doing what they told me

119
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:22.040
to do. They're like get a stupid job.

120
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.930
So I was waiting tables and like to get a stupid job. They're just, you know,

121
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:30.740
a lot of times you have this kind of idea of being a big shot or not that I did

122
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:34.160
at all. I was still waiting tables and like broke all the time,

123
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:37.940
but it's really just this idea of like being a worker among workers,

124
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.230
like put yourself in a,

125
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:44.270
get a day job so you can pay your bills and not be dependent and struggling

126
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.490
and put yourself in a cause. Sometimes it's like people who come from, you know,

127
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:50.870
finance or whatever though,

128
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.840
they were big shots and then they kind of lose everything. So then they.

129
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.880
<v 1>Tell them to get a job. Everybody needs.</v>

130
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.440
<v 0>Well. Yeah. And just for,</v>

131
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.090
just for consistency and to be responsible and to have to show up.

132
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:03.500
And I mean,

133
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:08.240
I really realized I started drinking when I was 12 and pretty

134
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.160
alcoholically by the time I was 15 and I

135
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.090
12. Yeah. I was young. I mean, nobody was paying attention, you know,

136
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:22.310
and my parents got divorced right around that age. And um,

137
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.360
yeah, I started,

138
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.380
I said it was off to the races and then it was just by the time I was 19,

139
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.030
I was in, it was,

140
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.980
it made a lot of sense and I was in rehab for heroin and then

141
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.580
got off that. But that kind of not being, I use that as an excuse to be like,

142
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.130
oh, I'm not an addict because I'm not doing heroin anymore.

143
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.080
So I use that to stay out for a long time as an excuse of like, well,

144
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.050
as long as I'm not doing heroin, because anyone will get addicted to that.

145
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.550
And so, yeah, I mean, it was a long, long journey to sobriety.

146
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:00.690
And then I, I was very miserable in somehow. And then round two years,

147
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:04.920
like the rubber just started meeting the road. I got my first column at Playboy.

148
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:09.240
I sold my first, um, freelance writing piece.

149
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.610
I started doing,

150
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:14.790
you have so much energy when you get sober for somebody like me,

151
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:16.080
who is wasting a lot of it,

152
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:21.030
just drinking and partying that I just had to do a lot of different things.

153
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:21.900
And I'll,

154
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.310
I couldn't really deny that my quality of life improving

155
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.120
drastically and starting to do things that I had always wanted to do,

156
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:31.680
like be a paid writer.

157
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.850
It didn't seem like an accident that it was a couple of years after I had been

158
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:37.800
sober that these things started happening.

159
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.840
<v 1>And so while it was happening, did you follow any protocol? Did you like,</v>

160
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.480
did you follow any advice from books?

161
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.230
<v 0>I was in 12 step, like full on and in.</v>

162
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.290
<v 1>What, what didn't you like about that? What didn't you like about the.</v>

163
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.620
<v 0>12 Steps? When I first left the 12 steps or just when I was in,</v>

164
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.600
um, well, I have, you know,

165
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:05.340
I had a lot of reason to think that abstinence isn't the only way which they

166
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:07.620
found isn't for everybody. Uh,

167
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:11.130
it is for me because there's no middle ground with subs.

168
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.320
I started smoking cigarettes and sobriety.

169
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:17.010
This is a perfect example of how there's no mid ground.

170
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.380
And I was so mad cause I quit everything.

171
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:24.660
And I started smoking cigarettes in 2015 and

172
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.810
I was, I had one cigarette at a meeting and I was like, all right,

173
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.710
I'll have a cigarette.

174
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:33.390
And then I was after the racist smoking pack a day within like weeks.

175
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.530
I'm like, if this is any example of what I'll be like with booze or anything,

176
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:41.790
I just know there's no, I do not. Some people can be moderate.

177
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.450
They have that ability and I envy the.
