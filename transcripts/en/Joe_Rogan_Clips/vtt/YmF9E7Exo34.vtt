00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.080
<v 2>Were you surprised that they decided to have a loose Mon and a MOSFET all to.</v>

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.700
<v 1>I'm surprised? No. Cause I know, like I said, it's about money, right.</v>

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.310
Putting asses in and see. And um,

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.970
I think if the fight tonight at 10 times,

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.170
I think it was probably nine probably. Um,

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.360
it's a good entertaining fight for the fans, but Mahershala is, is uh,

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.560
yeah, one of them fights. Right? It's like it,

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.260
wasn't just going to go out days and Crow grappling again, probably. Um.

10
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.100
<v 0>I want to see what, what Mazda doll can do with the camp, you know,</v>

11
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.210
because clearly he wasn't prepared physically. You know what I mean?

12
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.540
He's take a fight on six days. Notice there's no way you can really be prepared.

13
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.720
<v 1>Yeah. He was training was you had like wrestling coaches.</v>

14
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.610
Like I remember watching him, um, it was, it was like getting good,

15
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:55.020
good, real good training. And you know,

16
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:59.160
we weren't like sitting in a couch for the last like six months in tech six days

17
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.360
and.

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.580
<v 0>Right. But you know, as well as I know,</v>

19
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:06.180
there's a difference between just training and then preparing for a fight.

20
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.043
Right.

21
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.850
<v 1>Um, what do you think you'd be at? So.</v>

22
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.350
<v 0>No, I'm not saying that,</v>

23
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.310
but what I am saying is there were some very interesting moments in that fight

24
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.640
where he was out striking. Yeah. But you know,

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.370
Camara was just so strong. It's such a good Russian.

26
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.170
<v 1>Durable and finger dropped him. Um, Bernal dropped him the other day. So, um,</v>

27
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.470
it'd be a good fight, but watching it for sure. You know, but, um,

28
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.380
I think if I had to put money on it, I'll probably go, um,

29
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.780
it wasn't done for the, for the wind again.

30
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.780
<v 0>Well, once he, once a guy beats a guy, he's,</v>

31
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.330
you're always going to be the favorite to fight again, but it's just,

32
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.560
it's just a, it's an interesting fight. I just, I'm very,

33
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.210
I'm excited to see how Mazda perfect games with a camp. No.

34
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.310
<v 1>It'd be good. It'd be good. I'd love to see as well,</v>

35
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.030
but I can't see what it could do different, you know, he's in, come out again,

36
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.200
be weighed.

37
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:59.280
What he does is in swing single thing for the fences and try knock him out.

38
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.640
It wasn't going to, um, high garden just grappling.

39
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:06.180
And I was going to see why he does different unless he catches him and knock him

40
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:09.330
out. It was kind of see, um, what he does.

41
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.850
<v 0>When, uh, you and Mazda dog got out it at that post-fight press conference.</v>

42
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.430
Like, did you expect that a fight was going to come after that?

43
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:18.480
That you would eventually.

44
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.040
<v 1>Yeah, for sure for, okay. Next that's the next fight right? Straight away.</v>

45
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:26.400
And to have it like now for about two years, two for two and a half years,

46
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.440
it's like, what's the name for it yet?

47
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.760
I've been calling them out ever since IDRC wants it. Um,

48
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.850
but you just keep turning it down and he said, uh, no, I don't want to fight.

49
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.530
<v 0>That's the weird thing. It's like, you're at an elite level,</v>

50
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.350
the top of the food chain in terms of your skill level.

51
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.630
But you're not as known as you should be with the skill level that you have.

52
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:51.390
It's just, I mean, it's like, it's w it's like,

53
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.150
you're the best kept secret in the division. It's weird.

54
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.830
<v 1>It's a weird thing, but.</v>

55
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.540
<v 0>It'll change.</v>

56
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.070
<v 1>It's going to change a hundred percent. It's coming. Like you feel it it's,</v>

57
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.950
it's changing, you know, slowly, but I think number,

58
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.550
number one should fight number two, right? Number two, number fridges,

59
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.860
front number four. And that's the way it should be. But it's like,

60
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.440
I'd have to go to like number 13 to five,

61
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.430
but I'd have to go to five hands that cause all these guys like Dave is right.

62
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:19.180
There was demanding like Colby, for example, is demanding tower shots.

63
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.530
Like just got beat like one fight ago. Um, and got knocked out one fire go,

64
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:24.280
right?

65
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.570
<v 0>No, he beat Tyron after.</v>

66
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.860
<v 1>That. Yeah. So yeah. So Tyrone then beat Tyrone and um,</v>

67
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.450
in fourth sentence, right? So far.

68
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.150
<v 0>He was mine. Then he beat it was just tiring. Right? That's one.</v>

69
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.290
<v 1>Fight, right? I think.</v>

70
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.360
<v 0>So. I think it was just a Woodley fight.</v>

71
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.670
<v 1>Yeah, sure. It was.</v>

72
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.103
<v 0>Pretty sure.</v>

73
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.690
<v 1>I don't, I don't think you deserve a title shot.</v>

74
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.360
He just got beat like convincingly. You weren't like a,

75
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.510
it was a close fight to be fair, but he did get stopped, you know?

76
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:51.940
So I don't think she got in touch with us straight away.

77
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.130
<v 0>Um, so that's a fight. You would like call.</v>

78
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.510
<v 1>Fight now. Yeah, for sure. A hundred percent. Um, I would say,</v>

79
00:03:58.511 --> 00:03:59.980
I want you to Tyler shot would not define.

80
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.760
<v 0>Um,</v>

81
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.050
the only reason why I would say it'd be better for you to fight someone before

82
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.460
the title shot is just to get the hype out so that when the pay-per-view gets

83
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:11.620
built up so that you'll get more money. Yeah.

84
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.210
<v 1>Yeah. No, for sure. I want me to sit around and wait for the Arbor. Fine.</v>

85
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.020
You know, so we're trying to, we're trying to get it. And um, Kobe is a weird,

86
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.760
weird one, so we don't know what's going to happen,

87
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:22.780
but we're trying to get a fight done.

88
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.591
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:26.980
Well the one thing that does come with Colby is a lot of attention and that's,

90
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.840
that's the good, the good part of it.

91
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.290
<v 1>It's a, it's a, it's a good fight technically, you know? Um, I think,</v>

92
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.660
oh I think the top or the guard though,

93
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.530
all similar right in skillset and what they're going to do when they fight me

94
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:39.364
right now,

95
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.050
you're going to come to wrestle if a fight wasn't going to come to rest the

96
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.520
Colbys and to come to wrestle. Um, but I wasn't coming to country wrestled on,

97
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.470
I know what they're going to do. You know what I says,

98
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.100
it's easier to prepare for them. You can. Um, I was saying before,

99
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.590
we kind of like swap them out. So when, when the hands that fell out,

100
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.220
it was okay to put anyone in. Cause it's all, all do the same thing anyway.

101
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.560
So this pop another one in and uh, that's, that's what it was so normal.

102
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.370
<v 0>They're all gonna try to grab.</v>

103
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.740
<v 1>And then try to grab. That means nothing to me.</v>

104
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.840
I've I've I feel good when it really grappling.

105
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:13.990
I feel good with the striking and um, I just can't wait to show,

106
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.870
show my skill set and show what I'm about.

107
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:20.590
I haven't done a code yet in a game, but I want to show it in.

108
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:21.424
I'm going to show it.
