00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.000
<v 2>Another thing in once upon a time in Hollywood that got controversial was the</v>

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.930
Bruce Lee scenes. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people felt like you,

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.640
you made Bruce Lee into an.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.250
<v 1>Yeah. Well, okay. That's again, I'm a little hesitant to talk about this.</v>

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.300
Cause I don't want this to be the only thing that people pull from from this

7
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:23.700
show, but I figured you were going to bring it up, especially,

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.000
cause I've heard you guys go back and forth on it a little bit. I mean,

9
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.380
where I'm coming from is

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.940
I can understand his daughter having a problem with it.

11
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:40.710
It's her father. All right. I get that. But anybody else? Oh, suck a Dick.

12
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.680
You know, and the thing about it though, is, you know, like, you know,

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.020
even if you just look at it, it's obvious cliff, cliff tricked him.

14
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.510
That's how he is able to do it. He tricked him, you know, it's like, it's,

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.860
it's, it's explained more in the book, but the thing is like they, they do,

16
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.870
they do, uh, uh, three fall, uh, two falls out of three contests.

17
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.960
So cliff loves like that, you know? Uh,

18
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.980
and he has a method and his method is to give the guy the first fall.

19
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.590
Okay. Do your move, dude. Right? Let me see your move. All right.

20
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:29.400
And he gives them no resistance whatsoever. The guy does the move.

21
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.150
You knocked him on his and cliff. And then there's,

22
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.040
there's like four different ways.

23
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:39.510
Bruce could've come at him the second time that cliff would have had very little

24
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:44.100
defense against. But most of the time,

25
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.870
if, if a guy has a particular move and it looks like the guy's a lung kid,

26
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:52.860
just a big mouth who can't really defend himself, they do the second move again.

27
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.730
I mean, did they do the first move again? Second time? Well,

28
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:01.410
now cliff knows what it is. So we prepare us for it. He pivots, he catches him.

29
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.260
He throws his into the car. Right. You know?

30
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:06.480
And now the third time will be the charming. It gets broken up,

31
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.240
but he just tricked him. And Bruce realized he got tricked.

32
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.230
If it hadn't been so vicious, he could have even appreciated. Do you know about.

33
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.190
<v 0>The history of oh.</v>

34
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.040
<v 1>Yeah. Jane Jean LaBelle. Yeah, of course. Did you research that?</v>

35
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.280
I've always known it and everything and like,

36
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:24.420
well the stuntman hated Bruce really on, on, uh, on, uh, on, uh, green Hornet.

37
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.150
No, it's in the, it's a Matthew Polly's book. And before that,

38
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.170
I it's always been known. That's why Jean LaBelle was brought on the teach,

39
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.410
Bruce respect for American stem and Bruce had nothing but disrespect for

40
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.180
stuntman. And he was always hitting them.

41
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.060
He was always hitting them with this feat. He was always tagging.

42
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.870
It's called tagging. Uh, when you, when you hit a stunt man for real,

43
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.620
and he was always tagging them with his feet and he was always tagging him with

44
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:49.290
his fist and they, and they, and they got to be the point where like, no,

45
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.280
I refuse to work with him.

46
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.580
And he had nothing but disrespect for American stuntman.

47
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.290
<v 0>Huh? That's interesting. I wonder what that was about.</v>

48
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.660
I wonder what his perspective would have been.

49
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.880
If somebody asked him to explain it.

50
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.180
<v 1>Uh, it's like a bow. They're just not good enough. They're they're.</v>

51
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.150
Mm I'm going to make it look real.

52
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.860
<v 0>Okay. So he was hitting them to make it look real. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

53
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.030
But they don't like that.

54
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.100
<v 1>No, that's unprofessional.</v>

55
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.330
<v 0>Well, that is unprofessional.</v>

56
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.930
But that's been done before in a bunch of movies by people that people say are.

57
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.100
Yeah.

58
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.820
<v 1>Yeah. And well, yeah. And, and, um, you know,</v>

59
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:32.560
and actually somebody else who had a reputation pretty similar to Bruce Lee's in

60
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:35.860
that regards was like Robert Conrad. Oh yeah. During that time. Yeah.

61
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.890
And you know, he did a lot of his own stunts and he did some really,

62
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.580
really gnarly. But if you, and I'm always been a big fan of Robert Conrad,

63
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.620
but you know, in the stunt community,

64
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.540
he was known as Robert never met a stuntman. He couldn't blame Conrad. Mm.

65
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.490
<v 0>The stunt world is a crazy world because they're the people that occasionally</v>

66
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:57.730
die making movies. Yeah, absolutely. Which is just nuts.

67
00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.830
<v 1>The thing about it is also</v>

68
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.380
cliff is a hand to hand combat killer.

69
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.900
He, you know, he fought in world war II. He fought with the, uh,

70
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.360
Filipino resistant fighters, you know, uh,

71
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.460
in the Philippines against the Japanese.

72
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.180
If cliff fought Bruce Lee at one of Aaron Banks's Madison

73
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:23.980
square garden tournaments,

74
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.450
cliff wouldn't stand a chance against Bruce Lee at a Madison square garden,

75
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.460
martial arts tournament. But in as like killer,

76
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.410
who has killed men before in a jungle, he'd kill Bruce Lee.

77
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.750
He kill him, Bruce. Lee's not a killer Bruce.

78
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.610
Lee's never really let loose on anybody.

79
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:49.780
He's always had to keep it together in a martial arts tournament. Kind of,

80
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.280
kind of kind of way. If he's actually facing a guy who could actually kill him,

81
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.050
that's a different story. You know, it's, it's, it's in the book.

82
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:03.150
Bruce Lee realizes when cliff takes a hand-to-hand, uh,

83
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:06.940
a military hand-to-hand combat stance, you know, he realized, oh,

84
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.600
this guy's a killer. This guy's not fighting me.

85
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:12.850
He's fighting his instinct to kill me.
