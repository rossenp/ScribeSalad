00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.600
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Dude, virtual. We can give each other real knuckles.</v>

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.560
Come on, do that one.

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.760
<v 1>There we go. &lt;laugh&gt; I'm not, I'm not like I'm not crazy. I'm not, I'm not,</v>

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.760
I'm not like a paranoid person, but I'll tell you, Joe,

5
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.920
you got me to leave my house for the first time in five weeks.

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.120
<v 0>I'm so happy you left. And I'm so happy you got tested.</v>

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.710
<v 1>Yeah. The first time in five weeks that I've left the house and you, yeah,</v>

8
00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:23.990
I got tested and I'm, and everything's great. So, but I'm not like, you know,

9
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:24.750
paranoid or anything.

10
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.270
<v 0>Like that. It's just spray it down, baby. Yeah. Just how,</v>

11
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.750
how bad is all this Lysol for us? This stuff is pretty good.

12
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:32.790
This is a real question, right? How bad is all this Lysol? Yeah. Yeah.

13
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:33.624
It'll be fun.

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.990
<v 1>AOL's probably not bad, but no. Great to be here. Thank you. My pleasure. And,</v>

15
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.180
uh, man, what? I haven't, I haven't left my head in five weeks. Uh,

16
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.220
I've been isolating as a responsible citizen, right? Yes. Yeah.

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.260
And, uh, I, I feel good. I feel, first of all, I'm excited to be here. I, uh,

18
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.220
I'm excited to have you here. I posted that I was,

19
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.820
I've been going through my computers. I'm at home.

20
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.460
I'm going through my computers and just killing time. I live alone. Okay.

21
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.770
I happen to be single at this point in my life, ladies, there you go,

22
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.050
huh. Right, right. &lt;laugh&gt; right before this happened. Uh,

23
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.170
and I kind of think to myself sometimes I think, okay.

24
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.170
Imagine if I had been in a relationship that hadn't been going well,

25
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.303
and this happened,

26
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.250
and then you have to make the decision to isolate with somebody I'm not in that

27
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:22.520
situation. I'm home alone.

28
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.960
And I've been talking a lot to my friends on FaceTime and

29
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:32.680
I've been socializing and I've been, you know, living life in this world,

30
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.960
but alone in my house,

31
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.160
I'm going through my computers started going through old footage.

32
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.470
I found that clip from when you came up to my house back in the day. And uh,

33
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.550
yeah, I just, I, I, I,

34
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.950
I saw this moment where I just I'll jump right into this if that's cool. Sure.

35
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:50.590
Because this,

36
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.870
I saw this moment in the clip where we started talking about my old web show and

37
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:56.230
you'd come up to my house back in the day.

38
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.070
And it was so cool that you came up then,

39
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.990
and I remember at the time your website was like way advanced. Right?

40
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.261
Right.

41
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:07.580
Like it had all sorts of extra stuff on it that people weren't really doing on

42
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:10.180
the web back then. And you came up and we just started talking about the web.

43
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.300
And, um, that was.

44
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.060
<v 0>Because of my web master. Andrew Blevin shout out to Andrew Uhhuh. He's a,</v>

45
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.973
a wizard at.

46
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.340
<v 1>Web creating. So I was always really into the web stuff. You know,</v>

47
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.010
I had my website, I started my website early when I was, you know, in Canada.

48
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.450
And I was really thought that was cool.

49
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.410
And we started talking about what I was doing, which was kind of crazy. Right.

50
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.970
And then you just started talking about, you said, you said, uh,

51
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.393
what, what,

52
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.410
what we gotta do is figure out how we're gonna make some money off this.

53
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.890
And I'm like, yeah. Yeah. And I'm like going, yeah. I mean, I'd been trying,

54
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.480
I had been trying, I'd been going to, you know, advertisers and saying,

55
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:51.160
they were like, what, you know, what, what do you mean internet? You know? But,

56
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.080
uh, it's kind of funny. I saw that clip and I thought,

57
00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:57.640
that's hilarious cuz you know, not to, not to, you know,

58
00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.040
blow too much smoke up your,

59
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.120
but clearly you figured out how to make money off of it. And it was hilarious.

60
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.800
I'm like, that's hilarious and prophetic moment.

61
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.400
How can we make money off of it? Now we're here in this beautiful studio,

62
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.683
incredible.

63
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.520
<v 0>A few moments that, uh,</v>

64
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.720
really planted a seed in my head to do something like this online,

65
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.720
this yours was a big one. Yeah.

66
00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:17.920
Being at your house and seeing how you had servers.

67
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:20.470
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; &lt;affirmative&gt; you had full cables like folks mm-hmm

68
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.470
&lt;affirmative&gt; mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; this room is not as sophisticated as Tom

69
00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:27.790
Green's home was in 2007. That's how crazy it was. There.

70
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.590
<v 1>Was some weird stuff in there. Yeah. But you.</v>

71
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.870
<v 0>Had it set up like an,</v>

72
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.390
you had a whole internet service provider set up at your house.

73
00:03:35.391 --> 00:03:39.460
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, like you could have run like a network in 2007,

74
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.220
you had all those, you had that whole rack with all that equipment.

75
00:03:43.221 --> 00:03:46.860
I walked into that room and it's humming and I'm like, holy, dude. Uhhuh those.

76
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.620
<v 1>The grate drives. Yeah. The grate drives. Yeah. I.</v>

77
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.700
<v 0>Was like, this is crazy. This is your house.</v>

78
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.100
And like folks like back then you had to have these cables that snaked through

79
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.370
the house. Like, so everything was taped was like, dude,

80
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.890
this is like you've you literally turned your house into a set mm-hmm

81
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.211
&lt;affirmative&gt; like,

82
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.650
it was much more like a set than anything I'd ever seen before.

83
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:08.930
Outside of a set. It.

84
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.610
<v 1>Were lights screwed into the ceiling. Yeah. I kind of trashed my place. You.</v>

85
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.290
<v 0>Even figured out how to take video calls from people.</v>

86
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.560
<v 1>That was exciting. Crazy. That was exciting. I had this, this you, there.</v>

87
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.340
<v 0>It is.</v>

88
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.160
<v 1>Tom green. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then the TV on the wall. Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.200
And there's my dog. Steve I'll pour Steve. Oh, and look, I have, uh,

90
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.920
don't have gray in my beard. Oh, look at that. Um.

91
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.960
<v 0>Yeah. Young man.</v>

92
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.720
<v 1>Back then, this was probably around 2007, I guess. Yeah.</v>

93
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.200
And that's that was the back corner. My living room there. So Jean,

94
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.120
you can see all the wires going up. See that that's going up into the ceiling,

95
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.550
up through the ceiling, into the spare room,

96
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:44.550
which I turned into the editing room. Look.

97
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.510
<v 0>How crazy all this equipment is it, dude, dude, you were so ahead of everybody.</v>

98
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.350
<v 1>That's actually a little later actually. I'm looking at this now. This is later.</v>

99
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.470
This is after. Uh, cause I can tell cuz that's an actual,

100
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.030
that's not the TriCaster. That's an actual television switcher.

101
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.790
I forget what model it's a Sony switcher. So you.

102
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.620
<v 0>Started with a TriCaster and a, there was a thing called a.</v>

103
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.620
<v 1>Video toaster system. First I had that for a year. Then we got this,</v>

104
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.220
the first version of the trier. That's Victor who was, uh, working on the show.

105
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.220
He's he's stoked that I'm here today. I still talk to Victor quite a bit.

106
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:15.860
Shout out to Victor, Victor what's up. But um, so yeah,

107
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.900
so that was a little later. Um, but uh, still kind of, uh, you know,

108
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.170
we're talking three years later or something. So 2010.

109
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.050
<v 0>Ish. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Look at all your, like your lighting and everything.</v>

110
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.490
Like you had done it where you had basically instead of like putting cameras in

111
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:32.810
your house mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you would turn your house into a studio.

112
00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:35.570
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it was like legit mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I remember thinking,

113
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.463
oh my God,

114
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.650
cuz Anthony kuia had a kind of a pretty high tech uh, setup in his basement.

115
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.600
Yeah. Was another inspiration. Yeah. Yeah,

116
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.120
because he was doing that while he was doing Anthony and you know,

117
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.480
they actually, his employers at the time wanted him to stop doing it.

118
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:53.160
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they had decided somehow or another,

119
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.320
it it's not, he shouldn't be allowed to do an extra show. Right. And he's like,

120
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:59.440
but I'm just promoting this serious show. Right? Like this is free.

121
00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:02.520
Like people could see it. It's fun. So Anthony would, uh,

122
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.200
do karaoke with machine guns in front of green screens, Uhhuh &lt;laugh&gt;.

123
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.400
<v 1>And he's still, she's still kicking on the intern. Yeah. Yes. Well.</v>

124
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.000
<v 0>Now he has his own. He has his own network. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.</v>

125
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.903
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

126
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.590
<v 0>I love that guy. He's a, he's a unique dude. He, he was great on Anthony.</v>

127
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.070
He was always really funny and just like, like a comic,

128
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.510
but he never did standup. Yeah. It's really interesting.

129
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.710
He's like the most comicy comic guy that I've ever met that never did standup

130
00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:30.590
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is Anthony Kuya a hundred percent.

131
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:32.030
Could have been a great comic. A hundred percent.

132
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.870
<v 1>I think sometimes people that, I mean, I'm just making this up right now,</v>

133
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.300
but I think sometimes people that have never done standup who do radio are

134
00:06:40.301 --> 00:06:43.540
afraid of it, you know? Cuz it's like, cuz they can, they can,

135
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.540
it's a scary thing getting on stage, you know,

136
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.940
it's in front of an audience if you've never done it before,

137
00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:51.460
but you get comfortable behind that. I'm like, but anyways, yeah man,

138
00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:53.380
it was so cool when you came up because I remember like,

139
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.900
I think there was like entertainment tonight was there that day or something

140
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:59.770
like that, that, and you talked with them after that's right. That's right.

141
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.650
And you left this, made this quote to them and that went out and it was

142
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.170
defining what's happened in our work. You were just saying, you know,

143
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:12.570
like we don't need the advertisers. We don't need the networks anymore.

144
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.490
We don't, you know, we can go straight to the advertiser. I.

145
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.050
<v 0>Always is that video available.</v>

146
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.400
<v 1>Anywhere? I, I think I saw it on the internet. Some that, that, that.</v>

147
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.440
<v 0>Video of me saying that is kind of hilarious.</v>

148
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.000
If you stop and think about how all this internet stuff has played out since

149
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:28.720
then mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's like street, there was this pre YouTube, right?

150
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:30.520
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like nobody was uploading to YouTube.

151
00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:33.640
You had to have your own Tom green.com set up. So I.

152
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.360
<v 1>Remember I got a call. This is one of those, like, you know,</v>

153
00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:39.630
when you think about, think back, can you sort of kick yourself?

154
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.070
I'm I'm you know, I was, it was so,

155
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.470
I mean, how far into the weeds do we want to get? Technically I was it's like,

156
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:51.710
people are like, who give a? Oh, there it is right there. But here I was, I,

157
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:52.910
I had the surf that's the.

158
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.830
<v 0>Clip. Yeah. That was my backwards baseball hat days. So we.</v>

159
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.620
<v 1>Jimmy still in those days we were hosting this stuff on this site called bit</v>

160
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:03.700
gravity.com. Ah, so we would upload our to that. Were.

161
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.533
<v 0>Those, the guys from Denver.</v>

162
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.260
<v 1>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh, no, uh, bit gravity is San Francisco. Yeah. Okay.</v>

163
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.700
San Francisco and uh, Barrett lion is.

164
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.020
<v 0>Did you do some stuff with some guys from Denver that.</v>

165
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.860
<v 1>Was, that was sort of around the same time they were, that was mania TV.</v>

166
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.370
Right, right, right. And so they kind of, but what I, what, what I did

167
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.050
was mania TV was the only people that were really doing live streaming.

168
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.250
And I said, Hey, you know,

169
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.370
like I wanna build this TV studio and they helped me build the studio, but I, I,

170
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.210
I wanted it. I wanted to be autonomous of them as well. Right.

171
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:41.240
So I got my own servers through company, company bit gravity,

172
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.240
where they basically invented the technology to upload video and then serve

173
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:49.520
it out. Right. So I would link that to my website, Tom green.com

174
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:55.280
completely autonomous of the other website, mania TV. So,

175
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.600
you know, it was some there funny that happened there because you know, I, I,

176
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.480
I remember like I think back I go, I really made a few mistakes.

177
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.680
&lt;laugh&gt; you know, like I go, I go, I want all the stuff to be on my website.

178
00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:12.400
Right. And then YouTube started, oh, what's this? Oh YouTube. Oh, that's cool.

179
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.310
They're they're doing a thing out of an apartment in San Francisco on I remember

180
00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:17.870
at one point somebody called me from YouTube and said, Hey man,

181
00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:20.710
we really like what you're doing with your thing. I'm like, oh, that's cool.

182
00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:24.630
Cool man. Yeah. Yeah. I'm kind of doing my own thing over here, you know? Yeah.

183
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:25.070
That's cool.

184
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.590
I like what you're doing too and never really kind of connected with them cuz I

185
00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:34.270
thought I was thinking at the time it's gotta all be on your server. Right.

186
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.380
So you have, have those views, not thinking, okay, we could have it out,

187
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.020
spread it, send it out, just get the eyeballs on it. So, but it was,

188
00:09:41.021 --> 00:09:43.220
it was exciting. It was exciting time. Everybody.

189
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.820
<v 0>Thought that though. I mean, no one could have ever saw what YouTube had been.</v>

190
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.980
Yeah. Or, or has become. Yeah.

191
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.580
It's what's crazy about YouTube is that there's not another one.

192
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:51.780
There's just YouTube.

193
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.890
It's like there's Vimeo and a few other fairly pot video sites. Yeah.

194
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.370
But it's like the XFL compared to the NFL or something like that. Yeah.

195
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.730
Not even the XFL is done. Right. Do they just go under yeah. Done.

196
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.250
Now it's like comparing the two of them because all those other video things

197
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.730
it's like, yeah, you'll get some views, but it's just YouTube.

198
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.570
For whatever reason captured. They, they have.

199
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.320
<v 1>The market. It never became my space. You know? I'm imagine.</v>

200
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.320
Well remember YouTube. Yeah. Something as.

201
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.080
<v 0>Simple as uploading video. Yeah. I mean, obviously it's complex, right?</v>

202
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.040
Like just the being able to get it onto the website and make sure it streams and

203
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.800
all the technical stuff super complex. But just the concept is pretty simple.

204
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.360
You with your phone or video camera, you, you film it,

205
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.030
you can upload it like real simple. Any anybody can do it. And then anybody,

206
00:10:38.031 --> 00:10:40.950
all of a sudden can get views. Like that is amazing.

207
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.430
That one company has that locked up. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's kind of crazy.

208
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.310
Cuz you would think that like, boy,

209
00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:48.510
that would be something that everybody would want to get involved in.

210
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.230
Look how much money YouTube is making.

211
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.190
<v 1>Yeah. I would, I would, I would thought about that,</v>

212
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.150
but I guess kind of nuts the amount of,

213
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:01.660
of &lt;affirmative&gt; advancement that happens every six months in, in technology.

214
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:01.861
Yeah.

215
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:05.060
And they've got the funding to be able to stay right on top of it and just make

216
00:11:05.061 --> 00:11:07.620
it the strongest platform possibly. I don't know. I don't know. Well,

217
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:08.454
even Twitter.

218
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.420
<v 0>Like how'd they do that? There's like one Twitter. Yeah.</v>

219
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.540
I mean there's Facebook mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I guess people hold discussions

220
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:17.500
on Instagram. But if I read what do I,

221
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.250
of the things that drives me crazy about Instagram is like,

222
00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:22.250
if I go to your page and I'm reading one of your, uh, captions,

223
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.730
someone will say something in response to someone they're like, Hey you,

224
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:27.730
Dick boy or whatever.

225
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.490
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then I try to click and find out what they were talking

226
00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:31.830
about.

227
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.490
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I get to the beginning of the comments and then I gotta

228
00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:38.560
go through all the comments to try to figure this out. Like,

229
00:11:38.561 --> 00:11:39.680
why can't I just click.
