00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know what? Okay. So.</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.660
<v 1>One of the things I do, you know how you have like the junk, the, the,</v>

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.790
the junkie folder. Yes.

4
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:13.680
So to remind myself of how blind I might be and how I could,

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.470
like how I need to change my mind. Right. I, I talk about this with my students,

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.510
but I keep it with son. I actually have a con I have a, this touchy,

7
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:23.190
I have a Confederate monument in my wallet right here.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.090
So I keep, I don't know if you know, so the Confederate $2 bill.

9
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.650
<v 2>Oh, wow. That's a real Confederate too. Yeah. That's.</v>

10
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.620
<v 1>A Confederate $2 bill and that guy on it right there.</v>

11
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.970
That's Judah Benjamin that he's the, he's the only Jew.

12
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.130
Whoever made it onto American currency.

13
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:46.700
If you want to call it and it's Confederate money. Confederate money. Yeah.

14
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.150
Go for.

15
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.010
<v 2>It. What year is this from? Uh.</v>

16
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.100
<v 1>Sometime let's see. What does it say on there?</v>

17
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:55.880
I don't remember the exact year on the bill. This is weird, man. It's paper.

18
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.870
Yes. Paper. But I.

19
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.810
<v 2>Mean, it's like really flimsy paper. I would think you'd want to like,</v>

20
00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:00.890
keep this under glass.

21
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.260
<v 1>Or something. No, it's not. I mean, they're not like super valuable.</v>

22
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.180
It's not no, but.

23
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.240
<v 2>Historically, I mean, it's so touchy, right?</v>

24
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:12.110
Even saying anything about Confederacy, of course, it's not valuable. You idiot,

25
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.460
but they won't.

26
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.370
<v 1>Do that. I'll tell you why, because here's why I keep that in my wallet.</v>

27
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.330
People won't do that. I mean,

28
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:19.760
maybe they'll take that soundbite and it'll get ultra processed and people will

29
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:21.350
be like, he was arguing for Confederate monuments,

30
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:25.070
but that's stupid because I keep that in my wallet because that guy celebrated

31
00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:29.270
Passover. That guy celebrated Passover, which is a Jewish holiday,

32
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.310
all about how slavery was bad. Meanwhile,

33
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.360
it looks like he's got a little Hitler.

34
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.580
<v 3>Mustache. He had, he had slaves. Whoa. So here's this guy. Who's.</v>

35
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.120
<v 1>A Jew in America in the 18 hundreds who,</v>

36
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:48.740
so who's one of his most important holidays is a celebration of the

37
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:53.690
Jews, liberation from slavery who had most likely slaves

38
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.520
in his house,

39
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.350
serving him the Passover dishes and certainly

40
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.550
washing them. And what that means to me at least is like,

41
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.160
there's going to be something in my life that I'm as blind to,

42
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.880
as that guy was to the evils of slavery.

43
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.490
And if you can have your most important holiday,

44
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.870
be a holiday where you're celebrating the liberation of your people from slavery

45
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.180
and still end up on a Confederate.

46
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.490
<v 4>Bill, like crazy, God knows what we're blind to right now. Right.</v>

47
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.720
What is it that we're not seeing right now?

48
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.100
And people can justify as very strange. Right. And it,

49
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:32.450
and it means that it means that no matter what.

50
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.490
<v 1>There's probably some kind of thing that that a hundred years</v>

51
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:41.420
from now is going to seem like, how could Alan,

52
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.170
how could this ETF have not seen that? Right.

53
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:46.850
It was right in front of his eyes.

54
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.100
<v 2>Yeah. What do you think that one thing would be,</v>

55
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.300
have you ever tried to think about it?

56
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.320
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I have tried to think about it. Well, so there's a,</v>

57
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.760
there's a couple of things. I think it could be.

58
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.430
One of them is the fact that we've essentially exported slave

59
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:03.400
labor. So, you know,

60
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.700
people are going to be like all these people who were talking about how slavery

61
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.580
is bad, right. And chattel slavery is a very,

62
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:12.310
very different thing from other kinds of slavery.

63
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.950
But there are ways in which people are trapped in horrific situations

64
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.300
who are manufacturing, the goods that I have now, it gets complicated, right?

65
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.910
Because people are like, well, you know, that's better that than no job at all.

66
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:26.920
I'm not sure exactly how it all plays out,

67
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.330
but I can imagine a future in which people look back at me and you and the

68
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:32.590
things we are consuming and saying,

69
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:37.060
how were they blind to the conditions in which those items

70
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.860
were produced? Sure.

71
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.380
<v 2>Well, one of the best examples is someone tweeting about slavery on an iPhone.</v>

72
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.380
That's made by someone who works at Foxconn,

73
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.940
who has these giant nets around the building to keep people from jumping off

74
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.320
because they live such horrific lives that they, they leap to their deaths.

75
00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:59.190
So often they have to protect the building. And this is the exact point.

76
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.770
<v 1>At which if you want it to ultra process, this conversation,</v>

77
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.630
you take that soundbite. And you'd say, look at these two,

78
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.080
comparing, working in a Foxconn factory to chattel slavery,

79
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.430
which is precisely not explain chattel, slavery, chattel slavery. Well,

80
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:18.600
so sometimes, so for example,

81
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:20.490
when people are trying to justify the Bible and the fact that like,

82
00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:22.890
so why didn't Jesus, here's this guy who came down and he, you know,

83
00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:26.400
shocked everyone, right? Why didn't he also say like, you know,

84
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.930
also slaves need to be released ASAP. Slavery is bad. He didn't say that.

85
00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:34.290
So one of the things people will point out is that there are different forms of

86
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:36.450
slavery. So chattel, slavery, specifically, where,

87
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.010
where people are turned into property and bought and sold and have no

88
00:04:41.011 --> 00:04:43.470
opportunity to earn their freedom is a sort of,

89
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.020
it's a specific kind of slavery.

90
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:48.210
That was the kind of slavery we had in the United States.

91
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.640
It's uniquely horrifically bad.

92
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.950
And so that kind of slavery is not the same thing as

93
00:04:55.951 --> 00:05:00.360
working in a Foxconn factory. But you know, when I think about, you know,

94
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:02.040
I'm thinking about this right here, I am on like, you know,

95
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.000
what's going to happen when that parallel gets made. You know,

96
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:07.770
I think it's actually an instructive parallel, right?

97
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:10.830
Like I'd like us to think about what, you know,

98
00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:13.980
how were the goods that we're using and consuming and where they're made.

99
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.120
I also don't want people to think that for a moment that chattel slavery is the

100
00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:19.590
same thing as working in a Foxconn.

101
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.410
<v 2>Factory. And most certainly isn't, but it is.</v>

102
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.510
<v 1>Was bad. It's bad.</v>

103
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.060
<v 2>Working in a Foxconn factory is bad. Just.</v>

104
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.980
<v 1>Want your children to be there. I'll tell ya. Another thing is, is a, is eating,</v>

105
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.810
is eating factory farmed animals. Yes. I mean, I, I it's,

106
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.880
it's, it's messed up. I don't know. Like I do it, you know, I go out,

107
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.650
I eat, I eat meat that I know comes from a place, you know,

108
00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:51.510
where the animals are not treated, where they're in health, it's animal hell,

109
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.940
you know, and we have these animal Hells. Um, when do you do that? Bam. I mean,

110
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.940
just yesterday when I went out and ate like baby back ribs down the street,

111
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.970
I guarantee those baby backwards. Didn't come from, uh,

112
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.280
Joel Sultan's Polyface farm. Right. Um,

113
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.470
and I think that I, you know,

114
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.940
that's something I think about, but I, but I do it anyway.

115
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.080
I can imagine a time when we look back on our current eating habits and we're

116
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:22.700
like, why wasn't everyone arguing for ethically sourced meat? Like,

117
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.440
how was it that, that people didn't didn't want to, you know,

118
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.950
force everyone collectively to pay more for meat that was raised in a way,

119
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:34.040
like the kind of way that salad and pioneers right in this I'm really on board

120
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:37.970
with Salatin. I think he's, I think he's right to say, look there,

121
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.800
there are contexts in which animals are happier and less happy and they're

122
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:44.870
happier on my farm and they're miserable.

123
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.700
<v 2>But I thought it was very interesting in your book where you talk about Michael</v>

124
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.630
Pollan, pressing him on whether or not you could feed New York city that way.

125
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.190
And he's like, do you really need New York.

126
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.070
<v 1>City? Yeah. Well, so south sultans got it. Right? So this is,</v>

127
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.930
will and sound and thinks. I mean, he thinks about this, right?

128
00:06:57.931 --> 00:07:00.150
Like you saw in the book and explicitly divine terms, right.

129
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.620
God has designed the world, but I'll tell you,

130
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.390
this is a story I tell at the end of the book,

131
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.600
I was eating sounds delicious pork. I'm sure it was in,

132
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.550
it's an incredible place. Polyface farms.

133
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.340
And I was eating his pork and like the people there are awesome. He's awesome.

134
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.130
And he announces to everyone, he says, look,

135
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.380
we're going to be doing a bit of a change.

136
00:07:16.381 --> 00:07:17.790
We have a new thing that we're going to be doing.

137
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.830
We are going to be producing chickens for a

138
00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:27.480
growing segment of our market that doesn't want soy fed to their

139
00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:32.010
chickens. So sounds chickens get a lot of their calories, not from his farm.

140
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.610
They get a significant portion of their calories from non GMO soy.

141
00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:38.910
That's grown at another place outside of Polyface. Right?

142
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:40.140
So it's not a self-contained system. He says,

143
00:07:40.141 --> 00:07:42.420
but there's some people that don't want soy fed to their chickens.

144
00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:43.950
They feel like they react to story. They don't want it.

145
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.050
So they're going to start feeding their chickens.

146
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.190
There's a certain percentage of sauteing chicken season to start feeding fish

147
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.260
meal, ground fish meal. So afterward I went up to him and I was like, you know,

148
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.430
Joel, that doesn't seem very natural. Like, do chickens eat?

149
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.060
They swim like, right. Like, are they getting a hold of this fish?

150
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.960
And you know what? He looked at me and he said, I'm a hypocrite. You know,

151
00:08:06.961 --> 00:08:09.300
I'm a hypocrite like anyone else. But at least I admit it.

152
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.880
And what I wanted to say to him was,

153
00:08:11.881 --> 00:08:14.760
there's nothing wrong with feeding your chickens fish meal.

154
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.290
If some people want chickens that are fed fish meal and you're treating your

155
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:20.940
chickens in a way you think is ethical.

156
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.030
There's not some kind of purity tests that you need to apply to your farm,

157
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.460
even though it's on a road called pure Meadows lane. Right. But it's like,

158
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.840
you don't need a purity test for your farm. You're you're a good guy who cares.

159
00:08:30.841 --> 00:08:33.510
I mean, I really think he's a guy who really cares about his animals too,

160
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.620
you know? And,

161
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.330
and it just kinda made me sad that he thought of that as some

162
00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:41.340
sort of hypocrisy. Well.

163
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:46.080
<v 2>The only hypocrisy that you could see in it is factory farmed. Fish is awful.</v>

164
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.220
I mean, it's, it's really bad. I mean, it's bad for the environment.

165
00:08:50.221 --> 00:08:51.990
It's bad for the fish. It's, there's,

166
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.400
there's not a lot of sustainable factory fish operations.

167
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:59.550
It wouldn't make you wince. If you actually saw how they process all that fish.

168
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.420
<v 1>So it's a factory farm fish. Another thing,</v>

169
00:09:02.421 --> 00:09:04.520
I didn't know any of this stuff until I started this research.

170
00:09:04.521 --> 00:09:06.080
So I'll tell you a story, crazy story.

171
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.890
I was in the Netherlands researching the food chapter of this book,

172
00:09:09.891 --> 00:09:12.500
which is about vanilla, which I could talk to you about vanilla,

173
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.010
which sounds very boring. Right. Which is why I picked it. It's vanilla. Um,

174
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.870
I'm researching vanilla and people want natural vanilla. And I don't know if,

175
00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:23.690
you know, do you know where vanilla comes from vanilla beans? Yeah.

176
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.000
Viewer those come from, no, that was, that was the end of my,

177
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.110
that was the end of the line for me. Right.

178
00:09:27.111 --> 00:09:30.440
So we've got vanilla beans in the house. So they they're actually on an orchid.

179
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:35.390
This beautiful white orchid fine is where vanilla beans. Right. Makes sense.

180
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.460
<v 2>So the vanilla ice cream has that orchid on the.</v>

181
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.080
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. All of a sudden I was like, oh wait,</v>

182
00:09:39.081 --> 00:09:40.310
that's why my yogurt looks like that.

183
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.070
Every single one of those is artificially inseminated.

184
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.760
So there's a person who goes and you can watch YouTube videos. It's crazy.

185
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.930
<v 2>They always been like that.</v>

186
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.420
<v 1>No.</v>

187
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.100
So vanilla used to be only in Mesoamerica.

188
00:09:55.101 --> 00:09:58.940
That was the only place where it grew naturally red that's the only is everyone

189
00:09:58.941 --> 00:10:01.070
thinks of Madagascar. Right? Madagascar, vanilla,

190
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.130
only place vanilla was growing was in Mesoamerica.

191
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.790
It was these Mayan silviculturists, which is like forest gardeners who had, who,

192
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:12.260
who grew this. And it was pollinated by it's only known natural pollinator,

193
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.080
which was this thing called a Melipona bee. I don't know if I pronounce that.

194
00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:17.420
Right. What a mean? So that's the only place it was.

195
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.600
And when people came from Europe, they were like,

196
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:23.480
this is incredible vanilla amazing. And they wanted to grow it,

197
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.750
but they couldn't because they didn't know how to pollinate it.

198
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31.850
And then a 12 year old slave named Edmond lbs discovered

199
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.750
how to artificially pollinate vanilla flowers.

200
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.300
And just like that,

201
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.010
you now have the ability to grow vanilla orchids in an in non-natural

202
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.310
habitats. Right. So it's still expensive.

203
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.260
Cause you can only grow them in Madagascar to heat it. You brought,

204
00:10:48.261 --> 00:10:50.210
I don't know if you know this, like, you know, they're there, uh,

205
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.220
is vanilla beans are incredibly expensive.

206
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.880
Natural vanilla is just really expensive ingredient. Um,

207
00:10:54.881 --> 00:10:56.750
and that's because there's not a lot of places. It can be grown.

208
00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.040
So they're looking for ways to make natural vanilla cheaper.

209
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.630
And the Netherlands is where all of the best growing technology,

210
00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:07.040
a lot of the best growing technology is.

211
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:10.940
So I went to a university there where they have a greenhouse where they're

212
00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:14.930
growing vanilla, orchids, pineapples,

213
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.110
bell peppers, like coconuts. I mean, you name it, everything.

214
00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:22.630
They figured out how to grow all of these natural plants. Right. But I'm,

215
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.020
I'm sitting in here and I'm like,

216
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.100
you got vanilla orchids growing out of these buckets in this highly

217
00:11:28.101 --> 00:11:31.160
technological environment, you know, it's all temperature controlled, right?

218
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.520
And for what so that you can have cheap vanilla beans that are,

219
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.100
that can be labeled legally natural.

220
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.510
And that whole story comes back to the salmon and the fish that you were talking

221
00:11:41.511 --> 00:11:43.850
about before, because in that same place,

222
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.930
there was a machine like out of Charlie and the chocolate factory with like pink

223
00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:50.990
sludge whooshing through it. This was, you know, a couple of,

224
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.880
couple of places down from the, from the orchid house. And I was like,

225
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.130
what's that? And the guy who showed me around says,

226
00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:02.050
that's algae that we're growing here because people want their salmon,

227
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.540
their farmed salmon to be pink.

228
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.610
And it's not pink because it doesn't eat the diet that it gets in nature.

229
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:12.280
So it's naturally gray, but people, people won't pay for that.

230
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:16.570
So he's farming algae, which is natural. So he's, that's the stuff,

231
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:17.140
the pink stuff.

232
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:22.120
And then they feed that to the farm salmon just so it can be naturally

233
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.280
pink. So when you go into your whole foods or whatever,

234
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:26.920
and you see that your salmon is all natural and it's pink.

235
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.650
<v 4>And I'm just looking, I'm looking at this whole thing. And I'm like,</v>

236
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.140
what is wrong with us human beings that we've.

237
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.200
<v 1>Gotten to this point where we like, we want stuff natural,</v>

238
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:39.130
so bad that we're developing new technologies to figure out how to like,

239
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.930
we'll have our cake and eat.

240
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.450
<v 2>Salmon. It's really an orange, but they diet, they.</v>

241
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.170
<v 1>Do. They get the oranges, orange pinkish color. But th th there's also a weight.</v>

242
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:50.170
So as taxa, thin, I think is, is the chemical that,

243
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.820
and that you can have it artificially, but then people don't want artificial.

244
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:54.670
They just feed them.

245
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.950
<v 2>Other bugs that they eat that make them way.</v>

246
00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.040
<v 1>Too expensive. Really? Yeah. For when you want it on that scale.</v>

247
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.830
So they feed them this allergy and, and I was like, I get,

248
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:09.580
I get, I get what we're doing. I get what we want. Right. We want stuff.

249
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:13.060
That's better for the planet we want natural. And so then you, so what do we do?

250
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.340
So, but it's so complicated, right? Like what you're saying, like,

251
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:16.630
what do we do with factory farm Fisher?

252
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:19.450
Like what you were saying about Joel Salatin, how do you get,

253
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.740
how do you get Joel salad, meat to people that can't afford it right.
