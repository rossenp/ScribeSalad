WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>But anyway, so here I am. I'm with Mike Edwards. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.560
we show up at the airport in St. Louis. The first time we're gonna meet,

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.160
we meet each other. We hit it off right away. I don't have my driver's license.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.360
Uh, I had some, what form ID? I don't know, want a form ID. I had,

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.080
I had some other form ID and Mike, uh, he had his, and he could drive.

6
00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:20.080
He just got his at the time. So I wonder if I used my password. It, I dunno.

7
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:20.950
Anyway, the, this whole.

8
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.190
<v 1>Thing, you do this, this fast talking thing,</v>

9
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:25.070
this is part of the sh and jive though.

10
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.270
This is a little bit of part of the thing. No, this is me, but I understand.

11
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.110
But it, it also is very effective. That's what a shuck and jive artist does.

12
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:34.750
They talk very fast and they never pause.

13
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.670
So you never get a chance to interject. Yeah. And they're constantly going.

14
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.540
So if they're reading your or T saying something, you have to keep up with them.

15
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.860
And part of the keeping up with them is you get a little bewildered. Yeah.

16
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:50.900
And then bewildered, you forget what you've said or they've said, and you're,

17
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:54.340
you're trying to sort of keep pace with them and you can,

18
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:55.700
and next thing you know, they're like, oh my God,

19
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.940
I can't believe you know that how'd you figure that out. Well,

20
00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:01.300
we'll get to that later. And then you keep going and you keep, that is part of.

21
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.130
<v 0>The team aspect of it. Yeah. It's not what I'm doing. Right. Now's because.</v>

22
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.250
<v 1>Like, kuocs are Chavez when he was fighting, you would put a pace on you.</v>

23
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:09.170
You couldn't keep up with. Right. Right.

24
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.250
<v 0>Yeah. So you always analyze it with fighting, which is great. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:15.090
It it's kind a thing it's vulnerabilities.

26
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.810
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Exploit vulnerabilities in the human mind.</v>

27
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.810
And one of 'em is that you talk and think faster than most people.

28
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.400
So most people, we, when you're talking, they, they don't have it like, right.

29
00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:27.280
You just did right there. You, you wanna, because I had can get a chance.

30
00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:29.160
Tonterject cause I'm not gonna let you, cause I'm gonna keep talking.

31
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.920
And as I keep talking, I talk quicker. You get bewildered.

32
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:34.240
That's one of the things that you do to people, whether you realize it or not,

33
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.920
you do it because you've done it that way for a long time.

34
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.760
It's probably when it's become a pattern. Yeah.

35
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.640
It's become a pattern to make the other person feel insecure. So you don't,

36
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.550
so you take.

37
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.430
<v 0>Know what's a patent for it's a patent. For me,</v>

38
00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:48.310
being able to think and not forget things, as I'mm saying them, like,

39
00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:49.950
because like, as you but's so effective though,

40
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.390
as you said that there's another thing that popped in my I've gotta like all day

41
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:57.670
long, I have songs in my head. It doesn't stop. Like I,

42
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.150
I do this with my teeth all the time, playing the song, too music in my head.

43
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:04.540
Like constantly, if I'm not thinking about anything else,

44
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.660
I have songs in my head constantly. And I've even,

45
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.580
I went to the dentist and I said, Hey, you know,

46
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:10.700
I've got this thing with my teeth and I'm tapping my teeth.

47
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.860
I'm wearing 'em down, you know, what's going on? And he says, oh,

48
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.980
musicians do that all the time. And I go, well,

49
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.900
I always have music 24 hours a day in my head. So, wow.

50
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.260
But now I've gone off somewhere and there was, oh, handwriting.

51
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.090
So if you look at my hand, look my hand, how bad my handwriting, like,

52
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.730
it's really hard to fricking read. Right?

53
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.610
<v 1>It's not that bad. Somebody just wrote me a letter the other day.</v>

54
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:32.730
Well that's and I read the letter, somebody, a friend of mine sent me something.

55
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:35.970
He wrote me a letter and I read his letter. I was like, well, what the is that?

56
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.210
Cause it's just scribibble well, that's me. Right? You.

57
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.410
<v 0>Want someone to read it? It is me writing. Neat. That' slow. That's not bad.</v>

58
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.280
Slow. Normally when I write, I can't read it myself, I' be a, and I look, well,

59
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:47.360
that's the thing, what you just said, you, my, you, you,

60
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:49.400
you're trying to keep up with your thoughts. Yeah.

61
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.360
And that's one of the things about bad handwriting.

62
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:53.880
They say that you're trying to keep up with what you're thinking. Oh,

63
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:56.640
living and my brain. That makes sense, doctor, its always going a mile a minute.

64
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.080
Right. It's going thousand different ways.

65
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.080
And I think it's part of my problem solving is like when people give me ideas

66
00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:05.640
that they want, okay, this is what I'd like to do as a magic effect.

67
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.960
How do I do it? I'm able to rattle off like 10, 15 different ways of it's.

68
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.320
So of doing.

69
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.840
<v 1>It effective, like as a mentalist. That way that,</v>

70
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.840
that pattern of talking is so bewildering to people that they just sort of like,

71
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:20.630
huh? What, what, uh, and you've got 'em on the ropes. Always.

72
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.030
<v 0>It is that thing of, even in my state show. Um,</v>

73
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.630
and you'll have to come to the state show sometime. I' love, you know, I.

74
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.030
<v 1>Would love you to come see, see a, well, I saw the mini version of it.</v>

75
00:03:29.031 --> 00:03:30.550
When you did the television show, I was blown.

76
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.390
<v 0>Away. I mean, the first thing I do is I come out before.</v>

77
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:35.230
I don't even introduce myself. Where do you do it? So.

78
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.150
<v 1>If people can, they wanna see you. I, I was.</v>

79
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.900
<v 0>Just at planet Hollywood filling in, in Vegas. Yeah. I've got a, uh,</v>

80
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.300
a thing coming up, uh, at RO Rochester fringe festival, Rochester, New York.

81
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.940
I I'm, I'm at a lot of different college. You can go to my website,

82
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.100
mana check.com and look up the dates. But the Rochester is gonna be, uh,

83
00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:56.620
on the 13th, 7:00 PM, 14th, 5:00 PM. Then I'm on the 20th at 9:00 PM.

84
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.010
The 22nd. I can remember this 3:00 PM. I know. So you can find,

85
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.050
you can find it on the &lt;laugh&gt; you can't even help yourself.

86
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.050
<v 1>You can find it. You.</v>

87
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.170
<v 0>Can find it on the, you can find it on the website. So it is on the website.</v>

88
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:07.050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.890
<v 1>Okay. But you're in Vegas all the time. Right? I'm.</v>

90
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.250
<v 0>In Vegas a lot. I go't work Vegas that much. Um, oh really? I'm busy now really?</v>

91
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.530
Until, um, beginning of November, I'm gonna be like different places,

92
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.210
just touring on the roading, different places.

93
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:21.000
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; some of it's corporate, some of it's college, you know,

94
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:24.240
it's a mixture of a mismatch of different different things. So, so go back.

95
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.120
<v 1>To this whole James Randy Yuri geler.</v>

96
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.080
<v 0>So here I am with, uh, Mike Edwards at the airport,</v>

97
00:04:30.081 --> 00:04:32.200
and-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; we'rehitting it off and everything. Uh, Peter,

98
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:35.360
Phillip shows up and he's the professor that I mentioned a minute ago,

99
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:37.960
who's gonna be doing the investigating of us. Um,

100
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.350
and he has this wristband on and I'm all always asking questions.

101
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:43.230
What's this what's that. And I'm always noticing things.

102
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.390
And he said it was a wristband that he got from a witch doctor in Africa that

103
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.950
helps protect him. Ah,

104
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.830
so I'm starting to think this might be a little easier than I thought it was

105
00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:53.390
gonna be&lt;laugh&gt; but HES going in, I was like,

106
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.470
I didn't know these guys skeptical. Are they gonna use one way mirrors?

107
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.630
Are they gonna be trying to trick us, catch us? I had no clue.

108
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.780
So we get into, uh, we, we, I,

109
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.740
we had Peter Phillips' car because Mike was too young to drive a rental.

110
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.300
Peter Phillips has a rental HES in front of us. So we're following him.

111
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.300
And this is, this is how it all starts. Really.

112
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.540
I I'm sitting there and just kinda like me talking all the time,

113
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.260
I'm looking around, I'm always doing something. I'm always noticing something.

114
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.450
I look in the back seat and I notice says a briefcase.

115
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.730
I reach in the back and I kind of pull it under the dash. It's locked.

116
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.730
And to me like if somebody locks something,

117
00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:30.850
it means they don't want you inside there. Of course. Right.

118
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.010
But why doesn't want is in there? Oh,

119
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.690
briefcase E easily can just open the locks. So I pick the locks,

120
00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:38.970
open it up inside. There's a whole bunch of silverware. So either this guy's,

121
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:41.970
alept a maniac or this is a silverware he's gonna be using for the,

122
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.760
so I start bending it all up, lock the briefcase, put it in the back,

123
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.200
sit there for about two more minutes, open up the glove compartment.

124
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:52.480
There's some extra keys and things in the glove compartment.

125
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.600
I start bending those up.

126
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.440
<v 1>You bent his keys. I have.</v>

127
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.040
<v 0>Well, I'm a psychic, right? This stuff, this happens. Like, yeah.</v>

128
00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:02.760
What if he need those keys and get in his house? Yeah.

129
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.000
But I needed him to be convinced I was genuine. I get all right.

130
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.840
So I end up looking over the car keys that are hanging out the keys that are

131
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:11.520
hanging out on the car, key out of the ignition.

132
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.680
I start to reach over to get them. And Mike just looks at me and says,

133
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.070
I think you've done enough stop. You know, so, but there's,

134
00:06:17.071 --> 00:06:18.870
there's this really interesting phenomena. Right?

135
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.990
We knew that in the laboratory,

136
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:23.710
everything we did at that point was gonna be on a micro level.

137
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.950
It was gonna be very small because it had to be because we couldn't make it look

138
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:31.710
like it's a trick. We, it had to look like minute. Right. And,

139
00:06:31.711 --> 00:06:34.430
and not just that, we didn't know if they were gonna be watching as,

140
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:36.030
like I said, through one-way mirrors and things like that.

141
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.900
So there's a interesting phenomena at the time it was called spontaneous PK.

142
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.940
And that is stuff that just happens.

143
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.180
PK P psychokinessis PK short for psychokinessis.

144
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.340
Uh telekinessis psychokinessis the whole thing. They're all the same thing. Um,

145
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.620
so there's,

146
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:55.060
these things just supposedly happen around these psychics that can bend metal

147
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.210
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; stuff, moves, stuff breaks, right? That,

148
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.170
so those things were the things that would convince him and keep him holding on.

149
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.330
Even if we did a big band out of the laboratory, but not on camera.

150
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.930
That's the thing that would keep him going. I want to get that on film.

151
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.610
I definitely want to get that on film.

152
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.730
I'm gonna document that someday that's gonna happen in the laboratory.

153
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.880
When we ended up getting to, to the laboratory,

154
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.360
all the students at the university were extremely skeptical, very,

155
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:24.960
very skeptical, but they had heard about the spontaneous PK.

156
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.080
So they hid things underneath the video recorders in a,

157
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.880
there was a separate room and they hid all kinds of things everywhere around.

158
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.520
I noticed there was stuff hidden. I mean,

159
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:36.680
why is a recorder hidden under that VCR? You know,

160
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.510
why is there a four hidden behind that co you know, it doesn't belong there.

161
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.110
So I started bend up all those things on lunchtime &lt;laugh&gt; and that convinced

162
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.990
all the students that we were genuine as well. Oh, Christ. So this, this,

163
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.790
I mean, this, this, this whole thing went on and on it, it it's as simple as,

164
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.830
so what happened was immediately,

165
00:07:56.831 --> 00:08:01.020
Randy sent them a list of 13 caveat of things that we,

166
00:08:01.021 --> 00:08:04.060
that they shouldn't do. And it was common sense stuff, right?

167
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.580
It was stuff like don't let the subjects work at the same time,

168
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.940
because they could distract you.

169
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.580
Don't let them work with more than one object at a time,

170
00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:14.580
because they could confuse you with those objects as to which ones you're

171
00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:16.580
bending. And there was this whole list of different things.

172
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.090
They showed the list to me and Mike and had a good laugh about it and said,

173
00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:22.890
this would make you guys so uncomfortable.

174
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.570
We want you to be comfortable where in reality,

175
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:28.490
they should have followed that list because mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; oh,

176
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.170
one of the things Randy said was mark everything on a micro micro and a macro

177
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.570
level. So they, the subjects can see the macro mark,

178
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.370
but won't realize as a Micromark on there as well,

179
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.520
which would've helped big their idea of doing a macro mark was on

180
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.520
every fork. They took the forkle spoon.

181
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.880
They measured it at both ends like the height from the table.

182
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.960
And they measured the middle of the fork from the height, from the table.

183
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.480
Then they put a label on it on a little string with a number on it.

184
00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.400
And that was their idea of keeping track of if something had bent or not,

185
00:09:00.401 --> 00:09:04.240
because they would measure it after we concentrated on it and they would then

186
00:09:04.241 --> 00:09:07.720
remeasure it again afterwards. And they would say, oh, okay, this is, uh,

187
00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:09.920
this is bent a millimeter or two millimeters mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

188
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.080
So we would do things like we would say this tags in my way. Can I take it off?

189
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.150
Yeah, you can take it off. We put it down, concentrate on it.

190
00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:21.590
Didn't do anything. Put it down on the table, pick up another fork or a spoon.

191
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.590
Say, do you mind if I remove this tag, take it off, put it down,

192
00:09:24.591 --> 00:09:26.150
concentrate on it. Nothing happens.

193
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.630
Switch the tags around on the one that was on the first one to the second one,

194
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:34.910
the second one to the first one, and then put the two forks off to the side.

195
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.420
Then wait two, three hours later, pick up one of those forks.

196
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.700
Obviously not doing anything with it, concentrating on it. Say,

197
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:43.460
why don't you measure it? And they would measure it.

198
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.300
And the measurements had now changed.

199
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.140
Not realizing because they never measured the other one again,

200
00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:51.300
because they remeasd everything consistently later on and put new tags on 'em

201
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:52.134
every single time,

202
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.730
not realizing that we just simply switched forks or as we reached across the

203
00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:59.490
table, we would lean on one of the forks and then hours again,

204
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:03.570
later we would pretend like we actually bent that fork. So this went on. I mean,

205
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:07.010
it went on for 180 hours over four years. I mean,

206
00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:08.090
we messed with these people bad.

207
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.890
We did probably some things at the time that were probably illegal as well.

208
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.890
Like what, like leaving the window unlocked at the laboratory,

209
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.480
going off to the club, across the, the state line coming back,

210
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.160
like about four or five o'clock in the morning, breaking into the building and,

211
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.880
uh, bending up every single piece of metal that was in the laboratory. Um.

212
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.320
<v 1>They had a, what kind of scientists were running this?</v>

213
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.320
<v 0>Well, this is back in the eighties, so right. And they, they had,</v>

214
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:34.840
they actually had this aquarium back.

215
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.510
<v 1>In the eighties. Scientists were like, these TV shows. They.</v>

216
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.110
<v 0>Really, no it's it's, it's true. Here's a sad thing. Right?</v>

217
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.270
I went into this thinking, these people were gonna be the enemy.

218
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.990
It was me against them. You know, I had to do this. Turns out.

219
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:50.990
These are just really, really nice,

220
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.310
nice people that are very naive when it comes to what psychic phenomena is.

221
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.710
Right.

222
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.950
<v 1>Well, if you're a scientist,</v>

223
00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:01.980
most likely you're not studying a whole lot of liars and mentalists and

224
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.420
magicians and psychic phenomenon.

225
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.420
And you really are probably trying to find out whether or not it's real.

226
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.420
And maybe you believe a little bit too much. Yeah.

227
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.020
You Don don't know enough yet when it came.

228
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.460
<v 0>To this type of phenomena. Absolutely. But you Gallo was already doing that.</v>

229
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.770
Other psychics were already doing it in other kind ountries and they were being

230
00:11:18.771 --> 00:11:21.890
invalidated as a genuine thing in other countries. Yeah.

231
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:25.370
We knew like RO over in France, Tanzania, Steven north, over in England,

232
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:25.691
you know,

233
00:11:25.691 --> 00:11:28.730
there was a lot of research going on in England at the time on this type of

234
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.450
phenomenon as well. It was a really big thing.

235
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.290
<v 1>Back then. And it was just people hoing people. It.</v>

236
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:38.010
<v 0>Was little kids. Like the here's the weird thing. Right? So over in England,</v>

237
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.440
there were, um, I can't think of what the guy's name is now. Uh,

238
00:11:41.441 --> 00:11:42.840
there was a scientist over there,

239
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.080
a parapsychologist who was working with little kids and his thinking is that

240
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:49.360
kids don't lie. Little kids don't lie. That's all they do is lie.

241
00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:51.840
They get to that point where they learn how to lie to get anything and

242
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.480
everything. So these kids.

243
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.080
<v 1>Don't lie. That's someone without kids.</v>

244
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.880
<v 0>And these kids only got caught.</v>

245
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.160
The only reason they got caught was by accident because they were,

246
00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.480
the video cameras were left on and soon as the parapsychologists left the room,

247
00:12:02.481 --> 00:12:05.720
the kids were taking forks and spoons and actually bending them underneath their

248
00:12:05.721 --> 00:12:09.120
feet and then putting them back up on the, on the table. So,

249
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.440
and they would come in. It was, they literally.

250
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.590
<v 1>Scientists went in with the premise that children don't lie.</v>

251
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.790
That is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard in my life. I don't.

252
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.551
<v 0>Disagree with you,</v>

253
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:22.230
but this is how badly people wanted to believe in this phenomena. Why do,

254
00:12:22.231 --> 00:12:22.750
why do.

255
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.310
<v 1>People wanna believe in hidden powers?</v>

256
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.710
<v 0>I think it's white. People wanna believe in most things, right? Wanna,</v>

257
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.190
we wanna find, we wanna believe there's something more than just us like that.

258
00:12:32.191 --> 00:12:34.100
For most people, we're just, we're not enough.

259
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.580
And I don't know if it's because we get so bored with our lives.

260
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.660
We get depressed with our lives. We get, you know,

261
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:43.580
we we're in this everyday thing of going to work, coming home.

262
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.900
And is this all there is, is this it? You know,

263
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.940
is there something else that that's a superpower that I could,

264
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.340
I could actually have? Is there something I can discover? That's bigger than me,

265
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.050
better than me. You know, it is a,

266
00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:59.050
ununiverse much bigger than just this planet right here. Right. So, I mean,

267
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:02.770
if you asked me, I would think that if you, if UFOs were coming here,

268
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.970
if they were coming here, let's say, I don't believe they were,

269
00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:08.210
but if they were coming here, you don't believe they were. No, I don't. I don't.

270
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.290
But I think if they were, I just don't, I, I, I don't, I,

271
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.280
I think we would really have real evidence hundred percent evidence of it by

272
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:19.520
now, but here's the thing, right? Wouldn't it make much sense even like for us.

273
00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:22.080
Okay. Let's say we start going, looking at other planets.

274
00:13:22.081 --> 00:13:23.840
Are we gonna send other humans out there?

275
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.680
Or are we gonna go ahead and send robots or something like that? They can last,

276
00:13:28.681 --> 00:13:29.720
like we do tomorrow. Yeah.

277
00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:32.400
They can last and robots are getting better and better and better at.

278
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.360
So if there's an advanced civilization, civil,

279
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.230
surely they would also have right.

280
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.190
This advancement where they don't have to send themselves out,

281
00:13:40.191 --> 00:13:42.030
they can send something to represent them. Right.

282
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.870
<v 1>What the real hardcore believers believe those grays are. Yeah. Gray aliens,</v>

283
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:50.230
the big black highs. They think there's some sort of a Android or something.

284
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:50.950
And, and it.

285
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.590
<v 0>Could be, but I don't believe, I don't believe we've had 'em.</v>

286
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.220
<v 1>I, um, a lot more before I started doing that television show, right.</v>

287
00:13:58.221 --> 00:14:02.100
That television show cured me of Bigfoot cured. Me of psychics cured.

288
00:14:02.101 --> 00:14:05.340
Me of aliens, cured me of like almost everything. Well.

289
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.980
<v 0>This is a thing with me, right. When I was a young kid, I believe in that stuff.</v>

290
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.020
You know, when I was a young kid, I spoke tongues, you know, I thought I did,

291
00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:13.420
you know, did you really? Oh yeah, yeah. I had the whole experience. I mean,

292
00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:16.690
it was like, you know, all the chemicals running through my body and me just,

293
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.210
you know, doing the whole thing, you know, and going to that.

294
00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:23.770
And I realized later what was going on. But at the time I,

295
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.330
I was looking for answers. I was looking for answers in religion. Well, you had.

296
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.290
<v 1>A very disturbed life and you were probably looking for some sort of security.</v>

297
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.730
<v 0>I got shut down every single time I would ask questions.</v>

298
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.970
I was called a troublemaker.
