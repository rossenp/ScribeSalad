<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.640
<v 2>So what happens? You, you got accosted last night.</v>

3
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.360
<v 1>Oh, we're in it. This is just going. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, good to be here.</v>

4
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:10.280
Thanks for good.

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.240
<v 0>To have you. Good to.</v>

6
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.720
<v 1>Have you. Yeah. So we're here. Do you need booze? No, I don't drink,</v>

7
00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:17.680
but I appreciate the, do you want heroin? Heroin would good. Yeah.

8
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.040
I'm still doing heroin.

9
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.990
<v 0>That's always like the hack joke. I don't drink, but I wanna buy heroin.</v>

10
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.830
It's like, you always go. Like, if someone says they don't drink,

11
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.230
you go with something way more preposterous than drinking. Like, oh, I'm sober.

12
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.230
<v 1>Right? The other one is, uh, uh, quitter. Well, people say quitter.</v>

13
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:38.510
That's like a big one to do. That's a big one. But, um, but no,

14
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.350
I appreciate the offer though. I mean, this is cigar.

15
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.820
I might enjoy away once a Gar. Sure. Yeah. I'm on an empty stomach.

16
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:46.540
So it might make me more jittery than I already am. We'll give it a little.

17
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.660
<v 0>I'm a big settle in. Yeah, no.</v>

18
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.220
<v 1>You're not. You're fine. Well, what did I tell this story? You might. Okay.</v>

19
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.460
&lt;laugh&gt; okay. So yeah, we're here in Austin and I got a ride,

20
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.180
a lift to the hotel. I'm staying downtown and we were coming up sixth street,

21
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:03.330
which I don't know if you've been down there. It's changed a bit.

22
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.650
It's like kind of overrun with street folk homeless. Yes.

23
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.010
<v 0>There's, there's quite a few, uh, of the, they call them unhoused.</v>

24
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:14.370
That's the new, more politically correct term. Sure.

25
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.530
<v 1>I thought street people was good, but maybe that things people peoples.</v>

26
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.010
<v 0>I don't think they liked that. I don't know if there's like a,</v>

27
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.000
a homeless board talk about the vernacular that they

28
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.880
appreciate. Uh.

29
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.520
<v 1>Yeah. All right. Well, UN unhoused people that seem, you know, uh,</v>

30
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.840
unwell and they're kind of everywhere, which evidently they just passed a law,

31
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.053
but it hasn't been.

32
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.320
<v 0>Well, the law is only about camping. Okay. I mean,</v>

33
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.350
you can't stop people from walking around. Right.

34
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.830
So that there's always gonna be an issue. And like, uh,

35
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.750
one of the clubs downtown is a Vulcan gas company and uh,

36
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.710
that place is right caddy corner to a homeless shelter.

37
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.830
So they're all over the place in that area. That's.

38
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.670
<v 1>Where I think I was on seventh. Right. Is that seventh?</v>

39
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.660
<v 0>I think is on sixth. Is it on? Yeah,</v>

40
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.380
but the shelter would be the shelter's on seventh. Yeah, I think you're right.

41
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.220
Okay. Well, so.

42
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.100
<v 1>In that area, so we drove down the street and the guy was kind of saying, yeah,</v>

43
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.620
they've taken over. It's crazy. It's scary. Be careful,

44
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.500
whatever Lyft driver sentence. So I'm like, well, he was like a,

45
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.450
a driver driver, but so I'm already, so I'm already like in head. And then, um,

46
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.010
I asked the lady, I was like, is it safe walking around here? Now?

47
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.250
It feels like it's changed a bit. And she was like, just avoid sixth street.

48
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.570
And I was like, all right, got it. And then, uh, I was like,

49
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:38.250
I'm gonna go to the Creek, do a spot, texted Rebecca.

50
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.090
And it's like an eight minute walk. I was like, I'll walk there. Now.

51
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:44.600
I'm a huge pusy anxiety, whole thing.

52
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.840
Although I have been doing mixed martial arts, but we can get to that later. Um,

53
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.320
but so I was walking up the street and I'm like, all right, so far it's so good.

54
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.640
And then I started to get closer and I saw these two guys walking towards me and

55
00:02:57.641 --> 00:03:01.400
they seemed like, you know, near do Wells, just, you know,

56
00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:03.200
by the way they were presenting themselves.

57
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.040
And then there was a guy on a bicycle,

58
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.920
like a BMX style bike who kind of was with them and then rode ahead and kind of

59
00:03:09.921 --> 00:03:13.280
did like a loop behind me. So then I was like, all right,

60
00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:17.640
this feels unsafe. So I kind of just moved to the street,

61
00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:20.510
like off the sidewalk, but still right next to the sidewalk.

62
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.830
And then the two guys, as they passed were like, look at this,

63
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.270
this racist moving into the street, this white guy, this, and, uh,

64
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.423
it seemed.

65
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.390
<v 0>You were racist because you moved into.</v>

66
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.630
<v 1>The street. I think, cuz I moved into the street, but that's not what I was.</v>

67
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.750
I wasn't like, oh, here come black guys. Let me move up.

68
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:41.100
But they were walking up the sidewalk, so I just was moving.

69
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.900
So I didn't have like a and.

70
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.820
<v 0>A moment where you had to Zig or Zach exactly you left or.</v>

71
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.540
<v 1>Right, exactly. So I stepped off the sidewalk and he kind of called that out.</v>

72
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.500
And then as they,

73
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.340
we passed each other and I could still hear him kind of like mumbling.

74
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:58.380
They seemed like they were up. But um, so they were still kind of mumbling.

75
00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:00.490
And then I came to the intersection,

76
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:02.770
which is where I guess that homeless shelter is.

77
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.250
And there was like 40 homeless people,

78
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.330
not like sleeping tents or on the sidewalk,

79
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.210
but like fighting yelling bottle smashing. And I was just like, ah,

80
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:15.050
I don't feel like walking through that. That doesn't seem great.

81
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.970
So then I looked to the right was sixth street with a lady was like, yes,

82
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:19.890
stay off the sixth street.

83
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.440
And then this is all in front of an empty parking lot.

84
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.480
So there's just nobody around it's dark. And I'm like, if I go left,

85
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.720
I'm going up dark street sidewalk. So then I was like,

86
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.480
I'll cross sevens back over there and just start walking back to my hotel.

87
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.200
So I don't have to walk through whatever this scene is.

88
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.920
And then as I was walking back that way,

89
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.360
they were a little ways ahead of me and for whatever reason,

90
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.910
a decided to cross back across the street.

91
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.430
And so we just met right there and then the guy's like,

92
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:50.510
you wouldn't be following us. Would you? And I was like, no, no, I'm just lost.

93
00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:53.430
And I kind of did like a, I don't want anything to do with you guys.

94
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.070
And then the guy got like right up into my face and was like,

95
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:59.950
you better be lost you. Why don't you get lost? And like,

96
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.980
so whatever else I was in like panic mode. So I couldn't,

97
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.580
and then there was one of those like scooters, you know,

98
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:07.420
those rental scooters that everywhere. Yeah.

99
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:10.180
And he just gave that like a hard kick and did like this thing.

100
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:13.220
And we were kind of like manager and an umpire just like right there.

101
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.340
And I went, nah, no I'm getting outta here.

102
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:19.180
And I just kind of walked around and then swallowed all pride and just went

103
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.580
full, full run.

104
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.690
<v 0>That's a good move. All right. Thanks. I.</v>

105
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.570
<v 1>Thought you might call me a cut.</v>

106
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.970
<v 0>No, I might appreciate it. I might have done the same thing.</v>

107
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.370
<v 1>Well, I mean, again, it's like.</v>

108
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.810
<v 0>It's a good move, man. You don't,</v>

109
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.530
you don't wanna get into an altercation if you can avoid it.

110
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:37.170
If you can avoid it by running like the swallow, the pride thing,

111
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:40.250
like wouldn't like, what are you gonna do?

112
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.000
Just get attacked or what are you gonna do? Fight when you can,

113
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.800
if you can not fight by running, you should definitely run.

114
00:05:45.801 --> 00:05:49.880
Like you talk to any martial arts instructor that will always tell you that if

115
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:54.320
you can get away a smart one will tell you, get away a dumb one will say, first,

116
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.960
Roy, you gotta kick him in the knee. Then you gotta poke 'em in the eye.

117
00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:01.360
Like the three Stooges, you know, get the out of there, man. Get out of there.

118
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.040
<v 1>Yeah. So I, I've done a little bit of MMA training in the last couple of years.</v>

119
00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:08.680
And like that's the basic idea, obviously at whatever level,

120
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.200
if you wanna say level, the idea is to use whatever skills to get out of.

121
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.040
Harm's way. I'm not looking to inflict damage on people.

122
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.150
<v 0>Sometimes it's just people just wanna with you.</v>

123
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.150
So these guys probably just wanted to with you and make you feel uncomfortable

124
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.950
and make you scared. Cause if they wanted to do something,

125
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:26.350
they probably would've done something. Right?

126
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.150
<v 1>Yeah. That's how I felt. And I also,</v>

127
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.990
I literally consciously thought me running gives them what they want.

128
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.980
They get a nice like that's right. And I'm, I'm fine with that. I, 39 years old,

129
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.460
I'm not looking to prove anything to anybody. And then Rebecca was like texted,

130
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.260
who runs the Creek and was like, I can send security. And I was like,

131
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.620
I'll take it as a sign. I'll see you tomorrow night. I'll take.

132
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.340
<v 0>A lift. We have solid security of the Creek though.</v>

133
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.540
They have some big giant dudes. Oh really? Yeah. Some solid dudes.

134
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.860
<v 1>Oh good to know. Well tonight I'm gonna take a lift. I'm good with walking,</v>

135
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.050
but it was, but I felt good because.

136
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.850
<v 0>I'll come get you tonight. I'll I'll pick you up. All right. I'll take it.</v>

137
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.370
<v 1>We'll talk. I appreciate it. Well, I, I, I felt good. Cause when I got back,</v>

138
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.610
I was like, I didn't sit there going, you're a, a piece of.

139
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.690
And nor was I like panicking. I was just like, all right. That.

140
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.930
<v 0>Was crazy. Yeah. It's not good. You you're,</v>

141
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.400
you're always better off just swallowing pride. Yeah. It's it's hard to, to do,

142
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:19.234
but it's so important.
