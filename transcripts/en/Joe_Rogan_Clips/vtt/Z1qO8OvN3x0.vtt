00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.320
<v 1>Those cars who really feel the road. Oh yeah. So if you run over a P mm-hmm,</v>

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.880
&lt;affirmative&gt; like, you definitely get princess out and are like you. Cause I,

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.040
I have a 67 Camaro I've had, since I was 14. Great.

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.200
It's it was my it's my first car. Oh.

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.960
<v 0>That's amazing. You have your first car.</v>

7
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.990
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah, God. And, and there's been times when,</v>

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.150
uh, I haven't done well or something.

9
00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:26.910
I've had to sleep in it and all these things.

10
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:30.470
So we have this long relationship and it never breaks down.

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.390
It's always just wonderful to, we're wonderful to each other. And uh,

12
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.750
and you feel the road mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; when you hit something, you're like,

13
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:42.460
Hey, right. And so you're attached to it. Um, and I, I,

14
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.100
I love riding in a caddy or something like that too, where it's like,

15
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:49.260
you could run over multiple bodies and, and feel nothing. Right, right. But,

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.380
but, um, but I enjoy the drive when, um,

17
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.220
when I'm on the road sitting on a seat with five wheels,

18
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.580
one of my hand and four on the road, it's like great experience by old man. Um,

19
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.130
for a brief second I, a 65, uh, Corvette stingray.

20
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.930
<v 0>They're amazing cars. They just, the way that thing looks like,</v>

21
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:09.850
they just nailed it.

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.090
<v 1>It's very organic. Yeah. They nailed it.</v>

23
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:15.570
It's definitely taken off of a stingray. Like someone's like, Ooh, well.

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.130
<v 0>It's, I don't know. I mean, it doesn't really look like a stingray to me, but,</v>

25
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.283
but it looks like it's just.

26
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.050
<v 1>It's that front, like yeah. It's,</v>

27
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:25.480
there's that bit of that shaping that inspiration of the shape to me, I guess.

28
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.560
Yeah. And, and I think I, I I'm, so, uh,

29
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.240
always at a lost one. It's like,

30
00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:34.000
if you could make something and you're gonna ask everyone to help you,

31
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.240
and we're gonna grab all this from wherever,

32
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:37.880
we're gonna grab it from mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; can,

33
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.680
can we make it look cool or no? Or like, what is your aversion to,

34
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.150
everything has to look like an egg or a drop of water. Right. Um,

35
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.190
and if it does, can we do that like as cool looking as possible?

36
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.030
&lt;laugh&gt; you know what I mean? Like mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

37
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.230
it should look great because that don't you feel good in that car? Oh yeah.

38
00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.720
Yeah. It.

39
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.420
<v 0>Looks great. Yeah. It look and it's, it's also, to me, it's like,</v>

40
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:07.940
you're rolling around in a piece of history. So 1965, you know,

41
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.220
it's like that, that thing was created in, you know,

42
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.620
the early sixties,

43
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:17.980
someone figured it out and put it together and then made a production line.

44
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.220
<v 1>And, and did the most important thing ever. They said, this is where we stop.</v>

45
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.890
Yep. We're good. Yeah. And there was like,

46
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.730
this is what it looks like when it's finished.

47
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.690
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; a completed thought. Yeah. And, and,

48
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.250
and other people are like, good idea, man. And, and I just,

49
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.490
I have a 67, you have 65. Like, um,

50
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.410
that doesn't mean there aren't things made today.

51
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.930
It just means like I'm down with that idea and it, well, it's also, it's.

52
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.960
<v 0>It captures a very specific time in American history where they made these cars</v>

53
00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:51.560
that were worthwhile because when you go to 77, nobody gives a about a 77.

54
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.520
Anything, you know, you know what I mean? Like who's buying a 77 Mustang,

55
00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:58.280
get the thing away from me. You know, they all look.

56
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.560
<v 1>Like there's a lot of people selling him. &lt;laugh&gt; maybe, well, I also think too,</v>

57
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.480
this, this guy pulled up on me on, in a Prius.

58
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.320
<v 0>That was quite new and he rolled down the window and just looked at me and waved</v>

59
00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:14.120
his hand over his, and I was like, and he goes, stinky, no way. Really? Yeah.

60
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.030
<v 1>Oh, on Fairfax, kind of by the whole foods there at Santa Santa Monica. And, uh,</v>

61
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.070
um, and I just thought this is my first car. I haven't got another one.

62
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.550
So you've probably gotten multiple new cars. That's the only.

63
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.383
<v 0>Car you've had.</v>

64
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.950
<v 1>Uh, I had a Bronco. You have a family car, your whole life. That's it.</v>

65
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.790
I had a Magnum for a sec, but I never sold this car. Wow.

66
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.630
<v 0>Magnum was great. I can't believe you never sold. That is so cool.</v>

67
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.820
You ever sold your first car and it was a 67 Camaro. Like.

68
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.180
<v 1>I had a lot of experiences in there that were,</v>

69
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.300
that were wonderful and some that were challenging and they're all, it's,

70
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.700
it's incredible to have that locked.

71
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.540
<v 0>Into that car. Yeah. I mean, but it's the shape too.</v>

72
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.220
That's like one of the great all time iconic shapes in automotive.

73
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.850
<v 1>History. That first one was like an, an attempt to be like Mustang, Mustang.</v>

74
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.170
Yeah. And, um, and they really hit it out of the park.

75
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.770
<v 0>Because 67, 68 and 69, you can almost hear.</v>

76
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.930
<v 1>The Mustang going like, well, yeah. Um, you know, because the, it it's,</v>

77
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.850
it's, it's beautiful. Yeah. But I was thinking this guy,

78
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.680
like I see what he was trying to, but, uh, he's probably,

79
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.320
he's probably bought a ton of cars, which is way worse for the footprint.

80
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:27.920
Just off the plus batteries are made on three.

81
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.840
<v 0>Condos. And what does he think he is gonna do fix you by going stinky?</v>

82
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.920
<v 1>He's just being a tot.</v>

83
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.680
He's trying to build himself up again by breaking me down. But yeah. I'd have,

84
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:38.520
like, my grandpa always said he didn't swear very much, but he, he,

85
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.480
one of the things he was like,

86
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.790
I'd have to give a for to matter mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, and, um,

87
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.070
I just kind of &lt;laugh&gt; chuckled, um, because I was like,

88
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.910
thank God I had ride in the, in the car with him, you know? Yeah.

89
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.790
Because certainly he's going up to the next,

90
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.830
like money Carlo and is like stinky. Yeah. He's just gonna do it all.

91
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.590
He's not like a stinky parade. &lt;laugh&gt;.

92
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.340
<v 0>He's driving around in a car that gets 50 miles to the gallon.</v>

93
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.460
Just mocking everything with a V8.

94
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.740
<v 1>Yeah. But also like on a, on a stinky parade and, and that's, that's a,</v>

95
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.100
that's a something I don't wanna float on. It's.

96
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.060
<v 0>A lot of negativity pumping out there. Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:18.260
But it's just weird to roll down your window and do that to people like,

98
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.253
come on, man.

99
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.050
<v 1>Come on. Well, certainly that's too much free time. I'm in my book, you know?</v>

100
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.050
Uh.

101
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.370
<v 0>What says too much self righteousness. Yeah.</v>

102
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.990
<v 1>Stinky.</v>

103
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.410
<v 0>Stinky. There it is. Look at that one. Done up. Woo. Look at that bad boy. Oh.</v>

104
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.370
<v 1>Well, God. If I could turn on my head,</v>

105
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.490
do you mind if I turn this on I'll I'll show you a picture. Is that yours? That,

106
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.603
um, mine looks it.

107
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.730
<v 0>Is it yours? Is it not yours? I don't think that's his,</v>

108
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.800
isn't yours black or is yours.

109
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.960
<v 1>Silver? Yeah. It's silver. Is it like that? It looks a lot like that,</v>

110
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:48.920
except I don't have those actually. I used to have,

111
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.920
I that's real close, but that's not it.

112
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.320
<v 0>Ah, you internet &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

113
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.360
<v 1>But it it's strikingly close. For example,</v>

114
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.800
this has no door handles and no mirrors and yours does, and mine does.

115
00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:06.120
It also has a hood scoop from what seems to be a Corvette actually,

116
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.160
which mine does not have. And um, those rims are,

117
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.760
are much like the ones I had in my Magnum, but, um, not what I have on my,

118
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.630
I think that's the hood from, uh, 69, 4 27.

119
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.670
I think the SS and the, uh, that, that's it right there. There it is.

120
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.270
That's beautiful, man. Yeah. And, uh,

121
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.310
and I'll show you what it looks like right now because I, I,

122
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.950
I ended up dropping a crate engine because in there, which is a GM,

123
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.830
which one? It's a D blueprinted three 50 with aluminum heads.

124
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.580
So it weighs like 800 pounds left. And, um,

125
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.700
it sounds like you're stepping on glass, like in an endless mole to parade too.

126
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.700
Yeah. Cause like, like, you know, like a glass and a hankie. Yeah.

127
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.300
When they're like Mo like glass pack mufflers. Well, I, and I, in truth,

128
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.340
I tried to calm that down because as you crest a hundred miles an hour,

129
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.090
it with the muffler's too loud, it's like what? It's a bit like being in a,

130
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:07.090
B 52 bomber for no reason. &lt;laugh&gt; like, you know, um,

131
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:11.010
yeah. Um, and, uh, let's see my rides, uh,

132
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.410
I'll show it if you, if you don't mind there. Um,

133
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.260
because, uh, it's pretty, it's lovely.

134
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.580
When did you put the, the CRA engine into it? About five years ago.

135
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.740
And what a great idea that was? Oh, yeah. Changed the balance of the car, right?

136
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.580
Oh yeah. And it's got a new front and rear clip under it. Oh, nice.

137
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.580
So it's on rails, like, oh, beautiful. You couldn't roll that thing if you,

138
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.010
if you like lubed up the freeway, you know, like, um,

139
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.210
here it's and I got these Hopster oh yeah.

140
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.290
Hopster rims on it. It's Ooh, God, that looked good. You know,

141
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.730
you know, what's amazing about it is, um, um, I get in that car and I,

142
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.680
I take the kids to school or something and it's the it contagious,

143
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.080
because what happens is you feel really good as, you know, you get in your,

144
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.633
at 65 and,

145
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.400
and you feel really good and you pull up with a smile on your face and go, Hey,

146
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.400
and it's a daily driver of this thing. Yeah. Um, it's my daily driver.

147
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.280
And so that's a perfect rockstar daily driver, by the way. Well,

148
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:21.270
it's 67 Camaro. It's it's the, what it is,

149
00:08:21.271 --> 00:08:25.750
is something that makes me feel really good. That is not part of a crisis. Yeah.

150
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.510
Near not, mid-life not, yeah. Not, pre-life not post life. Right. It it's just,

151
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:35.190
it's just mine. And, uh, and I feel like myself in there, the kids get in there.

152
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.230
I have five point seatbelt.

153
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.950
So you don't need a car seat because I have a seatbelt that's that makes a car

154
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.860
seat look like you do. Okay. Right. Harness, harness.

155
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.500
It's it's a harness with Springs that like slip mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; anyway.

156
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:47.100
So they can be in the car as,

157
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.580
as it is and take them to school and, and, um,

158
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.800
kids go like, whoa. And they get to get out in that. Yeah.

159
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.720
And that's how they start their day. Right. Right. Right. And,

160
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.480
and it's like a little adventure. That is tight. Yeah. That is tight, man.

161
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.280
Like even being in traffic, like people are really nice to you too. They,

162
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.160
they pull up and they go, yeah, man, most of them. Yeah. Well, some go stinky,

163
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.120
but &lt;laugh&gt;, don't forget about that guy, you know, behind it,

164
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.110
behind the of something. Cool. Is stinking. Yeah. Well, that's true too.
