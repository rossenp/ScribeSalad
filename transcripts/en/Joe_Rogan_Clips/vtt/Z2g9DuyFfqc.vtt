1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Is this a thing that you brought up?</v>

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.690
<v 1>I found the first wash person. I've got to keep.</v>

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.020
<v 2>Try to keep this like a fifth. Sure. There.</v>

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.290
<v 1>We go. I got to bring a Welsh dragon for you. Uh, well strap, well striking.</v>

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.450
So this is on our flag in, in Wales,

6
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.130
goes back a long time ago since we were like protecting ourselves and

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.860
pride. Wow. It's cool.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.460
<v 3>You know, the history of it. So this is a classic whilst dragon.</v>

9
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.760
<v 1>Yeah. I think his name, like one of the coolest flags in the world.</v>

10
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:32.060
He's just got this big, big raging dragon on a flag.

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.630
That is pretty cool for if I'm the first worshiper I gotta,

12
00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:39.200
I got to bring you a, the red dragon. Look at it right there. There's some,

13
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.370
some images. There we go. Yeah. There's been two L's before. No.

14
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.510
<v 4>No, no. How bad is it? Yeah. Beautiful.</v>

15
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.420
<v 1>It is a good place. Lots of mountains right on the coast there as well.</v>

16
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:54.830
Of course, forests lakes. Good for training. That's where I do all my training.

17
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.420
Hardcore elements.

18
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.330
<v 2>Speaking of training, Ash, tell everybody what you've done. So.</v>

19
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.050
<v 1>I've recently only five months ago now five and a half months came back from</v>

20
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:04.100
achieving, uh,

21
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.810
my third world first record in walking the entire length of the Yangtze river in

22
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:11.510
China. So it's the third longest river in the world. Uh,

23
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.860
the longest to run through a single nation. So it's 4,000 miles.

24
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:19.160
It took 352 days. Um,

25
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:21.980
and it's from the Tibetan plateau and the west of China,

26
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.240
as you're talking 5,100 meters above sea level,

27
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.100
which is equivalent to aerospace camp and, and year 4,000 miles later,

28
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:32.450
352 days,

29
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.830
you end up near the near Shanghai where it pours out into the east China sea.

30
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.880
<v 2>You know what I thought when I heard that you did this, I thought two things.</v>

31
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:42.530
One, I thought this guy's insane.

32
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.330
Like what kind of willpower does it take to walk and hike 4,000 plus miles.

33
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.110
But the other thing I thought is this kind of validates a lot of the ideas that

34
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.300
people have always had about human beings,

35
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.500
migrating from Africa and through Siberia, do the pairing straight.

36
00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:02.270
Like you can do that. What you did, what you did is not dissimilar,

37
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.890
you know, that's it,

38
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.030
you got trails all over the world and you're just doing it for a world record.

39
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:10.550
Imagine if you're doing it because you're trying to stay alive.

40
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.770
It's going to keep your family alive. Yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.950
<v 1>I'd say what yeah. We would have had our there's so much,</v>

42
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.780
so much history in journeys that man can do kind of taken on since. Wow.

43
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.810
I'm reading, um, sapien at the minute. I only just started,

44
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.050
but that's just mind boggling with the numbers, you know,

45
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:31.550
it takes right back and it's like, whoa, whoa. But, um, yeah.

46
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.420
So the source of the Yangtze, it was actually only discovered in 2009,

47
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:39.650
the true and scientific source. So yeah, that gives us, we had to do two,

48
00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:41.330
it took over two years of planning.

49
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.870
So it was a case of work and heavily in China, um,

50
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.170
finding out whether this had ever been done before it talk,

51
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.160
we had to get different teams involved, uh, globally. Um,

52
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.900
and then we discovered that I was always,

53
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.360
I was always preparing to go from the traditional source,

54
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:59.950
which is most famous for, for the source of Yangtze B. Uh,

55
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:00.970
you actually would be in there,

56
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.420
but then we only discovered about a year into the planning that actually there's

57
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:09.130
a true and scientific source found by the same guy who mapped the traditional

58
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:09.880
source.

59
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.600
Yet he pointed it with NASA used all the satellite technology was able to

60
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:17.380
correct as wrong, slightly longer than the, the traditional source.

61
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.590
And that was it. When I write, it's got to be the true and scientific source,

62
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.120
how much longer is it? It's probably only a distance of 20 to 30 miles,

63
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.220
which that's only really a days Trek, but it was more close to Tibet.

64
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:34.630
It was more south, uh, Southwest of China. So it was closer to the spend Porter,

65
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:38.440
which means it's a little bit more sensitive. So it was tougher to go from,

66
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.560
from the true and scientific source, for sure. But it's the longer one.

67
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.440
If you're going to walk that distance, you've got to do it the proper way.

68
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.530
<v 2>I agree with you. I'm glad you think that way,</v>

69
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:49.950
but obviously a person that's willing to walk 4,000 miles would think that way.

70
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.660
<v 0>You wouldn't say 20 miles. If you skipped on 20 miles.</v>

71
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.330
<v 2>A day, it was like, well, you did a pretty good job,</v>

72
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.030
but actually Mike over here just did the whole.

73
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.090
<v 3>Thing. Actual scientific he's the real one. Well.</v>

74
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.330
<v 1>That's how that happened towards the end as well. So coming up near Shanghai,</v>

75
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.370
there's an official point of where the Yangtze paws into the east China sea

76
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.490
and the like, you know, you only have to go to this, this point. I'm like, no,

77
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.970
I am walk into where the land ends. So that took me an extra,

78
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:20.580
only an extra couple of days, but imagine finishing it's like,

79
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.780
didn't quite make it. He didn't quite make it.

80
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.780
<v 2>Feeling like when, you know, you only have two days.</v>

81
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.150
<v 4>Left. Um, well.</v>

82
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.040
<v 1>We were hit by storm storm Akima so it was one of the biggest</v>

83
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.960
storms they've had in the past 30 years. Uh,

84
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.820
and that put me into hiding United to shelter up after everything that I'd faced

85
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.340
over 350 days, you know? Um,

86
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.630
and that stopped me only a couple of days before I crossed into the east China

87
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:51.810
sea before the finish. But at that point it's almost,

88
00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:56.790
I'd visualized the completion over and over again in my head I'd played it so

89
00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:59.790
many times of what it would be like, what it would feel like it's, you know,

90
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:03.810
everything to, to cross the finish line that almost when that day happened.

91
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:05.070
And I did cross the finish line,

92
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.840
I almost over visualized to feel anything. It's just like, well,

93
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:14.220
so spot downtime, you know? Wow. Yeah. And I believe, you know,

94
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.070
the law of attraction, visualization, I've always been a big believer in that.

95
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.840
And same with Mongolia and Madagascar, which might were my previous expeditions.

96
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.460
Uh, I almost lost my life on both of those trips at the time that I'm suffering.

97
00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:30.210
I'm just constantly visualizing in always focusing on recovering,

98
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.660
getting better, visualize in the finish, keep getting up, keep pushing on. I.

99
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.480
<v 2>Want to get to that. I want, I want to get to those, but I want to,</v>

100
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.750
I want to ask you when you decide to plan this trip,

101
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.700
so how much had you learned from the first two crazy trips that you had

102
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.060
and how did you calculate, like how much food you're going to need?

103
00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:50.130
Where are you going to meet? Neat pit stops,

104
00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:52.290
where you're going to be able to like, how did you do it?

105
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.400
<v 1>So with that, we're always looking for communities on, on a long route,</v>

106
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.780
you know, as a there's food. And so,

107
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.960
and actually that brings me back to the traditional and then the true scientific

108
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:05.210
source. If we went from the traditional,

109
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.890
we'd go maybe one week or one and a half weeks without coming across any locals.

110
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.400
So we'd have to carry a week and a half worth of Russian packs in our backpack,

111
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.190
but there's true. And scientific source sentenced back.

112
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.020
I think it was two or three weeks.

113
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:22.010
We couldn't find any community along the way,

114
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:26.030
via satellite and via the people that we were there,

115
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:28.730
my logistics managers. So that night was Nita, Carey.

116
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.000
<v 2>Way to try to visit people,</v>

117
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.350
find them through satellite as you're tracking through a forest yet,

118
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.820
and then try to get food.

119
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.910
<v 1>That's it? And we're always maximizing it as well. So we're saying, okay,</v>

120
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.140
that's three weeks. So let's carry food for three and a half or four weeks.

121
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.640
Because if that community's now empty or abandoned, then we're out of food.

122
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.070
<v 2>What, what are you carrying for food? I would.</v>

123
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.940
<v 1>Carry a Russian packs. So, and the Russian Pikes were pretty good.</v>

124
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.050
We had like chicken tikka, masala, spaghetti bolonaise um,

125
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.040
carbonara and each ration pack was around 800 kilocalories.

126
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.390
<v 2>Are you using our CA or these dehydrated? Yeah.</v>

127
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.650
<v 1>That's true. So you just boil the water in there. You wait about 15 minutes,</v>

128
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.640
mountain house, like that kind of a deal. Yeah. Yeah. Similar. That's it. So.

129
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.470
<v 2>You must be so looking forward to regular food by the time that's over. Oh,</v>

130
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.333
what's the first thing. Yeah.

131
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.340
<v 1>Um, you know, the, the one that I was protein, uh,</v>

132
00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:27.640
the one I was craving was just protein. So I was thinking of peanut butter.

133
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.630
You get a cheese on toast. Cause he had just mostly carbohydrates. Exactly.

134
00:07:31.631 --> 00:07:33.670
So I was like chicken as well as a meeting.

135
00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:35.590
I was just craving all of this big time.

136
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.730
I don't know what the first thing I say is your body knows what you need.

137
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.370
Exactly. Yeah. You've got to listen to your body. You've got to listen.

138
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.120
<v 2>Listen. I mean, it's hard to know. I don't, I'm not really sure what I hear.</v>

139
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.081
You know,

140
00:07:47.081 --> 00:07:50.890
you had an odd craving sometimes I'll crave an ice cream is that's what I'm

141
00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:52.720
supposed to listen to some ice cream.

142
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.420
<v 3>That seems weird. Yeah. He was.</v>

143
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.670
<v 2>We're just listening to cravings. That's yeah. Ridiculous.</v>

144
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.210
<v 1>Yeah. And I think, you know, you, it does. I think almost listening to,</v>

145
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.390
you've got to be stripped of all the,

146
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.780
all of the protein and what not running for you, your body currently, how many,

147
00:08:07.781 --> 00:08:11.680
I think if you fall, you crave an ice cream, you know, if you fall,

148
00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:15.430
you want a dessert. But I think if you're now at the point of not starvation,

149
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:18.460
but if you're really hungry and you know, what's good, what's not good. You,

150
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.960
I think your body gives a good tale sign of what you can at the last month of

151
00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:27.340
mission Yangtze. I was really bad. I was coming across cities every day.

152
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.060
Cause you can imagine like towards Shanghai, you come in across cities,

153
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.230
chemicals, towns, communities. And so I was just craving protein.

154
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.990
I was craving fats and a lot the time for that last month,

155
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.160
I was just eating really unhealthy, just getting in stodgy foods, dodgy,

156
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.390
fat protein, you know, there was fast food chains along the way, KFC,

157
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:48.400
you know that I sort of, yes,

158
00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:51.100
I was out of the Y the wilderness was like six months worth.

159
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.930
Once I'd finished the first half,

160
00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:55.090
it was gradual for then another two or three months.

161
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.310
But the last three months you'll go city after city or really built it high

162
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:01.080
population there. Um,

163
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.410
and I found that my body was criticized listening to my body, scraping fats,

164
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.720
craving protein, and yeah, you're right. It did get ridiculous.

165
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:10.800
I was going to these, you know, fast food and I, the translation,

166
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.860
I could speak Chinese a little bit. I was just going to ask you to get by.

167
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.500
<v 2>But some say Chinese, like which dialect?</v>

168
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.010
<v 1>Oh, there's over a hundred dialects yet. So that's where it got difficult.</v>

169
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.960
Oh yeah. Um, it was nails. It was nails really difficult.

170
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:29.760
So speak Mandarin. What do you speak your basic Mandarin basis? Yeah. Yeah.

171
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.180
Enough to just about get by, but I,

172
00:09:32.181 --> 00:09:36.900
I skipped all of the basics and went straight into the sentences. Where are,

173
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.890
where are there bears here? Are there bears are the wolves, uh,

174
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.630
where the water food in a shelter. So yes. Get a lot of the basics.

175
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.610
Weren't straight. Yeah. So those.

176
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.530
<v 2>Are two questions I don't ever want to hear.</v>

177
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.390
Are there bears here and where are the wolves not, are there wolves here?

178
00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:57.920
Where are they? Where all they up and you're out there walking yeah.

179
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.020
<v 4>For a year. Yeah.</v>

180
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.650
<v 1>Does it, um, for the first six months, specially sort.</v>

181
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.810
<v 2>Of for the first six months is mostly hiking in the woods.</v>

182
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.350
<v 1>It's hiking in the world in S on the Tibetan plateau.</v>

183
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.760
<v 2>Are you carrying your camp on your back? So you have a bivy sack.</v>

184
00:10:13.761 --> 00:10:15.230
Like what do you sleep in a tent?

185
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.790
<v 1>So we have 10 really wait sort of car last 10, get it up storm.</v>

186
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.900
<v 2>It's amazing how light they can get those things too. Now he did.</v>

187
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.240
<v 1>It because I had to carry all of the Phil.</v>

188
00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:29.620
We were filming for a documentary sites, carrot, electronics, and got too heavy.

189
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.550
<v 2>Now, do you, when you're,</v>

190
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.600
when you're in this tent to go with a double layer tent,

191
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.540
so you have provides more insulation, it's a little heavier,

192
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:40.370
or do you have like a really lightweight tent?

193
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.100
Just try to tough it out in the cold. We have.

194
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.600
<v 1>Uh, I had a double layer,</v>

195
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.670
but that's because the double layer was just so small and so

196
00:10:49.671 --> 00:10:53.300
light and it was a case of yeah. You know, that's your comfort,

197
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.700
that's your shelter and I'm going to be facing some.

198
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.770
<v 2>Yeah. That's what I was thinking. I was like,</v>

199
00:10:57.771 --> 00:11:01.880
you'd sacrifice probably the weight for just something that's going to keep you

200
00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:03.710
insulated in there. That's it? Yeah.

201
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.250
And do you have a pad that protects you from the ground? Yeah.

202
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.350
And then a mattress pad on top of that?

203
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.940
<v 1>Uh, yeah, we've got the part,</v>

204
00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:13.160
like the waterproof pad on the ground from the tent.

205
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.730
And then we've got to sleep in mat, uh, maybe about this, this thick,

206
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:20.120
about a half an inch to an inch thickness. Um,

207
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.740
and then I had a minus 25 or minus 30 degree Celsius

208
00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:29.310
sleeping bag and what that is in Fahrenheit. Uh, but that was,

209
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.990
you know, you got toasty inside. It can be minus what is the issue.

210
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.820
<v 2>With the ground though? Like,</v>

211
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.900
do you have to have an insulated pad to make sure that the ground coal doesn't.

212
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.740
<v 1>Get to you? Yeah, for sure. That's what the sleep and muddy. So it's sort of,</v>

213
00:11:42.741 --> 00:11:45.110
you can roll it down. It's really small, really tight,

214
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.190
really lightweight as well.

215
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.180
But once you roll it out and it's got like memory foam almost inside something

216
00:11:50.181 --> 00:11:53.770
similar and you have to, to, to blow in it, pump it a little bit more,

217
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.600
only takes 10, 20 breaths. Um, easy to pack away as well.

218
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.150
Representation from the core of the ground. It protects from there.

219
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.000
Cause that's what you need. You know, the ground, just.

220
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.150
<v 3>Dude, I've never been comfortable camping. It's always.</v>

221
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.020
<v 5>It's like, you wake up like popping. Yeah, you're awake.</v>

222
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.660
<v 2>You made it, but it's still you feel, yeah.</v>

223
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.950
<v 1>You can do, you do get used to it. But, um, especially after the tracking,</v>

224
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:25.230
we were covering 50 kilometers some days. What are we carrying about 20,

225
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.450
25 miles, especially in the Tibetan plateau.

226
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.540
So after that day's Trek only two ration packs per day.

227
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.720
So you're taken in 1,600 calories.

228
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.070
<v 2>That's not a lot, not a lot. We will. And we were carrying, did you lose?</v>

229
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.610
<v 1>I probably by, and I've still lost weight now about 13,</v>

230
00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:45.750
12 to 13 kilograms, I would say in weight, uh,

231
00:12:45.751 --> 00:12:48.480
which over the year was I lost the same amount in Mongolia.

232
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.190
<v 2>32 Pounds summit.</v>

233
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:55.410
<v 1>About 32. Is it 32 pounds? Yeah. So, um, wow. That's a lot of weight to lose.</v>

234
00:12:55.411 --> 00:12:57.360
You're not a big guy. Yeah. That's it.

235
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.170
<v 2>Man. That must've been, you must've been really drawn out at the end big time,</v>

236
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.190
although it.

237
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.680
<v 1>Kind of worked itself out because towards the end,</v>

238
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.530
that's coming across more food. Didn't need my, my ration packs, of course.

239
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:12.390
So it was coming across more, um, restaurants, I can collect food as I, as I go,

240
00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:15.480
it's not solo and unsupported journey. Um,

241
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.510
so I was just utilizing that I was eating with the locals and I was, you know,

242
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.450
taken as much calories down as I possibly could whilst I was tracking.

243
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.990
<v 2>Did you pick like the, the type of meals based on calories?</v>

244
00:13:24.991 --> 00:13:28.080
Did you like when I'm talking about like the mountain house type deals or I

245
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.470
don't know what company you use? Oh yeah. Expedition foods.

246
00:13:31.471 --> 00:13:35.820
I think actually different ones that are more nutrient rich and more

247
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.720
calorie. Rich.

248
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.970
<v 1>Yeah. They have the smaller, lighter ones as well,</v>

249
00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:43.260
which you got about 600 calories. Um, they are smaller.

250
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.000
They are lighter, easier to pack,

251
00:13:45.001 --> 00:13:48.000
but I needed as much as I could possibly get in a special, they.

252
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.590
<v 2>Have a bunch of healthy options now.</v>

253
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.980
Cause a lot of CrossFitters are out there camping these days and yeah,

254
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.053
that's it.

255
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.150
I want to get that healthy paleo food while they're out there in the mind.

256
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.080
But the,

257
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.820
the what's undeniable has got to be for you is that once you've

258
00:14:02.821 --> 00:14:03.930
made those steps,

259
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.160
the first steps for the first day that you have this monumental thing in front

260
00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:12.960
of you, like what, what was that like? Knowing when you started like here.

261
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.040
Ready? All right. Bye Ash. Bye.

262
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.460
<v 1>Oh man. Yeah, it was exactly that. It was exactly that it was daunting.</v>

263
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.650
It was. So before we got to the, all we got to the source of the Yangtze river,

264
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:30.000
we lost, I think four members, when I say lost, they survived,

265
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.000
but they got altitude sickness. Um,

266
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.580
they were fearing for their lives because the bears cause of the wolves.

267
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.640
So before we reached day number one, before we reached the start line,

268
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.530
we've already got four members of the film crew of guides, uh, evacuated,

269
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.740
taken off the mountains, which brought me off the mountains as well.

270
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.780
Cause I needed to regroup with a different team.

271
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.630
<v 2>So everyone was scared and people also got out to sickness. I got up.</v>

272
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.900
<v 1>We are just over 5,000 meters. Oh my goodness point. Yeah.</v>

273
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.240
So it's equivalent to Everest base camp. I'd say, oh,

274
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.040
which you can get altitude sickness from really high that's 15,000 feet.

275
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.160
<v 4>Right. That is about that. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

276
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.920
<v 0>And there's wolves up there. There's wolves.</v>

277
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.870
You can run air. Yeah.

278
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.230
<v 2>What, how helpless would you feel at 15,000 feet when you see a pack of wolves?</v>

279
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.840
<v 5>Oh man. Yeah. And they're looking at you like you don't look too good, buddy.</v>

280
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.540
It's the bears that scared me the most. This should scare.

281
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.640
<v 1>Them. I can't do anything against the back end. It's a Wolf. Yeah.</v>

282
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.190
You can't do anything. Especially.

283
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.880
<v 2>At 15,000 feet, we can barely tie your shoes. of them as well.</v>

284
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.100
<v 4>Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

285
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.610
<v 1>We can't carry any weaponry. It's oh yeah.</v>

286
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.850
<v 2>Oh, sitting duck really can't carry any weaponry.</v>

287
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.070
<v 4>Yeah. Yeah. You can't even have a knife.</v>

288
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.680
<v 1>Uh, I tried, I took a knife out. Um, did I say, yeah, I took a knife out,</v>

289
00:15:53.681 --> 00:15:58.120
but I was taken from insecurity flying out to the west.

290
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.010
So I bought another one in Yushi yet.

291
00:16:00.011 --> 00:16:03.430
I did have a knife for the first month or two. Yeah. But again,

292
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.043
a pack of wolves.

293
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.520
<v 3>Yeah. You ain't going to do with it now. Yeah. Rip your ankles.</v>

294
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.000
Tear your legs apart. Yeah. Wolves.

295
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.450
<v 2>Are the nastiest hunters. Um.</v>

296
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.170
<v 1>And we had close encounter as well with uh, with the park. There was a, yeah,</v>

297
00:16:20.171 --> 00:16:24.520
there was a, a Tibet and he was trying to warn us. He was trying to say, well,

298
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:26.950
this is my, this is my angle. We were just talking to him.

299
00:16:26.951 --> 00:16:27.850
He looked a little bit worried.

300
00:16:27.851 --> 00:16:29.560
It looked a little bit stressful high on the mountains.

301
00:16:29.561 --> 00:16:33.190
He keeps pointing down a valley talking to into Tibetan. We didn't understand.

302
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.850
We just sort of waved off. Thank you. By big smile off we go say where it was.

303
00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:41.200
Me and my friend also videographer Kyle, we cracked on.

304
00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:44.740
But Kyle filmed all of that conversation. And four months later,

305
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.020
we find out that from a girl,

306
00:16:47.021 --> 00:16:51.730
from my editor team in Beijing who could speak to Baton that he was saying,

307
00:16:51.731 --> 00:16:54.220
right ahead, write down that valley as a pack of wolves.

308
00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:58.450
And only yesterday that it killed, uh, a local lady and China, you know,

309
00:16:58.451 --> 00:17:01.250
they were trying to get us not to go down there saying, don't go, well,

310
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:04.030
we didn't know. So we're like, oh yeah, all the best. Thanks. See ya.

311
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.270
And we cracked on her for the next two days. We were followed.

312
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.330
We believe we were followed by or stalked by a pack of wolves

313
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:16.090
and they cover bigger distance then than humans cover. You know,

314
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.390
for two days they would just howl in the same proximity. Same distance away.

315
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.183
<v 2>[Inaudible]. How do you go to sleep at night? What's that like?</v>

316
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.530
<v 1>Yeah, it was, luckily it was windy. The wind would pick up at nighttime.</v>

317
00:17:26.531 --> 00:17:27.370
So it rallied your tent.

318
00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:30.190
So you can hear the howling could only hear you on the day, but yeah,

319
00:17:30.191 --> 00:17:32.380
you still stood there your nice day. It's all just there.

320
00:17:32.381 --> 00:17:35.230
You constantly show and over to you buddy. Are you okay? You're just.

321
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.650
<v 2>Going to become a burrito in the middle of the night. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

322
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:43.180
<v 1>It was scary. I felt vulnerable, really vulnerable at that park bro.</v>

323
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.630
And the low, how many days were you doing this with the wolves? Uh,

324
00:17:46.631 --> 00:17:48.190
so it was two days that they were following us,

325
00:17:48.191 --> 00:17:50.280
but we were in sort of Wolf county. If you like,

326
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:52.860
for the best part of two or three months,

327
00:17:52.861 --> 00:17:55.650
I would say with the bears as well.

328
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.460
And the bears became an issue because I sort of went out there with a healthy

329
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:01.500
mindset. As long as I leave the bears alone,

330
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.540
the bears are going to leave me alone. Right.

331
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.520
That the locals were telling me otherwise.

332
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.410
And they would start showing me photos,

333
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.460
star show me videos and sending me clips saying this happened only one,

334
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:14.460
two kilometers away from you or from where you are now, people were killed by.

335
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.330
People killed just running into, um, huts, killing families.

336
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.150
And they were trying to say that they're coming off the mountains.

337
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.133
Cause it's too cold.

338
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.450
They're looking for calories before they go into hibernation.

339
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.150
So we were there in the wrong season. Um,

340
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:31.470
and it's that that's terrified as the most, it was the stories of the locals.

341
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.740
And you know, if the locals panic, then you should definitely be panicking.

342
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.140
Is what I was saying. A lot.

343
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.370
<v 2>Of parts of the world where you have to be really worried about wild animals all</v>

344
00:18:40.371 --> 00:18:44.630
the time. Yeah. We here in America, for whatever reason, we forgotten that.

345
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.320
I think everybody that lives in a big city is basically kind of forgotten that.

346
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:53.000
But when you make that Trek, you realize like, oh, there's no rules out here.

347
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.470
There they'll eat. You they'll eat every deleted caribou. They lead a moose.

348
00:18:57.471 --> 00:18:59.230
Why wouldn't they queue one of the things,

349
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.130
your special didn't even know what the you are.

350
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.880
It's probably the only thing that keeps you alive is they haven't eaten a person

351
00:19:04.881 --> 00:19:05.570
lately.

352
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:08.690
<v 1>Yeah. And they take, like you said, caribou, they can take the bears.</v>

353
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:13.100
They're going to caribou and moose, moose, a huge as well.

354
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.353
My friend.

355
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.170
<v 2>Watched a moose kill, uh, or excuse me, watched a bear,</v>

356
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.570
kill a moose on a spotting scope.

357
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.340
He was looking through a spotting soap and he saw a bear SWAT down the back of a

358
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:30.620
moose, just break its back terrified. He said the grizzly hit the moose so hard.

359
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.620
It's snapped its back Jay I'm like.

360
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:38.180
<v 1>What? The power [inaudible] and they are big on there. The,</v>

361
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.830
the moose is huge.

362
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.190
<v 2>Yeah. This bear swatted that thing and broke its back. And he said, yeah,</v>

363
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.920
he watched it go down. He watched this chase.

364
00:19:45.921 --> 00:19:48.470
There's like this alternation between this bear and the moose.

365
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.520
And he stayed on it and the bear gets a hold of the most just swats.

366
00:19:52.521 --> 00:19:54.800
It the most is like, I got to get the outta here. And the bear, I was like,

367
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.450
you going nowhere? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Those animals are up there in China too.

368
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.650
They're very similar type of bear. Right? It's a type of brown bear. The same.

369
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.840
<v 1>Type of brown bay. Yeah. Slightly. You've got the big ones here.</v>

370
00:20:05.841 --> 00:20:07.790
Haven't you had the Grizzlies in the last night.

371
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.040
<v 2>They killed them all to California.</v>

372
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.820
Everything that they had that was here in California. It's on our, our flag.

373
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.790
It's our state flag. If you look at the California state flag,

374
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.360
there's a giant grizzly bear in the middle of the California state flag because

375
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:24.170
he used to be an issue here. They killed so many people that we just killed.

376
00:20:24.171 --> 00:20:25.550
All the bears not wait. I wasn't.

377
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.620
<v 4>Here yet. Yeah. Wow.</v>

378
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.420
<v 1>I didn't know that. Yeah. So there's a north in Iowa.</v>

379
00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.730
<v 4>That's it right there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're nowhere near here.</v>

380
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.800
<v 2>You got to go up into like Vancouver.</v>

381
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.980
British Columbia has what's the British Columbia has a lot of buildings.

382
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.210
They have a Montana has, um, Montana has Grizzlies. Wyoming has Grizzlies,

383
00:20:44.211 --> 00:20:46.700
Colorado may or may not my friend Adam saw them there,

384
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.930
but they're not in California anymore. And it's just because they killed them.

385
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.370
There's actually a town named after the last guy who died. Lavette California.

386
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.010
The last guy got killed by a grizzly bear.

387
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.470
<v 1>Just out, out hunting. Was it August? Probably.</v>

388
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.580
<v 2>Being a dude that was alive back then. Terrifying.</v>

389
00:21:03.581 --> 00:21:06.670
So you experienced this in China. You're you're what, uh,

390
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.370
what are your precautions? Are you allowed to bring bear spray?

391
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.750
<v 1>So we had an air horn. We had a whistle.</v>

392
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.200
A whistle. Yeah. So they say that the boat,

393
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.070
the biggest attacks happened from where Tibetans out farming,

394
00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:21.990
doing their business in the mountains. They,

395
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.320
they they're in the forest and they surprised they come up the top of the hill.

396
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.980
There's a bear there. And obviously the bears shocked at scared. And it just.

397
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.100
<v 2>Yeah, that does happen with bears in America as well.</v>

398
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:32.640
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

399
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.060
So they would say I'm pretty much take a whistle taken out or make yourself

400
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.330
aware. Well, wouldn't make the aware that you're, that you're present.

401
00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:41.150
You're approaching. Uh, normally they would be,

402
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:45.000
they would scare off they'd run away. But there was a local that told me that.

403
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.000
So they have these big Tibet masters. Have you seen the two better masters?

404
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.500
Like the dogs that God,

405
00:21:49.501 --> 00:21:53.580
the two pounds are terrifying more of a problem than the,

406
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.540
the wolves they were for me. Um, cause they can scare away.

407
00:21:57.541 --> 00:21:59.910
The wolves scare with snow leopards, the bears.

408
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:03.450
But this one local was telling me that he wasn't living in this garage,

409
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.520
which is like a white felt tent like a year.

410
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:09.780
He was living in a concrete hub and he had a courtyard with a fence.

411
00:22:09.781 --> 00:22:12.390
The fence was open, but just outside the fence it's to better,

412
00:22:12.391 --> 00:22:16.440
must've chained up. And he said that this bear wasn't phased about the Tibet.

413
00:22:16.441 --> 00:22:20.520
I must've walked straight past it into the courtyard and was scratching his

414
00:22:20.521 --> 00:22:23.730
steel door whilst he was hiding in one of his empty cupboards.

415
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.670
And it's lasted about 30, 40 minutes. And he was telling me this story

416
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.280
and scratch him, gets the steel door alone, just in a tent.

417
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.410
<v 6>In the wilderness. man. They're monsters.</v>

418
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.580
<v 2>If they weren't a real thing. If grizzly bears or brown bears, weren't real.</v>

419
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.870
And then they were in a movie, you'd be like what? The poor guy.

420
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.320
And imagine you, you like you, someone would ask someone like you,

421
00:22:46.321 --> 00:22:49.500
like why in the world, if you know, there,

422
00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:53.890
there would you gonna want to walk for that long? Yeah.

423
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.570
<v 4>Yeah. Well that's, that's it as poly people are with you.</v>

424
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.630
<v 1>Um, towards the start. So it was myself,</v>

425
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:05.700
it was two guides that I had to Baton guide so we can even communicate. Um,

426
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.210
but with safety numbers and we took a horse for the film crew,

427
00:23:09.211 --> 00:23:12.210
but the film crew got altitude sickness and left us with the horse,

428
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.440
which I named Casta choy. We haven't seen the movie face off. Yes.

429
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:21.150
That the badass Casta Choi I've got to Larry's I've got this thing where I name

430
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.400
like my bicycles or like carry the chicken.

431
00:23:23.401 --> 00:23:26.550
We'll get to that code of chicken and Madagascar. I've been given them old,

432
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.770
crazy, ridiculous grinding names. And I was like,

433
00:23:28.771 --> 00:23:32.040
this horse is the last one standing by us. My, my crew, my,

434
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.610
my guides are suffering with altitude sickness and being taken off the

435
00:23:35.611 --> 00:23:39.090
mountains. You've got this horse still suffering with altitude sickness.

436
00:23:39.091 --> 00:23:40.560
Never knew that, but apparently horses can,

437
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.420
animals can suffer with altitude sickness,

438
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.710
but is there like a badass still going? So it's just me, him. And I'm like,

439
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.330
I can't give you a granny's name or elder or dot or Gertrude and giving you

440
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.690
Casta choice. Okay.
