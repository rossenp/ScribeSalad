00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I read your story. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.720
I saw a thing about you on NPR and, uh, it's crazy.

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.160
You've converted. How many people? 200 KKK members you've got them to.

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.080
<v 1>Drop their robes, right? Some directly, some indirectly. Yes. How.</v>

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.913
<v 0>Did that all happen?</v>

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.750
<v 1>Wow. &lt;laugh&gt; uh, you know, I keep running into these guys. I'm,</v>

7
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.070
I'm a musician by trade, right? Blues, musician, right? Rock and roll blues,

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.470
swing jazz. My degree's in jazz, but Hey, I'll,

9
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:32.590
I'll play whatever you want me to play.

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.670
&lt;laugh&gt; you're paying on playing &lt;laugh&gt; so, um, you know,

11
00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:40.270
everybody likes music, you know, even the KKK &lt;laugh&gt;. So

12
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.860
use that to, uh, to my advantage. Um, I was playing at a bar one night in, uh,

13
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:49.620
Frederick, Maryland, an all white bar. And when I say all white,

14
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.540
I don't mean that blacks couldn't go in. What I mean is that, uh,

15
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.780
blacks chose not to go in. They weren't welcome.

16
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.980
And here I was in this bar with this country band, a friend of mine's band.

17
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.170
I was only a black guy in the band, only guy in the bar.

18
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.170
And upon finishing the first set this, um, I'm walking to,

19
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.450
to the band table and somebody came up and put their arm around my shoulder.

20
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.450
I turn around and see who it was. There was a white gentleman, maybe 15,

21
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.650
18 years older than me. And, um, he says, yeah, yeah,

22
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:20.330
I really enjoy your alls music. I said, thank you. I shook goes and,

23
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.160
and he pointed at the age and said, you know, I've seen this here band before,

24
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.000
but I had never seen you before. Where'd you come from? And I explained, yeah,

25
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:30.480
you know, they told me they played here before,

26
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.920
but this is my first time in this place. I just joined the band. And he said,

27
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:36.480
well, man, I really like your piano playing.

28
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.880
This is the first time I ever heard a black man play piano,

29
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.270
like Jerry Lee Lewis. And I wasn't, um,

30
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.550
I wasn't offended, but I was rather surprised. Cause as I said, you know,

31
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:52.470
this guy's like maybe 15 years older than me. And he didn't,

32
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:55.910
he did not know the, uh, black origin of Jerry.

33
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.470
There was a style of piano playing. Um, I, I explained it to him.

34
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.500
I got it from the same place Jerry Lee did from black blue and boogie woogie

35
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:08.580
piano players where the guy was incredulous. Oh no, no, no. Jerry invented that.

36
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.180
I never heard no black man play like that. So for you something, okay,

37
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:16.100
well this, this guy never heard of little Richard or, or uh, fast domino.

38
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.420
And uh, I said, look, man, I know Jerry Lee Lewis, he's a friend of mine.

39
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.530
He's told me himself. We learned how to play. The guy did not buy that.

40
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:27.970
I need Jerry Lee. He didn't buy that Jerry Lee or anything from black people.

41
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.690
But he was so fascinated that he wanted to buy me a drink.

42
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.890
I was like a novelty to him. So I went back to his table.

43
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.490
I had a cranberry juice. And then he announces,

44
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.690
this is the first time I ever sat down, had a drink with a black man.

45
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.960
And now I'm, I'm the one who's incredulous. Like how can that be? You know,

46
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.320
I'd sat down with thousands of white people. Anybody else had a meal,

47
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.200
a beverage, a conversation. How is it that this guy had never done that?

48
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.320
And innocently, I asked him, I said, why he didn't answer me at first,

49
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.000
he stared down at the table top and I asked him again,

50
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.840
and his buddy sitting next to him, elbowed him in the side and said, tell him,

51
00:03:05.841 --> 00:03:08.560
tell him, tell him. I said, tell me, you know,

52
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:12.280
I'm trying to figure out what is mystery. He at me just is playing this day.

53
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:15.960
And he says, I'm a member of the KU Klux clan. Well,

54
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.030
I burst out laughing &lt;laugh&gt; you know,

55
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.310
cause it was getting weirder by the second half &lt;laugh&gt;. Yeah. And uh,

56
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.350
I knew a lot about the clan. Uh,

57
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.470
I I'd been studying racism since I was a 10 year old kid cuz of an incident that

58
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.670
happened to me back then. And I bought both on black supremacy, white supremacy,

59
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.270
the KKK, the Nazis, and neo-Nazis um,

60
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.380
to hard to understand this mentality.

61
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.500
And I knew a Klansman would not come up and just throw his arm around some black

62
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.180
guy's shoulder and praise his talent and want to, you know,

63
00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:49.580
hang out with him and buy him a drink. So you know,

64
00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:50.660
this guy's jerking me around.

65
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.380
So I'm laughing and he goes inside his pocket and pulls out his wallet and

66
00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:58.860
produces his Klan membership card. They have cards. Oh yeah, yeah.

67
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.770
And he gave me his, uh, card. I looked at it and I recognized the, uh,

68
00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:07.330
clan insignia, which is a, uh,

69
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:11.170
red circle with a white cross and a red blood drop in the center of the cross.

70
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.690
And I realized, oh man, this thing's for real. So I stopped laughing.

71
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.970
It wasn't funny anymore. And I gave it back to him and we,

72
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.880
we chatted about the Klan and different things.

73
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.200
But the dude gave me his phone number and wanted me to call him

74
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.680
whenever I was to return to this bar. So he could bring his friends,

75
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.200
meaning Klansmen and Klans women to see this black guy play like Jerry Lee.

76
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.150
I'm not sure. He called me a black guy to his friends, but, but uh,

77
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.790
I said, I'll call you. Wow. So, um,

78
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.190
I would call him every six weeks on a Wednesday or Thursday and say, Hey man,

79
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:50.270
you know, we're down at the, uh, silver dollar, you know,

80
00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:51.430
Friday and Saturday coming on out,

81
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.470
he'd come out both nights and he'd bring Klansmen and Klans women and they'd

82
00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:59.710
come and gather around the bandstand and watch me for the piano or get out there

83
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:02.380
and dance to our music. Now, you know, they,

84
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:06.220
they didn't come in robes and hoods, right. They came in street clothes and um,

85
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.260
on the break I would go to his table, say hello. Some of them were very curious.

86
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.820
They'd hang out there and want to meet me and talk to me.

87
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.580
Others would see me coming and get up and take off and go stand some other part

88
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:20.620
of the room where it's like, I just wanna see you.

89
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:25.010
I don't wanna deal with you kind of thing. Mm. So that was fine. And um,

90
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.210
I decided later on I would write a book because I had been

91
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:35.410
looking for an answer to a question that I had formed when I was age 10.

92
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.130
My question was, how can you hate me when you don't even know me?

93
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.120
And this was a result of having marched in a Cub scout

94
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:50.640
parade at the age of 10 being the only black scout in this, uh, parade.

95
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.520
And while most people on the streets and sidewalks were cheering us,

96
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.320
uh, we were marching from Lexington to Concord, Massachusetts to, uh,

97
00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:02.920
commemorate the ride of Paul Revere.

98
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.200
And people were like waving flags and yelling and screaming.

99
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.520
The British are coming and all of the time,

100
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.680
except for one small pocket of people who were throwing rocks and bottles at me

101
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.070
and at age 10, um, my first thought was, oh,

102
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.990
those people over there don't like the Scouts. That's how naive I was.

103
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.030
It wasn't until my den mother, my Cub master,

104
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.350
my troopleader all came rushing over and huddled over me with their bodies.

105
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.623
These are white people.

106
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.790
And they escorted me out of the danger that I realized I was only target.

107
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.100
Nobody else was getting this protection.

108
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.500
And these were adults or these were other children. These were a couple, uh,

109
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.260
it was maybe about five people. I remember that, you know, a couple kids,

110
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.700
maybe my age, a year older, uh, and some adults,

111
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.140
adults were throwing rocks and bottles at a 10 year old boy. That's correct.

112
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.030
Yeah. Wow. And, um, you know, I &lt;affirmative&gt;,

113
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.190
I kept saying to, to my, uh, my scout leaders, I didn't do anything.

114
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.510
I didn't do anything. Cause now I'm trying to find out what did I do? Right.

115
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.790
You know, why are they doing this to me? Right.

116
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.750
And they kept you knowhushing me and telling me to hurry it, move along.

117
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:14.350
It'll be okay. So they never answered the question as in why this was happening.

118
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.270
When I got home that day after this parade, my,

119
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.380
my mother and father who were not there were putting cure Chrome and bandaids on

120
00:07:22.381 --> 00:07:26.260
me and asking me, how did I fall down and get all scraped up?

121
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.940
I told 'em I didn't fall down. I told them exactly what had happened.

122
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.500
And for the first time in my life,

123
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.060
my mom and dad sat me down and explained to me what racism

124
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.570
was. &lt;affirmative&gt; at the age of 10,

125
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.970
I had never heard the term racism. Now what, what year was this?

126
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.970
1968. Okay. Um, I'll tell you why,

127
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.690
because my dad was a us foreign service.

128
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.170
So we spent a lot of time overseas. Every two years,

129
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.170
you go to a country you're there for two years,

130
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.080
come back home for a few months and then you get reassigned to another country.

131
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.240
So when I was overseas, uh, in elementary school,

132
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.640
my classes were filled with kids from all over the world.

133
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.240
Anybody who had an embassy in those countries,

134
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.760
all those embassy kids went to the same school.

135
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.990
My class was full of kids from Nigeria, Italy, France, Germany, Japan,

136
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.310
Russia, you name it. Um,

137
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.190
if you were to open the door to my classroom and stick your head in,

138
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.030
you would say, this looks like a United nations of little kids,

139
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.830
cuz that's exactly what it was. And we all got along.

140
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.550
Then I would come home after that two year assignment.

141
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.500
And I would be in either all, all black schools or all white schools,

142
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.140
I'm sorry, all black schools or all black and white schools, meaning the, uh,

143
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:50.620
still segregated or the newly integrated schools.

144
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.320
And there was not the amount of diversity in my classroom that I had overseas.

145
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.800
Today. You walk into a classroom, you know,

146
00:08:57.801 --> 00:09:02.800
you can't tell where people people are from, from all over. So literally, um,

147
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.440
between 1961 and like 19 68, 19 70,

148
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.440
I was living about 12 years into the future when I was living overseas

149
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.390
because that, that multi cultural scene had yet to come to this country.

150
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.150
And um, when it did, of course I was already prepared.

151
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.670
Unfortunately many of my peers were not.

152
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.950
So I didn't experience racism had I lived here. My, you know, my whole life,

153
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:35.500
I might have had a different perspective and not taken this path. Um,

154
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.580
so I was very curious about it and fascinated with it.

155
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:41.220
Like how can somebody hate you? And they don't even know you.

156
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.540
It was just beyond my comprehension.

157
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.700
And I knew something was wrong because the people who did this to me

158
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.420
did not look any different than my little French friends, my Swedish friends,

159
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.450
or my fellow Americans from the embassy or for that matter.

160
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.130
My fellow Americans right there, you know, at the school where I went,

161
00:10:00.131 --> 00:10:05.090
where we did the March. So I knew it wasn't a color thing.

162
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.330
In fact, when my parents told me this, I did not believe my parents.

163
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.010
I thought for some reason,

164
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.970
my parents are lying to me cuz my 10 year old brain could not process the ID.

165
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.040
DIA that someone who had never seen me had never spoken to me,

166
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:25.080
knew nothing about me would want to inflict pain upon me for no other reason

167
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:26.120
than the color of my skin.

168
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.920
So I did not believe them well a month and a half later,

169
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.000
that same year, 1968 on April the fourth,

170
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.150
Martin Luther king was a assassinated. And I remember it very well. Uh,

171
00:10:40.151 --> 00:10:44.990
we were in Massachusetts, same place and uh, nearby Boston, Washington, DC,

172
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.390
my hometown, Chicago, Illinois, uh, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore,

173
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:51.450
Richmond,

174
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:55.950
LA all burned to the ground with violence

175
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.700
and destruction all in the name of this new word that I had learned called

176
00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:05.460
racism. And so then I realized my parents had told me the truth,

177
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.020
this, this phenomenon called racism does exist,

178
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.860
but why I didn't understand why. Okay. So it's here, but why?

179
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.460
And so that's when I formed that question, how can you hate me?

180
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:18.850
We don't even know me.

181
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.370
And so I've been looking for the answer to that question now for 51 years,

182
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.850
I'm uh, 61 years old. So, um, after I,

183
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.810
uh, I, I, um, met this Klansman sh oh, maybe I don't know,

184
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.170
three or four months later,

185
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.920
I quit that band and went back to playing rock and roll and blues and R and B.

186
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.040
And then it dawned on me darl. You know,

187
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.920
the answer that you've been seeking since age 10 fell right into

188
00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:49.920
your lap. Um,

189
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.680
who better to ask that question question of how can you hate me when you

190
00:11:55.681 --> 00:12:00.640
don't even know me then to ask it of somebody who would go so far as

191
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:05.560
to join an organization whose whole premise has been hating people

192
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.040
who do not look like them and who do not believe as they believe.

193
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.080
And this organization has been around for over a hundred years,

194
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.910
somebody would go that far to join the KKK should sure have an answer to your

195
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.550
question. Hmm. So get back in contact with that guy.

196
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.030
And why don't you write a book? Cuz I had every book.

197
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.030
I still do every book written on the clan and they all were written by white

198
00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:32.950
authors obviously because a white author would have, you know, less fear of,

199
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.940
of Ram ramifications talking to a Klansman or interviewing them, um,

200
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.460
who would have easier access or could join the Klan undercover, get the story,

201
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.140
get out and write about it.

202
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.420
So my book became the first book ever written by a black author on the KU Klux

203
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.980
Klan, from the perspective of sitting down face to face,

204
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.170
I decided I would go around the country.

205
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.410
Interviewlan leaders there in Maryland where I live up north down,

206
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:03.210
south Midwest and west. And I, I said I would start right there in Maryland.

207
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:08.810
So I got a hold of that guy and I wanted him to introduce me to Thelan

208
00:13:08.811 --> 00:13:12.650
leader from Maryland. What was his reaction? When, um, when I told him,

209
00:13:12.651 --> 00:13:13.570
do you mind grabbing.

210
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.160
<v 0>The microphone? Just pull it, just pull it a little closer to, there you go.</v>

211
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.020
Okay. Perfect.

212
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.680
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what was his reaction when you called him up and said, Hey,

213
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.800
I want to know what makes you guys tick? Like why are you doing this?

214
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.600
<v 1>Well, actually &lt;laugh&gt;, it's a little funnier than that. Um, &lt;laugh&gt; the, uh,</v>

215
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.240
I, um, I found the guy's number, you know, from the bar,

216
00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:36.150
from the silver dollar lounge. And um, I called it,

217
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.870
this is like months later and it had been, it had been disconnected.

218
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.950
So I had to track him down. It turned out he had moved, he didn't have a phone,

219
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.790
but I was able to get an address. And so I had no way of no, you know,

220
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:50.510
letting him know I'm gonna come over and talk to you.

221
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:55.820
So I showed up at his apartment one evening and knocked on the door and um,

222
00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.500
I hadn't seen the guy in a while. Right. He opens the door and sees me, he goes,

223
00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.740
Darrell, you know, what are you doing here? And he,

224
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.420
and he steps out into the hallway and looks up and down the hallway to see if I

225
00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:08.500
brought anybody with me. And, and when he stepped out of his apartment,

226
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.860
I stepped in. So he turned around, he comes back in, he goes, what's going on?

227
00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:15.420
You still playing? What's going on? I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm playing.

228
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.930
But um, I need to talk to you with the clan. He says the clan. I said, yeah,

229
00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:22.850
you're a member. Right? Who? Well, I was, but I quit.

230
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.050
And he went into this long dissertation as to why he quit the clan.

231
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.570
So long story short, I said, I want to meet the Klan leader.

232
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:32.090
Did.

233
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.130
<v 0>He quit the clan because of his interaction with you?</v>

234
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:40.000
<v 1>No, not, no. &lt;laugh&gt; actually he, he lied to me. Um,</v>

235
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.440
yes, he was no longer in the clan, but uh,

236
00:14:43.441 --> 00:14:47.520
what happened was he said he, he quit because he didn't, he didn't like, um,

237
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.560
their, their, uh, ideology. I later found out, um,

238
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.520
in my research that, and I got this from the guy who banished him, the,

239
00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.640
the leader of the, of that particular claim group. Banished. Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.920
That's their term. They banished you &lt;laugh&gt; okay.

241
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:13.750
<v 2>I.</v>
