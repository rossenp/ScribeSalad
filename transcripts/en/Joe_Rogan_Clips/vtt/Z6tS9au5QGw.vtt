00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.820
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know,</v>

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:04.770
the radical honesty people have you seen this group?

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.410
It's the people that are like, you never lie about anything.

4
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:09.720
So it's this weird social experiment where they're just like, you know,

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.250
where they're, where they're with their loved ones or whatever.

6
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:13.230
And the loved ones were like, do you like my shirt? And they're like, no,

7
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.600
it looks bad. And you've gained weight. Right. And like, there's, it's,

8
00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:20.940
it's radical transparency about everything. And that,

9
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.340
that I understand where they're coming from. Right.

10
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:26.430
It's like this thought that like, we're all sort of laid bare to each other. Um,

11
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.340
but also like, it's great that we can keep things private. Like,

12
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:31.830
what we live in right now is the sort of grassroots. I mean,

13
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.830
I call it a grassroots panopticon. Right. We're all watching each other,

14
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.070
but it's not the government. It's not big brother. We're big brother. Right.

15
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.010
And that I want to keep stuff. I like, I like PR, like, I.

16
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.430
<v 1>Know what you're saying. I don't want you to look at my brain.</v>

17
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.750
I know what you're saying.

18
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.910
<v 2>I agree with you to a certain extent. But however, um,</v>

19
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.470
I'm a standup comic.

20
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:55.820
And one of the things that I love about being a stand-up comic is my friends are

21
00:00:55.821 --> 00:01:00.410
all brutally honest and they with me and we with each other Lego. I said,

22
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.740
do you like this shirt? And he'd be like, no dummy. It looks stupid on you.

23
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.050
They will say something like that. We both be like, ah,

24
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.750
they would say something like, do you think I gained weight? Like, you know,

25
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:12.530
you gain weight. Get on the scale. You fat. And they'll say that to you.

26
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.090
And I started laughing. We w there's no, in the comedy world,

27
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.540
like in the world of my friends, there's no room for dishonesty.

28
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.890
And if they think you're bullshitting,

29
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.140
they don't want to talk to you because it's no fun.

30
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.640
I think comedians are uniquely.

31
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.700
<v 0>Strong in that way though. I, so as someone to write for me,</v>

32
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:31.160
like my thing was like rationale. Like I liked rationality was like, oh,

33
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:33.680
we have a good argument. Like, I'll just have a logical argument with you.

34
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:36.770
Right. But like one of the things I realized and this one, you know,

35
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:38.430
when I was there at that place in,

36
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.480
in Florida where this charlatan is killing people,

37
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.040
I can't just tell those people the truth. That's crazy. I wish I could,

38
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:49.940
but they're dying and they're in pain and there's certain people who are

39
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:53.450
constitutionally. They like honesty all the time. They thrive on it,

40
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.430
even when they're in pain. Right.

41
00:01:55.431 --> 00:02:00.260
But there's a lot of people where logic or honesty.

42
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.820
That's just not the, that's not, they're going to suffer. They're going to,

43
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:05.930
they're going to suffer. No.

44
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.960
<v 2>I, I agree. I think you're right about that. That there's,</v>

45
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.210
there's certain people that you really shouldn't like, you know,

46
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.930
if you're talking to a delicate person and they ask you a question and it's,

47
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:17.210
there's nothing wrong with just being complimented. Well, you look good.

48
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:20.540
You look great. You look great. I like doing that too. I have a kid.

49
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.170
<v 0>One of my things, my wife, so my kid would come to me with drawings. Right.</v>

50
00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:26.570
You're like, you know, kid comes with a trunk. Right. And she'd be like, dad,

51
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:28.400
look at this and I'd be like, oh.

52
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.960
<v 1>I was like, I was like, Hazel, that's not your best work. And my wife was like,</v>

53
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:35.840
what do you mean? What is wrong with you? And I was.

54
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.270
<v 0>Like, well, I should just, I don't want her to like, and she's like, no,</v>

55
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.380
it's a kid. She just wants love from her dad. Right. You tell her like,

56
00:02:42.381 --> 00:02:43.940
that's a great day. You know, did a great job.

57
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:47.720
And I don't want to infantilize adults, but like, there are times when I am,

58
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.690
when I just need, you know, love or like,

59
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:54.950
I need someone to keep their thoughts to themselves. Um, and, and, uh, yeah.

60
00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:57.530
I don't know. I, I, I know what you mean. I don't know.

61
00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:00.580
I haven't been in a lot of pain. Joe is the truth. I haven't, I've been,

62
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:02.830
I've led this charmed life. I've led it on. Someone said,

63
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.750
like I've led it on difficulty level. Like pretty easy setting, you know,

64
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.210
my, my personally life. And like, I've been lucky.

65
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.370
I haven't been like super sick,

66
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:17.140
like who knows what kinds of crazy healing therapies I would be into.

67
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.531
I mean,

68
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:21.790
there was a guy there's a guy at duke who specializes in ALS Rick Bedlack

69
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.010
you, photos of him are incredible because he dresses in wonky outfits,

70
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:31.090
like flashy, like tuxedos and crazy ties and stuff. And I was like, Rick,

71
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:33.280
why do you, why do you dress in all these outfits? And he's like,

72
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.210
because it's the best,

73
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.890
because it's the best thing I can offer my patients is these

74
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.250
is I don't, I can't tell them the scientific studies. They're not here for that.

75
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:42.461
Right.

76
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:45.730
I don't have anything to offer my ALS patients in terms of like science or

77
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.960
rationality,

78
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.790
but what I can do is just make them feel lighthearted for a moment.

79
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:53.740
And I was like, do you tell them, like when they come into the office,

80
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:56.320
do you tell them like the truth, you know, which is like, basically like you're,

81
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.400
you're done for, you know, and he's like, you know, obviously not, right.

82
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.350
You don't just tell people who are in pain, the truth,

83
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.960
or at least you don't there's there's I dunno for me,

84
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:09.790
I've really pulled back from

85
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.470
I've really pulled back really recently from,

86
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.120
from the idea that truth-telling is the way to

87
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:20.950
engage with people who are in pain. Right.

88
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:23.170
I think a lot of what we're seeing right now with black lives matter,

89
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.950
a lot of what we see with, with, um, with transgender activism, uh,

90
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.010
all of the hot button, political issues often, right. Change is there's.

91
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:33.670
There are groups of people who have been in pain for very long time. Um,

92
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:36.670
and individuals within those groups have been in pain. And,

93
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.140
and that, I don't know. I think it's just important to sort of acknowledge that.

94
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:43.420
And I had a lot of trouble doing that. I would be like, well, here's the truth?

95
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:45.370
Like, here's your situation. Here's how you need to fix it. And like,

96
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:46.870
but that's not, I don't know. That's,

97
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:50.110
that's not necessarily it doesn't work and it's not necessarily what people

98
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:50.944
want.

99
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.400
<v 2>Yeah. Well, in those two particular subjects, too,</v>

100
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:54.960
you're dealing with people that are,

101
00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.240
that will get very upset if you do offer anything

102
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.103
that,

103
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.580
anything that contradicts their narrative.

104
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.670
<v 0>Yeah. Well, and if, you know, if someone's in,</v>

105
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.700
if someone's in pain or if someone's like literally trying, I mean, if they're,

106
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:16.020
if you're trying to change a situation for the better, right, there's all,

107
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:19.110
you can always throw nuance and you can always have a logical argument about

108
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:23.040
something, but I I've become, and I'm not saying like, don't say stuff. I I'm,

109
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:25.200
I'm very on board with like, you want freedom, right?

110
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:29.490
Like I want to be able to say, chiropractor's a. I want to do that. But like,

111
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:34.290
if there's someone who was struggling with chronic back pain forever and

112
00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:38.610
found a chiropractor and they come back from that chiropractor and they say to

113
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:40.110
me, Allen, for the first time in my life,

114
00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:42.690
I feel like there's some hope this chiropractor helped me.

115
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.240
If I have that thing in my brain.

116
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.020
<v 2>I don't say it. Yeah. I'm with you, I'm with you. I'd be like, that's great.</v>

117
00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:53.520
I'd be like, that's great. That's just being kind. Yeah. You value kindness.

118
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:56.310
And I think that's an awesome thing to value and I value that as well.

119
00:05:56.311 --> 00:06:00.260
And I think that's something that I've learned as I've gotten older is that you

120
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.080
don't always have to say what you think you could just be nice.

121
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.260
<v 0>And I've seen, I've saw, I saw you do this. Like I love this moment.</v>

122
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.210
I don't know. I forget which podcast it was on. You were like,

123
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.130
you were talking about something and then you were like,

124
00:06:09.131 --> 00:06:11.800
you looked down and you were like, wait, I think,

125
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.770
I think we're making fun of this person. And this is what you said.

126
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.630
And I feel like, and that was a moment, right? We was like, you want to like,

127
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.890
yeah, you want to be kind right. And, and honesty. It that's the difficult,

128
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.260
the sometimes ridiculous things or illogical things are the

129
00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:33.910
kind thing. And I I'm really struggling now.

130
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.340
And I hope, I just wish everyone were struggling to realize that that those are,

131
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.650
those are sometimes incommensurable values.

132
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.310
You can't sometimes be honest or tell the truth and also be kind at the same

133
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:50.190
time. Right. There's this book a God, what is it about a kid who's um, I,

134
00:06:50.191 --> 00:06:51.550
I can't believe I'm blanking on the book now,

135
00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:53.540
but it's a kid who was severely disfigured. Um,

136
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:55.080
and it was a book for young adults. And, uh,

137
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.880
and there's this moment in that book where one of the T the teacher puts on the

138
00:06:57.881 --> 00:07:00.820
board when you're given the choice between being right and being kind,

139
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:04.540
always choose being kind. And I was like, when I first read that, I was like,

140
00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:05.470
that's so stupid, man.

141
00:07:05.471 --> 00:07:08.470
You can be the way to be kind is by hoping someone be right.

142
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.140
Like tell them the truth. Right. But just to share.

143
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.800
<v 2>That thought, but I'm now in the group of be kind. Yeah.</v>

144
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.510
And as I've gotten older, first of all, I never sat out. I never,

145
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.123
I never,

146
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.770
I never went out with the idea that I would create something that millions of

147
00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:29.230
people would see, never, this was not a,

148
00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:32.770
this is just something that happened along the way. And as it was happening,

149
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.600
I became more and more aware of the impact.

150
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.540
And then the responsibility that comes with that impact.

151
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.820
And just through that process has made me a far nicer person,

152
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.130
because I'm also, I'm really aware of, you know, mean.

153
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.670
Like I never, I don't, I don't want to attack people. I don't like it. I don't,

154
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.510
I'd rather just not, you know, and I don't, I don't even want, like,

155
00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.940
if someone says to me before the podcast and they have before, Hey,

156
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:03.760
would you do me a favor and not talk about this weird thing that happened to me?

157
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.920
I'm like, I don't want to make you uncomfortable. I don't,

158
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.710
we could talk about a million things. You're a human being. I'm a human being.

159
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.680
There's not like a specific, I don't want, I don't want gotcha. Moments.

160
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.180
If you want to talk about something that's in your heart that you want to get

161
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:20.170
out, I'll talk to you about it, but I'm not, I'm not a mean person, you know?

162
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:25.000
And when I was younger, I was, and when I was younger, I was,

163
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.920
I was in the group of that, tell them the truth. They need to face reality,

164
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:34.480
get your together. And then, and as I've gotten older,

165
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:35.980
I've realized like, there's not,

166
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.900
that's me worried about myself falling short.

167
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.820
That's me worry about worrying about my own failures and then wanting

168
00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:49.120
to sort of reinforce my own philosophies and other people,

169
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.230
because I was insecure.
