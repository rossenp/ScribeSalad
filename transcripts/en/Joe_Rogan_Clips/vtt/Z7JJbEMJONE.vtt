00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.040
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Thing. Have you seen a hundred percent seen the, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:07.080
I watched on the plane the other day, the dickcheey movie with, uh,

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.120
I haven't heard it's great though. Oh, you must watch this.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.880
What's that called chain vice vice with, uh, Christian bale.

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.840
<v 1>Right. He gained like 70 pounds for it.</v>

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.990
<v 0>Unreal in this movie. He is great at everything he does.</v>

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.510
He's in a whole nother gear. He turns into this guy, man, and it's so crazy.

8
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.790
He's just a guy working for hallibur, you know,

9
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:34.670
he is running all this military stuff and has all this experience with,

10
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.590
you know, politics, but he is really just a business owner. So working,

11
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.150
what could he.

12
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.910
<v 1>Looks like? Incredible he's has.</v>

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.360
<v 0>Real.</v>

14
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.860
<v 1>How many fat guys saw that movie and go if I just lost Wayne, I have a crush.</v>

15
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.180
<v 0>Bear. Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.260
<v 1>It could be Batman, man. You got dead inside of me. I could be Batman.</v>

17
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:53.540
I got Batman inside of me. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean, I got these Pugy wrists and up hands,

18
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.380
but if I just, wow, he, I gotta see it.

19
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.393
<v 0>Is crazy.</v>

20
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.540
<v 1>In this. Is that him with, or they're next to each other?</v>

21
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.770
That next to each other. Oh, just picture, picture next to each other. Wow.

22
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:08.010
He got fat. Huh? He went for it. He really went for it, man.

23
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.450
<v 0>It's so good. You really? I mean,</v>

24
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.850
it really exposes that part of things. How close,

25
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.570
you know, you can he's he wants, you know,

26
00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:23.280
he's running a massive business. Makes military stuff.

27
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.320
So us having to do stuff, benefits him. Oh dude. It's tremendously.

28
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.400
<v 1>It's one of the most transparent scams.</v>

29
00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:32.480
That's legal in the history of the world. Yeah.

30
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:36.960
Just pause and think about how crazy everybody's going on about this Trump call

31
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.680
to Ukraine and whether or not there was enough to impeach him and all this

32
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.870
madness. He been going crazy about this, right? This is like, this is the topic.

33
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.470
And I've heard many Democrats go. There's nothing here, folks.

34
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.310
You gotta back up. This is not enough to take a guy outta office.

35
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.190
The Republicans are never gonna vote for this. Like you, you guys are you're.

36
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:58.590
You're making a big mistake here. Now think,

37
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.790
imagine a guy who's the vice president.

38
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.940
It of the United States who is also a guy who

39
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.540
used to be the CEO of Haliburton.

40
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.100
Then this guy decides to go to war under false pretenses.

41
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.180
They make up some about weapons of mass destruction.

42
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.140
They blow this place of smithines and then Halliburton

43
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.410
it's no bid contracts. I mean,

44
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:29.050
this wasn't someone saying I can do it for 3 billion. I can do it for 2.7.

45
00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:29.930
There wasn't any of that.

46
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.890
There was a no bid contract for billions of dollars to repair the places

47
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.130
they blow up &lt;laugh&gt; and he was making money off of it.

48
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.450
It's crazy. I think for the first year or something like that, I,

49
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.720
I wanna know when Dick Channey was actually making money off of Halliburton.

50
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:51.560
I think he had a band in his position or give up his stocks or something,

51
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.680
but it was a while. It was, it was,

52
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.000
it was one of those things where you're like, wait, wait, wait, you just left.

53
00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.620
You just left.

54
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.280
And then the company you just left is now getting no bid contracts in the

55
00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:06.240
billions, am I stupid? Right? How,

56
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.840
how are you allowed to do this on television in front of everybody.

57
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.080
<v 0>In the movie? And you know,</v>

58
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.240
in the movie also shows how much of the president's ear he really had, dude,

59
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.910
because the president, the George w him to win it.

60
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.590
He needed him to run with him to get the, you know,

61
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.670
the real like Republican votes at the time. For sure. Yeah. For sure.

62
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.710
No one else was, you know, could do what he could do. He needed them.

63
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.330
Yeah.

64
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.630
<v 1>He was, uh, deeply, deeply, deeply connected. Yeah. But it was also bushed.</v>

65
00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:40.980
Didn't want not doing any of that. Like you go ahead and handle it.

66
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.340
<v 0>Son. Yeah. Yep. That was the deal that they made fishing. At least in the movie.</v>

67
00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:46.700
That's the deal that they made basically. Cause he's like.

68
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.553
<v 1>Who plays Bush?</v>

69
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.900
<v 0>Someone unbelievable. It's what's his name? God. It's Sam Rockwell.</v>

70
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.580
I think it is. Yeah. Is it? Yeah. He's unreal. I mean,

71
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:56.220
this movie was so easy to watch.

72
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.020
I never it's one of those movies where like halfway through it. You're like,

73
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.730
I hope never ends hope. And Sam rock long.

74
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.530
<v 1>Who plays Bush. Sam Rockwell. Yeah. Did you ever see the moon move movie? No,</v>

75
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.810
just moon. There it is.

76
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.730
<v 0>You see the two billboards that Rockwell.</v>

77
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.970
<v 1>Looks like Bush. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; that's amazing.</v>

78
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.770
He's got the eyebrows down.

79
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.120
<v 0>Steve Correll destroys a is Donald Rumsfeld. Oh, of course he does.</v>

80
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.440
<v 1>Correll's a beast dude. He's.</v>

81
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.040
<v 0>Unreal in this.</v>

82
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:30.400
They make Rumsfeld look like basically what he was just a big duests that like,

83
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.680
you know, would get out and do his own thing.

84
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:34.800
And they'd have to control Rumsfeld. You wanna.

85
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.040
<v 1>Hear another conspiracy theory that you probably don't know?</v>

86
00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:40.000
It's gonna blow your mind. Let's do it the day before nine 11,

87
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.830
the day before the attacks Rumsfeld gave a press conference

88
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.230
where he talked about trillions of dollars missing the day,

89
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.030
then a plane slams into the very part of the building where they were doing

90
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.883
the accounting

91
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.170
blows up half the building of the petagon blows up a wall.

92
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.330
Donald Rumsfeld was on. Where was it? The white house lawn. Listen to this.

93
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.810
<v 2>This is a, I, this is like 10 minutes. But is that the Pentagon?</v>

94
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.130
This is on CS span. Yeah, you can look it up right now.

95
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.050
<v 1>Just li we gotta get to the quote where he says mentions $2.3 trillion.</v>

96
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.610
<v 2>In missing receipts. Talks about his quote adversary. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

97
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.080
<v 1>But see if you can just find the quote, see the just there's.</v>

98
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.640
I know there's YouTube videos. You're uh,

99
00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:30.280
what are you looking at is looking for.

100
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.520
<v 2>CSPA clips on here on CSPAN. You can usually get.</v>

101
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.360
<v 1>It there if you just Google it on. Don't even do that. Just go through YouTube.</v>

102
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.280
Oh, that's where the, um,

103
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.790
I know &lt;laugh&gt; have to see it cuz you hear him say it and you're like,

104
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:46.430
wait, what the did he just say.

105
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.670
<v 3>Not on foreignterrorist threat, but the.</v>

106
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.830
<v 0>48 Billion.</v>

107
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.880
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, there it, oh yeah. I think that's it right there.</v>

108
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.160
Let's see what it already spends. According.

109
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.920
<v 4>To some estimates, we cannot track 2.3 trillion in transactions.</v>

110
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.013
2.3.

111
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.273
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

112
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.720
<v 1>Okay. Now again,</v>

113
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.030
somebody told you that literally like right before nine 11 happened,

114
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.510
they said they, they couldn't track 2.3 trillion.

115
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.100
You'd go. No, that didn't happen. That did not happen. But it did happen.

116
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.693
<v 0>What the.</v>

117
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.590
<v 1>Yeah. So think about what Kennedy said. Yeah.</v>

118
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.100
Think about what you saw when you saw that vice movie. We're Dick Channey.

119
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.340
Who was the CEO of halurton becomes the vice president and gets billions of

120
00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:46.060
dollars in no bid contracts.

121
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.580
Now think about what we just saw with Donald Rumsfeld saying they couldn't find

122
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.940
$2.3 trillion. It know where, what?

123
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.740
I don't know mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't know.

124
00:06:56.741 --> 00:07:00.690
It seems like we should have had it. We'll we'll keep looking. Oh no.

125
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.490
The spot where we looked just blew up.

126
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.370
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

127
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.890
<v 1>What the hell? Find out if that's true. If the, it was the accounting office,</v>

128
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.370
cuz this is what I love to. I love to say it cuz it sounds good,

129
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.570
but let's make sure it's true. That that part blew up.

130
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.610
But either way that he did say,

131
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.760
and then they did get hit by a plane a couple of days later. &lt;laugh&gt;.

132
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.160
<v 0>It's unbelievable. It's so crazy.</v>

133
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.120
<v 1>And no one talks about that trillion. No one talks about two trillions two.3.</v>

134
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.040
<v 0>Trillion two trillions, bigger than most countries, right?</v>

135
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.840
That could build a whole nother country or something.

136
00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:36.600
That's 2.3 million million.

137
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.390
<v 1>Ooh. Isn't it? No, a thousand trillion is a billion, right?</v>

138
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.390
A no a thousand billion. How, how? No, it's not even. Yeah. Th well.

139
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.390
<v 0>A billions.</v>

140
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.870
<v 1>A trillion, a thousand million is a billion. Yeah. It is a thousand billion.</v>

141
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.750
A trillion. Yeah. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; a thousand.

142
00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:55.950
Billion is a trillion and it's &lt;laugh&gt;.

143
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.180
<v 0>It's 990 million, 2 billion, 3 billion.</v>

144
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.340
<v 1>Trillion. Is that really what it is?</v>

145
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.420
<v 0>It's 999 billion times two. Plus it wouldn't be billion.</v>

146
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.340
<v 1>Trillion.</v>

147
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.100
<v 0>A couple more billions. No.</v>

148
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.780
<v 1>It's we're so stupid. It's uh,</v>

149
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.740
a hundred thousand and then a million and then 10 of those

150
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.450
is right. Yeah. Or a hundred of those.

151
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.970
A hundred millions. A billion. It's a hundred. So it's a hun.

152
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:30.770
Each one is a hundred. Oh.

153
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.210
<v 0>Yeahtrillions a whole nother three zeros.</v>

154
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.810
<v 1>Another three zeros. Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.263
<v 0>That's so much.</v>

156
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.800
<v 1>How would you say that? Would you say, uh, look.</v>

157
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.800
<v 0>How big it looks written out. Oh my God. That's a, that's a million.</v>

158
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.400
So that's a billion. That's a trillion. That's,

159
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.440
the word billion is referred exclusively to as a.

160
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.000
<v 1>Million millions. A million millions. Okay. Wow. But how many is a trillion?</v>

161
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.360
A billion. Millions. &lt;laugh&gt;.

162
00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.800
<v 2>No, it's a million millions.</v>

163
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.440
<v 1>Uh, trillions and million millions. Uh-huh oh, well what's a billion.</v>

164
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.400
<v 2>A thousand millions.</v>

165
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:10.120
<v 1>Okay. That makes sense. A million millions. So it's 2.3 million millions.</v>

166
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.830
No. Whew. That seems like a lot to be missing. Yeah. Boom,

167
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.310
plane hits a Pentagon. Everybody stops talking about it.

168
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.790
When was the last time you heard about that? 2.3 trillion. Never.

169
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.790
That didn't come up all the times. We were talking about flight nine, three.

170
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.390
Let's roll. Remember that? Let's roll.

171
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:29.510
That's what they said right before they went up to kick her house.

172
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:30.950
And that's why that plane hit the ground.

173
00:09:30.951 --> 00:09:35.260
It didn't kill all the fine people that it was going towards the white true,

174
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.333
whatever.

175
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.340
<v 2>Outta here in British terms, British English, which is not American English,</v>

176
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.660
the word billion referred exclusively to a million millions,

177
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.700
however is no longer common. And the word is now used to mean 1000 millions.

178
00:09:48.701 --> 00:09:51.740
So if anybody is in another country and is confused, that's.

179
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.460
<v 0>Why it seems like if that would've.</v>

180
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.770
<v 1>Gotten, that makes sense. Thousand million makes sense.</v>

181
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:57.050
Million million doesn't make sense.

182
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.690
<v 0>It seems like if that would've gotten out that, that, that, that,</v>

183
00:10:01.691 --> 00:10:06.170
that money was missing. That the whole country could have revolted. Like,

184
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.490
I mean that's what, what did you do with our tax money?

185
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:09.970
That's our money right's.

186
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.970
<v 1>But that's a way to steal 2.3 trillion. If you're, if you go,</v>

187
00:10:13.971 --> 00:10:18.320
if you stole 2.3 trillion and want to cover red up, start a war, right? I mean,

188
00:10:18.321 --> 00:10:23.160
boom. Immediately everybody's freaking out. They can't believe what's going on.

189
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.010
I mean, that's what the tin, foil hat, uh, brigade would say,

190
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.210
what does this saysu scholars find 21 trillion unauthorized government

191
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:35.170
spending. Oh my God, this is recent.

192
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.840
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; 21 trillion in unauthorized government spending defense

193
00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:43.560
department to conduct first ever audit. Oh, they've never audited before.

194
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.320
Why would they audit? They just get free money.

195
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.720
They're not like a regular company, right? The defense.

196
00:10:47.721 --> 00:10:51.280
Department's not like a company where like all the stockholders are going, Hey.

197
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.480
Face. What are you doing? I got, you know,

198
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.440
a hundred thousand shares of your stupid company.

199
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:58.830
Your CEO's running into the ground. No, they don't even have to audit.

200
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.150
They don't, they don't do. They just take that Chah. Oh, we, we missing,

201
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.710
you know, 21 trillion or whatever, whatever. I don't even know what that is.

202
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.150
It's a thousand million billion or something. 21, whatever.

203
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.190
&lt;laugh&gt; come on. Doesn't.

204
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.030
<v 2>Even include the last four years. That's.</v>

205
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.900
<v 1>Just come on. So the last four years we've been good.</v>

206
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:21.460
Don't don't pay attention to that. Ha ha. Last four years, we,

207
00:11:21.461 --> 00:11:23.100
we haven't misspent at all.

208
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.020
Mm-m &lt;negative&gt; that's what Kennedy was talking about.

209
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:28.500
Literally not saying that anyone, you know,

210
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.940
I'm absolutely not saying nine 11 was an inside job. I don't think it was.

211
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.980
But I am saying that when things happen and disasters take place,

212
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.210
people capitalize on those disasters.

213
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.410
And if it's possible

214
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.770
that someone was going to set something up,

215
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.970
some sort of an attack and they're gonna do it because they were

216
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.000
in the process of stealing something or gonna steal something.

217
00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.320
It would have to be a lot, but like, wait a minute, what are they gonna do?

218
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.000
How much money would it be worth it to start a war that might be the number

219
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.520
2.3 trillion. That might be the number.

220
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.120
Like if you like what's how much would it cost to start a war?

221
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.750
If you're evil anyway. Hmm. We just start a war for a hundred million, man.

222
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.310
I can't spread that thin enough. You know, I gotta,

223
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.670
I gotta grease a lot of palms. We're gonna start a war.

224
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.070
Why are we starting a war? What's going on? Wow. We gotta get this oil man.

225
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.830
And I don't know how to do it. I'm thinking of just,

226
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.430
I don't like the world trade center. It's.

227
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.343
<v 0>Just.</v>

228
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.350
<v 2>It's hilarious. I just Googled. How much have we spent in Afghanistan?</v>

229
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.020
You wanna guess how much that number equal up.

230
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.940
<v 1>To? Okay. I'm gonna guess. Whoa, ever in AF Afghanistan.</v>

231
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.700
<v 2>No, no. This says, uh, published. Uh, the thing I just found,</v>

232
00:12:43.701 --> 00:12:48.140
which I was going off of congressional budget office reported report published

233
00:12:48.141 --> 00:12:53.060
in October, 2007, said, oh, could this is in a potential spending. Okay.

234
00:12:53.061 --> 00:12:55.210
Don't us. The number a potential spending. Then this is potential.

235
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:57.530
What they wanted to spend as of 2007.

236
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.330
<v 1>What they wanted to spend plan to spending. Well, how much did they spend?</v>

237
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.890
Did they spend more or less? Not.

238
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.770
<v 2>They think they spent way more. Okay. Let's.</v>

239
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.810
<v 1>Just guess what, how much, what do you think the number is? Geez.</v>

240
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.450
<v 0>This is a tough one. Um.</v>

241
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.370
<v 1>In Afghanistan, only in Afghanistan. That's what it says. Uh.</v>

242
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.440
<v 2>Actually it says IRA and.</v>

243
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.160
<v 1>Afghanistan, rock county. I'm gonna go with 113 trillion. Whoa.</v>

244
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.400
<v 0>That's a lot. That's a lot. I'm gonna go with, uh, I'm gonna go with, uh,</v>

245
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.960
100 billion. What is.

246
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.840
<v 1>It? They.</v>

247
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.160
<v 2>Conveniently planned on spending $2.4 trillion. Wow.</v>

248
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:37.870
Which was a very convenient at number after we lost 2.3, but he,

249
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.230
they spent closer to like six or so this.

250
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.230
<v 0>Is the worst. This is like,</v>

251
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:46.230
if you check somebody's accounting books and they just have stick figures with

252
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.990
Googley eyes, &lt;laugh&gt;.

253
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.350
<v 1>The fact is the exact same amount of money. Like what are the odds? Yeah.</v>

254
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.100
That is so crazy. But it's not like.

255
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.540
<v 0>We covered it.</v>

256
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.660
<v 1>Up. Good. They'll never imagine that that that's your laundering.</v>

257
00:14:00.661 --> 00:14:05.100
That's your money laundering war. It's not, but it is right.

258
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.980
Like if you're, if you are someone that makes weapons

259
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.060
and you have a huge contract with defense department and you have the ear of the

260
00:14:15.061 --> 00:14:16.730
defense partment and you know,

261
00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:20.770
you guys play golf and you dress up like drids and burning effigy

262
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.170
worship. MOIC the God. And you start talking and you say, Hey man, um,

263
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.410
what do we gotta do to keep his, I got these tanks. I'm making, they are a.

264
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.690
Wouldn't it be great. Try 'em out. You know,

265
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.170
tell me why I guy got a deal for you.

266
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.560
And they just walk around playing golf can. And the next thing you know,
