WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.230
<v 2>The physical strain that you guys put your body through is insane.</v>

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.700
And until you watch, like you guys compete and do all the,

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.050
like rocking, like running with the weight vest on and ever then yeah.

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.230
<v 1>It's insane. Yeah. Yeah. The games. So like the games,</v>

6
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:23.490
I like the big competition. It's like, it's, it's a wild show.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.410
Cause it's sometimes it's five days.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.500
Sometimes it's three days and we'll have like,

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.560
usually between 12 and 15 events over those days.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.020
<v 0>Do they let you know in advance what you're going to have to do.</v>

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.940
<v 1>Some, like, we might find out an event sometimes a week or two ahead.</v>

12
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.830
Uh, but then like,

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.030
we'll have others where we're literally finding out the event as we go, like,

14
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:46.080
as we're competing.

15
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.220
So we don't even know what we're doing on the competition floor. They'll buy,

16
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.270
they'll be like, all right, start lifting that weight.

17
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:54.000
We'll tell you when to stop. When you hit your number of reps, you know,

18
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.470
stuff like that. It's, uh, it's interesting to train for.

19
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.670
Cause you don't know if your training for a one rep max or a hundred, uh,

20
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:06.660
you don't know if you're training for a 40 meter dash or a marathon, you know?

21
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:09.630
It's yeah. It keeps it interesting. Like we've had,

22
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.060
we've had events that are like 20 seconds long.

23
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:16.560
And then a couple years ago we had to row a marathon on like the stationary

24
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:20.370
concept, two rowers. So like 42,000 meters. So it.

25
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.920
<v 0>Was that 26.2 miles rowing?</v>

26
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.980
<v 1>Yeah. Four. Yeah, 42,000 something meters.</v>

27
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.800
I think the average time was about three hours.

28
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.870
I think a couple people were like three and a half hours.

29
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.400
<v 0>Because he can't row as fast as you can run. Right. Kenya.</v>

30
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.780
<v 1>I mean,</v>

31
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.440
I would prefer to row a marathon than run one just because it's easier on the

32
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:45.270
joints. Like your goes numb just from sitting on the seat.

33
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.050
Um, but yeah, I mean, it was just easy on the joints.

34
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:50.850
They did it cause they were like, we tested it.

35
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:55.650
And like after you run a marathon, like you can't walk for a couple of days.

36
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.360
Like your body's just trashed with rowing a marathon. Like you're sore,

37
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.610
but you're good to go the next.

38
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.070
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.670
It really doesn't really though depend on the person and what kind of condition

40
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:10.260
you're in. Cause my friend cam Haynes, that runs a marathon every day. Yeah.

41
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.070
<v 1>I think if you're conditioned for it and that's all you're doing, you know, and.</v>

42
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.900
<v 0>But he lifts weights too.</v>

43
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.770
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I've I've met cam I've met him a couple of years ago. Got problems.</v>

44
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.870
<v 0>Does he? Yeah, he's crazy. He's legit, legit crazy. Like David Goggins crazy.</v>

45
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:28.020
There's a few people that I know that I'm like, what are you doing yourself?

46
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.920
Yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.460
<v 1>Yeah. I, I I'll watch cam and yeah, it runs a marathon every day. It's like,</v>

48
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.010
why, what are you doing? Well, you.

49
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.070
<v 0>It was terrible. He likes those ridiculous ultra races.</v>

50
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:40.050
Like those the I to forties.

51
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.310
<v 1>And stuff like that. Yeah. I got a buddy that does all those like 200 mile,</v>

52
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.440
couple days long. And it's like, all right, like I get that. That's your thing.

53
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.680
I don't get it. But.

54
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.410
<v 0>They're just testing. I mean, for cam he's just testing his mind.</v>

55
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.250
He wants to find out when it breaks, you know? And he, he can't break. Yeah.

56
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.840
And every day strengthens it.

57
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:04.360
So every day he's running massive amounts of miles.

58
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.760
He'll run like 19 miles in the morning.

59
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.240
Don't run like six miles in the afternoon.

60
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.700
<v 1>I mean, I wonder if like, if he's ever played with like other challenges,</v>

61
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:14.110
you know, instead of just running.

62
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.440
Cause I know like if I'm practicing the same thing over and over, you know,

63
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.110
you adapt to it, you get better at it. You get more comfortable with it.

64
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.810
And it's like, one of those curve balls get thrown at you.

65
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.240
If something that you're not used to. And I mean,

66
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:28.500
that's basically that's CrossFit. Right? That's what our training is. Like,

67
00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:32.710
we're trying to think of different things that can be,

68
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.730
be the test for us and figure out like, all right, if this comes up,

69
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.780
how do we deal with it?

70
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.490
<v 0>Did you get involved? What did, what was,</v>

71
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.830
did you just walk into a class one day and.

72
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.443
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

73
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.620
so I have a background in Olympic weightlifting did that for 10 years,

74
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:49.180
lived at the Olympic training center.

75
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.950
Like my goal was to go to the Olympics for weightlifting and then

76
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.450
that didn't pan out and like started focusing on school.

77
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.680
And then I just kind of, I guess just gained the freshman 15. So I was like,

78
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:06.580
all right. I either need to start working out again or change my diet.

79
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.590
So I was like, oh, I'll start working out. And uh, you know,

80
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:13.930
trying to find an Olympic weight, lifting gym,

81
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.970
is there like a needle in a haystack, but CrossFits are everywhere.

82
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.240
And so I just like Googled CrossFit near me cause they,

83
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.090
they use all the same equipment, like the barbells and bumpers.

84
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.690
And so I just showed up, introduced myself. I was like, Hey,

85
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.480
like I don't want to do your CrossFit thing. I'll be in the back room,

86
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.050
just doing clean and jerks and squats. And uh,

87
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.860
just kept doing that kind of showing up on a irregular basis.

88
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:43.150
And then one of the girls from the gym who was a competitor was just kind of

89
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:45.970
like bribing me into workouts every once in a while. Like, oh,

90
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:48.550
you might be good at this one, give this one a try, give this one a try.

91
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.960
And the, uh,

92
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.130
the owner of the gym actually signed me up for my first competition.

93
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.230
Cause he just, okay, I think you have potential in this.

94
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:58.390
You should give this a try. And uh,

95
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:01.450
so we made a deal that he signed me up and paid my entry fee.

96
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.410
And then if I won any money, he, I had to buy a pair of CrossFit shoes.

97
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.600
<v 0>And CrossFit.</v>

98
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.550
<v 1>Shoes. I mean, at the time it was like the Reeboks, like the minimalist shoes,</v>

99
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.400
like I was working out in air max nineties. And so he was like,

100
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.410
anything's better than that. And what year was this?

101
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.050
This would be back in like 2012. And uh, so anyways, I,

102
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:25.960
I won the competition, got a couple of hundred bucks and was like, yo,

103
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.040
this is kinda cool. Like just pocket money for a college kid. Like,

104
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:31.390
are there more competitions like this?

105
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:34.120
And so they showed me where to find these competitions.

106
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:36.280
And I just kind of started driving around the Northeast,

107
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:39.250
like all of new England. And if there was prize money at a competition,

108
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.690
I was signing up as I basically looked at it like a part-time job of like,

109
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:48.580
while I'm in school, full time and broke, I can make some pocket money. And uh,

110
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.950
yeah, just kinda, I was like, all right,

111
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:53.680
if I want to keep winning these competitions, I need to work on my weaknesses,

112
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:56.140
get better and then just kind of fell in love with it.

113
00:05:56.141 --> 00:06:01.100
And it just ratchet it up bit by bit until like I'm at the world

114
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:04.160
championships and I'm like, oh. How did I get here?

115
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.420
<v 0>And then you won over and over and over again, which is crazy.</v>

116
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.890
It's a weird start man, to something that you not just excelled at. I mean,

117
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.920
I think you're the winningest guy ever, right?

118
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.570
<v 1>Yeah. I've won one,</v>

119
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.270
the been on the podium seven times and I've won it the last five years.

120
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.530
<v 0>Bananas. Yeah. I mean, for someone who started off as like Lark.</v>

121
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.370
<v 1>Yeah. Um, I'm not blind to it. Like I'll be sitting in my fiance, like,</v>

122
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.970
you know, it's just one of these cool opportunities get plopped in front of me.

123
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.670
And I'm like, how, how did I end up here?

124
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.640
Like this wasn't supposed to be my life. You know, I was a mechanical engineer,

125
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:41.960
you know, like I thought my sports career was over with Olympic weightlifting.

126
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:45.320
You know, I broke my back. Like it was a whole, what did you do to your back?

127
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.480
Uh, broke my L five and two spots. Oh yeah. How, uh,

128
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.450
just training too heavy too often. And uh.

129
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.180
<v 0>It just fractured the actual bone. Yeah.</v>

130
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.480
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.410
Like the little wings off the side and it was on two separate occasions too.

132
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.640
It was like, they were like a week or two apart from each other. And uh.

133
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.490
<v 0>Hold on, you broke one and then you kept lifting.</v>

134
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.320
<v 1>Yeah. I didn't really have a choice.</v>

135
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.570
So I was living at the Olympic training center and like,

136
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:16.010
there was a lot of pressure on the program to like produce and I was on the

137
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:17.120
junior world team.

138
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.530
I was leaving for Romania and a couple of weeks compete and uh, yeah,

139
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:26.480
it was just, I don't know. I wasn't training as smart as I should have been.

140
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.930
And so the first one while I was doing like a clean poll,

141
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.090
so just like a dead lift with a big explosion at the top and like loud pop on

142
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:37.850
one side, I dropped the bar and like it,

143
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.460
have you ever seen those heat packs that have the little clicky thing in them?

144
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.530
It was, that's what it felt like when it like clicked and then it just like the

145
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:49.550
inflammation just spreading and uh, and so, you know,

146
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:50.900
go to my room,

147
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.850
lay down for a couple of days and then it was,

148
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.380
oh, I knew something was wrong. Like I've never had an injury like that.

149
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:01.340
You know, I couldn't move.

150
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.440
<v 0>Did you get an x-ray? Did.</v>

151
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.150
<v 1>You get an MRI? Cause it was like,</v>

152
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.060
I was leaving for the competition like two weeks.

153
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:10.700
So it was like too late to call the alternate to.

154
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.690
<v 0>Excuse me. So wait, do they know that you're this injured?</v>

155
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.700
<v 1>I mean, I told him like, Hey, I know, suck it up. I'm injured.</v>

156
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:22.640
And I was told like, Hey, there's a difference between pain and injury.

157
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.950
And I was like, okay, uh, I'll get back to lifting.

158
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.360
And so then a couple of days goes by and I'm being super cautious.

159
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:35.510
Like basically stripped all the way out of my training. I'm just moving.

160
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.780
And then, uh, what was it?

161
00:08:37.781 --> 00:08:41.270
It was heavy back squat and like load up.

162
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:43.490
And you're going for like a new one rep max,

163
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.120
like a week before you get on the airplane. And uh, yeah,

164
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:51.680
I hit the bottom of the whole left side goes, oh Jesus. And so anyways, I got,

165
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.920
went to the competition, did terribly, you know,

166
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.920
like the coach was like, Hey, what's your goal for this competition? I was like,

167
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:02.640
I just don't want to bomb out. I just want to make one, lift one lift in each.

168
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.470
And he's like, okay, we'll make sure that happens. I only made one snatch,

169
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:11.280
one clean and jerk. And then it was when I got back, I like put my foot down.

170
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.090
I was like, Hey, I'm not, I'm not lifting until I got an x-ray. And like,

171
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.280
they x-rayed it. And they're like, oh yeah, there's break right here,

172
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:18.114
right here.

173
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.920
<v 0>And what does the coach feel bad?</v>

174
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.320
<v 1>Uh, I mean,</v>

175
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.730
I feel for now that I have a little more life experience and like, you know,

176
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:29.220
at the time hated the guy. Um,

177
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.980
but now that I know the situation he was in,

178
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:35.070
he was under pressure for keeping his job to like, Hey,

179
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:36.270
you need to produce athletes.

180
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:40.680
Like none of the American athletes are doing well on the world. World scene.
