00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 1>Hey, holding up. Did I move you out of here at a bad time? Do you.</v>

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.040
<v 0>Think, I mean, we considered suing you.</v>

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.380
I was sitting there going, can I take legal action against him?

5
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:15.120
Like I called the lawyer and apparently.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.440
<v 1>Yeah, I'll give you free meals. Every time we go out forever.</v>

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.860
<v 0>I mean, I was on a bread line two days ago.</v>

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.790
My opener flies into town where it's going to fly out for shows all the flights

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.920
grounded. We can't go anywhere. I mean,

10
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:32.430
we're waiting outside of a supermarket for an hour and then we're eating fish

11
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:37.110
sticks in the dark of my house with no power. And I'm like, you know, Joe Rogan,

12
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:41.760
man, uh, this was a real leap of faith,

13
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.960
but it's looking better today.

14
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.260
<v 1>It'll be fine. It'll listen. It was a once in,</v>

15
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.260
they're calling it a once in 120 year storm.

16
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.650
But I think what that means is like ever recorded.

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.510
Like you go back to 18 hundreds. So what we're talking about, or 1900 rather,

18
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.190
like when, what was the, what kind of instruments were they? What were.

19
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.140
<v 0>They, what were they jotting down? Was.</v>

20
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.930
<v 1>The big thing back in those days. And how did that work?</v>

21
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.890
Cause that thing was apparently kind of accurate. It's kind of crafty.

22
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.963
<v 0>Crazy.</v>

23
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.490
<v 1>Crazy, like next year's. Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.450
<v 0>Yeah. And harvests and things like that. Yeah. What did they do? How.</v>

25
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.440
<v 1>Was, how did it work?</v>

26
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.430
<v 0>It was just wild driving around Texas and seeing nothing but snow.</v>

27
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.600
And you, it looked like Vermont, it looked like you were in the Northeast,

28
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:28.350
but it didn't.

29
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.820
It was like wild to be in Texas driving around and nothing was open.

30
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.470
So like gas stations weren't open, uh, fast food. Wasn't open,

31
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.420
nothing was open. No.

32
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.560
<v 1>Now tell you what was opened. The Houston airport. My boy, Ted Cruz is like,</v>

33
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.423
yeah, he was out.

34
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.620
<v 0>And by the way, isn't it sad that like, he couldn't get away with it. It's like,</v>

35
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:52.410
here's the thing about the Bush family say what you want about them?

36
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.560
Maybe whacked Kennedy bygones. But I mean,

37
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.760
now our leaders can't even get caught taking a commercial flight to Ken Kuhn,

38
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.893
like that's.

39
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.580
<v 1>But here's the thing, like what can he do? What is the,</v>

40
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.350
what is the reason for him staying?

41
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.950
<v 0>Well, I think it's just the optics of how it looks, but of course, no,</v>

42
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:13.110
he doesn't have any of couldn't. He make it warm out.

43
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.970
I don't think he has any power to do anything.

44
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.880
<v 1>Good. Maybe he should be there with blankets. The.</v>

45
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.580
<v 0>Funniest, like the people that hate them the most are the ones that are like,</v>

46
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:23.730
he should be there and it's like doing what? Well, here's the.

47
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.260
<v 1>You know, here's the thing though.</v>

48
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.270
He was one of the vocal critics of mayor Adler. Who's a Democrat,

49
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.760
but went to Cancun as well. Right.

50
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.170
<v 0>Everybody goes to.</v>

51
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.770
<v 1>Cancun. I think he was in king. Who was he in Cancun or was he in, uh,</v>

52
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.170
one of those thing out of the house? Yes.

53
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.990
But it was in Cancun or was it Puerto Vallarta? What?

54
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.910
It was one of those nice places in Mexico.

55
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.770
<v 0>And he wanted, and he's the mayor of.</v>

56
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.910
<v 1>Boston.</v>

57
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.780
He went down there and he was saying now is not the time to relax wa Cabo,

58
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.780
Cabo. So he went in there. I mean, that's the place to relax.

59
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.520
I mean, Sammy Hagar has got a song about it. I.

60
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.700
<v 0>Mean, it's crazy to watch.</v>

61
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.300
It's also crazy that he got caught and then he came back.

62
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.310
<v 1>Well, he said I was always coming back. I was being a good father. Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.660
So you had to put a spin on it.

64
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.830
<v 0>Dropping my field.</v>

65
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.760
I feel cause Ted Cruz is the face of the guy that always is caught.

66
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.660
Like he looks like the kid at school who gets in on the prank too late.

67
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.320
And then the teacher catches him. Like he just looks like he gets caught.

68
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:29.080
He's not, he's not one of those guys who gets away with it.

69
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.360
No matter what happens, he doesn't get away with it.

70
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.030
<v 1>No he's he's um,</v>

71
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.000
did you ever see those videos that they made where it was?

72
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.600
I don't know who released the full video, but the videos that they made,

73
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:44.680
where he was running for president and he sat down with his mom and he's talking

74
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:47.830
about, you know, I go to church every day and she's like, yeah, every yeah,

75
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.870
right. His mom threw him under the bus. Yeah. Every day. Yeah.

76
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:57.340
Yeah. It what I was like, you don't go to church every day. And it was like,

77
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.110
they had to retake scenes.

78
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.020
<v 0>Oh the whole thing's a nightmare. I showed it.</v>

79
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:05.620
How about somebody from the wife's group? Text leaked.

80
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.430
Cause they were inviting neighbors going as come the Cabo or wherever the hell,

81
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:10.330
come to Ken Kuhn.

82
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.340
And somebody leaked it to the New York times going here's the group tax proving.

83
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:16.420
They were inviting us all.

84
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.560
<v 1>I wonder how many moms were in that group? Text too many. Yeah. There's the,</v>

85
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.300
there's the video. This is great. But these things are always gross,

86
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:28.960
man. Those like sit down with your mom. Let's pretend the camera's not here.

87
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.213
Right?

88
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.970
<v 0>Tell everyone.</v>

89
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.810
<v 1>How good I am. I'm a good person right now. I'm I'm a God-fearing Christian.</v>

90
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.510
<v 0>Tell everyone what a good person your son is. Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.190
<v 1>He was very good though.</v>

92
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:43.660
I have to give him props because there was this one situation

93
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.610
where what, what was it?

94
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:49.000
It was a tech thing where he was.

95
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.040
<v 0>I don't.</v>

96
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.640
<v 1>Remember. God. We talked about it on the podcast. Jamie,</v>

97
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:55.600
do you remember what it was?

98
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.950
Where he was a calling them out for

99
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.320
God it's escaping me,

100
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.550
but I was actually kind of replatforming people or privacy. Yes, it was.

101
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.340
It wasn't like here is the video of him from the summer. He was like,

102
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.120
who the hell are I see? Who is he? Who is he critiquing though?

103
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.550
Who's he criticizing Google? Yes.

104
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.380
It says Ted Cruz on Google and big tech censorship. Yeah. There was a,

105
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.200
who the hell are you to decide who can speak? There was,

106
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.340
he was catching them in some hypocrisy and supplies and it was like,

107
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.720
it was very good the way he was doing it. And well-phrased oh, you gotta,

108
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:33.760
you gotta give a little, if you're gonna on the guy,
