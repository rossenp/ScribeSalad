00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.270
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um,</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.540
but then there are the people who are selling the antidote to their fears. I,

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.480
in, in the book, I call these people the dread merchants, right?

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.820
The people who are going to sell you the bunker, you know.

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.030
<v 1>Jim baker and his gym based food and his survival water. How,</v>

6
00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:21.800
how amazing of those buckets of food that you could use as the base of a table.

7
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.900
I love those.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.530
<v 0>Any, and he talks about using them as porta Johns, and, uh, yeah,</v>

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.360
but he sells the Bible buckets as well.

10
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.930
Have you ever sold buckets with the Bible books? Just a bucket full of Bibles,

11
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.980
just in case you need more than one Bible. I know. Yeah.

12
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.320
Well maybe you got a big family. Maybe you want to go old.

13
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:40.430
Testament of gets really.

14
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.263
<v 2>Weird.</v>

15
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.820
<v 0>Have you ever seen the Vic Berger remixes of the gym? Oh man.</v>

16
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:47.900
They are so much fun.

17
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.080
I got really addicted to those when I was working on this project,

18
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.490
that was kind of my, it became a must like a, um, a mantra, you know,

19
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.770
just having these running in the background. It's so.

20
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.910
<v 1>Strange that he was the guy that was attached to the Jessica Hahn</v>

21
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.920
controversy back in the 1980s. I mean, I remember that. Yeah.

22
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.030
Do you remember the Jim baker?

23
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.980
Like he had had an affair with this woman and it became for whatever reason,

24
00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:17.240
this big news, like the same guy he's around today. And then.

25
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.960
<v 0>We, we still expected people to be guided by their moral compass, you know?</v>

26
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.930
Never everyone's a hypocrite now. Right. Do you remember then.

27
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.340
<v 1>There was Jimmy swagger got caught with a and he was crying a Herve soon.</v>

28
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.210
Do you remember that? Do you remember that? That was good. Yeah.

29
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.950
<v 0>No one confesses anything anymore? No one had mixed work. Any Bible bucket? Yes.</v>

30
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.090
<v 3>I love that one.</v>

31
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.120
<v 1>A bucket of Bibles. Why not? That's only 50 bucks. That's a pretty good deal.</v>

32
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.700
How many buyers? How many Bibles you get? 24.

33
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.760
Why should we get a bucket of Bibles?

34
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.330
I feel like we should have one at the gateway. I feel like we should have one.

35
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.640
I don't want to feed the beast, but you should. You should get,

36
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.590
if he gets 50 bucks from me, what.

37
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.710
<v 2>The we did? We did it. We did at least a table, table worth.</v>

38
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.230
<v 1>Right. A tables where the Bibles six.</v>

39
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.290
<v 2>Buckets. Can you get how many buckets makes a table?</v>

40
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.890
<v 1>But that w shouldn't we get the food or she just get the Bibles? Well,</v>

41
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:14.390
one bucket of Bibles and five buckets of food, but it's,

42
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.930
I.

43
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.390
<v 0>Love watching him feed the audience, you know, with the jet,</v>

44
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.740
from the giant trough.

45
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.000
<v 1>Get real good freeze, dried food that will last forever.</v>

46
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:27.890
You know how we get this? Yeah. So what the?

47
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.350
Creamy potato soup. Oh my God. Look at that slop. Yeah. Yeah.

48
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.660
<v 0>And they do a big thing of rice and then they just,</v>

49
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.280
and they mix it all together. You know,

50
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.680
bucket of slopped is poured on top of it. Google.

51
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.950
<v 1>Peak refuel.com. This is my friend.</v>

52
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:46.970
Chad Mendez has a really delicious, um,

53
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.500
company that they make actual, I think, is it freeze? Dried?

54
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.750
I think his stuff is freeze dried or dehydrated.

55
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.100
I'm not sure if aliens are real, I'm not a hundred percent of events,

56
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.080
but I'm probably like 90% convinced. But if they are real,

57
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.190
I leave in the room for. It's like, Jamie, get a picture of your shirt,

58
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.560
the shirt you're wearing. Why we're talking about that? It's a UFO says,

59
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.370
can they see it? Believe that that's a dope shirt.

60
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.770
<v 4>That's a saucer. If I've ever seen one. I think if they're, if they're here,</v>

61
00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:20.610
they're not going to let us.

62
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.910
<v 1>That's what I think. Well, that's what I think they're going to swoop in and go,</v>

63
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:26.220
Hey, Hey, Hey, well, let's.

64
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.990
<v 4>I'm 25. Right? I can't speak on anything,</v>

65
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.150
but just looking from past experience and

66
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.990
you know, there's like drawings, like even in the Mona Lisa,

67
00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:43.170
there's a weird thing or whatever in the background and,

68
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.320
but there's a spike. It's a spike in like,

69
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.840
because it's getting pretty weird here.

70
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.010
<v 1>The spike,</v>

71
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.180
they think it's hard to tell because sometimes when people talk about UFO's

72
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.680
bunch of other people hallucinate or lie, like there's a lot of that. Right?

73
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.360
So every time there's a real legit UFO, you get a bunch of nut, just nutcases,

74
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.470
who just want to tell crazy about being taken.

75
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.800
<v 4>Ships. I mean, yeah. What'd you say what it looks like I was in,</v>

76
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.350
I was probably 16.

77
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.580
I was at an upstate New York and, uh,

78
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.140
it would just stay there. So I, whoa, let me precursor this.

79
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.240
My aunt and uncle were very strict and we had to go to bed at a very

80
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:32.430
strict deadline, probably 10:00 PM.

81
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.790
And I was looking out the window with my cousin and it's just a

82
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:43.350
light that just stays there and then just goes off.

83
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.150
I mean, you just, you can't explain it.

84
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.880
<v 1>Well, if you're 17, you're 17 at the time 16, 16.</v>

85
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.220
<v 4>How, uh, probably.</v>

86
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.030
<v 1>How strong is this memory when you're like looking at it when you're trying to</v>

87
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:04.380
remember medium. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean,

88
00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:05.790
there's something there for sure.

89
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:08.790
Something took off and did something that didn't make sense to you. For sure.

90
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.590
<v 4>Um, and then Utah, I mean, their happens all the time. I mean, even here in LA,</v>

91
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.020
I can't tell you how many times. Cause I used to live in Tarzana. So,

92
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.600
uh, there was like a balcony here and it looked kind of like,

93
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.190
it sounds corny, but like a classic like field,

94
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.330
whenever you think of a force field and it just kinda goes like this and it's

95
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:39.570
kind of like a dome in a circular shape.

96
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.940
And it just goes like this and goes back in whoa,

97
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.980
in Tarzana, looking down at the city. And I'm like,

98
00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:51.420
how did no one else see this.

99
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.100
<v 1>All across the country?</v>

100
00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:56.220
There are situations where cops have to pull their guns and have to use them.

101
00:05:56.221 --> 00:05:59.150
There are, but they're as frequent as every day.

102
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.200
<v 5>Probably somewhere everyday, but not every day in every officer's.</v>

103
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.220
<v 1>Life. Right. But if it's you, if it's usually you're that officer,</v>

104
00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:10.690
you gotta be ready. Like this idea that that's not important,

105
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.130
it's it should be of critical.

106
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.080
<v 5>Not that it's not important,</v>

107
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.880
but that there are so many other things that need to also be in place because

108
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.650
if these other skills are in place, right, if you are a master,

109
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.170
you know, they like to call verbal judo. If you can,

110
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.520
if you can talk someone down, if you are a master at deescalation,

111
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.820
you are never going to need these other tools. Maybe not never,

112
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.340
but you are very rarely going to need any, you know,

113
00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:40.840
the less than lethal force or the least lethal force because you are managing

114
00:06:40.841 --> 00:06:43.720
situations. If you suck at these, you need these a lot.

115
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.020
I see what you're saying. Right? So, so for me, because I, you know,

116
00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:49.000
deal with communication and deal with, you know,

117
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.250
deescalation and how to talk someone down,

118
00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:53.320
how to talk to an individual with a mental illness,

119
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.060
how to talk to somebody who's a victim,

120
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.260
or has been traumatized how to talk to somebody who's maybe on drugs and not

121
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.070
able to, you know,

122
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.420
how do we manage those situations with verbal,

123
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.590
with interactions,

124
00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:09.550
with communication so that we don't have to go up the chain of command of,

125
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.350
you know, uh, of, of levels of force.

126
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.250
<v 1>But that seems to me to be an incredible amount of training that must be</v>

127
00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:18.130
necessary. And it also has to be constant and consistent.

128
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.960
<v 5>Absolutely. And that's why, when,</v>

129
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.350
when you and Jocko were talking about the training and how much more I'm like,

130
00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:24.184
yeah.

131
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.990
<v 1>Mean how much training did they have to do in terms of hand-to-hand combat?</v>

132
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.050
<v 5>I don't know. I'm not sure how much. And again,</v>

133
00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:33.970
I'm sure it depends on what academy they go through.

134
00:07:33.971 --> 00:07:37.720
Some academies are four months, some are six, some less longer, you know? And,

135
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.010
and the makeup depends on who's running that academy as to like the breakdown

136
00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:44.860
of, you know, how much is in the classroom. How much is physical,

137
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:47.980
how much is tactical? So, uh, I'm not sure what the numbers would be on that.

138
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.350
<v 1>Andrew Yang, uh, presidential candidate, uh,</v>

139
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.730
he had former presidential candidate. He had an awesome idea. He said,

140
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.940
every person who is in the police force should be a purple belt in jujitsu or

141
00:07:57.941 --> 00:08:02.920
higher. And I think that is a really good idea because at that level,

142
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.820
you have a real understanding of how to defend yourself and how to control

143
00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:10.090
bodies. I saw a video, I've seen it quite a few of them,

144
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:13.750
but one of the more pathetic videos I've ever seen was two people trying to hold

145
00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:17.890
one guy down, completely ineptly. The guy gets up, runs,

146
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.480
gets into his car and shoots both of them and then takes off. And I'm like,

147
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.660
Jesus Christ went into his car, got a gun. Like they,

148
00:08:25.661 --> 00:08:28.900
they had no control over this guy, two people. And I'm like,

149
00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:30.970
that should never take place.

150
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.150
And this guy wasn't some freak of nature either.

151
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:37.270
It wasn't like they were trying to hold down Herschel Walker or some super

152
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:41.110
athlete. No, it was just a regular guy. Just, they sucked. And it was,

153
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.850
it's terrible to watch. Yeah.

154
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.070
<v 6>Um, so I wake up at 5, 5 30 first noise</v>

155
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.530
and then laughter. I'm like, are these doing fart jokes at five in the morning?

156
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.530
And that's the thing that people realize is when you don't have TV,

157
00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.573
internet,

158
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.860
and you're just with your family and your homeys all day bored as.

159
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.910
So they joke morning till night. Like, I don't know what they're saying.

160
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.800
Laughter laughter someone cuts a fart joke and I'm like, all right,

161
00:09:12.801 --> 00:09:17.600
let's go. So you saw the pictures, they're ripped back muscles, six packs.

162
00:09:17.601 --> 00:09:21.440
The kids have six packs. I was very out of shape. I'm still out of shape,

163
00:09:21.441 --> 00:09:22.730
but that was the most out of shape.

164
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.760
And think about waking up at five 30 in the morning and the thing

165
00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:33.410
that's the final animal that's like kind of left is baboons. They call it,

166
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.010
they almost call them in, in that part of Africa. Like the baboon men,

167
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:42.350
because that's what they eat. Tastes horrible to me. Baboons look human.

168
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:48.020
So we're in a cave, men sleeping on the top bed, women on the bottom,

169
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.490
we wake up, there's another cave. And you see, oh there's people in that cave.

170
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.390
No they're baboons. And they're pointing at us. They're pointing. They're like,

171
00:09:56.391 --> 00:10:00.410
look, they're coming. So I'm like, this is crazy. We're hunting baboons.

172
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.610
They're like, there's tons of meat on them.

173
00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:03.440
We're going to it's enough to feed her family.

174
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.340
Think about like running again.

175
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.390
I was pretty run fast in high school. I could do the 50 pretty quick.

176
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.710
I can't run at top speed for hours. And I, and I got these

177
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.180
I'm drinking water. And in this environment,

178
00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:22.790
it's an advantage to have black skin. Cause it's cool.

179
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.330
These guys aren't sweating. I'm like, what's going on?

180
00:10:26.331 --> 00:10:27.740
We've been running for five hours.

181
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.890
You guys aren't sweating the and they don't get tired.

182
00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:34.580
And then they'll just start digging a hole and drink like re like a handful of

183
00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:39.170
brown water and that's enough for them. And I'm like, dude, what the?

184
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.470
Like I, and they're telling the translator,

185
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.560
this looks like he's never caught anything in his life. And he's like,

186
00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:50.080
he hasn't, to me, I'm an alien. Right? They go, he,

187
00:10:50.081 --> 00:10:52.670
he gets his food from supermarkets. What's that?

188
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.710
They hunt the food for him. They cut it up and package it and sell it.

189
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.490
Like they don't believe it. Right. But, I tell them, they're like, Hey,

190
00:11:01.491 --> 00:11:04.220
you guys, you look like a supermodel.

191
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.950
Can I bring you to America and do it fashion thing and get you guys paid.

192
00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:09.620
And why would you, we want to go to America.

193
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.390
What w tell me what you know about America.

194
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.880
Isn't that the place where people jump off buildings to kill themselves.

195
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.650
Like that concept is so foreign that when someone explained suicide to them

196
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:26.300
almost like, oh my God, they don't. And in, in the time that I'm there,

197
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.260
like I said, that first week is withdrawal. I'm like, where's my phone.

198
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.920
And then all of it goes away, right?

199
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.810
I'm not thinking about any of my addictions. I'm not thinking about like,

200
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.290
I feel peace. I'm not, I'm not miserable.

201
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:47.120
My depression goes away and I go morning till night,

202
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.310
you wake up, you hunt for food, you get home celebration.

203
00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:55.330
Everyone's happy. The men brought the food back. The women, you know,

204
00:11:55.390 --> 00:12:00.070
gathered the berries. We have a big dinner celebration. Cause every meal,

205
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:02.770
you gotta be grateful for dance party by the fire.

206
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.830
And you're out couple of fart jokes and you're out. Repeat the next day.

207
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:09.910
There's no time to be like bored and sad and upset

208
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.500
and worried about some. Okay.
