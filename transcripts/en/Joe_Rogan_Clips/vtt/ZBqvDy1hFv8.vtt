1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.840
<v 0>Let aside that are for people who are actually suffering minorities to be like,</v>

2
00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:03.800
no, no, no, this is not cool.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.000
<v 1>She's got pushback. I'm seen this from small blogs.</v>

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.160
I'm not seeing this from anything mainstream, right? Yeah.

5
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.960
<v 0>Correct.</v>

6
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.680
Cuz mainstream they're always gonna cover for the establishment a hundred

7
00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:14.160
percent of the time. Yeah. They're gonna cover their own.

8
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.760
<v 1>The thing about those blogs is like a lot of them are basically like a Shafi</v>

9
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:19.760
refers to 'em is like college papers.

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.550
It's like a lot of these blogs are like college student written.

11
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.310
<v 0>Yeah. But they're often speaking truth. Oh yeah.</v>

12
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.390
<v 1>Well I would hope I would hope more would come out and say, Hey,</v>

13
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.310
you can't say you're native American. It's like, like, imagine the outrage.

14
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.670
If I just started calling myself African American.

15
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.470
<v 0>Well, do you know, did you see what Trump said? He said,</v>

16
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.940
I can't call her pons anymore. Cuz she's not an Indian &lt;laugh&gt;

17
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.140
and I'm just like, oh my God, we're not worthy.

18
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.900
<v 1>He says some hilarious, man. Oh yeah. He really does. He really does.</v>

19
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:58.500
He's funny off the cuff. Oh yeah. He really is. You know?

20
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.970
And the way he goes after people, like, even though he's the president,

21
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.530
like he still calls people losers. I mean he still,

22
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.130
he still calls them losers on Twitter and goes after them horse face,

23
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.890
horse face. He called stormy Daniel's horse face.

24
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.850
Just think of how repulsive he is. Physically he's fat.

25
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.650
His face is all hanging off of his bones.

26
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:25.360
He's got white raccoon eyes and orange skin.

27
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.440
And yet he's still will mock stormy Daniels and call her horse face.

28
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.920
<v 0>Someone tweeted out. I forget who and I apologize the thing he said,</v>

29
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:36.560
they go imagine what happens.

30
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.320
That Trump's the first person who a porn star and she had to brag about it.

31
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.200
&lt;laugh&gt; and then she paid him.

32
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.390
<v 1>She has to pay him now. Yeah. Well he did pay her. Right.</v>

33
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.350
But what he paid her,

34
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.870
what she's gonna have to pay him is probably like a factor of three or four.

35
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.670
Yeah, of course.

36
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.430
I mean how much more she's gonna want up paying him for 350 K that's all he

37
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:00.550
asked for. Yeah. Oh, oh. That's.

38
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.590
<v 0>Very reasonable that doesn't come. Even cover her book.</v>

39
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.780
<v 1>Account. It's probably like he just wants just be done with it to get it.</v>

40
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.660
Just gimme that paper. Yeah. Just gimme a little something.

41
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.900
I need a little something from you. Let this, let this slide. I want 300,000.

42
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.100
Yeah. Yeah. That's probably whole book. That's.

43
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.940
<v 0>Probably all the money. No, she got more than three 50. Do you think? So I'm.</v>

44
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.940
<v 1>Positive. How much you think.</v>

45
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.820
<v 0>She got for that book? Uh, 750 ID guess. Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.653
<v 1>But she's gotta pay down.</v>

47
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.330
<v 0>Axis. Sure. And her agent's getting 15. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.850
<v 1>She's probably not even bringing three home. So is all that money's gone.</v>

49
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.930
Oh yeah. It's all gone. Yeah.

50
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.290
All gone a hundred percent gone and no one's buying that book. A.

51
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.370
<v 0>Successful it's book. It it's stiffed. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody.</v>

52
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.290
<v 1>Gives a. She said it already. Like I the president. That's your book?</v>

53
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.050
Your book is I the president.

54
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.840
<v 0>Well, you know, here's any part with her? Do you remember this people?</v>

55
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.520
She was making fun of his Dick. Like she had hit a mushroom Dick, whatever.

56
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.480
And people were like mushroom Dick. That's what she said.

57
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.720
And then people were like that, you know what?

58
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.640
That as up as he is that's body shaming.

59
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.960
You really shouldn't make fun of someone. And she's like, you know what?

60
00:02:56.961 --> 00:03:01.160
You're right. I'm sorry. And then he goes, Hey horse face. She goes,

61
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.000
his mushroom Dick. Like the next day she's back on it. It was amazing. &lt;laugh&gt;.

62
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.120
<v 1>The fact that he can call her horse face and he's the predator,</v>

63
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.073
but he doesn't even have a horse.

64
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.040
<v 0>Face. No, it doesn't matter. I know, but it's just.</v>

65
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.000
<v 1>So we, I mean,</v>

66
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Ted Cruz really is in the uni bomber or whatever the he said he was Zody.

67
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.990
Didn't.

68
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.630
<v 0>Say that that's the name? He said he, his dad shot FK yes.</v>

69
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.983
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

70
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.750
<v 0>There.</v>

71
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.950
<v 1>Just even that that's, it's all so crazy.</v>

72
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.310
<v 0>That was the best part.</v>

73
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.270
So Ted Cruzs was known as like the best debater in the Senate.

74
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.670
He had this Harvard or Yale, whatever debating team. Great debater.

75
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.660
Everyone recognized him for this. Had the. Do you prep for a debate? Be like,

76
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:44.180
oh yeah. Well, well your dad shot you. FK it's like, what the? Wait,

77
00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:45.740
what the you supposed.

78
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.860
<v 1>To say? Well, it didn't have to make sense. Right? People,</v>

79
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.300
people that are Trump supporters don't want it to make sense.

80
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:52.260
They just want him to win.

81
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.060
<v 0>Right. Right. Exactly. And it works. Yes.</v>

82
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.460
<v 1>Yeah. Well he just had to get zingers in. Oh yeah. Yeah.</v>

83
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.090
I mean it's like roast more than.

84
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.170
<v 0>It's amazing. And they don't get that. There was this my favorite tweet of his,</v>

85
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.890
my favorite, where he goes,

86
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.450
whenever I speak of the losers and the haters I do. So with great affection.

87
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.010
It's not their fault. They were born up exclamation point.

88
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.930
That's a real Trump tweet. It's the best one at its right?

89
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.720
<v 1>Yeah. You know, one of my favorite things was him at a speech, uh,</v>

90
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:23.554
where he was talking,

91
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.200
it was 2015 before he even talked about running for president or he was even,

92
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.640
I don't think he was a hundred percent open about running for president.

93
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.160
And he said, there's two ways to talk to China. You could, you know,

94
00:04:37.161 --> 00:04:40.000
could pro things, you could propose things. And he says that like, you know,

95
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.830
normally in, then he says, or you could say, listen. &lt;laugh&gt;. He said, yeah,

96
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.990
you ever heard that? No. Oh my God. It's great. Pull it, pull it.

97
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.910
It's it's great because everybody starts cheering. Yeah.

98
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:55.830
Because it's so forbidden in this environment wearing an expensive suit,

99
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.590
standing in front of a podium and he says, or you could say, listen. Oh,

100
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.540
like is what we're gonna do? And everybody's start. Yeah. It's so exciting.

101
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.660
Oh my God. It's so much more exciting. Yeah. Than Marco Rubio or you know,

102
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:11.820
someone, boom gem.

103
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.020
<v 0>Jeb is a waste. Gem is a big fat mistake. The way.</v>

104
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.933
<v 1>He did it with the fingers.</v>

105
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.900
<v 0>Too. He do. I, I watched those videos, which speech?</v>

106
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.810
He in June of 2015. No. When he said mothers.

107
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.290
<v 1>When he just, just not speech. When he is talking about China, when he said,</v>

108
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:30.050
listen, China.

109
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.213
<v 0>China.</v>

110
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.010
<v 1>China. Yeah. That was a thing. Puerto Rico. When he pronounced.</v>

111
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.170
<v 0>Muslims, Puerto Rico, I'm announcing a ban on all Muslim immigration.</v>

112
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.320
<v 1>Muslim here. This is a great listen to this.</v>

113
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.673
Cause it's it's.

114
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.360
<v 0>Leadership this time. Instead of with his name in gold it's with his words,</v>

115
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.480
is this it discussing a rack. We.

116
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.440
<v 2>Build a school, we build a road, they blow up the road. They blow up the school.</v>

117
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.920
We build another school. We build another road. They blow them up.

118
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.920
We build again. In the meantime,

119
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.400
we can't get a [inaudible] school built in Brooklyn to the audience's.

120
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.353
<v 0>Approval talking.</v>

121
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.680
<v 2>Oil. We have nobody in Washington that sits back and said,</v>

122
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.320
you're not gonna raise that. [inaudible] price. You understand me?

123
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.750
<v 1>This is uh, a long time ago. Chinese.</v>

124
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.430
<v 2>Goods here is, listen, your mother, we're gonna tax you 25%.</v>

125
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.590
<v 0>While polls have Trump in a very early 11. Is that what it says over there?</v>

126
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.030
Yeah. It's at least when this is posted, but here's, what's interesting.

127
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:34.630
Notice the person who posted it, their name is say no to racist &lt;laugh&gt;.

128
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.780
<v 1>Oh, uh, yeah. They probably put it up as a negative thing. Well, no.</v>

129
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.700
<v 0>2011. He would've been considered a Democrat, right? Oh no. He's north Roney.</v>

130
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.220
He endorse Roney. So he's be a Republican.

131
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.100
<v 1>Regardless of race. He was a Democrat until what? 2010?</v>

132
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.340
<v 0>Probably around then. Cuz he was gonna run as independent at some point Trump.</v>

133
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.300
<v 1>2012. Look at that. This is the guy we've been looking for. &lt;laugh&gt; wow.</v>

134
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.170
<v 0>Seven years ago. But it's.</v>

135
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.810
<v 1>Says deplorable. They could have changed. They probably changed it.</v>

136
00:07:01.811 --> 00:07:03.530
They probably changed it. Oh. That would be good.

137
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.210
Probably changed it in the future. Cuz it says seven years ago. Yeah.

138
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.770
<v 0>Time traveler deplorable. That's the time travel that hacked joy and Reed.</v>

139
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.530
<v 1>Uh yeah. Someone did it. Someone definitely hacked it. Yeah. Just hilarious.</v>

140
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.200
They didn't give the good ver version of that either. Cause they BLE. It said,

141
00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:20.500
well,

142
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.360
not just that cuz he also see if you can find the better version because he, he,

143
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.880
he basically prefaces it. Like, you know, people have been saying it like this,

144
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.720
right. You could say it like this or you can say, listen, you.

145
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.600
And that's when everybody starts.

146
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.120
<v 0>Cheering, he actually gave an example. What would you do? He actually, okay,</v>

147
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.490
what can you.

148
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.030
<v 3>Do? Yeah. So easy.</v>

149
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.110
I drop a 25% tax on China and,

150
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.270
and you know, I said to somebody that is really the messenger.

151
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.830
The messenger is important.

152
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.350
I could have one man say we're gonna text you 25%

153
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.340
and I can say another, listen, your.

154
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.300
<v 0>That's like, this is a Brer film. I.</v>

155
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.260
<v 1>Know it's it's punish. I know. But.</v>

156
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.660
<v 0>Heres how the press lies on the campaign trail. He said a point, uh,</v>

157
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.980
I remember what it was, the sense me. He goes, you better shut your mouth.

158
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.850
So he didn't say the word they bleeped it. Oh interest.

159
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:24.570
And they bleeped it to make it look like he was cursing. And he is like,

160
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:26.290
you guys are shady as hell.

161
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.450
<v 1>That's very shady. Yeah. That's shady.</v>

162
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.610
You can't just bleep a pause and pretend that there's some sort of an offensive

163
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.970
word in there. Right. That's really, that's just deceptive.

164
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.880
<v 0>Right? And it's pervasive. They do it all the time.</v>

165
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.320
<v 1>Well, who's good out there to challenge him.</v>

166
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.440
<v 0>They're. You know why they're. Why?</v>

167
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.080
Because we've never had this happen before the whole time.

168
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.080
All those Democrats are fighting each other for the primary, for the nomination,

169
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:54.800
he's gonna be tweeting the out of those debates.

170
00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:57.520
He's gonna be live tweeting the debates. Right. And they're not gonna,

171
00:08:57.521 --> 00:08:59.920
they have to worry about the tax from their colleagues,

172
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.840
but also from the sitting precedent &lt;laugh&gt; who is like, look at this dope

173
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.800
and he's gonna come up with nicknames for them in this stick. Danang Dick.

174
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.960
He already did. Oh my it's amazing Danang.

175
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.400
Dick Dick Blumenthal center from Connecticut lied about his Vietnam service.

176
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.470
Oh no. He didn't. Trump had started calling him Danang. Dick.

177
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.950
He lied about his Vietnam service. Still got elected. Yep. Whoa

178
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.830
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; shameless. Yeah. How did he lie? What did he say?

179
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.710
He said he served and he didn't look it up. Yeah. I mean it's it's it is brazen.

180
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.190
It wasn't some ambiguous area. I think he's like he never left.

181
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.740
America's my understanding. Oh.
