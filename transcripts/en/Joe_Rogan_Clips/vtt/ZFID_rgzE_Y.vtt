WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.480
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I gonna talk to you about that too. Yes. Um,</v>

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.080
cuz you brought up Bostrom, what do you Bostrom relies on?

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.800
I mean he was relying on theories in terms of like mathematical

4
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.120
theories of probability to,

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.990
to say that he thinks it's more likely that we're in a simulation.

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.950
Yeah, he has. He.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.310
<v 1>Has a, the thing he's articulated,</v>

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.510
I don't think he's come up with the idea of the simulation.

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.110
He just kind of right. Really thought about it deeply.

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.270
He came up with a simulation argument,

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.870
which is these three categories that he described to you, possible outcomes.

12
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.150
I think, uh,

13
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.660
the first one is we destroy ourselves before we ever simulation.

14
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.660
The second one is that we would lose interest in creating a

15
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:48.980
simulation at some point. And the third one is, uh,

16
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.580
we're living in a simulation. Yeah.

17
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.020
<v 0>And where do you, where do you lean?</v>

18
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.700
<v 1>I think, uh,</v>

19
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.260
to &lt;laugh&gt; I think there's going to, um,

20
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.850
the three paths that he highlight. I did,

21
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:04.210
it makes it sound like it's so clear that it's just three,

22
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:07.290
but I think there's gonna be a huge amount of possibilities of the kinds of

23
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:12.170
simulations. Like to me, I keep asking, uh, you know, to ask El Musk, he,

24
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.410
uh, about the simulation, he said, uh, what's outside what? Outside?

25
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:19.210
What's on the other side. What's outside the simulation. Yeah. I,

26
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.650
I think I asked, uh, what would you ask an AGI system?

27
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:24.560
And he said what's outside the simulation is the question. Yeah, he believes.

28
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.040
<v 0>In it. I, or at least he entertains it as a troll. The.</v>

29
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.280
<v 1>Elon Musk embodies like the best of the Twitter,</v>

30
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.593
internet troll,

31
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.520
AME &lt;laugh&gt; and a billion engineer and designer in one it's like a, yeah,

32
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.950
it's like a quantum state that you can't quite figure out. Like what,

33
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:47.430
what's the coupling? Cause I don't know if he's trolling, but I'm the same way.

34
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.150
I love asking people about the simulation.

35
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:53.150
Even though I get a little bit of hate from the scientific community, but it.

36
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.791
<v 0>It pushes,</v>

37
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:56.470
why do you get hate from the scientific community about the simulation?

38
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.310
Cause it's.

39
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.990
<v 1>Uh, it's ridiculous notion if you think of it's like literally that,</v>

40
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:04.700
because it's not a test of thing mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; or we don't know how to

41
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.340
test, like why are you talking about this?

42
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.980
Why do you sit down with Elon Musk and talk about the simulation? When,

43
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.460
when you're sitting with a world expert in particular aspects of rockets or

44
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.420
robotics, like I'm an expert.

45
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.060
I can't believe I just said that I'm not expert anything,

46
00:02:19.061 --> 00:02:21.420
but I know about a few things about autonomous vehicles.

47
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.290
Why don't you talk to him about that? Right? Why don't we talk about simulation?

48
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.370
Well, the thing is the simulation pushes you outside of the muck,

49
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.290
the messiness of everyday details of science and makes you ask big questions

50
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:37.210
about like the nature of our reality. Mm. And I,

51
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.410
I like to think of it as like what, how would we build a simulation?

52
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.640
Like what would be a compel enough virtual reality game that you wanna stay

53
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:50.000
there for all your, your whole life? Mm that's a first step there.

54
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.320
That's useful to think about like, what is our reality? What,

55
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.800
what aspects of the are most interesting for us humans to be able to

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.440
perceive with our limited perception and cognitive abilities interpret and

57
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.840
interact with, and then a bigger question then is like,

58
00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:11.120
how do you build a larger scale simulation that would be able to create that

59
00:03:11.121 --> 00:03:14.320
virtual reality game, which I think is a possible future.

60
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.150
We're already creating virtual worlds for ourselves on Twitter, social networks.

61
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:23.390
And so on. I really believe that virtual reality will, will enter.

62
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.510
We will spend more and more of our lives in the next 50 to a hundred years in

63
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:32.310
virtual worlds. Mm. And the simulation hypothesis,

64
00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.590
the simulation discussion is part of that. I think,

65
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.060
I think there's the question of what's outside is really interesting.

66
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.100
That's the other way of, because like what created us?

67
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.580
What started the whole thing?

68
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.540
It's the modern version of asking what the, what is God?

69
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.660
What does God look like? What, you know, it's, it's asking,

70
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.420
what does the programmer look like? I think that's a,

71
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.050
a fast say any question, but arguing that we're already living the simulation.

72
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.490
I think you've got stuck on that little point.

73
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.770
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I think it's not that intrigu there.

74
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:12.650
There's a bit of a language barrier too. There's a, there's a technical. Yeah.

75
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.610
I think Nick, that legit, it's funny. It's funny.

76
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.890
Nick is a legit philosopher and so he's been fighting battles in the philosophy

77
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:23.160
game, him, like you've asked them, does somebody disagree with him? Yeah.

78
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.760
On thesepos and there's a bunch of philosophers disagree with him, but uh,

79
00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:30.960
including Sean Carll on the philosophical level and a lot of the arguments are

80
00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:33.560
in philosophy mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they're sort of technical and they're

81
00:04:33.561 --> 00:04:37.320
about language and about terms and so on. But I think, yeah,

82
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:41.030
it's very possible that we, we a,

83
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.790
we live in a simulation and I think, uh, one of the,

84
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.710
this constructs of,

85
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.310
so physics theoretical physicsatistics with many world's interpretation of

86
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:53.910
quantum mechanics, as Sean has talked to you about mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,

87
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.830
reveals some interesting sort of fundamental building blocks of our reality.

88
00:04:57.831 --> 00:04:59.910
There's something I don't think people have talked to you about,

89
00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:03.420
which is like the coolest thing to me,

90
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.180
the most amazing thing that nobody can explain yet things called

91
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.540
cellular atoter.

92
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.740
And there's a guy mathematician named John Conway who came up in the seventies

93
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:19.620
with a thing called game of life and cellular atoter are these two

94
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:20.900
dimensional or one dimensional,

95
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.930
but am of life is two dimensional grid where every single little cell

96
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.450
is really dumb and it behaves based on the cells next to it.

97
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.130
And it it's born when there's a few, when there's like a certain number,

98
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:36.370
like three cells alive next to it. And it dies otherwise.

99
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.850
So it's like a simpler rule for birth and death and all it knows it's it's

100
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.000
nearby surrounding in its own life.

101
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.520
And if you take that system with a really dumb rule and expand it in size

102
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.440
arbitrary complexity emerges, you can have, uh,

103
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.120
touring machines so you can simulate perfect computers with that system and it

104
00:05:58.121 --> 00:06:01.080
can grow. And all these behaviors grow. Like if you watch,

105
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.040
if people Google like a game of life and you can watch this extremely dumb,

106
00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:09.840
simple system just grow arbitrary

107
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.880
complexities and what you start to

108
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.510
realize that from such incredibly simple building blocks,

109
00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:23.350
that don't know anything about the bigger world around them,

110
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.470
you can build our entire universe.

111
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.590
You can build the kind of complexities we see in this.

112
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.190
So like we think that God is like, uh,

113
00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:35.710
designing every little aspect of whatever of our world or a simulation

114
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.700
hypothesis. The is designed by hand. Like I'm gonna craft these things.

115
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.020
What you realize is all you can,

116
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.500
all you need to do is just set some initial conditions,

117
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.860
set some really basic rules and allow the system to grow

118
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.300
as long as it can grow arbitrarily, just crazy stuff.

119
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.130
Amazing stuff can happen from like, from simplicity. Complexity can emerge.

120
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.490
And that for like, if you study this a little bit closer, just like watch it.

121
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:07.090
People can watch a game of life on YouTube and think about what it's showing

122
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.850
like for 10 minutes, it, it it'll blow your mind.

123
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.170
The fact that from simplicity,

124
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.880
arbitrary complexity, beauty can, is like incredible.

125
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.160
So for the simulation,

126
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.840
the creator of the simulation is probably some 13 year old nerd living in like,

127
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.400
uh, in his mom's basement is probably just set some rules in this video game and

128
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:35.800
press play. And then arbitrary complexity can emerge. It can have a Joe Rogan,

129
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.800
it can have an Elon Musk,

130
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.870
all the tech technologies that we've developed and probably millions of other

131
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:45.630
alien species that are living throughout our universe. Jesus.

132
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.150
So the, yeah, that, to me,

133
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:53.150
the cellularometer reveals that the simulation is much

134
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:57.260
easier to create than we might think. And,

135
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.210
but there's a lot of varied and the kinds of simulations well create,

136
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.290
like I think the simulation hypothesis thinks like, you know, there's like one,

137
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.410
but I think there's gonna be a lot of varieties. There's, there's,

138
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.530
there's a lot of possible different rule sets. There's a,

139
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.050
a lot of different physical mediums in which these simulations could be created.

140
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.680
It can be a completely virtual world, the rule of consciousness,

141
00:08:20.681 --> 00:08:22.760
whether you make most people consci or not,

142
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:25.120
whether most of them are philosophical zombies.

143
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.960
They're just like non non-player characters. And it's just you, or you have,

144
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:35.120
or is your mind simulated like the role of

145
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.000
suffering. So consciousness brings with it, this idea of,

146
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.190
of basically, you know, subjective experience,

147
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.790
a subjective experience comes with the idea of pain and fear.

148
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.030
And so on the thing, again, my Russian romanticization of it,

149
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.790
but I think fear of death is essential. Scarcity is essential for,

150
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.120
for beauty for life. Yeah. And that,

151
00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.400
that's a nice feature of this little simulation we got going on that there could

152
00:09:01.401 --> 00:09:05.720
be a lot of different alternatives. I think that could be less individualistic,

153
00:09:05.721 --> 00:09:10.280
less, less, uh, consciousness could be present in different kinds of forms.

154
00:09:10.281 --> 00:09:11.114
So I,

155
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.430
I see there's a lot more options than those three that he highlights and we can

156
00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:18.670
destroy ourselves in a lot of interesting ways. Uh,

157
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.950
the entire civilizations from AI to nuclear weapons, to biological,

158
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.710
to all kinds of weapons. So.

159
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.710
<v 0>It's almost like whether it's a simulation or not is almost</v>

160
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:29.544
irrelevant.

161
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:34.710
The complexity of the existence and all of the various

162
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.820
pushes and pulls that, keep everything together. They're,

163
00:09:39.821 --> 00:09:44.780
they're almost operating like some grand plan,

164
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.020
whether they like it or not, whether whether or not a grand plan exists,

165
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.900
all these different things are happening and everything is moving in a very

166
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:58.170
specific direction. Right. It's moving to words, further complexity.

167
00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.370
Like, uh,

168
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.250
I was having a conversation with a friend of mine last night where we were

169
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:06.170
talking about phones and, uh, we were like, uh, you know,

170
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.090
like when are they ever gonna look at a phone and say, I think we're good.

171
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:14.450
We don't have to, the camera works great signals, great. And call people.

172
00:10:14.451 --> 00:10:16.880
You can text people. Let's just stop innovating right here.

173
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.960
And we're both laughing. Like it's never gonna happen. But even though we admit,

174
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.960
like if you have an iPhone 11 or a pixel four, is that what you have? Yeah.

175
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.680
It works pixel four. Yeah. Works. They work great.

176
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.560
You don't really need anything better. Like in terms of the way our,

177
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.440
our culture works, you get so much done on these things. You can bank on them.

178
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:37.590
Is it okay if I'm.

179
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.470
<v 1>Drinking all your waters by the.</v>

180
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.350
<v 0>Way? Yeah. We have a lot of water. Yeah. Okay. Please.</v>

181
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.950
&lt;laugh&gt; you're water Russian. &lt;laugh&gt;,

182
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:49.230
that's very polite of you. Um, the, the, just the existence itself,

183
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.670
whether or not there's a design to it, uh,

184
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.300
it seems to operate in a at,

185
00:10:57.301 --> 00:11:00.780
or that would indicate there's a design. The design doesn't have to be real.

186
00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:04.540
It doesn't have to be a simulation. It doesn't have to be a grand plan,

187
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.860
but it moves in the, the same way as if it's a grand plan. It's weird.

188
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:10.180
It's.

189
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.020
<v 1>Hard to put into words,</v>

190
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.020
but there is a different force and a momentum like the evolutionary process.

191
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.370
The fact that life was created fact that there's always a kind of a progress.

192
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.890
And also like, uh, just like with the native Americans, the,

193
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.530
the fact that suffering seems to be a constant story that was weaving in mm-hmm.

194
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:33.210
&lt;affirmative&gt; like we, we constantly progress, but we seems to be, uh,

195
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.130
like creating the other and torturing. And the,

196
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.040
there seems to be constant suffering and war and so on through this growth

197
00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:44.800
process. And that seems to be death is a huge part of that. And, and.

198
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.080
<v 0>Conflict, conflict, even social conflict.</v>

199
00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:51.000
Like we were talking about social justice warriors and, and that type of thing.

200
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.880
I think they almost have to exist.

201
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.280
It's almost like the world creates a space for them and people find a way to

202
00:11:58.281 --> 00:11:59.480
fill that space. Yeah.
