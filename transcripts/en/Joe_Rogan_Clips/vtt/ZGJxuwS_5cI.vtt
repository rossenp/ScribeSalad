00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. For people don't know where to live below zero it's.</v>

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.210
Um, this crazy show where people live, you know,

3
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:12.960
in this very rugged terrain and you, you, uh,

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.360
you had the most interesting life because you,

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.300
when you would live up at the cabin, you would live by yourself,

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.210
just you in a very small room, just a hunting, all your food and,

7
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:26.490
and hiking around. You didn't use any vehicles.

8
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:31.230
And he just kind of had a rifle and a frying pan and a pot and a

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.650
place to sleep. And he seemed really happy up there.

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.950
<v 1>Oh yeah, I'm having a good time.</v>

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.720
I just wanted to strip everything away that I could dispense with, you know, um,

12
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.771
I got the idea.

13
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:46.070
I wanted to go back to live in like a hunter gatherer back in 97.

14
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:49.280
I just got this idea. I was actually living in a tent in the woods,

15
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.260
down in Vermont and having such a good time. I thought,

16
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.810
where could I go with this? What could I do with this kind of lifestyle?

17
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.080
And I decided to move to the Brooks range of Alaska. What.

18
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.610
<v 0>Was it like? So you, what made you go live in a tent in the first place?</v>

19
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.360
<v 1>I just always liked the outdoors. I just love nature. And you know,</v>

20
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:06.290
I was doing other things too,

21
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:08.720
but there was this one summer when I was in my twenties,

22
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.990
when I found this really cool spot in the woods. And I thought, Hey,

23
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:15.110
I'll set up a teepee over there and I'll just hang out there this summer as much

24
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:19.400
as I can. And I just had a great time. So I started thinking more about,

25
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.450
you know, instead of just living in the woods,

26
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.990
kind of as a recreational thing, I started thinking about, Hey,

27
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:31.190
how could you actually make a life living like this? You know,

28
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:35.300
get up every morning with the animals around the sky, the water.

29
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.490
Um, I started thinking about,

30
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:41.450
I started reading anthropological stuff about hunter gatherers that summer,

31
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.550
and I started getting ideas and, uh, it,

32
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.330
it took me seven years to make it to the Brooks range and to get out to that

33
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:54.020
lake that you've seen on TV and to actually start living that way.

34
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.200
It took me a few years just to organize my life enough, to move up to Alaska.

35
00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:58.460
And then once I got to Alaska,

36
00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:02.180
I was kinda in Fairbanks for about four years before I could really spend long

37
00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:05.120
periods of time in the wilderness. But once I got it all arranged,

38
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.580
I just drove up the haul road,

39
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:11.240
which is this industrial road that goes up to the north slope oil fields.

40
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:14.660
It's very, very, uh, unimproved in areas,

41
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:16.640
just gravel road for hundreds of miles.

42
00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:18.290
I drove about 300 miles north of Fairbanks.

43
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:22.460
I parked my van and I walked 60 miles off of that road by myself,

44
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.000
out into the wilderness and started figuring out how to live off the land.

45
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.070
How did you know where to go? Oh,

46
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:33.050
I had found the spot a few years before I had actually found that

47
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:36.530
lake flying around in a little Bush plane, because part of my plan originally,

48
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.150
when I formulated this idea back in Vermont, I thought I'll become a Bush pilot.

49
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.840
That'll be a thing I can do in Alaska. You know? Um,

50
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.620
so I was thinking about starting an air taxi service. I'd been studying,

51
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:50.930
flying for fears. As soon as I got my private license,

52
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:53.840
I jumped in the plane and flew to Alaska. But then when I got up there,

53
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:57.200
I was getting my commercial and all that. And in the meantime,

54
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.680
as much as I could, I'd go out and explore, look around.

55
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.760
And I discovered this lake one day when I was flying across part of the Brooks

56
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:07.840
range. And I set up a little tent camp there that summer 2000,

57
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.620
but it took me another four years before I could actually walk out there and

58
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:15.000
start living 60 miles walking. Yeah,

59
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.000
that's a long way. Hey,

60
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:20.370
I walked the length of Vermont when I was 13 years old.

61
00:03:20.371 --> 00:03:23.460
I walked you really Massachusetts Canada. But, um,

62
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.680
the difference is when you're 13. Yeah,

63
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.630
I actually started when I was 12 gave up the next I was with

64
00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:31.081
my uncle.

65
00:03:31.081 --> 00:03:34.110
We went for about a week and then the next summer I convinced my mom to drive me

66
00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:37.980
back down and drop me off alone where we had given up the year before. But, uh,

67
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.460
that's just you by yourself. Yeah. When I was 13, I was alone,

68
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.300
but that's a trail that's called the long trail and it's marked,

69
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:47.040
there's a little paint mark, you know,

70
00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:49.500
on the trees up ahead of you telling you where to go. Yeah.

71
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.270
<v 2>Brooks range. You were 13. Yeah. That's a little kid. Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.660
And your.

73
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.250
<v 3>Mom's like, go, go ahead. It was amazing. I was given a lot of freedom, I guess.</v>

74
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.300
<v 1>So, I mean, I'd already quit school by the time I was 13, you know, really?</v>

75
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.890
I went back a few times, but uh, yeah. I mean, I, I never,

76
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.910
I never finished the, uh, fourth grade tell you the truth. But I went back,

77
00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:14.490
I went to one year of high school. Eventually.

78
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:15.930
I was curious about what's going on over there.

79
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.660
Did you ever get a GED or any of that jazz? No.

80
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.710
I never needed a GED for it than I did, but I went to ninth grade and uh,

81
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.940
you know, I did my own thing. After that, you.

82
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.780
<v 0>Seem like an educated guy. Do you, are you self-educated if I got.</v>

83
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.120
<v 1>Any education it's self-educated yet. And I just,</v>

84
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.910
I like to be learning all the time, whatever I'm doing, I like to learn,

85
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:38.550
but if I'm making a TV show, I want to learn everything I can about it.

86
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.100
You know, if I'm flying airplanes,

87
00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:44.820
I want to learn a lot more than I need to know to do what I'm doing. Um,

88
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.610
and it's the same thing with, uh, going out there and living,

89
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.380
just learning as much as I could. There's so much, so much to learn out there.

90
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.370
Now, how long did it take.

91
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.890
<v 0>You when you're 13 and like, what did you do for food?</v>

92
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.970
<v 1>Oh, well that was easy bite at the store and carried on your back.</v>

93
00:04:59.971 --> 00:05:03.390
I never hunted when I was a kid. Oh, okay. I mean,

94
00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:06.480
I remember going once or twice with some uncles of mine, we never got anything.

95
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:09.990
I never, I didn't have any real hunting experience until that summer.

96
00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:11.220
I walked out to the.

97
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.500
<v 2>Lake. Really? Yeah. So.</v>

98
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.010
<v 0>You really just had a rifle and I didn't quite know what you were doing.</v>

99
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.160
I'd read a lot about what to do.

100
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.493
<v 4>The biggest thing.</v>

101
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.230
<v 1>Joe, I got out there, I had two months food.</v>

102
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.070
I left two months worth of food at the lake. Okay. To get me started.

103
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.350
And I walked out there in July.

104
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.530
<v 0>Pause you for a second. When you say two months food, like, what did you bring?</v>

105
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.330
<v 1>Oh, I had left, um, basic stuff, grains leg, you know, some beans,</v>

106
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:43.740
some rice to stuff that you knew you could serve a jug of oil, you know,

107
00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:46.740
basic some flour was out there.

108
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.270
And I left that the year before, when I had a plane, it,

109
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.620
my whole plan to become an air taxi and, and do the Bush flying. I,

110
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.431
at that time,

111
00:05:56.431 --> 00:06:00.320
I realized doesn't go together with living off the land in the wilderness.

112
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:05.180
So I actually sold that plane that summer and drove up the road and

113
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:09.710
walked out to where I had left these supplies a year before and decided that's

114
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.600
where I really wanted to just go live off the land. I don't,

115
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.460
I don't need an airplane anymore. I don't need to fly. So, um,

116
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.043
when I got out there, I had,

117
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.200
there was a 55 gallon barrel and it had some food and it had a few supplies.

118
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.900
I had a tent, you know, it was insulated, but it,

119
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.520
it hadn't really become a cabin yet. It's the same place that you've seen.

120
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:31.070
But it, it was just a little less,

121
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.310
little less solid back then. And the cabin has a stands. You built? Yeah. Well,

122
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.630
I flew in the plywood and stuff. And then when I get out there, I put, I put,

123
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.620
I had a Walton originally. I had had a tent camp out there since 2000.

124
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.600
I built plywood cabin under the wall. Basically. That's what I did. But, um,

125
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.390
when I got out there, I had some food, I had my rifle,

126
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.720
I had fishing equipment. I started living.

127
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:01.670
I started improving that little cabin, you know,

128
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.190
and by September I ran out of food, like completely. I had one bag of flour,

129
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:08.810
this little plastic bag of flour.

130
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.730
It was all I had left when it got cold enough that I figured I could start moose

131
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:16.520
hunting. So that was my plan. I got to get a moose.

132
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.360
<v 0>Why did you have to wait until the car called this regulations.</v>

133
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.060
<v 1>Bugs? You've got to preserve the meat. I've got no freezer. I had,</v>

134
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.770
you know, I had to wait until like I still do. When I hunt moose,

135
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.280
my moose hunting season starts the day.

136
00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:37.990
I can leave a piece of scrap of meat out on the ground all afternoon and go look

137
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:38.920
at it. There's no flags.

138
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.400
<v 3>On it. Hmm. That makes sense.</v>

139
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.830
<v 0>Wow. That's crazy. So you have to, other than the rifle aspect of it, I mean,</v>

140
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.980
you're really living like a primitive hunter gatherer. I.

141
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.470
<v 1>Would have used a bow and arrow. If I thought I could have survived,</v>

142
00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:56.230
there's your spot right there. There it is. Well, if you.

143
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.830
<v 0>Only want to gather, meet the rifles, the way to go, you know,</v>

144
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.720
I was always trying to just.

145
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.990
<v 1>Let go of everything I could, I could do without,</v>

146
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.390
but I never got to the point where I thought I could make it with just a bow and

147
00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:12.610
arrow by myself. You know,

148
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.510
people used to survive out there before they even had archery.

149
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.520
They survived out there with Spears,

150
00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:20.770
but there were groups of people they would build a fence,

151
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.150
they would corral animals.

152
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.630
They would put nooses up between trees to get a moose, things like that.

153
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.610
There's also probably a lot more animals.

154
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.830
I don't know that to be the case. Maybe not Alaska.

155
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.130
<v 0>We'll ask it. Probably not too much different, but throughout north America,</v>

156
00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:41.020
like if you listened to, or you read rather the, uh, tales of, um, um,

157
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.250
uh, Boone and not Boone and Crockett, uh, the Lewis and Clark,

158
00:08:45.251 --> 00:08:48.430
when they made their way across the country, like they found a lot of game.

159
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.490
There was a lot of animals. I mean, it was just an abundance of animals.

160
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.770
And then of course, if they ran into Buffalo,

161
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.240
obviously there was millions and millions of Buffalo.

162
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.830
<v 1>Unbelievable. That's the difference between Alaska and down here,</v>

163
00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:03.200
down here with modified everything with paved,

164
00:09:03.201 --> 00:09:05.840
everything over Alaska is still wild.

165
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.230
Northern Alaska is the most wild place left in this country.

166
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.210
That's why I went there. It's barely.

167
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.550
<v 0>This country too. I mean, it's not even attached.</v>

168
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.120
<v 1>Yeah. Some people don't really think of Alaska, the United States. It's not.</v>

169
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.140
<v 0>But it's not. It's a frozen Puerto Rico. It's way up there.</v>

170
00:09:21.141 --> 00:09:25.880
It's not even connected to us. It's one of those weird ones, but it is why.

171
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.240
<v 1>And, and you see actually, that's what drew me to it.</v>

172
00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:33.620
The first time I ever saw the Brooks range was years before I moved to Alaska,

173
00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:38.120
I was on a flight. I used to get jobs as a courier. When I was in my twenties,

174
00:09:38.121 --> 00:09:41.540
I was real interested in traveling. And I found out this way,

175
00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:44.960
I could travel all over the world as a courier. So I would go to New York city.

176
00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:48.170
I'd get these jobs as a freelance career and take off to wherever they need me

177
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:49.004
to go.

178
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.990
And one time I got this flight to Tokyo and I'm flying right across the whole

179
00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:55.490
length of the Brooks range. Great circle.

180
00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:57.470
Route New York Tokyo takes you right across it.

181
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:02.720
600 miles of mountains from the Canadian border over to the

182
00:10:02.721 --> 00:10:04.700
Chuckchi sea, across from Siberia.

183
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.830
And there's one road across it in 600 miles. And I was just glued to the window,

184
00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:12.680
the whole flight, looking at that. Wow. I thought someday,

185
00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:15.560
I'm going to go check that place out on the ground. You know? I mean,

186
00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:17.930
it's incredible when you see those mounds that they're big nuns,

187
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.680
they up to 9,000 feet high and that one road is the haul road. Yeah.

188
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.180
Also known as the Dalton highway that was built in 1974,

189
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.910
just to construct the Alaska pipeline to get to the oil up at Pluto bay on the

190
00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:33.410
north slope, the oil fields up there,

191
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.970
they built that road in one summer's amazing story in itself. Wow. Yeah,

192
00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:41.900
they started in April and they had the whole thing done in one summer from, uh,

193
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.600
the Yukon river all the way up to the Arctic ocean.

194
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.600
<v 0>So when you got down to one bag of flour, yeah.</v>

195
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.320
Was there a part in your head where you're like, what, what am I doing here?

196
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.270
<v 1>No, I never wondered what I was doing. No, no. Oh. It always felt right for you.</v>

197
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.760
Oh yeah. What I was doing there is looking for a most.

198
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.290
Yeah. And you already had.

199
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.130
<v 0>That whole shed built for meat. Oh, there's no shed for me.</v>

200
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.630
What's that thing that you do? Well,

201
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:12.200
you have everything like the sock covered up the sod house. Yeah. No.

202
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.670
<v 1>That came. That came like four years later. Yeah, no, no,</v>

203
00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:20.690
I didn't have that yet. I didn't even have a meet Paul. Really? No.

204
00:11:20.691 --> 00:11:22.340
I built to meet Paul after I got the most,

205
00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:25.130
the same maple that's still there that you've seen is 20 feet high.

206
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.540
And I built that with a piece of parachute cord and a,

207
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.410
a little block and tackle that you can fit in the Palm of your hand that just

208
00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:37.040
had parachute cord it. And I, I, I had to get, well that big it's,

209
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.820
I'm actually talking about that platform. That's right beside the meat pole.

210
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.700
Right. Um, the meat poles, 20 feet high, the plastic explained.

211
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.820
<v 0>To you. I see what, what a meat poll is so that they know just.</v>

212
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.773
<v 3>To.</v>

213
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.160
<v 1>That's like my freezer. I don't have a freezer out there,</v>

214
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.550
so I just hang up and I live in the freezer.

215
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:58.870
The Arctic's your freezer from September until usually

216
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.070
sometime in may.

217
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:04.870
I can keep meat with out anything other than the open air around it.

218
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.090
Yeah. That's a.

219
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:10.710
<v 4>Long time. It's most of the year. Yeah. Lakes.</v>

220
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:15.300
<v 1>Only thought out from June until most years around the</v>

221
00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:16.800
1st of October freezes over.

222
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.270
So you get about four months old and water by eight months of ice. So.

223
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.790
<v 0>You're basically living off of fish for those months.</v>

224
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.560
<v 1>No. Um, there,</v>

225
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.150
there was one year when I caught a lot of fish there.

226
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.390
Um, cause I stayed there. I stayed there one time,

227
00:12:33.391 --> 00:12:37.920
15 months without going to town and by yourself, no,

228
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.820
uh, I was only there for four months totally by myself,

229
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.630
but I'm not totally crazy. I went back out and,

230
00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:48.580
and I got my woman to come in there with me after she's told me.

231
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.280
<v 5>Maybe it's true. I got divorced from her later. But, um, but, uh,</v>

232
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.600
actually, no.

233
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.680
<v 1>I S most of the time I've been out there, I've had a family, uh,</v>

234
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.090
with me most of the time I went out there, uh, you know,

235
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:11.040
I actually was, uh, I, I got married. Um, before I went out there,

236
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.540
I went out there for four months. I went back, I got Sylvia, my ex-wife. And,

237
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.230
um, we were out there for years, you know, we would go back and forth.

238
00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:23.760
We would go to Fairbanks for six months or sometimes a year.

239
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:27.600
We'd go out there for a year, you know, we would, um, go back and forth.

240
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.950
And then what happened was, uh, after we split up,

241
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.170
I was out there one winter, totally alone.

242
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.750
And that's when I got on the show right after that, um, it all just,

243
00:13:39.751 --> 00:13:44.550
the timing was perfect. I'm up there by myself.

244
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.710
I'm living real close to the land. I mean,

245
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:54.120
I'm sleeping under caribou hides that winter and I'm eating just caribou.

246
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:57.810
Like I had a little tiny bit of store-bought food with me, hardly anything.

247
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.520
And I hadn't seen a human being in four and a half months. Wow.

248
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.120
And the executive producer of the show flies from LA all the way up there to

249
00:14:06.121 --> 00:14:07.920
meet me and lands. And it was no,

250
00:14:07.921 --> 00:14:11.340
you were there the summer before I was in fair banks.

251
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.380
And for a few years,

252
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.920
I was trying to figure out how can I share this stuff I'm experiencing?

253
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.270
Cause it's incredible. I'm just,

254
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.960
I'm realizing that this is not ordinary life anymore.

255
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.670
And there are a lot of people that don't even realize what's going on out here

256
00:14:26.671 --> 00:14:30.360
in the middle of the wilderness. So I'm talking to people,

257
00:14:30.361 --> 00:14:33.450
I'm trying to find some kind of a filmmaker or somebody.

258
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.860
And I don't know anything about it,

259
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:39.000
but I'm trying to find somebody to help me do something like a documentary or

260
00:14:39.001 --> 00:14:43.530
something like this. So my friends know this,

261
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.640
somebody handed me an email address. They said, you should write to this person.

262
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.210
They're looking for people like you. They told me it was a filmmaker.

263
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.560
Didn't know what it was. I sent off an email. I said, hi, you know,

264
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.940
I live in the wilderness.

265
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.630
I'd like to talk to you about if you're interested in making a documentary.

266
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.330
And few days later,

267
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.840
I started walking from the road again to get back to my camp.

268
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:09.680
So I left them a satellite phone number. I said,

269
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:12.170
this is my only means of communication. It's a satellite phone.

270
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:15.770
I don't keep it turned on because it runs on a battery.

271
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.950
You can send a message to it. I check it once in a while.

272
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.770
It's basically for emergencies only, but you can communicate with me this way.

273
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.200
And I put that in the email, how to do it. Well,

274
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.930
that whole winter went by eight months. Went by. I hadn't heard from them.

275
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.380
I'd forgotten about that person. I'd send emails to a lot of people.

276
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.260
And then one day I turned on my phone. There's this message there.

277
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.570
They want to talk to me.

278
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:41.630
So I called them up and we start talking and they tell me it's

279
00:15:41.631 --> 00:15:42.800
a reality TV show.

280
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.700
And I had literally never seen a reality TV show in my life.

281
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.210
I hadn't watched TV for many, many years. And.

282
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.550
<v 0>So you had no idea what that even meant. Not.</v>

283
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.580
<v 1>Really. I talked to them about that, but they mostly didn't.</v>

284
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.800
They mostly want to talk about me, not about them.

285
00:15:57.801 --> 00:16:00.730
And I kept trying to get information, like, what is this.

286
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.130
<v 5>Exactly right. You know? And uh, because.</v>

287
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.650
<v 1>I kept, I remember I kept saying what I really want to do.</v>

288
00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:11.500
I want to talk about nature out here. And they're like, well,

289
00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:14.080
we don't want to make a show about nature. We'll make a show about you.

290
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.090
But in any case,

291
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.890
I learned what reality TV was over the next few months,

292
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.170
because after we talked for two weeks,

293
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.320
the executive producer flew all the way up from LA.

294
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.340
He flew from Fairbanks on a little ski plane out there to meet me.

295
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.670
And he landed and met me to make sure that I wasn't the biggest bullshitter

296
00:16:33.671 --> 00:16:35.980
they'd ever talked to. They had no idea. I mean,

297
00:16:35.981 --> 00:16:38.680
they're just talking about a satellite phone and I was telling them, okay,

298
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.160
you know, right now I'm living off these two caribou. I killed last month. And,

299
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.550
and they came out there and they saw that it was real. And they were like, yeah,

300
00:16:45.551 --> 00:16:49.510
we want you in the show. Wow. And a few weeks later we were making TV.

301
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.740
<v 0>So they had to come out just to check, to see if your story was legit. Yeah.</v>

302
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.970
And then to come and get actually lake. Yeah. The actual lake where you living.

303
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.070
<v 1>I couldn't give him references. I mean, I was all on out there. Wow.</v>

304
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.430
<v 0>That must've been very surreal for you. The guy lands out there,</v>

305
00:17:06.431 --> 00:17:07.750
some Hollywood Jack off.

306
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.780
<v 2>Comes out to visit you. Great. It was again.</v>

307
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.930
<v 1>As solitary. I hadn't seen anybody four and a half months. That's a long time.</v>

308
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.260
<v 0>I mean, with all due respect, I just mean a Hollywood person, you know, like a,</v>

309
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:23.530
an LA television producer flies out to mint to meet you when you're doing your

310
00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:26.560
wilderness thing. Like what a convergence of worlds.

311
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:31.510
There's no world that's more removed from the world of living by yourself

312
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.950
in the woods. Then Hollywood, that's like the most opposite of it.

313
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.820
<v 1>In some ways, but we're all human. Yes. We're all human.</v>

314
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.080
And we had a great afternoon together. We had an awesome afternoon together.

315
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.560
<v 0>Take them and show them your routes and all the places where you go.</v>

316
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.520
It was in April. I had a packed.

317
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.770
<v 1>Trail on the snow. That's still winter where I am.</v>

318
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.850
And I took him out for a walk up onto a mountain side.

319
00:17:56.851 --> 00:17:58.590
So he could get a view of the whole country there.

320
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:03.510
And it just happened that the first grisly

321
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.320
track I'd seen that spring that had come out of hibernation was right there in

322
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:07.890
front of us,

323
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.750
that the bear had hit my trail and was walking down my PAC trail right in

324
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:16.110
front of us. It was that day. Totally fresh track.

325
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:20.520
So that was exciting. And did you see the bear? No,

326
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.610
we didn't see the bear. It had headed up the mountain. Um,

327
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.380
it was walking a lot faster than we were, but we saw

328
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.850
a lot of, uh, beautiful things that day. And you know,

329
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.150
he shot a sizzle reel and he brought it back for the network to see and.

330
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.160
<v 3>Everything. Wow. So what were you thinking when the guy left? Like.</v>

331
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.030
<v 1>I was thinking, is this going to Dallas fun? That was cool.</v>

332
00:18:44.031 --> 00:18:46.310
I got to show somebody around, out here, you know,

333
00:18:46.311 --> 00:18:49.250
because other than my immediate family that had been there with me,

334
00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:52.910
my wife and we had two kids by then, you know that, uh,

335
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.440
they hadn't been there since the year before,

336
00:18:54.441 --> 00:18:57.290
but nobody had ever seen it with me. I,

337
00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.970
I never had had anybody out there to, to walk.

338
00:19:01.971 --> 00:19:04.670
And we were all these years by the time this happened,

339
00:19:04.671 --> 00:19:07.040
I'd been out there for nine years off and on, you know,

340
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.770
I'd had my camp out there since 2000 actually.

341
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.850
And I'd been kind of living there at least half the time for nine years.

342
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.460
I'd gotten to know that country so well, all the mountains I'd walked some days,

343
00:19:19.461 --> 00:19:23.600
20, 25 miles, over 5,000 foot mountains and everything hunting, sheep,

344
00:19:23.601 --> 00:19:28.130
hunting caribou, and just looking around trapping sometimes. Um,

345
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.610
but always alone. Why was this life.

346
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.820
<v 0>So appealing to you from such a young age? Like the fact that you're,</v>

347
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.870
you're 13 years old, you make that walk all the way across Fremont.

348
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.200
I mean, that's, that's a long walk.

349
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:42.951
<v 1>You know,</v>

350
00:19:42.951 --> 00:19:47.270
I grew up in a small town right near the base of the highest mountain in

351
00:19:47.271 --> 00:19:48.440
Vermont, Mount Mansfield.

352
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.820
And some of my earliest memories are looking at that mountain wanting to go up

353
00:19:52.821 --> 00:19:56.570
there. And I got to the top of mountain by the time I was nine,

354
00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:59.930
but it took me nine years to get up there. Things take time. It's.

355
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.080
<v 0>Always been something that's, you're drawn to. I guess,</v>

356
00:20:03.081 --> 00:20:06.950
some reason you're drawn to being in the wilderness. I'm drawn to a lot.

357
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.110
<v 1>Of things, but the wilderness, definitely one of them, when.</v>

358
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.290
<v 0>You get there, do you feel like everything's right?</v>

359
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.420
Like when you finally got to your place and you finally started when you walked

360
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.390
60 miles out there and started living,

361
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.900
did you finally feel like I'm in my spot? This is where I'm supposed to be.

362
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.180
<v 3>Oh yeah. Like you knew, you know.</v>

363
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:31.100
<v 1>I had literally been planning to do exactly that in the Brooks range for</v>

364
00:20:31.101 --> 00:20:35.990
seven years. Like that's what I was doing every day was preparing to do that.

365
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.493
Wow.

366
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.220
<v 0>But what was it about it that was so compelling?</v>

367
00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:46.550
Like why was that a thing that you were so drawn to?

368
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.480
<v 1>Because when I was living in the woods before that,</v>

369
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.630
when I was in the TP in Vermont, every single day,

370
00:20:55.631 --> 00:21:00.040
I'd wake up with a smile on my face. I'd just be excited. What was going on?

371
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.630
Get up, look out, see the fog coming up off the water on the lake,

372
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.980
you know? Oh, wow. There's something over there. There's a loon, whatever it is.

373
00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:12.670
There's um, I was just excited by what was going on out there.

374
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:15.580
And I just felt really connected to it.

375
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.530
And there are a lot of really positive aspects to being out in the woods.

376
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.520
I mean, just the physical part. Like I like to stay in shape.

377
00:21:24.521 --> 00:21:28.360
I like to be active and you can't help, but be active out there. You can't help,

378
00:21:28.361 --> 00:21:32.260
but stay in shape. Um, I like the diet. I mean,

379
00:21:32.261 --> 00:21:36.700
once I started eating animals, I killed myself and food that I collected myself,

380
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:39.040
you know, plant food too. It was, um,

381
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.920
that was the best food I ever ate in my life.

382
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.580
When I ate that first moose I killed. I mean,

383
00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.110
I never had anything better.

384
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.010
<v 0>It's a crazy way to live, man.</v>

385
00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.070
It's interesting because most people would tell you, Hey, you gotta get a job.

386
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.810
You gotta, you gotta be a normal person. You can't just go out there and live.

387
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.090
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Well, and that's what I told him. I said,</v>

388
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:05.680
I'm going to make a career out of this now.

389
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.490
I didn't know exactly how it was going to play out. Um,

390
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:14.650
but I was always confident that it was a valuable thing to do and that it would

391
00:22:14.651 --> 00:22:16.060
not only benefit me,

392
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:20.080
but in the long run that I would be able to share this with people and that it

393
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:23.830
would pay off. And it did. It just, uh, took time.
