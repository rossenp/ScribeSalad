00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How often are you guys washing your keyboards?</v>

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.040
I feel bad. Every time my son touches my computer and.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.730
<v 1>It's probably keeping them healthy.</v>

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.220
<v 0>There's so much bacteria on that board cover and they use that.</v>

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.570
Dustin blast thing is great. I don't use any of that. Just blowing comrade.

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.650
<v 1>Gross. Your kitchen tables. Gross. Everything's gross. Right?</v>

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.960
<v 0>Do you think about like homeless people touching guardrails?</v>

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.740
It's like you go and touch that like ah, homeless people, the subway,

9
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:36.310
the subway rails must be just, oh, it's brutal. But the amount of times I've,

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.970
I've done this in New York city, like, I'll be going to put my hand on the hand.

11
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:41.220
I just don't touch handrails anymore. And I make sure that my son does it,

12
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.140
but I've just been putting my hand on the rail.

13
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:46.290
And then I just pick up a bugger, like a human bugger. And I'm like, okay,

14
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.860
my week, the story just ruined my hour

15
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.850
and I'm definitely, I'm definitely going to flick it.

16
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.310
And then it gets stuck in your thumb. You it again. It gets back on that.

17
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.130
<v 1>Finger, something about other dudes, buggers. It's really, there's no.</v>

18
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.650
<v 0>Way that that would end my day and your own kids book.</v>

19
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.260
I'll pick my son's nose in a heartbeat. It's just a random.

20
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.930
<v 1>Different though. That's your own son? I mean.</v>

21
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.920
<v 0>He's six now you should stop.</v>

22
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.050
<v 1>Yeah, definitely stopped picking his nose.</v>

23
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.900
How old is it when you be really concerned?

24
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:16.290
If your son is still sucking their thumb, how many years in.

25
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.360
<v 0>I wanted to wait anymore.</v>

26
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.190
<v 1>And until you confirm and they go, okay, well now I know.</v>

27
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.080
<v 0>My son never sucked his thumb. So.</v>

28
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.110
<v 1>I'll give you out a kid though. If you had a boy.</v>

29
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.160
<v 0>Girl, if you had never said she loves second thumb, you don't have any kids.</v>

30
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.390
I got a eight month old.

31
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.220
<v 1>[Inaudible] I didn't know you were out there breeding. I am. Congratulations.</v>

32
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:44.340
Now you become even more libertarian, correct? Yeah, but not like.

33
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.850
<v 0>I'm an authoritarian with my baby. I make the decisions there.</v>

34
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.250
<v 1>That's a good move. Don't let babies call the shots.</v>

35
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.320
Now that'll be just sugar and guns.

36
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.143
<v 0>But um.</v>

37
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.740
<v 1>I teach a baby how to shoot a gun. If a baby could actively shoot a gun,</v>

38
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.830
like, you know how much of a giant problem that would be like,

39
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:07.410
if a baby was just like, dude, yeah.

40
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.470
<v 0>I'm feeling like I'm not enough of a libertarian because here's a gun,</v>

41
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:11.304
go homestead. Some light.

42
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.750
<v 1>Their body can't really hold a gun and shoot it. Right. It would go flying.</v>

43
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.570
There's no way. But if they could do you know how,

44
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:22.770
what a great time they would think it would be to shoot your baby.

45
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.610
And you had a guy just like, don't do dude dumb, dumb. Right?

46
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.190
<v 0>They love it. The projectiles, my son has those Nerf guns.</v>

47
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.310
That's how I know he's not gay. He loves to shoot things.

48
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.250
<v 1>And a lot of gay people that shoot things. Now that's.</v>

49
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.590
<v 0>How I know is not good. Like he kept shooting his friend in the face,</v>

50
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:38.424
the other guy.

51
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.060
<v 1>What do you think about.</v>

52
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.950
<v 0>Bears? So then he was hiding the bullets in his book.</v>

53
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.980
<v 1>If you had a bunch of bears that you, uh,</v>

54
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.330
couldn't take them out to like a shotgun range and shoot clay pigeons, you know,

55
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.720
they was like.

56
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.700
<v 0>15 Minutes before they started each other. Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.533
<v 1>Eventually.</v>

58
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.480
<v 0>Oh my God. The. But this kind of gave me so horny.</v>

59
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.680
<v 1>They're guys. They're just guys who like guys, they got the wacky wire,</v>

60
00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.693
the kids that I.

61
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.190
<v 0>Grew. I'm sure. Yes. There are gay guys who like to do doodly dude things,</v>

62
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:04.300
right? Oh, definitely.

63
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.330
<v 1>But doodly do you.</v>

64
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.660
<v 0>Know? Not that often. I mean, how many gay friends you have that are like,</v>

65
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.970
we should really go shooting guns right now. Let's go hunt.

66
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.910
<v 2>I bet there's a bunch you want to shop and that's.</v>

67
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.620
<v 0>Fine. They do.</v>

68
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.180
<v 1>But isn't it like girls, like there's girls that are like woodsy girls,</v>

69
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.670
girls want to live in the woods and. Yeah. I think.

70
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.520
<v 0>These are exceptions.</v>

71
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.140
<v 2>And if you're a gay like mountainy guy and you're another mountain,</v>

72
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.600
he guys probably going to have an all right life. That's also.

73
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.180
<v 1>Hot gay mountainy guys alone. Just Bolton down the door before they bought Fox,</v>

74
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.240
looking out the issue should the neighbors don't know what.

75
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.810
So are you fell as brothers and sisters? Brother-in-law.

76
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.750
<v 2>What's going on?</v>

77
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.220
They run a seasonal marina and then they just suck and in the off season.

78
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.860
<v 1>I'm on the road where those two homos live. Yeah.</v>

79
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.700
<v 2>There's a couple of whatever it is.</v>

80
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.210
There's a couple of heavy dudes living in the L fishing house.

81
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.450
<v 1>Don't get me wrong. Great guys. Great guys.</v>

82
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.480
All they do is chop with them. But.

83
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.750
<v 2>That was the bagel boss guy. When he said that he goes,</v>

84
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.020
I got a problem with gay people. He goes, just don't touch me. You know,

85
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.660
especially in the private area that we'll have the problem I go.

86
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.920
Is that what your life's worried about?

87
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.680
You don't want to hang out and I gave you is your property is going to start

88
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:19.330
grabbing viciously at your Dick.

89
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.880
<v 1>Do you think that guy's, uh, he's going to stick in there.</v>

90
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.370
You think he's going to be a like Joe, the plumber?

91
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.980
Or do you think he's going to have some legs to them? I think this is.

92
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.470
<v 2>Going to Lenny. Dykstra is going to knock him out.</v>

93
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.930
<v 0>He's five, 10. He's a former. I know.</v>

94
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:35.590
He's like he ain't got alcohol problems and, but he's got those big hands.

95
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:37.630
I saw the video of him getting arrested the other day. He's.

96
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.470
<v 1>Going to hit the bagel boss. He left.</v>

97
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.020
<v 0>Tanks was fighting bagel, boss.</v>

98
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.720
<v 1>Boxing. No.</v>

99
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.270
<v 2>And then it's like, she was, you know, older now, but I mean,</v>

100
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:48.160
he's Lenny Dykstra. He's a lunatic. He's.

101
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.360
<v 0>Only 55.</v>

102
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.470
<v 2>Something like that. He looks like 70, but he's still a stocky dude,</v>

103
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.333
but he's like.

104
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.730
<v 0>Four foot eight he's I.</v>

105
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.830
<v 2>Mean five was he phase four.</v>

106
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.320
<v 0>He's really small.</v>

107
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.490
<v 1>I don't, you've seen that guy. I've seen, he went to one of, uh,</v>

108
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.090
someone's MMA gym and he was hanging out with a bunch of fighters and he was

109
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:13.660
throwing punches and dancing around the ring. I think I want to say Matt Serra.

110
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:16.990
Was it Matt Serra. Chris Weidman yeah. He was an island guy. Yeah.

111
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:19.720
So he was out there. Uh it's like,

112
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:23.500
he's not like he doesn't have a background in martial arts. Like you could tell.

113
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.663
No that's over.

114
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.350
<v 0>That really fight. And he's also at a.</v>

115
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.260
<v 1>Shape shape. And he said tiny little fellow.</v>

116
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.870
<v 2>Like a butterfly sting, like a butterfly there's no.</v>

117
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.250
<v 0>Yeah. There's no good. There's no learning how to fight. Getting in shape,</v>

118
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.170
doing it all. Like it. Yeah. He's.

119
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.003
<v 1>Too small.</v>

120
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.830
<v 0>It looks like he's been in a bunch of fist fights.</v>

121
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.030
<v 2>He used to be arrested language. Jack did a point his life.</v>

122
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.530
I mean like shredded and you're.

123
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.080
<v 0>Losing that strength. You're not going to leave. Even if he's out of shape,</v>

124
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.440
even if.

125
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.350
<v 2>He's, he's still a strong like boltsy guy, I'm.</v>

126
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.300
<v 1>Sure even a conversation it's.</v>

127
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.370
<v 2>Going to kill him. So he was saying they heavy, heavy on lady.</v>

128
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.780
<v 1>Push it off. Lenny Dykstra. Crazy. He's a.</v>

129
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.020
<v 2>I think there's no way. There's no integrity in celebrity boxing though.</v>

130
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:12.020
I don't know if you could bet like a zillion dollars the top. Yeah.

131
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.003
That's him now. So.

132
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.620
<v 1>He's only 55. That's crazy.</v>

133
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.750
<v 2>Now he's holding that. Isn't he?</v>

134
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.820
<v 0>It's going to be a little bit older. I just looked it up the other day.</v>

135
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.740
It's now he's not that old.

136
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.700
<v 1>He was a legit.</v>

137
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.550
<v 2>Wild man. Yeah. When he was that right there, he looks like my cookie. Yup.</v>

138
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.510
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

139
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.350
<v 1>Yeah. He was, that guy was a legit wild man. Look at that.</v>

140
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:34.640
Lenny Dykstra indicted for drugs, threats, falling arrest in may who? Yeah,

141
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.420
he's the one.

142
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.141
<v 0>Yes. Uber driver.</v>

143
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:39.860
He was high on ecstasy and Coke and got into an argument with Uber driver and

144
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:44.090
then threaten his life. When the cops come, the cops come and they're like,

145
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:47.570
yeah, this guy is saying his fear for his life. He's like, well, for me, for me,

146
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.540
it's the place so innocent. It's hilarious. That's funny.

147
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.910
And then he start checking his bag and he starts freaking out about them going

148
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:53.720
through his bag.

149
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.710
<v 2>56. Yeah. Wow. Wow. I thought he was older than that even.</v>

150
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.970
<v 1>Yeah. I've lived in them hard years, son ahead of celebrity fight.</v>

151
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.080
Lenny Dykstra says bagel. Boss has one inch penis that was outrageous.

152
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.010
Click on that, please.

153
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.720
[inaudible] So rude.

154
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.583
<v 0>The world we live in.</v>

155
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.590
<v 2>Lenny Dykstra went on Howard stern and did like, uh,</v>

156
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.470
he said like he had girls come on and say how good eats.

157
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.920
And they were like swearing down there and then stir. It was a comic.

158
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:26.030
So he brought comedians from LA and then the comedians immediately just used it

159
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.270
for like a credit and then just, uh, bumped his whole thing.

160
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.190
So he flew them in for nothing.

161
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.080
<v 1>That's funny. It's a crazy that he's going to hit that little guy.</v>

162
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.860
Cause that's so, so wrong. I guess the little guy,

163
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:42.950
I wonder if I could just go down quick. Yeah.

164
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.060
<v 0>Celebrity boxing. It doesn't usually get too brutal. I think, you know.</v>

165
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.970
<v 1>I think punch him once and it might kill him.</v>

166
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.630
<v 2>Bonaduce used to go for it though.</v>

167
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.730
<v 1>Hecky doesn't help you at all.</v>

168
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.030
Heck it sometimes makes it worse because he got all this extra weight in your

169
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:02.090
head snaps more know you get, if you get head gear on,

170
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:03.770
that's more that you have to control.

171
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.040
Like one of the things about having a strong neck is when you get punched,

172
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.280
you can kind of control your head from moving around too much.

173
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.140
Some guys can take it better,

174
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.790
but if you have a head gear on it's like extra weight and your brain sloshes

175
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:20.000
around inside your head, I mean, it protects you from cuts more than anything.

176
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.880
This is, there's an argument that it would protect you from cuts,

177
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.940
but the protecting you from the thud. Cause it's not,

178
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:30.080
it's the rocking of your brain. You know? Like it's,

179
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.750
in some ways it's, it's a real mixed bag.

180
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:34.490
In some ways it's better to have head gear on.

181
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.090
Cause there's a little more cushioning. But in other ways, like it's, it makes.

182
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:38.960
<v 0>It way more dangerous.</v>

183
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.660
<v 2>You folded it on and took it off because I was surprised you did that.</v>

184
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:42.494
But you were like.

185
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.461
<v 0>And if I were the head guy,</v>

186
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:46.730
I tried to change it at the end because I started sparring with it.

187
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:48.950
And it's sucks, Dick dude, you can't breathe.

188
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.050
You can't say when you start grappling,

189
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:53.630
you start feeling like you're being smothered right away. No matter what,

190
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:54.530
as soon as they touch your head,

191
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:56.670
you feel like that starts moving up in your face.

192
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.040
So I try to get them to take it off and they wouldn't.

193
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.790
And then my head gear broke like in the first minute of the fight and they were

194
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:04.560
like, all right, you take it off. Cause it was a show.

195
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.910
So we both took off our head gear and I was like, wow.

196
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.280
<v 1>Where's the rules. Yeah. Yeah. Head gears. A tricky thing.</v>
