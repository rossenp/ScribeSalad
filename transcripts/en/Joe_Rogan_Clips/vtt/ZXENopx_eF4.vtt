1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.060
<v 0>Hello, freak. Yeah. And I think I learned from that experience,</v>

2
00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:07.310
I enjoyed the experience of being on ecstasy,

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.810
but the comedown was just way too brutal. I was like, this is not good for you.

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.160
I think like chemicals, that manmade stuff that doesn't exist in nature that,

5
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.750
or, you know, LSD sort of does and Hawaiian baby Woodrow seeds and some,

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.890
some other things you can actually give, reduce track the GHB. No,

7
00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:29.090
I heard that's, I heard that is really dangerous. I,

8
00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:32.560
I O D I was in a coma. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What happened? I,

9
00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:37.010
I took was the out, but so it's so dumb when I did, I took,

10
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.970
I took ecstasy and then I was having some drinks,

11
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.760
like I probably had like four or five drinks, which is, you know,

12
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.580
like liquor grapes. Right. Like, and then I was like,

13
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.110
I don't feel this ecstasy at all. This guy called you, by the way,

14
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.590
I'm a freshman in college. So 19, 19. Yeah.

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.660
So then he's like, I got,

16
00:00:56.661 --> 00:01:01.400
he's got a gallon of GHB in the back now you're supposed to take, uh,

17
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.630
like if you take a four, you take like a water cap. Yeah. That's,

18
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.410
that's what we did. We would take it like this.

19
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.310
You'd pour it into that and just that's it. And then that's it. Yeah. Well,

20
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:14.210
he has a milk jug, so he gives it to me and I'm like, and he's like, here,

21
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:18.800
just take a swig. Well, and when I look back on it, I realize what I did to,

22
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:21.740
it was just like, out of like, not wanting to be rude, basically.

23
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:25.610
Like politeness almost killed me is that I open it. And I can't, you couldn't,

24
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:30.410
it's too heavy to like, you know, a milk jug just is like a thin little cap.

25
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.290
Right. You can't fill it. So you're trying to like, well, how much?

26
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.860
So I realized I went like this and I realized there's too much in my mouth.

27
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.640
There's there's six capitals in my mouth. Oh no.

28
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:44.180
So I'm not gonna spit it in what he's going to sell. If I spit it out,

29
00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:48.860
it's like, I'm spitting $50 on the ground. Oh my God.

30
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.540
And I give it back to him.

31
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.340
What kind of an has a milk jug of GHB around his house.

32
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.280
And then I continue drinking.

33
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.970
And that's the one thing about GHB is you're you're not supposed to have any

34
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:06.650
alcohol with it. Like not even a drink. So you black out, you go into a coma.

35
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.530
Yeah. Who say, what do you mean? I,

36
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.700
I remember all the way up until like moments before blacking out.

37
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.680
Like I was hanging out. I was, I realized that I was like, highest. Like,

38
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.180
like PERMA grin, like, ah, and just like, like when, like we should hang out,

39
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:26.000
man, like buying drinks for like just being a.

40
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.110
And then I remember I sat down and uh,

41
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.070
and then I blacked out and my sister was at this bar. We were all at a bar.

42
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.540
And my sister was like, he, like, everyone was like, just let him sleep it off.

43
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.760
And she's the one that called the, uh, the ambulance,

44
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.090
like they had to, you know, and then I woke up with like tubes and all kinds of.

45
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.960
Yeah. It sucked. It was really suck. Don't overdose on GHB. It's not fun.

46
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.720
Be rude. Be rude. Spit that out. Put it on the ground, man.

47
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.120
Yeah. I've never with that stuff. I've never with cocaine heroin.

48
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.970
Here's the thing too about GHB. Is that in its real natural form, like when,

49
00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:10.480
what it really is, it's like, you know, it can be regulated. It's used like,

50
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.390
as an anesthetic in, in, in like parts of Europe.

51
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.510
But when you buy it from like street level people,

52
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.310
it's obviously it's with like, people will spike it with anything.

53
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.410
Even if they didn't spike it, you drank so much of it. Right? Oh yeah.

54
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.170
I would've been if, um, but still they used to sell that at GNC. Right.

55
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.590
It used to be for bodybuilders body to recover. And that was kind of the,

56
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.290
the thing, like when you, when, when we started,

57
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:38.500
like I used to sample it and stuff, you would use dudes.

58
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.520
It was under the guise of like, well, I'm lifting weights, you know?

59
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.590
Like I gotta get strong. It's up. I'm lifting weight, lifting weights. Oh,

60
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:48.424
that's hilarious.

61
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.520
<v 1>Those shows made like the honeymooners. That's a window into another time. Yeah,</v>

62
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.330
sure. They watching Lucille ball watching the honeymooners,

63
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.310
the honeymooners every week.

64
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.200
Ralph Kramden with threatened to beat the out of his wife. Yeah. That's true.

65
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.440
Not just occasionally every week.

66
00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:10.710
He would like to the moon. Yeah.

67
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.850
He would talk about punching her in the face and knocking her to the moon.

68
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.690
<v 2>She deserved it, but it stopped me. Just stop.</v>

69
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.890
<v 1>And think about like culturally, how crazy people were. It's not that long ago.</v>

70
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.900
We need to understand what a giant change has happened

71
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.973
in our culture.

72
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.210
And I think one of the best ways to really document it is to watch old shows,

73
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.580
watch what they, what they excepted back then and watch what they accept today.

74
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.770
There's a newspaper.

75
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.400
<v 3>Article. I just saw from somebody posted it,</v>

76
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.480
I think on Twitter. And it was,

77
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.700
it was the, they polled guy. It was an old newspaper article.

78
00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:58.560
They pulled guys whether it's okay to spank a woman and

79
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.420
the answers they pulled like five or six guys. It was an old article.

80
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.090
And they were all like, absolutely. Like she needs it. If she,

81
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.910
if she's out of line and she doesn't know she's doing it,

82
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.730
just trying to help her. And this was a newspaper thing where they were like,

83
00:05:11.731 --> 00:05:15.480
see guys. Yeah. It was to make you feel okay about spanking yearly.

84
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.760
I tweeted that. Oh, you tweeted that? Yeah. Okay. I don't know.

85
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:18.600
I just saw an article.

86
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.750
<v 1>Well, I might've retweeted it, but either way I definitely tweeted it.</v>

87
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.440
I thought that was hilarious. Yeah. If a woman needs it,

88
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.650
should she be spanked the best part about it was rich. Read it. Let's read.

89
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.560
Yeah. It's so funny. Why not? Jesus Christ.

90
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.530
If they don't know how to behave by the time they're adults,

91
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.970
they should be treated like children and spanked that ought to make them grow up

92
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:46.170
in a hurry. If it doesn't at first they'll soon. Get the idea.

93
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.340
This is incredible. I get the idea. I, yes.

94
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.810
When they deserve it as a barber, I've got a lot of faith in the hairbrush.

95
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.580
Oh my God.

96
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.970
I think there are certain cases when it is advisable. When it is.

97
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.240
There's no reason why you shouldn't go right ahead and do it.

98
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.120
I can't knock the idea in my business.

99
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.440
A man sets a lot of store of sets,

100
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:17.420
a lot of store by the results he can get with a hairbrush properly applied.

101
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.080
Nice little smack. Now here's the counterpoint though. Sets a lot of stores.

102
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.180
<v 3>Maybe that's a business term back then. That's a lot of store.</v>

103
00:06:25.181 --> 00:06:27.850
Are you ready for the counterpoint? Yes. There is none. Everybody. Yeah.

104
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.040
<v 1>Yeah. That's incredible.</v>

105
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.010
That's the best part is everybody takes the point of view because this guy

106
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:36.640
parking lot attendant from Brooklyn. You Betty Galella you bet.

107
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.720
You bet it teaches him. Who's boss. A lot of women tend to forget.

108
00:06:40.721 --> 00:06:41.860
This is a man's world.

109
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.270
And a lot of men who stepped down as boss of a family wished they hadn't

110
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.800
spanking might help get back. Some of the respect, they lost. Look at Teddy.

111
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.630
Look at them as Joey Diaz, his cousin listen, spank them.

112
00:06:55.631 --> 00:07:00.070
If they want it. William Davis, what is Williamson? He's a toy factory owner.

113
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.070
Yes. Most of them have it coming to them. Anyway.

114
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.810
If they don't, it will remind them of how well off they are.

115
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.700
I subscribed to the theory that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

116
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.180
Holy. Look at him. Look at that evil looking.

117
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.890
It looks like Rutger house brother. Wow. Does he look like Rutger?

118
00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:24.950
Hauer and Robert de Niro. That looks evil. Man.

119
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.820
Think that one a Holtzman. Oh yeah.

120
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.580
He does a little like Holsman imagine that guy spanking your wife.

121
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.600
Let's see what the other people does. That last one. Yep.

122
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.350
<v 3>That's awesome. Well, did you check out my special bombing episode?</v>

123
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.970
<v 1>No. You told me about it.</v>

124
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:42.280
We were talking about it before the podcast and we it's funny.

125
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:46.600
We're all like almost three hours in. We were going to mention it two hours in,

126
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.520
um, what the happened? You were up in, uh, Winnipeg. I was going to Winnipeg.

127
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.390
<v 3>I was um, doing this club that I've done many times called rumors.</v>

128
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.050
It's an old club. It's a good club. And it was a Saturday night.

129
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.780
And instead of like regular comedy club crowd,

130
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.350
it happened to be like private event.

131
00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:13.060
People like a group of 80 was doing their corporate party.

132
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.661
You know what I mean?

133
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:17.260
So it wasn't like it wasn't individuals buying one and two.

134
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.510
<v 1>Tickets, giant group.</v>

135
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.830
<v 3>Giant groups. So there was like three groups. One was like 80 and one was 60.</v>

136
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.710
So you don't like, it's more like you're doing a corporate,

137
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.000
like you're doing a private event, you know? And I talk, I break it down.

138
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:35.500
If you, if you want to listen to it's episode 1 70,

139
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.360
2 of your mom's house. And I play the audio from this thing,

140
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.930
falling off the rails. And I mean, it is like,

141
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:45.880
there was a lady who worked at the club.

142
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.510
She's been there 20 years and she told me, she goes, I've never seen like that.

143
00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:52.840
Even close to that before what happened. It was, I mean,

144
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.110
I think it's like a combination of things happening

145
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.720
to make it fall apart. That way basically I went up there.

146
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.190
I had one guy in the front row who I, you know,

147
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:11.970
when you just hate somebody and you fixate on them because like this one guy who

148
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:16.770
was like kinda mumbling talking, tagging my, everything I saw, no, he's like,

149
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:19.410
yeah, I bet you'd like that. And you're like, what, what did you just say?

150
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.800
One of those guys who I, absolutely lost my.

151
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.720
I didn't lose my on him, but I kind of tried to straighten them out.

152
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:33.450
And then there was one of the groups,

153
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.090
one of the groups of like 50, 50,

154
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.480
60 people was like being super loud and like the first,

155
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:41.640
like really talking loud and I went to talk to them.

156
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.320
They were kind of like, just like, kind of about it.

157
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.660
And the thing is like, it's different when you,

158
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.530
when you do a regular show and you let's say you go after somebody or you go

159
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:57.300
after a table, you're just working on five people,

160
00:09:57.301 --> 00:09:59.370
maybe, right. A group that like,

161
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.910
but then everybody else in that room has nothing to do with them. Right.

162
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.500
In this case, it was more like mob mentality where, when I was like, Hey,

163
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.330
go yourself. Then the group is like talking to us.

164
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.010
Yeah. Not, you're not saying I was just talking to them.

165
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:18.360
You're talking to my group of 80. So then it was like, no, you.

166
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.280
Like, but in, in unison, there's all of them. And then it just went.

167
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.880
Then I tried to put it back on the rails, which I was like, I'm sure I can,

168
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:32.250
I've done this a thousand times. Let me put this back together. you,

169
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:34.500
man. Like, it was like, dude,

170
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.120
they were booing in unison for like 15.

171
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.650
<v 1>20 Minutes, the 80 people.</v>

172
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.400
<v 3>At this point, it was more than their groups.</v>

173
00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:45.780
So it was probably 200 people doing that. Oh my.

174
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.480
<v 1>God. So is there group and then other groups chimed in,</v>

175
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.150
so bullying you two unrelated groups. Yes.

176
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.040
<v 3>Yes. Wow. Oh, it was pretty crazy. And then they're like, bring back the,</v>

177
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.070
I had a black feature act to like bring back the black guy,

178
00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.750
screaming that screaming at man. And it went and I here's the thing.

179
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.550
I resigned to the fact that it was so crazy. It was less emotional.

180
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:13.140
I, and I talk about this on that episode, then your standard bombing,

181
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.460
like when you're bombing an irregular bond where it's just not going your way

182
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.900
and you start to sweat and you're like, man, this sucks. Chewing up here.

183
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.350
But like, and that, and that like emotionally affects you.

184
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:31.260
This was different in that I felt like their response to

185
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:34.800
me was so outrageous.

186
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.150
Like I felt like it was unwarranted how upset they were that it affected me

187
00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:42.420
less. Like I was just standing up there. I was like, all right, guys here,

188
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.970
ready for some more jokes as they're booing me, you know, like,

189
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:48.660
not as I wasn't as flustered as I've been during a.

190
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.070
<v 1>Race. Real bomb. Yes. So you were just dealing with a giant group of yes.</v>

191
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.870
Of cons. Yes. Swimming through your pond. Yeah, exactly.

192
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.690
And why didn't the club do something about that? That's that's the only part.

193
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:05.280
<v 3>I, I, cause I take responsibility. I'm not, I try to make it clear on that.</v>

194
00:12:05.281 --> 00:12:06.510
On that episode that like,

195
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.210
I'd take responsibility for yelling at a guy for insulting people.

196
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.810
Like I'm saying, I put it on myself that I made things go downhill.

197
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:20.520
The club takes responsibility for kind of not really

198
00:12:20.521 --> 00:12:24.870
policing. And they like, the one part is I tried to,

199
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.900
I told a guy that he had to go. I was like, you have to go, you're gone.

200
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.040
See you later. And you know, I've done that before.

201
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.680
Sometimes you have to do that. Like you're outta here, man. Right.

202
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.950
And then they were like, the club came and taught and they're like,

203
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.650
just give him another chance. He's going to be good. Now when I was like,

204
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.340
I've already thrown them out. Like there's no, we're not negotiating now.

205
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.400
<v 1>Right. So the club asked to keep the guy there. Yes.</v>

206
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.770
<v 3>So that part of that, I don't know. But they, they now realize that that was up.</v>

207
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.380
Uh, like I've talked to them and they're like, that was, that was.

208
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.860
<v 1>Some people you can give a second chance. I've I've most likely,</v>

209
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:02.460
most of the time I've asked clubs to lead people along like the other. Okay.

210
00:13:02.461 --> 00:13:06.510
They're okay. They just don't do that. And he'll say to them, like,

211
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.990
you can't yell out just too confusing. Bunch.

212
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.690
<v 3>Of times. Like he's okay. Right. But this time though,</v>

213
00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:15.600
the difference was this time I was saying, get them out. Yeah.

214
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.600
<v 1>What was he saying to you while this was going on? He was.</v>

215
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.340
<v 3>It was the, he was the mumbler, the tower, like,</v>

216
00:13:23.341 --> 00:13:27.060
so we had our first interaction. We had another interaction.

217
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.890
I think the third time I said something to him, I was like,

218
00:13:31.891 --> 00:13:35.940
what the did you say? I forget exactly what he said. And then I was like, oh,

219
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:39.090
you're a tough guy. And he's like, do you want to step outside and find out?

220
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.620
And I was like, you can go outside. Cause you're out of here. You're done.

221
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.840
Get out of my show. It's my show. You're out of here. And they were like, what?

222
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.900
And his table, he goes, we all go and go great. Have a great night,

223
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.410
get the outta here. I don't need you here. That's when the,

224
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.700
the crowd was the problem, we felt like we were discussing what happened.

225
00:13:59.701 --> 00:14:00.960
I was talking about it with the club.

226
00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:05.220
The guy is that a lot of people in that room

227
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.350
didn't hear what he was saying.

228
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.390
So they thought I was just attacking a guy for no reason. Right.

229
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.240
<v 1>That makes sense. But I still.</v>

230
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.740
<v 3>I tell you, I was an that night, but.</v>

231
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.100
<v 1>That's, you know, the guy was clearly, he was instigating it.</v>

232
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:24.270
<v 3>Yeah. He was a. He was a real kind of a guy. And I didn't like him at all.</v>

233
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:29.130
And you know, I don't think that like, like I always say,

234
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:30.330
I,

235
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.860
I don't have to be like pleasing to the different,

236
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.730
like I, you know, I'm there doing comedy. You came to see my standup,

237
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.890
if you want, if you're not liking it, that's cool.

238
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.530
But if you try to take over the room.

239
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.070
<v 1>Well, it's not just taking over the room. It's interfering. Yeah.</v>

240
00:14:47.071 --> 00:14:49.860
It's interfering, interfering with the performance and it's,

241
00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:53.630
there's hundreds of other that have to deal with the fact that you have to deal

242
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:58.010
with this guy. It just it's, it's all in how to do it and not lose your cool.

243
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.730
And when you lose your cool. Yeah. So it's a, it's a bad scene.

244
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.880
Terrible feeling too. It's crazy.

245
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.100
<v 3>And the audio is insane. I mean,</v>

246
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.660
you've probably not heard a bombing like that. Yeah. It's a different,

247
00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.120
it's not like a standard bombing. I mean, there's,

248
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.830
there's a lot of aggression from the crowd on it. And how does it end? Well,

249
00:15:17.831 --> 00:15:20.920
the best part and the only I, cause I also was bummed at myself for not,

250
00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:23.680
I was like, I, you know, you know, you always look at moments where you're like,

251
00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:28.570
I wish I had said something funny or here, this was an opportunity to be funny.

252
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.720
I really, you know, so I was like a lot of it. I was like, I was like, ah,

253
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.110
you know, I really, they won. Like they, they defeated me. I was like,

254
00:15:35.111 --> 00:15:36.760
but the only funny thing I said was like,

255
00:15:36.761 --> 00:15:41.590
at one point the manager came up to the stage and he was like, are you okay?

256
00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.950
Like he was checking out. He came on stage and was like, cause it was so crazy.

257
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.650
And there he's like, all right. I was like, yeah. And he was like,

258
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.790
do you want to keep going? I was like, yeah.

259
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.583
<v 4>And.</v>

260
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.690
<v 3>He's like, okay. So he leaves and they're like, yeah, that's right.</v>

261
00:15:55.691 --> 00:15:59.950
Get the F you think he's telling me, get off stage. Right. And I go, I go,

262
00:15:59.951 --> 00:16:04.900
he asked me if you guys wanted me to bring back the other guy and

263
00:16:04.901 --> 00:16:08.050
they go, yeah, like they scream. Yes. And I go, I told him,

264
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.310
you guys want more of me. So here I am for more jokes. And they're like.

265
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.143
<v 4>But they go.</v>

266
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.540
<v 3>So they go so crazy. Yeah. These.</v>

267
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.630
<v 1>Are Canadians too. Yeah. They go people ever.</v>

268
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:24.190
<v 3>But in the very end, the lady who was running the,</v>

269
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.160
one of the private events that night, like she brought her group there.

270
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.800
She was in tears. She was crying and they brought her on stage.

271
00:16:32.801 --> 00:16:35.650
They were like, she wants to say something. And I was like, okay.

272
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.760
Cause my plan was just stay here the entire time, no matter what,

273
00:16:39.761 --> 00:16:44.680
talk about recipes that you want to try and just don't phase them. Right.

274
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.130
She gets up there and she's like, please, I, you know,

275
00:16:48.131 --> 00:16:51.700
I've done fundraisers here. Like I really wanted this to be a good night.

276
00:16:51.701 --> 00:16:55.270
And I see like how, like she's a right way affected by this.

277
00:16:55.630 --> 00:17:00.610
Please give him the respect of like some, just your, your time and like,

278
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.150
just let him talk. And they're like, it's too late for that. it. Like,

279
00:17:04.151 --> 00:17:08.230
they're going crazy. Oh right. And she's, and I see her like, just like,

280
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.380
she's defeated. It's like someone was beating her up. Right. You know?

281
00:17:11.381 --> 00:17:13.210
And I was like, oh my God. I go, you know what?

282
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.480
This is 35 minutes in to,

283
00:17:16.481 --> 00:17:20.620
what's supposed to be like a 50, 55 minute set.

284
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.240
So there's 20 minutes to go. I was like, you know what? Um, I don't,

285
00:17:25.241 --> 00:17:29.650
I want her to have a fun night. She like, she like, it affected me,

286
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.350
but she was so I was like, I'll tell you what,

287
00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:34.240
because you're a nice lady and blah, blah, blah. I go,

288
00:17:34.241 --> 00:17:36.550
I'll bring back the black guy.

289
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:41.110
So I brought the black guy back on stage and they went, it was like I said,

290
00:17:41.111 --> 00:17:45.850
ladies and gentlemen, Chris, hell yeah. He anyway crazy. Wow. I was like,

291
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.030
dude, it's all you. And he was like, oh my God.

292
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.960
Can't believe people actually liked black people here. Like he was so excited.

293
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.270
Does he have any more material? Yeah. Yeah. He had me,

294
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.570
he had his name and I should give him credit too. His name is, uh, tricks.

295
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.050
<v 1>That's his whole name? Yes. Like silly rabbit.</v>

296
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.150
<v 3>Tricks are for kids. Yeah. Wow. But I mean like, you know, he goes,</v>

297
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.060
guys can pull that off. They can pull like that off it's T R I double X,

298
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:09.894
I think so.

299
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.720
<v 1>That's on what episode of your mom's house? 1 72. All.</v>

300
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.630
<v 3>Right. It's um, it's a, it's a, it's a fun episode.</v>

301
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.710
<v 1>So you did for putting that audio up, it takes balls.</v>

302
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.590
<v 3>Man. I was trying to, yeah. There's tricks. He did a good job, man.</v>

303
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:25.160
I totally give him credit. Cool. If there's that site, that site that like,

304
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:29.360
I go to sometimes for that, like, can I handle this, the effect, you know?

305
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.380
And you look at it and you're like necessary. Yeah.

306
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.560
<v 5>Can look at it. We get submissions from.</v>

307
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.860
<v 3>People, send in their stuff all the time. Sometimes I'm like,</v>

308
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.340
that's crazy and something. I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa. I can't handle it.

309
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.920
That's my pucker. I do.

310
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.460
<v 5>Like the, uh, fart stuff. Like some guy said</v>

311
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.520
a girl. Yeah. It was a guy and his nose was wet,

312
00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.310
firmly in this girl's butt crack. And then she saran wrapped his hair.

313
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.460
But I mentioned.

314
00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.600
<v 3>To the parents and she walked around the kitchen and she's like,</v>

315
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.880
turn the sink on. And just farting.

316
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.140
<v 4>And she's party. He's like, she's like, yeah, you like those dirty parts? Huh?</v>

317
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.890
Yeah.

318
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.270
<v 5>I like anything was saran wrap. is funny. Lunch, sack lunch.</v>

319
00:19:11.271 --> 00:19:13.640
There's this guy that has saran wrap diaper on. And he just,

320
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.230
the camera just pans to him.

321
00:19:15.231 --> 00:19:18.920
And he spreads his cheeks and fills it with diarrhea.

322
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.700
<v 4>Wrap is so funny. It's so, but it's good.</v>

323
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.730
<v 5>Just like find me funny. I just it's the sound.</v>

324
00:19:28.731 --> 00:19:29.660
It's the timing.

325
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:32.330
<v 4>It fills up fast.</v>

326
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.000
<v 5>Pans in just to the right.</v>

327
00:19:35.001 --> 00:19:38.570
And then it turns ever so slightly in the spread and the sound.

328
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.950
<v 1>This is something about someone relishing a woman's farts, like hold the gods,</v>

329
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.320
the cheeks. Oh yeah.

330
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.700
<v 4>About it for awhile. And then B people wrote.</v>

331
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.390
<v 3>It, people wrote in that were into it, you know? Cause we were like, tell us.</v>

332
00:19:53.391 --> 00:19:55.040
And then they would tell us, they were like, yeah,

333
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.440
it goes back to like a pretty girl making something dirty, you know?

334
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.310
So it's like, oh my God.

335
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.080
<v 4>I'm so embarrassed of what I did.</v>

336
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.940
<v 3>So they, this guy he wrote in that, he was like my, uh, now his girl,</v>

337
00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:11.810
his fiance, like, you know, knows. And his colon, like whenever she has to fart,

338
00:20:11.811 --> 00:20:13.780
she calls him over and he gets so excited.

339
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.290
<v 4>He loves it loves come.</v>

340
00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.170
<v 1>On. How strange people, people are so strange.</v>

341
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:26.270
The variabilities of what people are attracted to. It's just, it's so bizarre.

342
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.010
Yeah. Well you see like people that are into people that are so beast,

343
00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:34.190
they can't get off the couch. There's guys that are turned on by that feeders.

344
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.070
<v 4>Feeding community. Love that.</v>

345
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.090
<v 3>Watch them. And then there's girls who they have.</v>

346
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.240
That's a whole business for them is like, they set up a camera and they're like,

347
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:49.120
oh, I ate cheese and cookies today. And then you, they just,

348
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.420
you get to watch them, you know, gain weight should have done.

349
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.350
That's their whole thing.

350
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.540
<v 1>I'm at done that. Like it's a great way to make comedies. Dennis.</v>

351
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.740
<v 5>Is my brain to make a living. You should have jokes. Just. Yeah.</v>

352
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.870
<v 1>That'd be awesome. I just, the idea of saran wrap a guy's head here.</v>

353
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:12.090
So great. Larry. So funny. So is this guy crawling around as she does her stuff?

354
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.460
<v 5>It's in the kitchen or follows. He.</v>

355
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.340
<v 1>Needs those like sliders on his knees. It's a really.</v>

356
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.420
<v 4>Good idea. We should suggest this board maybe. And we've played a lot of a.</v>

357
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.990
I'm going to email this guy. Well, I have these.

358
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.140
<v 1>Omni-directional sliders that are work out with, I do abs with them.</v>

359
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.830
You know this slide, you can do it this way. Remember the climbers with them.

360
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.570
I do all kinds of different. Yeah. You can put those on the guy's name.

361
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.240
Just fart and we're all around the house. Hardwood floor.

362
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.630
Have you seen king Ash rippers work? Um, excuse me.

363
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:49.500
<v 4>What is that? There's a lot offered him money and he won't.</v>

364
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.040
Yes. Just because he's such a creative guy. Wait, are you talking.

365
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.670
<v 5>To me? Maybe the great job. Your powers.</v>

366
00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.450
<v 4>Kicking, ripper ripper, Harry and gross.</v>

367
00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.900
The Lord of all farts and gluttony. He makes videos. No of himself.

368
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.360
Tim king asked her, please give me some.

369
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:17.010
That's still moving.

370
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.850
<v 5>There's no real. Oh, go to ribbon. Massive farts.</v>

371
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:34.590
Hold on. Oh, because he has an Opus. What's up with his pants. Yeah, he does.

372
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:45.420
<v 4>It's getting brown in there. 199,000 is how many?</v>

373
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.470
Good standup.

374
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.470
<v 1>Bits online of 199,000. It's not mine.</v>

375
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.333
<v 4>[Inaudible]</v>

376
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:12.870
this is like, no about him. We've studied his work forever.

377
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.440
Looking at brown is good back there.

378
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.470
Obviously, as they're making money, I mean, from this,

379
00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.630
he should be making millions of ads. He's gotta be making money if it's like,

380
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.540
it's got this many, not a ton, but so does he have ads? I like that.

381
00:23:33.541 --> 00:23:37.620
He's just checking everyday ads. No,

382
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.080
he likes to stage the scene with

383
00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.880
it's like he's got marks in his underwear drawer, dude.

384
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.350
<v 3>He's got some that are so brown. That's clearly</v>

385
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.730
here's a Christmas one too.

386
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.590
<v 4>Harry Gross slob is his yeah. He, oh my God.</v>

387
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:19.400
Look at what he videos he has with Honduras is so many.

388
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.990
<v 1>This one is not much sausage gravy, Gluck as heel pizza,</v>

389
00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:25.100
watch you get to watch a meat.

390
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.350
<v 4>Throw up. It's hard to watch.</v>

391
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.410
So live is coming to the surface, his Christmas one

392
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.050
Christmas, special.

393
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.460
<v 3>Special. We, uh, uh,</v>

394
00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:45.790
we found it on his cause his live leak account is he has a lot on live leak

395
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.680
from YouTube.

396
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.450
<v 5>Because YouTube will take him down. So lively. It's just not apparently.</v>

397
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:55.840
Maybe he gets flagged a lot and a.

398
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:59.980
<v 3>Lively lively. It's like, bring it on dude. So his mom sees it. What is you?</v>

399
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.460
What is my son being

400
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:12.970
mothering? Mothering. We we're talking a lot about, um,

401
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.350
crazy mothers. Yeah.

402
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.730
<v 5>Oh over-parenting yeah. This is a divergent.</v>

403
00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.680
He wasn't parenting this.

404
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:25.780
<v 1>Guy B was too much. Maybe this is like rebellion, right?</v>

405
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.570
Hates mommy. Imagine if his mom finds out about this.

406
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.990
<v 5>I think he lives at home still because we've studied the videos.</v>

407
00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:36.910
And it seems as though these are like prior to that

408
00:25:36.911 --> 00:25:39.760
location, there was one that was just a bedroom in a basement.

409
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.160
And I think he actually did live with his folks.

410
00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:47.170
And we've deduced that this might be like a fetish thing because it's glutton

411
00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.530
me and then farts. And he won't answer any of.

412
00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.780
<v 4>Our tweets. We had people.</v>

413
00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:54.550
<v 3>Just bombard him with email.</v>

414
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.890
Cause he put an email in one and we will on our show where like everybody,

415
00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.900
even unlike no.

416
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.750
<v 5>Response, know if you could get to the bottom of this, we'd really appreciate.</v>

417
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.930
<v 1>It because I'm terrified. One day he'll be in here.</v>

418
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.660
And the farting in my ergonomic chairs.

419
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.590
<v 3>The family,</v>

420
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:12.700
the family thing also is because on the Christmas one you can tell it's a family

421
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:16.570
home and there's stockings up. And he farts in every stocking.

422
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:19.960
<v 4>And then he goes, that's what you get.</v>

423
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.190
<v 3>From king ripper for Mary dang ripper.</v>

424
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.020
He's.

425
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.910
<v 1>Probably going to die. He probably has something wrong with his colon.</v>

426
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.620
That's an interesting theory too. And.

427
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.510
<v 3>People have also, um, like brought about the theory that he is,</v>

428
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.230
uh, doing that pushing air in there, you know, using it's cheating.

429
00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.980
Like he's cheating, like filling himself with air and then fighting it.

430
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.460
Cause there's, you know, edits each fart.

431
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.800
<v 1>You assume that he can't fart rapid fire that loud. I mean,</v>

432
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.350
you you'd have to be some sort of a bag of.

433
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.980
<v 4>Wind like a bag, right? Like.</v>

434
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.850
<v 3>Cause sometimes I mean regular fresh, like, oh, I don't know.</v>

435
00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.880
<v 5>Can you tell me your fart smell? Like sounded like last night I thought.</v>

436
00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.380
<v 3>Yesterday, you know,</v>

437
00:27:03.381 --> 00:27:07.100
when you stay away from seafood for awhile and then you reintroduce it,

438
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.480
there's bacteria in like, you know, it's different than shellfish and sushi.

439
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.660
And I, I, I thought when I guess they, when I farted,

440
00:27:14.661 --> 00:27:16.400
it sounded like somebody was throwing up.

441
00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.440
Like the frog sounded like a guy going.

442
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.920
<v 1>You know, I I've only shaved my once in my life. But once I did,</v>

443
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.040
oh my God, my fart sounded so different. Really? Oh, they're.

444
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:31.250
<v 4>All like wet and sloppy. It's a hair, different.</v>

445
00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.950
<v 1>The hair and your literally changes the way you fart, smell or sound rather.</v>

446
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.560
Right. Smell this, smell the same. But they sound different

447
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.540
was like stop slop.

448
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.780
<v 3>Something tells me king Asher, doesn't shave. That's a whole new area.</v>

449
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.730
He can get into monster that guy.

450
00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.630
No, he doesn't have a girlfriend.

451
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:01.123
<v 1>Girlfriend. No, there's no.</v>

452
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.690
He scrapes up his YouTube like add video money.

453
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.970
<v 6>Then, then he gets a and she's.</v>

454
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:13.970
<v 1>Far it's on her. It's like, no, I hate it. You loser.</v>

455
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:21.140
<v 4>My videos of [inaudible].</v>

456
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.170
<v 1>No you don't. I don't have the internet shut up.</v>

457
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.180
What the that's someone's babies from when I was a little baby thinking that

458
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.680
your son, your son could be our son for sure. Could be our son,

459
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:41.150
my very close to like take the throne for new, the new king

460
00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.200
hell to the new king to go toe to toe. I hope.

461
00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.850
<v 4>I hope he takes it from the one day to the next level. Yeah. Maybe it's like,</v>

462
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.620
what is it about farts that are so.

463
00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.460
<v 5>Hilarious? It's the best. It's they're never not funny.</v>

464
00:28:55.461 --> 00:28:58.370
They're never not entertaining. Cause they're so taboo.

465
00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.790
You're never supposed to do them in front of strangers. The smell,

466
00:29:01.791 --> 00:29:04.370
the sound everything's sublime.

467
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.870
<v 3>The people that love them versus don't like it.</v>

468
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:13.400
I think that's all rooted in if your household was okay with farts or not it's

469
00:29:13.401 --> 00:29:14.000
class.

470
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.370
<v 5>And we had none growing up. So that's why we're Euro trash. So we loved farts.</v>

471
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.550
Poopies.

472
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.380
<v 3>Hawks. Was it talked about in your house? Was it?</v>

473
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:25.730
<v 1>No, no, no. My house was lacking in any sense of humor.</v>

474
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.930
Really? Yeah. No one was funny. No one, no one's funny.

475
00:29:29.931 --> 00:29:34.730
No one had any never everyone was like, don't be a loser. Stop being a loser.

476
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.420
Really stopped being a loser dummy. It was always, you're gonna be a loser.

477
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.010
Your grades suck. You're going to be a loose.

478
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.100
<v 7>Let's get, I'm still coughing from the fart sublime parts. Um.</v>

479
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.770
<v 1>I literally almost threw up when he was eating the,</v>

480
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.100
when he was eating dogs and the sausage and the gravy,

481
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.640
like saliva was coming to the surface in my throat. Now you.

482
00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.330
<v 5>Should see the one. Sometimes he farts on what he's going to eat.</v>

483
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.010
He's like five

484
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.730
little Debbie's 12 of them. And then you're like, all right.

485
00:30:11.731 --> 00:30:13.320
And he turns around, he's like Mo fart.

486
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.050
<v 4>On them. And then he eats them.</v>

487
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:23.100
He's got to be eating some of his own. Right? The particles, there's a video.

488
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:27.780
<v 3>Where he gets up bucket of KFC and dips every fried piece in</v>

489
00:30:27.781 --> 00:30:28.920
Mayo and eats it.

490
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.760
<v 4>[Inaudible] Google search that guy.</v>

491
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.040
That's so crazy. That is all.

492
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.700
<v 1>Wrong. In every way I do.</v>

493
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.040
<v 3>Kind of look, there was a time where our listeners thought that I might.</v>

494
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.720
<v 1>Get this away. Him, James literally almost threw up.</v>

495
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.760
<v 3>There's a, there is one. We won't describe anything.</v>

496
00:31:02.761 --> 00:31:04.920
There's nothing gross about this description. But one time,

497
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.590
cause he's the eater. He's like,

498
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.490
I got eight sausage,

499
00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:15.750
egg McMuffins and then he's, he's, he's tallying it.

500
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:19.140
And he's like are 250 calories.

501
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:24.300
And then I got egg and cheese, uh, 300 calories.

502
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.390
Nine of those, you do the math

503
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.640
because he wants you to know how many calories he's eating.

504
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.280
<v 4>But he's not that fat. It's just, no, God.</v>

505
00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:37.170
<v 1>Yeah, just good God on him. It's not like he's,</v>

506
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.950
he doesn't have some sort of Ralphie may thing going on with like remarkably,

507
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.810
sadly, that guy.

508
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:47.790
<v 3>Lives his life. Like absolute every day. And I'm fatter than him. But</v>

509
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:53.250
he definitely does not give a ever. And he's not that out of shape.

510
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.380
<v 1>But you think that's an act. I mean, maybe he's like, yeah.</v>

511
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.100
Some customer service representative for like Toyo tires or something. Yeah.

512
00:31:59.130 --> 00:31:59.250
You know.

513
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.630
<v 5>What, Joe? I might agree.</v>

514
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:05.520
Have I not watched many of his films and gone over the data,

515
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:10.220
the footage for about a year we've we've had like a long time with.

516
00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.050
<v 3>He claims to be in Michigan. By the way he claims to be a Michigan guy.</v>

517
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.390
How long has he been doing this? A few years.

518
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:20.010
<v 1>So do you think he tentatively dipped him his toes into the pool of</v>

519
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:25.170
asphalt videos? Or did he just decide he's the king? He calls himself.

520
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.330
<v 4>Yeah. From the jump though. I mean,</v>

521
00:32:27.331 --> 00:32:30.810
did you go back to the library earlier videos where he's.

522
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:33.030
<v 3>Like, I challenge anybody to fart. Like I can't like.</v>

523
00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.770
<v 4>He's really, he owns it. You know.</v>

524
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:36.870
<v 5>He farts on his hairs.</v>

525
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.610
<v 4>On all his haters shows his face too. He didn't.</v>

526
00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.790
<v 1>That guy gets recognized. Yes.</v>

527
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.520
Do you think that he like one day he's at golden corral and.

528
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.320
<v 4>Then like, that's you you're the king getting shrimp?</v>

529
00:32:50.321 --> 00:32:54.250
Nibblers I, I think I'm going to go out on a limb here.

530
00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.570
<v 3>I'm going to go out on the lemon thing and say that.</v>

531
00:32:58.571 --> 00:33:00.700
I don't know if he's all mentally. Well, I think.

532
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.510
<v 4>I would take it a big leap. I.</v>

533
00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.870
<v 3>Think if you do a pro you like your king and he's like, oh, like.</v>

534
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:16.300
<v 1>Pardon my face, please, sir, your grace. I would like to go at.</v>

535
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:21.160
<v 3>Him serious and be like, dude, I can fart bigger than you any day like that,</v>

536
00:33:21.161 --> 00:33:25.870
you know? And have them be like, oh yeah, I'm the king dude name a spot. Well,

537
00:33:25.871 --> 00:33:26.020
what.

538
00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.750
<v 1>If you can only fight on his own? What if like if you challenge him,</v>

539
00:33:28.751 --> 00:33:33.070
he just locks up. It's interesting. Yeah. Maybe get stage fright.

540
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.360
Wow. That's why he does it all alone in his kitchen on a stage somewhere.

541
00:33:37.361 --> 00:33:39.520
And he doesn't respond to the emails. Let me ask you this.

542
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:42.910
If that guy put on a show somewhere, like he had a small club,

543
00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:47.080
like he's in Chicago, like some hundred 50 Cedars. Yeah.

544
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.940
Do you think he could fill a place?

545
00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.960
You think you'd get a hundred people in there? I would endorse that.

546
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:56.440
I can make some money. If he could fart like that all the time.

547
00:33:56.441 --> 00:33:57.274
He can make some money.

548
00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.260
<v 5>I mean, that's why I'd like him to contact us.</v>

549
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.740
We can have him open for your mom's house podcast.

550
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.070
<v 4>Live. Yeah. No, you couldn't eat on your microphone.</v>

551
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.650
<v 1>Sorry. No. And you try to clean it up and do your show.</v>

552
00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:16.990
Sorry to throw.

553
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:21.430
<v 4>Up. I'm starting to throw. Everybody would get so. Oh,</v>

554
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.010
we thought it was going to be cool. It's got everywhere.
