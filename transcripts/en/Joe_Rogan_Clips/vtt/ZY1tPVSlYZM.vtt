00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.640
<v 0>Selling out theaters. He's I, his pre sold sale sold.</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.280
<v 1>Out everything, selling out everything. Huh? When you moving into.</v>

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.120
<v 2>Arenas selling, ah, Hey, speaking of arenas, how was Toronto.</v>

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.240
<v 1>Insane? What is it like in.</v>

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.320
<v 0>The, when you're doing 10,000.</v>

6
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.400
<v 1>People, 10,600 people with the Scotia bank arena, it was the air Canada center.</v>

7
00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:20.440
The UFC's back there in December. I'm back.

8
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.950
<v 2>Crazy. You're gonna be like, oh,</v>

9
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:24.950
one time I was here alone talking it's its ridiculous.

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.670
And then you see it like filled for events like that.

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.550
I mean that's where the Raptors play it.

12
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.510
<v 1>It's it's so ridiculous. It doesn't seem real,</v>

13
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.390
but I gotta say the show felt like as intimate as, uh,

14
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.780
a set at the store, really? I'm not bullshitting. Yeah. Yeah. Welcome the set.

15
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:47.540
Yeah. It was, it was nuts for real. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was easy peasy.

16
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:51.820
It was fun. I mean it was literally like any other set. I was,

17
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.580
I was nervous that I wasn't nervous. Yeah. I,

18
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.260
I was nervous that I was con I mean, I did a lot of sets leading up to it.

19
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.460
Like when, um, I did, I did you,

20
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.170
I constantly do sets, but I did like, I did four sets Thursday night.

21
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.090
I did really? Yeah. I did the ice house Wednesday.

22
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:14.170
So I did an hour plus the ice house. I did three sets on um,

23
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.530
on, uh, Tuesday night. Yeah.

24
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.530
I mean that's that's I think that's the key is you just gotta do.

25
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.280
You gotta be sharp for it. Yeah.

26
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:27.000
You have to just do so many that you're you're just, just like working out.

27
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.800
You can't have any doubt. You gotta be just in shape. I just sent you a video.

28
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.880
This is, this is shows you how ridiculous the.

29
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.240
<v 2>Crowd looked. But when you're, um,</v>

30
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.800
but you you're also getting used to arenas cause you've done a few now.

31
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.840
It's weird. This.

32
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.600
<v 0>Are fourth.</v>

33
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.110
<v 1>Arena. Fourth. Yeah. Maybe fifth. I did. I did, um, Columbus, Vancouver.</v>

34
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.910
I did Columbus. I did Kansas city. Kansas city was weird. Cause it was outside.

35
00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:49.190
That.

36
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.070
<v 2>Was weird. That's like an amphitheater, right? Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.430
<v 1>It's crazy. Yeah. I saw, I saw, but this was the biggest one.</v>

38
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.670
This one was bananas. Yeah.

39
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.550
<v 0>Wild man. Yeah. I'm stressing 12,</v>

40
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.430
Tom and I are doing tours at the exact same time next year. And uh,

41
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:06.180
I'm stressing doing theaters 12, 1200 in the theater going like, it.

42
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:06.460
How do.

43
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.780
<v 1>You like it gets normal man. After a while scooter,</v>

44
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.340
scooter head just like a couple of seconds.

45
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.420
And you can see it when I get on stage, like, like,

46
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.900
like watch when they turn the lights on. This is what's really strange

47
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.380
when you get to look out over the entire audio.

48
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.610
<v 2>Oh my God. ridiculous. That's.</v>

49
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.530
<v 1>Crazy's that's madness. That.</v>

50
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.210
<v 2>Is that's wild, man.</v>

51
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.490
<v 1>Dude, that, and there's a upper deck that</v>

52
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.650
it doesn't seem real and it just happened.

53
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.010
<v 2>And you, you did this and the same night, uh, bird did the forum 20.</v>

54
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.400
<v 1>Yeah. The forums not 20,000 is 9,000. The Western forum.</v>

55
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.400
<v 2>The great Western forum. I don't know what it is.</v>

56
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.520
<v 0>The thing online said it was 20,000.</v>

57
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.560
<v 1>People. I, I think they're wrong. Cuz Dean Del rice said it was 9,000. Okay.</v>

58
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.480
I think they just made a mistake, but it's huge either way. It's it's.

59
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.160
<v 0>Huge. So I was thinking last night, I know you.</v>

60
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.840
I know that you're not like this. I, I know you're a little bit like this,

61
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.480
but to compare different times of comedy. Right. Um,

62
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.400
and compare people and I know you don't like comparing people,

63
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.240
but has there ever been a time in comedy where this many acts were selling

64
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.881
arenas,

65
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:18.240
this many acts were selling theaters and this many acts were selling out clubs.

66
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.030
<v 1>I don't think so. Well, well BES sold out Madison square garden,</v>

67
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.590
which is way bigger than that. Madison square garden I think is 18,000.

68
00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:28.790
That's true. How about this? Sebastian is ready to sell four.

69
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.070
He's already sold out three. Yeah.

70
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.830
He's they opened up a fourth show at Madison square garden. Yeah.

71
00:03:33.831 --> 00:03:38.710
Just stop and think about that. That's almost 80,000 people. That's.

72
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.820
<v 2>Crazy. Yeah. Yeah. That's like a NFL game stadium.</v>

73
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.460
<v 0>Has there ever been been at this time? Like just look at theater comics.</v>

74
00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:50.380
Just legit selling like multiple theater shows.

75
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.980
Eliza Delea you can name any of you. Right?

76
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.980
My like you go down the list a Z there's so many comics selling theaters,

77
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:01.050
theaters. I don't think there's ever been a time.

78
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.650
<v 1>No, there's never been a time like this. Never.</v>

79
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.090
There's never been a time when this many comics are selling out multiple

80
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.210
thousand seat places. And then there's the big, first of all, this Kevin Hart,

81
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:13.490
who's the biggest of the big he sells out 50,000.

82
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.890
<v 0>Cat Williams is actually a lot bigger than he is cat Williams. Oh yeah.</v>

83
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.120
I watched it on the breakfast club. &lt;laugh&gt; I thought you were drunk.

84
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.720
I'm joking. I'm joking. I was gonna pee test.

85
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.720
You didn't he got Williams just slamming. I don't pay attention to that. Oh,

86
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.000
it was pretty fun. I like cat. I like.

87
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.360
<v 1>Kevin too. I like cat too, but he's he's eccentric at best.</v>

88
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.680
<v 2>Um, no, Kevin is the biggest monster.</v>

89
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.240
<v 1>Kevins. The biggest he's the biggest monster. So he's like 50.</v>

90
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.560
He can sell 50,000. He sold 50,000 Philadelphia when he did a special, yeah.

91
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.030
There's only one of him,

92
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.030
but you know what was real close to him that people forget about is Larry the

93
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:46.150
cable guy. Cause Larry,

94
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:49.950
the cable guy was selling out football stadiums cuz Josh Wolf was opening for

95
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:52.870
him. And Josh Wolf took a picture and showed it to me and he goes, dude,

96
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:56.710
this was me on stage opening up for Larry, the cable guy. And you're like, yeah,

97
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.030
yeah. But people don't talk. Think about first of all, Larry,

98
00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:00.670
the cable guy is like the most humble.

99
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.180
<v 2>Plus he's doing that in like the Heartland. So people will just dismiss it.</v>

100
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.860
Cause it's not like an LA show or.

101
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.180
<v 1>New York show. Right. So those two guys, I think,</v>

102
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.340
I think Kevin Hart is Nuer UNO. He's number one. Yeah.

103
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.460
And then there's Chappelle could basically do anything.

104
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.860
He sells out master chap, 50 sells.

105
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.700
<v 0>He sold out the, the forum. Not the for.</v>

106
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.730
<v 1>Hollywood bowl. Hollywood bowl. Yeah. Yeah. That's huge. What is that? 20,000?</v>

107
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.843
I don't know's.

108
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.410
<v 2>Like 20,000. He has amphitheater offers like left and right.</v>

109
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.530
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then they'll, you know who they'll probably be like,

110
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.890
yeah, you do a show and it's like, you'll get like 700,000. He'll be like,

111
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.770
I'm gonna do the belly room.

112
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.490
And then he just goes and does that cause he likes it.

113
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.530
He likes the intimate shows. Well, he's also.

114
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.640
<v 1>I hate to use a term like this, but he's a legitimate artist. Yeah.</v>

115
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.640
Like he's just trying to do better work.

116
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.240
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; do better comedy and always evolve. It.

117
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.200
He's one of the rare guys that could do a special and then the next week will

118
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:57.320
have a new hour. Yeah. And somehow just comes outta. I know. I mean, he's just,

119
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.840
it's supremely dedicated, you know? Yeah. So there's him.

120
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.000
There's Chris rock can still sell out pretty big places. If Louie came back,

121
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.120
I think he could sell out giant places. Giant bur sells out everywhere.

122
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.560
He wants to Burker could sell out. Um, he sold out Boston garden,

123
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:18.550
which is like 18,000 Wells Fargo center in Philly.

124
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.950
How big is that? 15,000. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah.

125
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:23.550
He could sell out all those places. It's.

126
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.990
<v 0>Really hard to put in perspective. And I think you guys can understand this,</v>

127
00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:30.390
but I mean you were selling out clubs. What? Like six,

128
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.470
17 years ago. Were you just doing clubs?

129
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.110
<v 1>Yeah. For sure. But when you.</v>

130
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.870
<v 0>Were, when you were selling out yeah.</v>

131
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.420
&lt;affirmative&gt; when you were selling out just clubs,

132
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.340
that's an achievement in this business.

133
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.260
I mean to sell out weekends and ad shows, right. Is a legit achievement.

134
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.020
Definitely. So undermined,

135
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.180
when you go in and you San Jose or you do whatever and you sell out everything

136
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:52.820
and then go, oh my God, like, holy.

137
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.380
Like there's there's so it's the possibilities are endless.

138
00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.370
<v 1>Yeah. Well I think it's the internet. It's, that's what it is. It's people.</v>

139
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.770
And then there there's like this network of comics now that everybody

140
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.570
knows about, you know, if you know about bill, you know about Joey Diaz,

141
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:11.330
you know about you, you know about you, it's like,

142
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:15.370
there's this thing going on now where everyone's sort of connected. Yeah.

143
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.680
That's never existed before. And then a, a lot of these people,

144
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.840
not Sebastian he's one of the rare ones,

145
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:23.720
a doesn't but most of these people have podcasts. Kevin Hart doesn't obviously,

146
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.680
but Kevin Hart has major movies. Sebastian actually does one.

147
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.200
<v 0>He does a podcast. Pete co with Pete co. Yeah. I didn't even know, but I,</v>

148
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.400
I don't think they, I don't think he can get to it like weekly,

149
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.440
but they definitely put it SiriusXM. I think he'd do it specifically for.

150
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.400
<v 1>Sirius X. Just does it whenever he can get to it. I.</v>

151
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.870
<v 0>Yeah, I think it's, you've probably been, you've been in this longest of,</v>

152
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.930
of the three of us.

153
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.710
But have you ever known a time in comedy when comics were more friendly? No.

154
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:50.950
Like it seems like everyone's on the same team. Yeah.

155
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.790
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. This is a completely different thing.</v>

156
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:53.830
And I've talked about this before.

157
00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:58.230
It's because I really believe it's because the internet and also because there's

158
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.780
no, uh, things were fighting for anymore.

159
00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:05.180
Like tonight show spots or stupid like that or sitcom auditions.

160
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.380
But in the past it was like there was three channels and there was the tonight

161
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:12.820
show and the Letterman show and everybody wanted to host the tonight show,

162
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.180
but Jay Leno was hosting it forever or Johnny Carson before him. Right.

163
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:19.420
And there was this competition between comics where they were just cut through

164
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.650
out. And there's not that anymore now instead like radio shows,

165
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:29.130
right? Radio shows always on the other radio shows always. They always,

166
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.610
the other morning shows in town. They on 'em. It was all on everybody. them.

167
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:36.810
Like Howard stern was notorious for it. Yeah. We do the.

168
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.930
<v 0>Opposite. They'd start wars for ratings. Yeah.</v>

169
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.640
<v 1>But we do the opposite. It, we all have successful podcasts,</v>

170
00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:46.680
but we all have each other on our podcast. We're all super friendly about it.

171
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.600
We all promote each other's specials. We all, we all hang out together.

172
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.920
Like there there's a comradery amongst comedians. Now it used to be like,

173
00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:58.320
there might be some camaraderie amongst a couple, but it would always go bad,

174
00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.640
you know? And then there,

175
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:04.520
there was never like bunch of real headliners hanging out together like they are

176
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.150
now.

177
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.983
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

178
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.160
I mean even the simplest things like Delia does something funny and I'll just

179
00:09:10.161 --> 00:09:13.080
put it, I'll talk about it on my open tabs and get like half a million views.

180
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.030
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you go like,

181
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.190
I mean Delias might be one of my favorite people to watch these days.

182
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.870
Cause I just watch his Instagram and go, what's he doing today? He's ridiculous.

183
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.430
I can totally talk about it on my open tabs and just share it with everyone.

184
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.830
Yeah. And just go, oh great. Brand Shaw. Like dude, it's been funny.

185
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.670
Did you.
