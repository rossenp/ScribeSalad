00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.210
<v 1>You know, think about this. Imagine this scenario, imagine that the,</v>

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:10.980
that the lethality rate on this virus was like 10%. Right? Right.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.791
W like,

5
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:15.390
what do you have to do to convince those grocery store workers to come to work

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.480
at that point? No, one's coming to work. No, one's driving the trucks. No,

7
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:19.500
one's going to deliver anything.

8
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.060
And then what preppers would say is we're 72 hours to anarchy or 72 hours to

9
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:28.950
animal, right. It's like, once you shut down those kinds of supply lines, right.

10
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:33.660
Our entire mentality starts to shift into a different mode and it doesn't take

11
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:34.710
long before you think I'm going to,

12
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.930
I'm going to take something from my neighbor at this point. I'm hungry.

13
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.860
My family's hungry.

14
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.350
<v 2>Sure. Yeah. I mean, it's, it gets real scary or cooperate with your neighbor,</v>

15
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:47.150
hopefully. Yeah. You know? Um, I, uh, I hunt, so I have a lot of meat.

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.380
And so, um, one of the things that happened during the pandemic, when it hit, I,

17
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.510
I had a lot of people come over and I gave the meat. Cause I have, uh,

18
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.990
three commercial freezers here at the studio. I think, you know,

19
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.230
if you shoot an elk, Elk's 400 pounds of meat, a lot of meat.

20
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.680
It's the great thing. As long as the power stays on and I have electricity,

21
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.010
I have frozen meat, so I can, I can give a lot of it out.

22
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.090
So you got a backup generator. I do. I'm not a prepper, you know,

23
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.440
but I'm prepared in some ways.

24
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.090
And then when all this came down,

25
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:24.440
basically all I did is I stockpiled on a lot of dried stuff like rice pasta,

26
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.840
things that, you know, you could cook easily with it.

27
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.350
<v 1>That's the thing is people get fixated on prepping as this kind of, you know,</v>

28
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.390
I built a multimillion dollar bunker or whatever,

29
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.270
whatever spectacular stories that people hear, which, you know,

30
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.190
I'm happy to happy to verify if you want to get into those. But, um, you know,

31
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.270
Mo like prepping on a, on a practical level, like everyday prepping is just,

32
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.850
it's just common sense. You know, just having, you know.

33
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.310
<v 2>Having enough food to last a few days and.</v>

34
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.130
<v 1>Thinking through, you know, what, what might happen, you know,</v>

35
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.600
in a blackout or the, you know,

36
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:56.910
the taps not working or whatever these things do happen.

37
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.220
<v 2>Yeah. They do happen. And,</v>

38
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.760
but I wanted to get into the psychology of prepping prepping,

39
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:06.510
because it seems to be conflated with, uh,

40
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.790
conspiracy theorists in some way,

41
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.650
like a preppers or it's the tinfoil hat brigade. It's like those,

42
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.450
those type of folks, folks who think 5g is causing COVID, you know what I mean?

43
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.660
Like there's, for whatever reason prepping,

44
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.790
which should be just a prudence, you know, common sense, preparing, you know,

45
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.480
having something that can purify your water, if everything goes weird. Yeah.

46
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.580
<v 1>You know, camping every once in a while,</v>

47
00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:36.270
just to get a sense of what it's like to be outdoors and pop your tent and pull

48
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:37.970
your water out of a river. And, you know,

49
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:39.600
it's great to have those practical skills.

50
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.890
<v 2>Yeah. It's camping is fun. As long as you know, it's not permanent.</v>

51
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.800
Isn't that weird. So.

52
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.290
<v 1>I mean, and this is the thing about disaster, right? Is that if, uh,</v>

53
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.640
if it has an end point, it's something that we can cope with. Right. You know,

54
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.900
so, so take nuclear war, for example, right. Like, let's say,

55
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.560
let's say we get a text message on our phone member in Hawaii in 2018.

56
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:05.350
Everyone got that message that the ballistic missile was incoming. Right.

57
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.130
So imagine we get that message right now. And you're like, well, Brad, and we,

58
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.060
we actually have a bunker underneath this, the studio. Right.

59
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.400
So you go into the bunker in, but we know after LA is nuked, right.

60
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.380
And it's gone that if we stay in this bunker for 14 days,

61
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.220
the radiation levels are going to be a fraction of what they were when that new

62
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.600
kit. Right. So, so you have an end point there. We have to make it to day 14.

63
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.930
And that's why people were able to psychologically cope with it. Whereas,

64
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:37.270
you know, the situation we're in right now, like what do we have,

65
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.470
when is the end point? Like, that's why people are cracking. Cause they,

66
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:41.710
they can't see the end of it.

67
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.180
<v 2>Right? Well, they're cracking for a bunch of reasons. First of all,</v>

68
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:49.080
they're cracking because the economic stability is non-existent, it's gone.

69
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.110
50% of all restaurants are dead. You know, I mean,

70
00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:57.090
how many retail shops are dead? It's, it's terrible. Raw, uh, uh, Yelp had some,

71
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.230
uh, statistic the other day that I was reading online about all the different

72
00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:02.610
businesses that have been impacted.

73
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:04.530
We don't even know what's happening with comedy clubs.

74
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.680
It's just guesswork right now. But I think in Los Angeles,

75
00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:10.470
a lot of them are probably going to wind up going under or across the country.

76
00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:14.550
A lot of them are going to wind up going under restaurants. Um, I had, uh,

77
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.780
uh, the owners of Felix and, uh, the head chef Evan and the owner,

78
00:04:18.781 --> 00:04:20.700
Janet on the podcast recently.

79
00:04:20.701 --> 00:04:25.080
And they were explaining how the Felix is a really great restaurant in Venice

80
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.060
that almost every restaurant operates with a very small amount of profit,

81
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.160
you know, their profit margin. What did she say? Like 15%, 14%,

82
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:35.994
something like that.

83
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.080
So imagine all of a sudden that's cut to zero for several months.

84
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.890
And then you're asked to occupy 50% of the restaurant,

85
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.100
which is obviously going to diminish your profits radically as well. It's like,

86
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:53.520
it's just a survival game and there's no end in sight. Right?

87
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:58.260
So here we are in July, no one anticipated this in March. We thought,

88
00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.790
you know, by the time June rolls around,

89
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:02.640
everything's going to be up and running. No, here we are July,

90
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.720
everything's locked down again. And there's even talk of another,

91
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:09.870
stay at home order in Los Angeles, which is even scarier. Let's.

92
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.420
<v 1>Get back to your conspiracy theories. Okay.</v>

93
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.710
If someone told you that we would be in the situation a year ago,

94
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.610
would you believe them? Sure. You would've? I would have. Yeah.

95
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.560
Cause the pandemic seemed like a realistic, well, because.

96
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.550
<v 2>I've been to the center for disease control, right. I, um, went to Galveston,</v>

97
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:29.670
Texas for the center of disease control for a show that I did with my friend

98
00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:31.710
Duncan and Duncan Trussell.

99
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:34.500
And I went down there and we talked to these doctors that work with these

100
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:38.130
viruses and they scare the out of us. We, we went down there to,

101
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.010
for a television show that we were doing for Saifai.

102
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.020
And it was basically on the idea of weaponized viruses that the basic premise

103
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:50.010
of the show was it would, if someone engineered a virus and released it on, uh,

104
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.850
on, you know, on the country, like a weaponized virus and they said,

105
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:56.640
that's not what we have to worry about. We have to worry about as nature.

106
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.920
That's what we have to worry about.

107
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.870
It turns out both because this virus most likely had been

108
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:05.390
leaked from a lab, what we're dealing with with COVID 19,

109
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.640
according to my friend, Bret Weinstein,

110
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:11.480
who is a biologist and he detailed on a podcast that I did with him,

111
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.570
all of the different points of, uh,

112
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.580
of evidence that lead to what he believes is a very likely

113
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:22.740
scenario that it was released from accidentally released from, uh,

114
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.640
a lab and not actually from a wet market that the wet markets,

115
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:28.740
the coverup it's like the disease is too advanced. It,

116
00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:33.470
it has too many hallmarks and indicators of a virus that had been tampered with,

117
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:35.420
for study for, uh, for,

118
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.500
for studying the lab and for the examinations and all of the different tests

119
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:43.850
that they would run. And, uh, so you got both those things, right? You have,

120
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.500
you have, um, the possibility of something just morphing in nature,

121
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.200
like many other pandemics that have happened in the past.

122
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.850
And then what we have now, which is this weird virus, it doesn't make any sense.

123
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.200
And we were talking about all the different,

124
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.280
different symptoms that people get from it, neurological problems,

125
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:04.460
blood clotting. I was reading this article where they were saying that, uh,

126
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:08.090
the people that have died from, uh, COVID when they've done autopsies on them,

127
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:12.380
they found blood clots in every major organ. And they they're like,

128
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:14.570
this is astonishing. Like this is so weird.

129
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.640
<v 1>Yeah. It does seem very unrelatable liver.</v>

130
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.140
<v 2>Kidney, but just blood clots everywhere. It's like people are hemorrhaging.</v>

131
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:25.850
It's, it's very strange. It's a strange virus. And the,

132
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.780
the transmissibility, is that a word? The, uh,

133
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.910
the ease of transmission is terrifying. It's so it's so contagious.

134
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:37.250
It's a ridiculously contagious virus.

135
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:41.240
So once we went to that center for disease control, I started getting scared.

136
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.290
I saw the 2015 bill gates, Ted talk on, uh,

137
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.550
pandemics and about the possibility of a pandemic. And I got scared of it too.

138
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.880
So I would've thought it's possible. Yeah.

139
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.510
I would never would've thought it's impossible. So.

140
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.810
<v 1>Here's the thing, regardless of, of where this virus came from,</v>

141
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.870
you have to imagine that, uh,

142
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.050
there are governments and individuals, uh,

143
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.900
who are now keyed into how effective this visit.

144
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.380
This virus was at crippling crippling, uh, capitalist economies,

145
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.540
because it's the thing, the thing is we created COVID pathways, right?

146
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.430
I mean, it's international flights,

147
00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:21.940
it's international trade it's people moving around. It's it's, you know,

148
00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:26.920
the neoliberal global capitalist system that we built over the past 30

149
00:08:26.921 --> 00:08:28.870
years that created the pathways that, that,

150
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.880
that took the virus everywhere at once. Right.

151
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.160
So if this were to be a test run, um,

152
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.470
it's now proven to be extremely effective.

153
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.680
And so you have to imagine that governments around the world probably including

154
00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:44.830
the United States are thinking, well, what else, you know, how could we,

155
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.850
how could we weaponize this potentially? And this is the thing.

156
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.160
<v 2>Well, I don't.</v>

157
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.310
<v 1>I don't, I don't know either, but the thing is we, you know, the threats,</v>

158
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.980
existential threats that we face now have been multiplied

159
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:03.330
exponentially right. In the past, in the past, you know, post-World war two,

160
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.860
right. We had, I mean, this is the first sort of global catastrophe, right.

161
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.630
You know, world, world wars. Right.

162
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.880
But then once we develop nuclear weapons and we're,

163
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.920
we're just past the 75th anniversary of the Trinity test now, uh, you know,

164
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:20.700
once we create that ability to destroy ourselves and potentially the entire

165
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:25.200
world we have to live with with the possibility of that happening right now,

166
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:29.100
stack on top of that artificial intelligence, climate change, you know,

167
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:31.130
synthetic biotech, uh, all,

168
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.890
all of these threats that we face are something that we have to kind of hold in

169
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:38.460
our heads all the time. And I think it's cracking us mentally to like,

170
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:42.120
think about these possibilities. So, um, yeah. I mean,

171
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.310
some of the preppers are conspiracy theorists, right. And they're,

172
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.520
they're spinning some really outlandish scenarios. Um,

173
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.210
but a lot of them are just trying to work through these things. Right.

174
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.860
And rather than get caught in this kind of perpetual future tense, like,

175
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.950
you know, uh, thinking about something terrible happening,

176
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.320
they're trying to take action now in the present.

177
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.560
And that gives them some sense of, of, of peace, right?

178
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.480
Like it gives them a sense of like,

179
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.370
it gives them some solid footing in the present.

180
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.720
And a lot of the preppers I talked to were, um, uh,

181
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.770
are not actually very anxious or paranoid at all. Right.

182
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:21.330
Because they have a plan. It's those of us who don't have a plan that are,

183
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.560
that are anxious.

184
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.290
<v 2>Well, you've talked to them post, post PO. Yeah. Yeah. Um,</v>

185
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.790
did they feel vindicated?

186
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.360
<v 1>Uh, no, not really. No. What,</v>

187
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.170
what most of them have told me is that this was a mid-level crisis. Well.

188
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.020
<v 2>They're right about that. Right. I mean, if Yellowstone blows,</v>

189
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:41.060
this is going to look like a cakewalk. Yeah. Thanks.

190
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:45.290
If we get hit with an asteroid, I mean, it's a wrap for humanity. Yeah.

191
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.640
If there's a solar flare that takes out the power grid, we've got real problems.

192
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.130
This is minor in comparison. When you look at the,

193
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.350
the actual fatality rate for healthy people, it's very,

194
00:10:57.351 --> 00:11:01.760
very low, you know, it's less than 1%,

195
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:06.680
much less than half of 1% for, for most healthy people.

196
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.110
So when you look at what,

197
00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:12.230
what could happen if Yellowstone blows that's a continent killer.

198
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.630
<v 1>Oh yeah. I mean, I mean, we're talking about volcanic,</v>

199
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.590
volcanic Ash clouding the sky and it can get winter. Yeah. Killing,

200
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.520
killing crops all over the United States all over the world. Yeah. I mean.

201
00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.480
<v 2>Being, you got to have a jet and go to New Zealand, like instantly,</v>

202
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.350
it's like, you don't even know if that New Zealand.

203
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.370
<v 1>Is in a volcanic zone. I mean, this, like, this is one of the great, uh,</v>

204
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.830
red herrings of our time that you know,

205
00:11:36.831 --> 00:11:40.100
that all of these wealthy people are going to fly to New Zealand and find safety

206
00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:43.340
there. I mean, I also find it totally ironic that a lot of them are sort of,

207
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:43.910
you know,

208
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.150
libertarian free market capitalists that are quite happy to make money off this

209
00:11:47.151 --> 00:11:48.620
system. But when goes wrong,

210
00:11:48.621 --> 00:11:51.380
they want a really strong government to clamp down and take care of it,

211
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.100
you know.

212
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.790
<v 2>Is that what they want?</v>

213
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.320
I think just want a remote place to escape with a small amount of people and a

214
00:11:56.321 --> 00:12:00.610
lot of, uh, wildlife resources and real natural beauty.
