00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.060
It was back in the day when you can get away with something like that, you know,

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.043
like.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.930
<v 1>Dark. How about the journalist who.</v>

5
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.330
<v 2>Infiltrated the Vatican? You remember that? Wow.</v>

6
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.040
<v 1>And nobody needs to infrared. The Vatican is what infiltrates.</v>

7
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.950
<v 2>There's a French journalist who is games, health,</v>

8
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.080
who went in to basically interview the priest. And the Vatican said,

9
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:27.680
I'm doing an account of the Vatican. Well, you know, he,

10
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:32.060
he spent a while there I a while years. And,

11
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.560
and he came out and basically said in this book, um, he said,

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.650
there's, there are a lot of gay priests there.

13
00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:42.770
And there are a lot of pedophiles and both are protecting each other because

14
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.320
they don't want each other to get exposed. So you're saying, buddy,

15
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:47.930
you're telling me that boys. And I'm going to help you with you. guys.

16
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.520
And if this whole, and it came out in the book, it's a real, yeah. It's I mean,

17
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:53.390
it's probably interviews.

18
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.970
<v 1>Well, if you know the history of the Roman Catholic church, you know,</v>

19
00:00:55.971 --> 00:00:59.510
constantly and a mainstream history, Constantine,

20
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.260
he D he was a pagan, which is, can be considered Luciferian, frankly. Yeah.

21
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.510
Vatican.

22
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.740
<v 0>Sexual that against gay overlords as sensational new book</v>

23
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:12.710
minds, the Catholic church, sexual secrets.

24
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.760
He's gay that Frank Frank will right-wing homophobes exploited.

25
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.850
Frank Bruni's gay. Yeah. Well, for a gay guy,

26
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:23.060
it's gotta be a bittersweet thing to know that the gay wizards control

27
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.350
everything to do with the Catholic church and even dress like gateway.

28
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.520
<v 1>Well, when you look at, when you look at the history of the Vatican,</v>

29
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:32.390
when you look at the history,

30
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.740
Constantine decided to convert to Christianity because the people were leaving.

31
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:39.950
The people were like, that. So this is mainstream history constantly.

32
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.220
And God's okay. I'm no longer pagan slash Luciferian.

33
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.180
I'm no longer inching Babylonian where we like Christ too.

34
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.600
We're going to do Christ. We're going to do what we got. We got our own, we got,

35
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:53.270
this is mainstream. We're going to start the Roman Catholic church.

36
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.740
We're going to have a Pope. He talks to Jesus.

37
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.510
That's where we're going to have Cardinals.

38
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.120
They'd talk to Jesus like once a week. And then we have the bishops,

39
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.410
they talked to Jesus like once a month.

40
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.010
And then the priest every now and then all of a sudden they created rock stars,

41
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.880
dudes with power. The Pope has power. He talks to dudes every day, Cardinals,

42
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:11.630
bishops priests. Right? So come on back. We got, we got Jesus for you.

43
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.900
They made Jesus into telling us things. We already know. No, no,

44
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.160
but what I'm saying is they were never into Jesus. It was never about Jesus.

45
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.190
We know that. Yeah. Yeah. So when you look at the Vatican, you're like, man,

46
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:23.120
the Constantine.

47
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.340
<v 0>Didn't convert to Christianity.</v>

48
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.420
<v 1>Well, maybe he did. Maybe he didn't, but that was always like a debate about it.</v>

49
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.990
But that was always a debate. Right? So when you look at the Vatican,

50
00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:37.580
they have a lot of Luciferian. And look at, look at the resurrection,

51
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.630
look at the sculpture of the resurrection, pull that up the sculpture.

52
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.800
And you tell me if that's Jesus look up, this isn't the Vatican,

53
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.770
the notion of the sculpture, any of you ever does not look like Jesus.

54
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.710
Have you ever been to the Vatican? I've seen a lot of videos on it. Go.

55
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.780
<v 0>You should say, it's amazing just to see it. It's pretty.</v>

56
00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.950
<v 1>[Inaudible] lot of Christ in the eating.</v>

57
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.400
This is their main church that does not,

58
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.550
that's supposed to be Jesus right there. There's got,

59
00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:09.640
this is suppose it looks like a Slayer album cover that looks like Halloween

60
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.630
artists, RET rendering the kilowatts Slayer right there.

61
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.820
So they're saying pull up the, uh, this is,

62
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.750
this is supposed to represent the resurrection of Jesus.

63
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.190
How come you couldn't show the park?

64
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.150
How come you didn't show the part where he's like in front of a meadow and he

65
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.110
resurrect and there's children running around.

66
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.520
<v 0>This is an artist. It's not like the Mona Lisa represents all women.</v>

67
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.300
This is the guy's different. This is in the Vatican church,

68
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.440
the main church police. Can I just see what that looks like? Come on, man.

69
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.000
It's beautiful. Pull up some artists. [inaudible] Jamie. Jamie, Jamie.

70
00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:45.810
Same picture. The same big chose. Hell. Just go back to the same picture. Oh.

71
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.420
<v 1>Okay. They chose the, the part where he's rising out of hell.</v>

72
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.000
You should have chose the part where he's in the sky.

73
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.730
<v 0>But is Eddie, is that what it's supposed to represent?</v>

74
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.420
The resurrected from the hell he's coming out of the ground.

75
00:03:57.421 --> 00:04:01.870
It looks like roots there's but those things in the bottom aren't faces. Right?

76
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.290
Are they? I don't even want to ask.

77
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.490
It looks like to me, it's possible.

78
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.520
<v 2>The artists felt the same way he did. And he was like, why don't.</v>

79
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.640
<v 1>You use the part where he resurrected and he's unlike over a meadow.</v>

80
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.830
<v 2>Or something to the artist. I'm a Christian, a believer.</v>

81
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.890
<v 1>On the second. None anymore comment ever online.</v>

82
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.930
<v 0>Is that the ground? What is that supposed.</v>

83
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.330
<v 1>To be held? How do you mean he's resurrecting from hell?</v>

84
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:26.040
He went to hell and then he resurrected.

85
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.360
<v 0>Jesus went to hell. Why would Jesus go to hell? That doesn't make any sense.</v>

86
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:34.410
I don't think that's in the scripture. Okay. So it doesn't. What is that image?

87
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.700
All right. Behind.

88
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.580
<v 1>This getting held to me, it looks like a Slayer album.</v>

89
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.180
<v 0>Cover the restoration of the statue of the resurrection. I've seen that.</v>

90
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.300
Does it become Satan's throne? What does that?

91
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.810
I've never seen depicts Jesus rising. Would it be backup please?

92
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.300
<v 3>Instead of nuclear bomb? What? Nuclear.</v>

93
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.280
<v 0>Bomb. Crater, who these people are crazy people. Well.</v>

94
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.400
<v 1>That's the Vatican. That's the main church and the Vatican. No.</v>

95
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.950
<v 0>I understand that, but I don't know what that represents.</v>

96
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.570
You'd have to talk to the actual artist.

97
00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:02.490
Like if the Vatican hired someone to make a,

98
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.820
an art piece about the resurrection and this is his depiction of it,

99
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.110
I don't know how much that has to say about the VAT case position or about this

100
00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:10.980
guy who created.

101
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.900
<v 1>It either into Jesus. Maybe I'm jumping too.</v>

102
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.810
<v 2>By the way. I said Frank, Bruni's gay. That's not the guy who wrote the book.</v>

103
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.940
That's a piece of. Sorry, Frank, Brittany

104
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.860
[inaudible].

105
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.360
<v 0>And to Frank, [inaudible] apologized to queen of England.</v>

106
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.600
This is just figures of speeches. We rudely use here in America. Yeah.

107
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.060
I apologize to Frank Bruni to you though. His picture. He did look, my friend,

108
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.160
Brian said you looked. Yeah. He just meant handsome. That's all he meant.

109
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.160
He meant gay. Like maybe in the Flintstones have a gay old time.

110
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.590
Come see me this week.

111
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.530
<v 1>I'm down with the Queens, right Queens. Right?</v>

112
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.020
That's one of my favorite all time. That's that's in the Vatican.

113
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.070
That's a serpent.

114
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.330
<v 3>Come on, man. The serpent should do a show.</v>

115
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.060
<v 1>Look at the fangs and look at the items that come on. The tongue that comes up,</v>

116
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.390
pretending they're into Christ. They're not into Christ.

117
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:08.620
They want to destroy Christ.

118
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.660
<v 0>Oh wait. That's supposed to be a snake. They're trying to.</v>

119
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.410
<v 1>Destroy. Oh, I see. Now you don't see that. Look at that.</v>

120
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.730
That's the, that's the inside of a, how was that? Jesus?

121
00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:21.550
How is that Jesus right? Where where's Jesus.

122
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.520
<v 0>Is that the Vatican is the rabbit. Can, that is a snake. You know?</v>

123
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:26.380
What's the most amazing thing about the Vatican though.

124
00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:29.590
It's not the sate tannic at St. Peter's Basilica St.

125
00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:32.980
Peter's Basilica took hundreds of years when you're standing in the middle of

126
00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:35.260
it. You can't believe it's real, man.

127
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.920
I mean like go to that upper left corner that you got there right there.

128
00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:43.060
Jamie right there. Yeah. That you, when you, when you zoom in on that,

129
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.350
can't click on it. It doesn't click. It's so amazing that St. Peter's Basilica,

130
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.090
zoomed in. It's a enormous church. It's so much bigger than that.

131
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.140
It's so big.

132
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.950
<v 1>Put the snake one. How do you, how do we get past that snake? One</v>

133
00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.830
that somebody loves snakes.

134
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.710
Those are the same people that came up with the big bang theory.

135
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.350
<v 0>Same people were in the butterflies. They're the same people who did the,</v>

136
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.190
the hell awaits cathedral. And then the serpent cathedral.

137
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.463
Big bet.

138
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.000
<v 1>It's the same people they're trying to kill Christ.</v>

139
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.060
They're not trying to Christian St.

140
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.500
<v 0>Peter's Basilica. No power tools. No, no power tools,</v>

141
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.600
no cranes. It's my favorite place. That's the most amazing,

142
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.720
incredible thing. It didn't even make it. It didn't make sense to me. Yeah.

143
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.630
My whole family were walking around. We barely talked to each other.

144
00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:37.900
Even my kids who are always like super energetic and piped down,

145
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.130
they were just like spending.

146
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.780
<v 2>As a kid, as a kid is the first thing I remember looking at and not.</v>

147
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.720
<v 1>The same way. When I go to Vegas, when I go to the Venetia in advance, I'm like,</v>

148
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.340
oh my God. I'm like, Jesus Christ. Go there and go lose your mind.

149
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.690
You'll never leave. You. Won't be able to leave.

150
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.560
<v 0>Yeah. Look at that. Look at that dude. But</v>

151
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.150
not anymore. Looking at it right now. Well, it's your new house?

152
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.760
Get at it right now is one thing. But looking at it when you're there in person,

153
00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:11.710
it, it really, it it's one of the reasons why people were so into believing.

154
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.281
That makes sense,

155
00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:16.090
because it's so bigger than anything you've ever seen in your life.

156
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.570
They don't feel like you have to be humble. When you walk in.

157
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.890
<v 2>There, there are paintings that were done.</v>

158
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.830
There were started by one artist and then finished by another artist because

159
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:26.710
that artist died. It took them in generate, like it took them a lifetime.

160
00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:30.010
And then another guy took off. Yeah. It's amazing. It's the credit, right?

161
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.293
No one.

162
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:34.180
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

163
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.650
<v 2>God. And it wasn't done. Nobody signs it, right? It wasn't about you.</v>

164
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:41.410
It was about, it was about the larger picture.

165
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.980
And that's the difference between architecture back then and architecture today,

166
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.730
architecture like, you know, today, you see it's about the architect. You,

167
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:53.830
you see these incredible structures do, do like, you know, whatever.

168
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:55.920
It might be. The structure that we go and visit all the time.

169
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.040
We don't really know it was done by maybe one guy.

170
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:02.250
Then another guy that's never, it was commissioned by a king.

171
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:03.750
You hear about the king who financed?

172
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:06.620
You don't hear about the guy who built it because that wasn't the point we're.

173
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.560
<v 1>In it. Wasn't it? The Freemasons that they build everything. Yeah, no, it.</v>

174
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.560
<v 0>Was the aliens. It was the big bang theory.</v>

175
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.590
The expansion of observable universe began with the explosion of a single

176
00:09:15.591 --> 00:09:19.270
particle to definite point in time. Oh, Georges, Jamie.

177
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.490
They met tear a Belgian cosmologist,

178
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.130
Catholic priest and father the big bang.

179
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.330
So big bang theory. So he was at cosmologists as well as being a Catholic.

180
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.450
<v 1>There's the Vatican has the biggest telescopes in the world.</v>

181
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.760
They have one called Lucifer. I don't think it's about that.

182
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.690
They have a telescope called Lucifer and sway. It's the biggest,

183
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.970
if not the biggest telescope you've gone too far.

184
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:49.040
You think the craziest real? How about it's real? How about it's real?

185
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.240
It's that's crazy.

186
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.230
<v 0>No, I don't think that's true. I don't think that's the biggest telescope.</v>

187
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.230
<v 1>It's one of them. It was the biggest at one time,</v>

188
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.610
or it's still maybe a surprise,

189
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.730
but it was the biggest at one time back before the Vatican,

190
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.740
the Vatican has been, it's a beautiful place. I love it.

191
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.260
I was born Catholic. I was born Catholic and EV you know,

192
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.790
for the Catholic church you got to have, I love the Cardinals.

193
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.880
I love the bishops. I love all that. You should.

194
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.390
<v 0>You should go. You should go. Just to see how weird it is. Yeah.</v>

195
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.600
I've seen a lot of it, man. I love it. But I mean, in person,

196
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.080
I love it in person. It's strange. What does that say?

197
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.840
Lucifer instrument helps us Toronto or see through darkness.

198
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.700
<v 1>At the Vatican elusive for telescope retardants in Arizona and Arizona, Miami.</v>

199
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.120
The.

200
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.880
<v 0>Vatican has an observatory in Arizona.</v>

201
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.120
<v 1>I know he's not making it up. Like. See.</v>

202
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.800
<v 0>How big it is. It's amazing. The Vatican would fly.</v>

203
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.840
<v 1>The Vatican is the one killing Christ. Amazing that the vet.</v>

204
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.530
<v 0>Amazing that the Vatican would have a telescope in the name. It Lucifer,</v>

205
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.830
go to that, click on that link. Anyway, whether they name it Lucifer.

206
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.500
<v 1>Exactly. Cause it's an acronym for something,</v>

207
00:11:03.501 --> 00:11:08.000
but it just so happens to be lucid for it really that's them just,

208
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:09.643
that's what they say.

209
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.530
They say it stands for something. It stands for like some kind of linear.

210
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.230
<v 0>Or whatever. You better stand for something to your fault for everything</v>

211
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.270
for Brian. What does it say here? Large by knocking a telescope,

212
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.640
go make that a little larger for my eyes.

213
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.260
It's an optical telescope for astronomy located at 10,700 feet Mount Graham and

214
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.650
uh, pina LAN pillow, you know, uh,

215
00:11:39.651 --> 00:11:42.080
mountains of Southeastern Arizona.

216
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.840
Part of the Mount Graham international observatory.

217
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.160
The LBT is currently one of the world's most advanced optical telescopes at two

218
00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:54.080
8.4, 330 inch wide mirrors, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

219
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.100
blah, blah, blah. Where's one. Where's the name?

220
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.980
It's the second biggest telescope. He showed us the name, Eddie,

221
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.240
the Carl Lucifer now,

222
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.800
but it was [inaudible] O L U C I a originally

223
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:10.330
Lucifer, L U C. I excuse me, large by nodular telescope,

224
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.640
near infrared to corn stratospheric utility. It doesn't

225
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:18.630
[inaudible].

226
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.350
<v 1>But they picked.</v>

227
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.550
<v 0>Ones. One letter to you like the pick they hell Eddie,</v>

228
00:12:23.551 --> 00:12:27.720
Jesus Christ. They had a chicken. They picked the owl.

229
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.920
It skipped like four letters that doesn't make any sense. How do they call that?

230
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.470
Exactly. That's crazy. It was a coincidence, but it really only came.

231
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.850
They only found enough letters for Lucy.

232
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.090
<v 1>I like that. Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. He's onto something here, man.</v>

233
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:47.933
[inaudible].

234
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.530
<v 0>When was this telescope created?</v>

235
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.760
<v 2>It's an observatory in, um, in Arizona.</v>

236
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.320
<v 0>But when what's the art, Jamie we'll scroll up</v>

237
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.370
January, 2004. This one, they started it.

238
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:07.560
Imagine being a part of a gigantic religious institution and naming a

239
00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:10.180
telescope. But you could say like the God I can call it the God.

240
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.700
<v 1>I know. How did, how did that work?</v>

241
00:13:11.701 --> 00:13:14.880
You mentioned the meeting where they're like the top three names were like,

242
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.440
okay, we got Jesus. I, we got God of light.

243
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.320
How did that one get picked? Came out to the press by Jesuits.

244
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.320
And they veiled this telescope and they at the Vatican and they call it Lucifer.

245
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.090
<v 0>How did that get picked? What a, what?</v>

246
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:38.040
<v 1>A weird conversation that must've been that be one guy opposed to it.</v>

247
00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:39.420
At least one guy.

248
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.950
[inaudible] I know it sounds crazy, but look, L.

249
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.960
<v 4>Loosen you universe. See.</v>

250
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.500
<v 1>Cosmology. It's a whole, uh,</v>

251
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.290
interstellar F

252
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.920
E earth radius of earth.

253
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:05.783
Come on.

254
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:08.843
<v 4>It's easy,</v>

255
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.280
but it's safe, but it's not state. It's not Satan.

256
00:14:17.281 --> 00:14:19.380
It's Lucifer. It's an acronym.

257
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.510
<v 1>Okay, true. But we are the God, the house of God. And this is Lucifer.</v>

258
00:14:24.511 --> 00:14:27.750
It's this enemy. It's a coincidence. It's a coincidence.

259
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.620
<v 0>How did the Vatican relax? The Vatican didn't name? A telescope. Lucifer. Okay.</v>

260
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.030
Just from Catholica. Why was.

261
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.380
<v 1>There? But wait a minute. This is the damage control right here. Why.</v>

262
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.200
<v 0>Was the Vatican named his telescope? Uh, in Arizona, Lucifer,</v>

263
00:14:43.201 --> 00:14:45.270
I'm a proud and devoted Catholic blah, blah, blah. Answer.

264
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:49.440
The Vatican did not name a telescope blues for the Vatican observatory shares

265
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.870
space, no pun with, with other organizations and groups.

266
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.860
The Vatican observatory does not own each piece of equipment,

267
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.090
nor can it give official names or nicknames to things. It does not own.

268
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:06.170
Another group installed a telescope neck and nicknamed it. Lucifer.

269
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.710
That would be hilarious if you had a telescope right next to the Vatican's

270
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:10.544
telescope.

271
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:15.860
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

272
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.830
<v 4>Vision of God, to the heavens to prove the gospel, like where and how.</v>

273
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.320
<v 1>And the meanwhile. Okay. Okay.</v>

274
00:15:23.321 --> 00:15:27.570
What about the serpent cathedral with the fangs and the snake eyes?

275
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.320
It's a coincidence about the, the, the resurrection sculpture.

276
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:36.280
<v 0>Well, you know, the, the serpent was the reason why we're human.</v>

277
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.910
<v 1>What about Cox? 17 was pagan and said,</v>

278
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.240
and even the mainstream history says that he never converted.

279
00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:46.990
That was posted that's mainstream. So if he never converted Constantine,

280
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.670
I thought he was, he didn't convert.

281
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.930
<v 0>But the fact that there was a dependent.</v>

282
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:56.650
<v 1>Political decision, but yeah, exactly. So the, the one theory and it's, it's,</v>

283
00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.010
it's either one or the others, he actually did convert the Christ,

284
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.730
or he just said that for political purposes. But meanwhile,

285
00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:07.360
he was still pagan, right? It's one of the other,

286
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.120
and then you start looking at the Vatican. You're like, man,

287
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.960
they're the ones who are creating the stuff that,

288
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.460
that turned people away from the Bible. They created the big bang theory. Well,

289
00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.610
if you believe in the big bang theory, you're like, how could the Bible be true?

290
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.290
How could Jesus be read charges? The big bang theory can be scientific too,

291
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.690
right? Yeah, you're right. You're right. But if you were trying to kill,

292
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.580
if you were trying to kill religion,

293
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.150
you want everything that's opposite of the religion, right?

294
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.890
It's there because religion,

295
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.620
the Bible tells you that we're on a special payment.

296
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:46.810
<v 0>You're saying the Catholic church trying to kill religion. I didn't say that.</v>

297
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.600
Is that what you're insinuating? This doesn't make any sense.

298
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.200
<v 2>Eddie, this has become a sacrifice. Don't.</v>

299
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.140
<v 0>Hack off any. I.</v>

300
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.860
<v 1>Never said that I'm pointing to the Catholicism.</v>

301
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.090
<v 0>The wake division. I got a little excited about the Catholic church loves Jesus.</v>
