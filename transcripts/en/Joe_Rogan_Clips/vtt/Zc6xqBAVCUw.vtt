00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>G Gordon Liddy was on fear factor. He was, yeah. Oh, I didn't know that.</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.630
<v 1>Interesting guy. He hold his hand above a flame. No, he didn't.</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.320
<v 0>But we did hang him by his ankles and slam them into a pool,</v>

4
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:13.470
like over and over and over again, he was, I forget what the stunt was,

5
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:17.910
but I was like, Jesus, this guy's old to be doing this. But, uh, he did, uh,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.770
some physical challenges.

7
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:24.660
I remember thinking like this guy is more fit and more active

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.920
than most young people.

9
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:29.310
And he was deep into his sixties at the time when we had him on fear factor.

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.200
The only thing that screwed him up was in the end,

11
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:36.120
the final stunt was a driving stunt and it was at night and unfortunately his

12
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:40.380
eyes are not that good. And he just couldn't see, well, without glasses.

13
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.440
So as he was driving the car, he slammed into something or something.

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.390
Got what it was when he got them there. No, it's all right. But uh,

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.810
he had a chance to talk to him for a few days. He did hang out with them.

16
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.210
Very interesting guy. Yeah, yeah.

17
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.980
<v 1>Yep. That's right. He had a talk show back in the nineties. I was on when, uh,</v>

18
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.870
my first book came out, white people believe were things.

19
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:04.170
And I talked about conspiracies there. And so he, he asked me, well,

20
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.110
tell me about conspiracies. Well, you tell me about conspiracy, you know,

21
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:08.850
more than I do knows about real one.

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.050
<v 0>The real ones. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.120
That is my number one beef with conspiracy theories is that when you, you know,

24
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:18.450
some of them that are so preposterous, like whether it's flat earth or what,

25
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.960
what were the really dumb ones? There's a base on the opposite side of the moon.

26
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.240
And NASA knows about all the daily ins are living.

27
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.250
<v 1>In New Mexico. The lizard people, the.</v>

28
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.140
<v 0>Problem with those is they undermine actual conspiracies, right? When you,</v>

29
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.640
when you hear about preposterous things and they, they get false,

30
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.810
they get categorized as conspiracy theories. Then when someone says, well,

31
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:41.760
there's a conspiracy about this. Well,

32
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:45.720
it's already a tainted idea because the word conspiracy is connected to

33
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:49.710
nonsense, right? Because there's so many nonsense, conspiracy theories,

34
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:53.700
it's hard to recognize, oh, something like Enron that really did happen. Yeah.

35
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.830
There, there is the Northwoods papers.

36
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.160
There's a bunch of like legitimate conspiracies. You're like, wow. You know,

37
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.670
you find out what the Gulf of Tonkin. You're like, well, they really did.

38
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.450
<v 1>Yep. That's right. Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.420
I'm writing a paper now on why people believe conspiracies.

40
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.480
And so I go through the whole list of all the psychological things,

41
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:13.920
but I am with the whole second half is because a lot of them are true and there

42
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:17.640
are reasons we should be suspicious. Let's just think of, uh, the, uh, the,

43
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.900
the WikiLeaks or the Panama papers, you know, like the Panama papers,

44
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:24.630
here's all these billionaires opening. These shell corporations,

45
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:27.360
keeping their money. They're not paying tax. That's a conspiracy, you know,

46
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.560
by definition to them,

47
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.640
are people meeting in secret to conspire to benefit themselves that harms the

48
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.930
public good or other people.

49
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.700
This happens a lot in the U S government in corporations.

50
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.040
There's a reason we should be suspicious.

51
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.301
<v 0>There is.</v>

52
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:46.440
But what is it about people that want to look for a conspiracy and everything?

53
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.990
Even if it's, you know, they wanna see,

54
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.610
they wanna see con trails behind jets as evidence of the government spraying

55
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:55.920
things in the sky to control our minds.

56
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.900
<v 1>Right? So the sort of baloney detection, uh, tools are not too finely tuned.</v>

57
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.490
Uh, the problem is, is that we're tendency is to look for some global,

58
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.620
simple explanation for complex systems. So while we all kind of recognize,

59
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:11.861
yes,

60
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:16.600
we know corporations cheat and stock traders trade with insight information,

61
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:18.640
but that's kind of small and mundane.

62
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:23.500
It's not very interesting global domination of the world. You know,

63
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:25.300
this is, Ooh, who's doing that. You know?

64
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:27.550
So then it becomes like a Dan brown novel.

65
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:31.690
It's more compelling as a narrative story about how the world works.

66
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.381
It's super simple.

67
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:35.890
There's these 12 guys in London called the Illuminati and they're calling the

68
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:38.410
shots and they're, they're, you know, they're controlling older burdens,

69
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.150
the builder burgers, the Rockefellers, the last child, the Illuminati CFR,

70
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.320
the new world order.

71
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.770
<v 0>Towards Soros is doing it. He's a part of it.</v>

72
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.480
<v 1>Oh, totally. That's what I hear. He's number 13 in the Illuminati. There's so.</v>

73
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.210
<v 0>Many different competing theories too.</v>

74
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.260
<v 1>So a couple of criteria, the more people that have to be involved,</v>

75
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:02.770
the less likely it is to be true. And it was Gordon Liddy that told me this,

76
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.800
that, you know, th th what is it? Three people can keep a secret.

77
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.620
If two of them are dead, you know, people can't keep their mouth shut.

78
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.260
And also he would know, cause he worked in government.

79
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.880
Most people are pretty incompetent.

80
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.420
So the idea that you could orchestrate a thousand people and each of them is

81
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:19.030
going to go out and do this one thing at nine o'clock Tuesday,

82
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.200
and it's all going to come together. Just perfect. Impossible. Yeah.

83
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.130
And he should know. I mean,

84
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.450
they couldn't even break into the Watergate hotel room to get these papers.

85
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.180
<v 0>So who is getting into government the first place?</v>

86
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.240
Are they the geniuses of the world, the heads of their field?

87
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:37.750
Or are they people that just like decided to get into a job? You know,

88
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:38.584
and this is,

89
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.470
this is a good percentage of the people that are involved in government.

90
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:42.970
If those people know as well,

91
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.840
these unexceptional folks that are just like uninspired and they're also,

92
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.120
they're like th do they re it's they that's right. Air quotes. They, they,

93
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.840
they really have the kind of wherewithal to control the whole world.

94
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.240
Mine control. That's my favorite. Right?

95
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.840
<v 1>PSYOPs. I mean, this idea that, um, you know,</v>

96
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.990
operatives went into the world trade center buildings, both of them,

97
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.890
two of the most, uh, tightly controlled and secure buildings in the world.

98
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.580
And under the pretense of working on the elevators,

99
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:16.690
managed to get into and break through the dry wall, to get into the main beams,

100
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:20.710
to wrap them up in explosive devices, this thermite stuff.

101
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.241
And this would, you know,

102
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:25.690
we know how long it takes to demolish like a stadium or a big building.

103
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.410
You know,

104
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.010
th they work they're there for weeks or months preparing all the explosive

105
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:32.230
devices. Somehow they did this and the world trade center building,

106
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:36.700
without anyone noticing not to mention all the people that worked on this,

107
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.270
they never told their spouses or friends or buddies, or, you know,

108
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:42.910
what they were doing, or they didn't mention it to anybody.

109
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:46.720
They don't want to go on CNN or 60 minutes ago. I saw something.

110
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:47.650
And here's what happened.

111
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.870
<v 0>Nobody. Well, anytime you have a gigantic catastrophe like that,</v>

112
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.830
just a gigantic horrific event. There's so many,

113
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.270
there's so much chaos.

114
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.900
There's so much going on that you're going to get a bunch of really wacky eye

115
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:06.590
witness accounts. Cause people just aren't good at remembering things. When,

116
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:10.910
when they're under extreme duress, it's just the fact they hear things.

117
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:12.410
They remember explosions,

118
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.820
they see things that aren't necessarily what was really in front of them.

119
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.590
And this is the human memory is one of the most flawed

120
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:26.360
ways of gathering information. Right. It's terrible. We have terrible memories.

121
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.020
Yeah.

122
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.120
<v 1>Right. And everything, once something happens,</v>

123
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:33.050
then you back up and look for all the sort of pregnant moments leading up to it

124
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:36.120
that otherwise would have been a noticeable, like, uh,

125
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.320
put the JFK assassination. There's a famous story about the umbrella man. Yes.

126
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.240
Yes. Okay. So there he is. It's a clear sunny day. Why does he have an umbrella?

127
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.450
And for decades there, you know, you can go online, you could see these, uh,

128
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.260
like, uh, examples of how the umbrella could have been turned into a rifle.

129
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:54.260
And then he shot like that. And, and anyway,

130
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.870
somebody finally tracked this guy down decades later and he said,

131
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:00.710
I was out there protesting Kennedy. The umbrella was a protest. Uh,

132
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.150
and that stems back to a Neville Chamberlain coming back after meeting with

133
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:08.570
Hitler before Hitler, annexed, I think it was a sedate and land.

134
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.260
And he came back and said, you know, holding his umbrella here, I had, you know,

135
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.410
hear a Hitler sign this paper and promised he wouldn't do anything more bad.

136
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.390
And so the umbrella became a symbol of, um, you know,

137
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:24.560
sort of caving into evil people or, you know, uh,

138
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.400
w what's the word for it? Uh, you know, appeasement, how convoluted.

139
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.050
<v 0>Do you think people are going to get that? And.</v>

140
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.930
<v 1>I don't know he's out. So this is what he said. I had my umbrella to,</v>

141
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.430
cause I didn't like what Kennedy was doing with Castro and the Cubans. Okay.

142
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:40.520
So in other words, the umbrella meant nothing, uh,

143
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.960
in terms of the assassination, right? And this is true. So like nine 11, oh,

144
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.260
there was this little puff of smoke or somebody found this passport over here,

145
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:51.890
this little thing that, all those little things really it's just randomness.

146
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:52.401
<v 0>Well,</v>

147
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:56.480
the other thing is the people that want to think that the windows blowing out

148
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.520
are indicative of some sort of a controlled demolition or the buildings caving.

149
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.060
<v 1>It's the floor pancake. It pushes the air out, that's it?</v>

150
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.590
<v 0>Yeah. Well, it's,</v>

151
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.160
there's never been a controlled demolition that went from the top down either.

152
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.490
Like the way they did it. [inaudible].

153
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.990
<v 1>From the bottom up, right? Yeah. It's.</v>

154
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.730
<v 0>The one that looks crazy is a building seven tower seven. That one looks crazy.</v>

155
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.900
<v 1>It does, but it burned for like eight hours or something and yeah. Um,</v>

156
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.150
that one's just slightly fuzzier,

157
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:30.920
but explosive experts tell me that it's fully explicable by burning all day.

158
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.980
<v 0>So when you see the images of it collapsing,</v>

159
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:38.600
what you don't see is the interior structure had collapsed previously.

160
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.870
And there's video of that when you watch the interior cave in,

161
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.130
and that as this fire was burning, because apparently there was obviously,

162
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:47.240
I don't know what really what happened,

163
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:51.590
but there was diesel tanks apparently in the basement and the diesel fuel had

164
00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:54.560
burned incredibly hot. And the whole inside of it,

165
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:58.650
all the structure had been completely weakened. And, and then as it collapsed,

166
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:03.330
it just all gave out. It just happened to be a design.

167
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.370
If I was the guy who owned that building, I would Sue everybody. I mean,

168
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:10.290
that's the, I mean, he got his money back, I guess,

169
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:13.740
because there's some insurance money, but what a terrible design,

170
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.113
there was some.

171
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:20.010
<v 1>Uh, issue with the legal insurance payout to the owner of the world trade center</v>

172
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:20.431
buildings,

173
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:25.200
whether this was like one event or two events or one building or two w you know,

174
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:25.590
what is it?

175
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:30.570
W was it what the difference was between like 8 billion and $16 billion payout

176
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:31.404
or something like that?

177
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.960
<v 0>How do they get people to get into that new building? I'd be like, you. I'm not,</v>

178
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.330
I'm not renting an office in this building, this building.

179
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:42.750
They blew it up in 93. They blew it up again in 2001, Hey,

180
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.710
get outta here with this. I'm not taking a chance of this new building.

181
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.450
What is it? The freedom tower or something like that.

182
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.370
It was just a big old bullseye.

183
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.300
<v 1>Yep. Yeah. I haven't been in it yet. I've been around it, but it's not even.</v>

184
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.380
<v 0>That big, uh.</v>

185
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.720
<v 1>Well, it's T I think it's just, I think it's taller than the.</v>

186
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.320
<v 0>Not, it's not, it's not as big as the original towers. Right. I think it is,</v>

187
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.150
is tall. It.

188
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.800
<v 1>Isn't. Yeah, I think, I think so. Yeah. I thought it.</v>

189
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.160
<v 0>Was shorter. It's definitely not as big as the one in Dubai, the Dubai,</v>

190
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.100
one's like a half a mile. Right? Isn't it something crazy like that?

191
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.340
I don't know how tall is the tallest building. It is.

192
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.060
<v 2>I just went to there. The one world trade center, leasing page,</v>

193
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.150
it says at 1,776 feet, one world trade centers,

194
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:25.890
the tallest L E D gold certified building in the Western hemisphere.

195
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.440
<v 0>Hmm. That's not good enough. Whatever that don't know. Some America,</v>

196
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:30.750
we need to be number one, number one, we need to go straight to.

197
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.610
<v 1>The moon in the solar system. We need.</v>

198
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.810
<v 0>To take an elevator right. To the moon, right?</v>

199
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:39.150
Outside of space. How is that possible?

200
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.180
Can they build a building that's so high that it goes into space?

201
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.170
<v 1>Why not? Yeah, I don't think so. Because structurally it wouldn't hold.</v>

202
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.330
<v 0>Went up to make it the shape of a pyramid.</v>

203
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.730
<v 1>Like why aren't trees, you know,</v>

204
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:54.360
a thousand feet tall because the material would just collapse. And I don't,

205
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:56.610
I don't think you could have it strong. It'd have to be so fast.

206
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.000
<v 0>Oh, that's right. Japan was going to build that space elevator. Oh, look at it.</v>

207
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:04.380
You got jacked with the pop-ups Japan takes tiny first steps towards space

208
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:07.320
elevator. Yeah. You can off. I'm not getting in that thing.

209
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.870
It will take a few years before I'm willing to climb it, that sucker. But, um.

210
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.260
<v 1>So the other problem with conspiracy is just get back there for a moment is the</v>

211
00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:18.150
problem of anomalies. What do you do with anomalies?

212
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:19.320
This is true in all science,

213
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.180
no theory explains every single thing that's out there that we want to study.

214
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.380
There's always going to be some like quirky thing that the main theory here that

215
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:31.560
explains all these things here, it doesn't account for that. Okay.

216
00:11:31.561 --> 00:11:34.830
What did we do with that? Well, my joke is you assign it to a grad student.

217
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:39.750
They let them figure it out. But what, what outsiders mistake is that?

218
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.540
Well, my theory explains this a little anomaly.

219
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:44.760
So therefore it should replace this theory.

220
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.480
And so people like Neil and Sean Carroll, Lawrence Krauss,

221
00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:53.260
Michio Kaku has like two webpages. One. He has a link on his webpage.

222
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:56.320
If you have an alternative theory of physics, go to this page.

223
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.970
So they go there and it has,

224
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.150
your theory has to explain all of these things over here,

225
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:06.040
that our theory currently explains and your, whatever your said anomaly is.

226
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.770
And of course they can't. So, um,

227
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.790
it's not that scientists are dogmatically closed-minded to the anomalies.

228
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.170
It's that we can't explain everything and you don't have to do anything with

229
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:18.490
that. Just, just leave it there.

230
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.020
Maybe eventually they'll pile up and there'll be a new theory,

231
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.430
like with Einstein's relativity. Okay. There's enough anomalies here, uh,

232
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.190
like the orbit of mercury and a few other things.

233
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:34.990
And so we have to modify Newtonian physics a little bit. Okay. That happens.

234
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.190
But for the most part, like, and so conspiracies are filled with these things.

235
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.700
Like the moment something big happens, you go back and okay.

236
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:46.060
But there's this weird thing here. How to explain that? I don't know.

237
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.770
We don't have to explain everything.
