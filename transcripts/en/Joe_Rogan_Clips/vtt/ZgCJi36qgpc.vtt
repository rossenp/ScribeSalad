00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well, Mike Baker tried to explain Walway to me.</v>

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.500
And one of the things that he, Mike Baker from the CIA,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.450
one of the things that he was explaining, he said,

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.460
you have to realize that there is no such thing as industry,

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:18.690
independent of government in China. If you have something like Walway,

6
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:20.010
if you have a giant corporation,

7
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:23.100
they are inexorably connected to the Chinese government.

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.300
And the moves they make are not necessarily designed for, you know,

9
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.400
the infinite growth paradigm.

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.360
This idea that we have in the United States with corporations are beholding.

11
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.310
The stockholders are just trying to make money.

12
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.400
That's not what they're doing over there. They have a long game.

13
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.780
And the long game involves information involves espionage,

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.970
involves stealing, uh,

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.270
trade secrets and patents from other companies.

16
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:51.060
And so when they're selling them these modems,

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.560
they've got built in third party options. So the third party,

18
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:58.650
meaning China can extract information. So if you're,

19
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.240
if someone has this modem and they're using this modem to send information to

20
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:04.800
someone in Beirut,

21
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.790
China can also get that information. Yeah.

22
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.620
<v 1>They do a lot of cyber. I mean,</v>

23
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.800
that that's been a thing that's been known for a long time, that there they'll,

24
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.190
you know, Jack patents and intellectual property, and they have this whole,

25
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.180
you know, economy that's kind of thriving off technology that's made elsewhere.

26
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.920
That's certainly an issue. Um,

27
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.850
but also I would argue that is probably the case with the U S too,

28
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:31.320
that this kind of distinction between corporations in the state is largely of a

29
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:31.651
near,

30
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:35.850
because you have such control of our political process because of big money from

31
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:37.530
corporations flowing into the system.

32
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.380
So I think that a lot of these decisions that are made,

33
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:43.860
even when it comes to foreign policy are directly in relation to how it will

34
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:44.940
impact those corporations.

35
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:48.270
Like the thing that I remember was a light bulb moment for me back in the day,

36
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:51.270
when I first learned about it was the banana wars.

37
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.790
Have you ever heard about this back in the day?

38
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.900
I think it was in the late 18 hundreds, but don't quote me on that. Um,

39
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.290
we just went into south America and started toppling governments because we

40
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:04.710
wanted to Jack their bananas and it was literally further, I think the Chiquita,

41
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.100
but then the company that we did that really? Yeah. So when you look at that,

42
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:09.480
you go, okay,

43
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:12.900
well that kind of distinction between corporation and government is not even

44
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:15.870
really a thing here. It's like this veneer that's in between the two,

45
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:20.430
but really it's the powerful moneyed interests in the elites that kind of run

46
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.320
everything. And they're married at the hip,

47
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.050
whether they're in the government or whether they're in corporations.

48
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.630
I think this was the late 1890s. Again,

49
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:30.300
I'm more than happy to be fact checked on this. But, um,

50
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.180
I remember the first time I read about this, it had to be in college,

51
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.370
the banana wars. I was like, that's insane for.

52
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.360
<v 0>Bananas.</v>

53
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.390
<v 1>It's great.</v>

54
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.740
<v 0>Well, how about when you,</v>

55
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:43.560
you go throughout history and you find out that a lot of the wars were over

56
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:44.394
salt.

57
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.980
<v 1>I didn't even know that. I didn't know. They killed.</v>

58
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.610
<v 0>People for salt was very important back in the day because they didn't have</v>

59
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.444
refrigerators.

60
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.680
So in order to preserve things and keep them from being infected by bacteria,

61
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.800
they would pour salt all over their meat and salt, all of their fish.

62
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:01.480
And that's how they preserve things. Right.

63
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.140
You get apparently preserve things for long periods of times when you completely

64
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.273
cover them with salt.

65
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.960
<v 1>Yeah. So it's, I guess,</v>

66
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.530
I guess it's just always been a thing that it's like wars over resources.

67
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.750
Now there's a lot about oil, but like.

68
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.840
<v 0>We're accustomed to the oil stuff. Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.360
<v 1>You're right. We have been used to that for quite a while.</v>

70
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.700
And it's interesting because what just happened with Syria and Trump,

71
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.270
that was fascinating. Is he, at first he said, oh, we're getting out of Syria.

72
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.910
We're getting out of Northern Syria. Everybody went crazy and said, oh my God,

73
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:28.750
what about the Kurds?

74
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.230
And then we come to find out like three or four days later that he's like, well,

75
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:34.780
no, we're actually taking these troops from Northern Syria,

76
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.450
moving them over into Western Iraq.

77
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.520
And they're going to be doing the same thing that they've been doing from

78
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:42.250
Western Iraq. And then Trump had the nerve to go out there and say,

79
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.850
and we've secured the oil. It's so tremendous. We've secured the oil.

80
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.610
We're not going to make the same mistake. Like we made in Iraq again.

81
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.790
And this is something that he had been saying at SeaPak that conservative

82
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:55.270
political action conference going back for years every year, he'd give a speech.

83
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.020
And, um, he actually said like, we should, we should have taken the oil.

84
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:01.900
We should have taken the oil in Iraq because we didn't want ISIS to have it.

85
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.630
And we should have it instead of ISIS. And it's like,

86
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.200
he's he actually ripped the mask off of everything we're doing because he has no

87
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:10.420
filter. And it's like, yeah, that was a big part of it.

88
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.880
But what he's just admitting in front of the world is international law.

89
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.780
It means nothing. We don't care about, uh, you know,

90
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:19.480
the proper process we don't care about. Like imagine for a second,

91
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:21.850
China did that to us and they're like, no big deal or anything,

92
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:23.110
but we're just going to go into Texas.

93
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:25.900
And we're just going to Jack all your oil, but don't worry because it's okay.

94
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:28.450
We're allowed to do that. Cause we say, we're allowed to do that. We'd be like,

95
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.060
what are you talking about? But we're going to do that to a sovereign country,

96
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:35.830
Syria, as we pretend like we care so deeply about civilian or Syrian civilians.

97
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:37.450
And that's why we're there to protect them. Like no,

98
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:38.680
we're there to check their oil.

99
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:40.630
That's what we're trying to do and control the region.

100
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.390
<v 0>It's so disturbing when it's that transparent.</v>

101
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.060
<v 1>Exactly. But that's see. That's, it's interesting to be a better, well,</v>

102
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:49.000
that's what I was just about to say next is that some people make the argument

103
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.290
that, well, at least there's no tap dancing. Whereas with all,

104
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:55.690
all the other presidents, they have this,

105
00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.490
this like fake holier than thou attitude where they really can like put a happy

106
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:04.090
face on a disgusting thing, like empire where Trump is.

107
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:05.320
And I think it's fair to say,

108
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.220
he's like too stupid to really go through the tap dance. And so people are like,

109
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.740
Hey, there it is. It's like, it's right in front of our face.

110
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.730
But what's interesting about him is he says both things at the same time.

111
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:20.560
Like he has the political instincts enough to know that people think

112
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.000
war is generally bad.

113
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.540
So he always goes out there and he talks about how he thinks war is generally

114
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:27.490
bad and we gotta get our troops out of the middle east.

115
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.470
I don't know why we're there. It's so stupid to do in the first place.

116
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.860
But when you look at what he's actually doing, it doesn't match his rhetoric.

117
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.400
So I don't know if you remember this, but like a year or so ago, he tweeted, uh,

118
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:37.930
we're getting out of Afghanistan. Finally.

119
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:40.330
After all these years we've been there for 18 years. It was terrible.

120
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:41.500
We should have never been in there in the first place.

121
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.130
And then we just didn't get out. He said that acted like we were going to do it.

122
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.550
And then the generals by the scenes were like, that's a good one.

123
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.490
And we never got out. And then he just stopped talking about it.

124
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.150
We're still there. But he say, he just says it. He's like, oh,

125
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:58.040
we're going to get out of Iraq. Then he doesn't do it. So happens is he gets,

126
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.470
it's actually politically it's.

127
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.860
It comes across sometimes as a positive because nobody follows up with it and

128
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:05.450
the media doesn't do their job and say, wait,

129
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.620
we didn't actually get out of there.

130
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.340
But so it comes across as a positive politically because he's still doing the

131
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:12.710
head fakes towards non-intervention with people agree with,

132
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.830
but it's business as usual behind the scenes. How much.

133
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.520
<v 0>Time do you think he actually spends on any of these things?</v>

134
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.170
And if he does spend time, how does he have the time to do these interviews?

135
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.490
How does he have the time to tweet? How does he have the time to watch Fox news?

136
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.590
I mean, I really want to know like how much interaction he actually has with his

137
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:37.040
cabinet. Like how much interaction does he actually have with the generals?

138
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.113
How much interact.

139
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.750
<v 1>That's that's the dirty little secret Joe, is that it can't be much.</v>

140
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.670
It's not because what he really does is he watches Fox news all day and tweets

141
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:49.460
out there videos and Eddy tweets all day. Well, how, yeah. Right.

142
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.510
<v 0>How can you be doing that? And then also doing what we think you should do.</v>

143
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:57.620
Look, I don't have any time. And all I do is do podcasts that's right.

144
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.050
So I watch him and I'm like, this doesn't make any sense.

145
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.580
<v 1>No. So here's the thing.</v>

146
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:04.340
And there was a story that was reported before he became president.

147
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.110
I think it was after he got the Republican nomination,

148
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:08.660
there was this interesting story that it wasn't discussed too much,

149
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.580
but I thought it was fascinating because, uh,

150
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:13.880
the Trump team apparently approached John Casick who just like kind of a

151
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:15.230
standard establishment Republican.

152
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:18.470
And he was the governor of may have been Ohio. Uh,

153
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.930
but I'm not sure if it was one of those states over there, but anyway,

154
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.830
so he approached John Casick and basically said to him, boss behind the scenes,

155
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.770
Hey, listen, man, if I end up winning this election,

156
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.970
I want you to kind of like be my vice president run the day to day at the white

157
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:35.150
house, take care of dot all the I's cross all the T's do all the work like that.

158
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.420
And I want to go around the country and keep doing rallies and rile up everybody

159
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.870
and get everybody to our side. So basically,

160
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.240
and this shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody what's.

161
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.940
<v 0>That? Why even if you win, why do you have to rile.</v>

162
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.660
<v 1>Everybody up? We'll see, he's the first president to never stopped campaigning.</v>

163
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:52.550
He's always campaigning. He's always doing rallies.

164
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:54.320
And there's a reason why he's doing that, Joe.

165
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.140
It's the only thing he loves on this earth.

166
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.420
It's that in watching Fox news that he loves.

167
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.000
So that's what he does with all of his time and everything else. Yes.

168
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:04.100
He's just see, this is the thing, Joe,

169
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:08.570
he took all these deeply establishment figures, Steve Minutian of Goldman Sachs,

170
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.680
um, Stephen I'm forgetting his name, cone something co Cohen cone.

171
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.480
Another guy from Goldman Sachs. He had all these just career insiders,

172
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.300
brought them into his administration, whether it's with the economy,

173
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:23.060
with farm policy, John Bolton, deep neo-conservative you said he,

174
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.860
he believed in the opposite philosophy, but then,

175
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.070
but then he pushed John Bolton the power because he wants the system to keep

176
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:32.960
running as it is and run smoothly while he goes around and just, you know,

177
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:34.450
makes the name for himself and,

178
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:37.520
and talks about how amazing and tremendous this country is and what an amazing

179
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:40.970
job we're doing. So it's funny because he has two different personas.

180
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:43.940
One of them is I'm going to pretend to be the antiestablishment guy and rally

181
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:46.790
people up nonstop and be a politician and be good at it.

182
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.880
And then the other thing is behind the scenes. He's like, gosh,

183
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:51.710
just keep everything running and, and, you know,

184
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:54.290
hold it together with duct tape, if you have to, before I get out of here.

185
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.070
So at the same time,

186
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:58.500
he's acting like the most antiestablishment president of all time,

187
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:59.580
when he's on the campaign trail,

188
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.120
he's also the most deeply pro establishment candidate in terms of,

189
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:05.220
or president in terms of what he's actually doing.

190
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.690
So it's a fascinating dynamic that's going on right now. It's a giant hustle.

191
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.090
That's right. It's a giant hustle and listen man.

192
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:13.860
And other people on the left might disagree with me on this,

193
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:17.040
but I think he's brilliant at it. I think he's brilliant at this part of it,

194
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.500
but where he, he really does have a way,

195
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.450
like he broke every single political rule that ever existed when he ran for

196
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:27.210
president and he won. So what does that tell you?
