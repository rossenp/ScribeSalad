00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.710
Independent times when I ran out of food and I've literally tracked wolves

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.190
and taken food away from them when they've killed caribou.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.360
<v 1>What? Yeah. How many wolves were there?</v>

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.640
<v 0>One time, there was a lone Wolf that got a caribou just ahead of me.</v>

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.330
He didn't have time to do anything except got it for me. Literally.

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.220
That's what they start eating is the guts.

8
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:29.220
And he had opened up its belly and pulled the guts out and the whole caribou is

9
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:32.820
there. Wow. Um, what happened that day? Um,

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.270
I was really hungry. I had, we had run out of food.

11
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:38.730
I was out there with my ex wife and we had,

12
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.580
and your kids had one baby at the time.

13
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.020
<v 2>So you're out there with a baby and you don't have any food? The.</v>

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.730
<v 0>Baby was fine. She was nursing. Um, your wife doesn't have any food. Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.650
Um, well we always had something to eat, just not enough,

16
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.120
but I never,

17
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.650
ever have been out there when I didn't have something to eat every single day.

18
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.140
Some days it was just one rabbit.

19
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:06.590
Some days it was just one time again,

20
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.640
which is very little food, but I've always been able to get something to eat.

21
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.930
But this particular year, it was kind of early on. This was the winter of 2006,

22
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:19.580
2007. I hadn't been out there that long, made a miscalculation.

23
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.940
I was counting on caribou shown up because so far I'd always seen a lot of

24
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.710
Caribbean, the winter that one of the income,

25
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.870
if I had known I could have prevented the situation,

26
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:33.350
but we had taken one moose in the fall. I'd killed a moose in September.

27
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.710
And I thought, man, we've got 500 pounds of me. We're set.

28
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:38.120
The caribou will come later in the winter,

29
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.450
but it's amazing how much meat you can eat when you're not eating much of

30
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:42.284
anything else.

31
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.450
And all that I was eating at that time really was meat fat and maybe a

32
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:52.370
cup of berries a day, you know, that I had gathered in the fall and froze. Um,

33
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.030
so the most we went through that pretty fast, uh,

34
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.060
found out that two adults can eat a large bull moose in three months.

35
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.200
If that's all you got to eat,

36
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.650
I've eaten by myself of a large bull moose in six months.

37
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.893
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.430
<v 2>For people that don't know a large bull moose is about 2000 pounds.</v>

39
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.610
<v 0>I don't think they're quite that big with it. Probably 1500 pounds.</v>

40
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.150
You probably get 500 pounds.

41
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.810
<v 2>The Yukon moose is like 2000 pounds.</v>

42
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.640
<v 1>People, people exaggerate.</v>

43
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.980
<v 3>They exaggerated a lot of things, Joe. So, but I've heard some like a 60.</v>

44
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.840
<v 2>Inch bull. How much, how much has that other guy.</v>

45
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.160
<v 3>Against something like that? What that bowl was? It was about 60 inch. Oh,</v>

46
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.080
that one was actually 57.

47
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.930
<v 0>If I remember, I don't pay too much attention to the exact measurements, but.</v>

48
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.170
<v 2>I think when the range of 1500 pounds, which is like, what,</v>

49
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:44.000
how many pounds of meat you think that is?

50
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.120
<v 0>Uh, I would guess that you probably are getting five, 600 pounds of meat.</v>

51
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.093
Are you.

52
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.610
<v 2>Um,</v>

53
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.590
taking the femurs and getting bone marrow out of them and doing all that jazz?

54
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.290
Yeah.

55
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.710
<v 0>Oh yeah. That's, that's really part of,</v>

56
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.790
of my diet when I'm living off an animal is, um,

57
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.890
I like variety and they analyze a ton of variety in it.

58
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.870
One caribou will give you so many different options in

59
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.810
terms of food. If you know how to utilize it, I've eaten everything.

60
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:18.070
I have a caribou except the poop.

61
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.570
Literally you can even eat part of the antlers when they're oh yeah.

62
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:24.550
In the spring, when they're growing, they're soft on the end,

63
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.680
it's like a pickle. You scan them,

64
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.100
you take the velvet off in the last inch or two. It's just,

65
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.540
it's got the consistency of a pickle.

66
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.880
<v 2>They're great. Rarely eat it raw. Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.860
<v 0>I eat a lot animals. Right? A lot of parts of it, caribou raw. But anyway,</v>

68
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:41.320
you get a lot of variety. Cause you eat all the Oregon's eat the eyes,

69
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.480
eat the brain, eat the liver, the brain.

70
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.540
<v 1>Spinal cord. Whoa. Like.</v>

71
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.030
<v 0>I said, I've eaten everything except the poop out of a care. But literally,</v>

72
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:50.590
I mean, you can, even the cartilage,

73
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.180
you can get all kinds of variety and it's nutritious. It's good for you. I mean,

74
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:57.970
I learned about all this from the old people that used to eat this way.

75
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.030
I went to, I would have been reluctant to eat certain things.

76
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:05.980
If I hadn't been educated by other people that you can do

77
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:08.530
this, I was talking to this nine year old woman in Fairbanks, you know?

78
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.950
And I asked her, so you eat the brains. Cause I'm thinking, you know,

79
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.670
mad cow disease. Freons she's like, oh yeah, the brains are great.

80
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:16.780
And then I did a little research.

81
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:19.900
They've never found prion disease in Alaska in any of the animals up there.

82
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.610
So I was like, okay. I started in the brain.

83
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.760
<v 2>That's an issue. That's happening more and more, uh, here in the lower 48,</v>

84
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.100
you're getting a lot of CWD, which is another prion disease. Very scary stuff.

85
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.160
You know, it's a,

86
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.780
there's parts of Wisconsin where my friend Doug during lives where, you know,

87
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.640
50% of the deer, they,

88
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.600
they test test positive for CWD. Yeah.

89
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.920
Which is a real fatal disease. And it hasn't made the jump to humans yet,

90
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.690
but they're very concerned.

91
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.850
<v 0>And you know, this is, um, coming from the deer,</v>

92
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.370
like you said, there's a lot of deer and where deer and moose live together,

93
00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:59.430
the moose get it. We don't have any deer. So other than moose and caribou,

94
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:04.200
that's why we don't have the prebiotic disease, no deer up there at all. Well,

95
00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:06.540
most are a deer caribou or deer,

96
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:09.420
but we don't have anything other than most than black tail,

97
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.690
which those are much further south down to Southeast Alaska.

98
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.020
I don't know their exact range, but nowhere near where I am. That's interesting.

99
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.280
It's too harsh of a country. It doesn't not the right habitat.

100
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.630
<v 2>Wow. So you,</v>

101
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.000
when you take this caribou away from the Wolf, how does that go down?

102
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.860
<v 0>What happened that day was a thanks for, remind me, I've forgotten that story.</v>

103
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.600
That's what we were talking about. Uh, I had a trail up the mountain.

104
00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:42.630
There's a lot of snow in the winter, you know, two, three feet of snow.

105
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.170
So you gotta have pack trails to walk efficiently, pack them down,

106
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:48.390
snow shoes and stuff, and pretty much follow the same routes.

107
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm following my trail to go up the mountain, looking for food that day.

108
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:53.160
And I came on there, there were no caribou around.

109
00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:54.780
I couldn't find a caribou anywhere.

110
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.720
I didn't see caribou track for like months they're migratory.

111
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.460
And if they happen to migrate 10 miles away, I'm not going to see them.

112
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.110
That's out of my range.

113
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.320
I come on a track of one caribou. It's wounded, it's bleeding,

114
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:15.650
it's being chased by one Wolf and it crosses my trail.

115
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.660
So I start chasing. It was real fresh. It was snowing out. And I could tell it,

116
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:22.940
this is just happened. This injured caribou,

117
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:25.970
this Wolf is chasing it up this mountain. That right ahead of me,

118
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:29.980
I got to follow this. So you have a rival. Yeah. Yeah. My rifled,

119
00:06:29.981 --> 00:06:31.310
my constant companion. I mean

120
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.280
like that rifle goes just about everywhere I go up there. So, uh,

121
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.050
I start just jogging up the mountain as fast so I can go it's 5,000 foot

122
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:46.280
mountain. And this, this caribou is wounded pretty.

123
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.520
Bailey's bleeding almost continuously, you know?

124
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.370
And it's clear to me that if he doesn't make it over the top

125
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:58.940
of that mountain, this Wolf's going to get him. I mean,

126
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.280
going down the other side, I don't know.

127
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.010
But this Wolf has a good chance of getting this caribou.

128
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.220
This is usually the way they ha they injure them and it takes time.

129
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.410
It's not like they just run up and knock them down, you know,

130
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.820
usually hamstring them. Right? Yeah. They they'll jump on their back.

131
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:17.780
They'll they? Um, I see a lot of them injured on the,

132
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.600
the big muscle right here on the back legs. That what you mean?

133
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:23.120
The hamstring that right in here. Yeah. Yeah. They'll get them in there.

134
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.450
You find a lot of caribou injured, real bad that get away.

135
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.050
They get away with big pieces of hide, ripped off of 'em.

136
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.710
I killed a caribou once that only had two good legs.

137
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.280
It couldn't even walk anymore. Wow. But anyway, uh,

138
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.550
I start chasing them up the hill to kind of zigzagging up the hill.

139
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.680
And this caribou obviously doesn't know this mountain.

140
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.930
It doesn't know where it's going.

141
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.580
It heads in a direction where there's some cliffs on the other side of this

142
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:54.560
Ridge and I'm getting real hopeful at this

143
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:56.030
point. And uh,

144
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.980
I still haven't seen them there they're ahead of me on the mountain and sure

145
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:03.290
enough, the tracks come right up to the edge of the cliff,

146
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:07.250
both the caribou and the Wolf and go right over the top of the cliff.

147
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:09.980
And I'm like, there's no way that caribou survived getting down.

148
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.210
Cause I know this mountain, like the back of my hand and uh,

149
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.400
I just sat down there and I listened and I sat there at top of the cliff

150
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.970
and sure enough, it's real quiet out there in the winter. The Arctic.

151
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.820
<v 1>Is just like dead silent. And I start hearing.</v>

152
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.040
<v 0>The crunching in the snow of this Wolf and he's down in the ravine and he knows</v>

153
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:34.250
I'm up there. He can sense that I'm up there at the top of the cliff.

154
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.400
And he wants to, to bug out of there at that point.

155
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:39.380
And he just walked up the other side of the ravine.

156
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.230
I'm looking across the ravine and I see the Wolf going up and I know, Hey,

157
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:46.000
that curb was down in that ravine somewhere. So he's just getting away from you.

158
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:46.923
Yeah.

159
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.020
<v 2>Did they already know you by then? Because you,</v>

160
00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:53.560
you had shot quite a few wolves, right? You.

161
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.550
<v 0>Had trapped a few. I shot a, not tons, but we.</v>

162
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.420
<v 2>Shot a few on the show that one time on the lake where it's frozen and.</v>

163
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.680
<v 0>Yeah, th I didn't have a care man with me.</v>

164
00:09:03.681 --> 00:09:06.170
That was actually that story was told on the show.

165
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:07.910
And I documented it a little bit,

166
00:09:07.911 --> 00:09:11.450
as much as I could with my little camera at the time. Um,

167
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:16.040
that day I shot three walls, but that was a very unusual situation. That was,

168
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.300
those worlds were actually trying to get me, which is almost unheard of. Um,

169
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.050
but this was years before that this Wolf and like almost every other Wolf

170
00:09:24.051 --> 00:09:27.050
encounter I've ever had. Every other Wolf encounter I've ever had.

171
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.660
The Wolf wants nothing to do with you. I mean,

172
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.990
the Wolf knows I'm dangerous and.

173
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.730
<v 2>Well, do they know you're dangerous?</v>

174
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.990
Are they having any interactions with other humans wolves?

175
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.290
<v 0>No. This all across north America,</v>

176
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.270
I've only been able to find two documented bone of fighty

177
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.190
cases where wolves have killed humans in north American, recent times.

178
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.490
There was this one guy, young guy up in Saskatchewan several years ago.

179
00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.160
There was one woman in Alaska apparently was killed by wills.

180
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.830
It almost never happens. Um,

181
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.570
they just know that people are dangerous to have been persecuted. I mean,

182
00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:09.980
there were bounties on walls. I think it's in their DNA now, you know.

183
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.850
<v 1>All wild animals, grizzly bears, they.</v>

184
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.610
<v 0>Don't want anything to do with people 99.9% of the time.</v>

185
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.300
<v 2>It's interesting you saying that grizzly bears where they're hunted don't want</v>

186
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.360
to have anything to do with people, right.

187
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.190
They're having a real problem with grizzly bears in places like Montana,

188
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.400
where they don't hunt them. Right. Where they don't have any fear. Many,

189
00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:31.490
many generations have no fear of human beings.

190
00:10:31.491 --> 00:10:33.290
And you're getting a lot of Mallinckrodt.

191
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.070
<v 0>Yeah. I wouldn't be crazy about walking out in a national park where you're not</v>

192
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:37.904
allowed to bring a gun.

193
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.990
<v 2>Well, my Montana in particular there's they have a lot.</v>

194
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.140
<v 0>But in this case, the Wolf wanted out of there, it walked up.</v>

195
00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:47.240
The other side of the ravine. I watched it, it was about three,

196
00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:51.050
400 yards from me when he got up to the top of the Ridge, he stopped way,

197
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:52.040
way up, high above.

198
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.450
I remember looking at him through binoculars or maybe it was the scope of my

199
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:58.070
rifle. I just remember him giving a yacht.

200
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.310
He laid down on the ground when he knew he was safe, way up there.

201
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:04.310
And he just gave a yawn and I could see his tongue. It was just like a dog.

202
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.020
I could see him give this yawn.

203
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.780
Like he had just climbed up this big mountain in about 10 minutes, you know?

204
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.460
So I just walked around. The cliff, went down in there, got that caribou.

205
00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:17.750
I actually made a backpack out of his rib cage carry at home. And, uh,

206
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.680
it was called, it was like 25 below. It was, that was pretty brutal.

207
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.650
Getting that thing back to the camp from up on the mountain there.

208
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:29.720
How heavy was it? Oh, I don't know a lot of things. I don't way,

209
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:33.950
but I'd say a caribou like that probably weighs about 250 pounds.

210
00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:35.120
Something like that. You know,

211
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.110
I obviously don't take all of that weight at one time with me.

212
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.820
I've carried as much as I can. Did you.

213
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.000
<v 2>Have a backpack that like a pack frame? I had a frame.</v>

214
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.650
<v 0>And I just stuffed everything in the room.</v>

215
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.160
I remember it was so cold and I was so tired up there running up this mountain.

216
00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:53.470
The, when it's dark, it's dark up Delta. There's no sun in the winter. Um,

217
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.550
I just remember getting the head off that thing,

218
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.740
throwing the legs and stuff in the,

219
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.630
in the rib cage and throwing it onto that frame I had,

220
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.620
and it was all inside of the big rib cage.

221
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:07.120
Still had the skin on it and everything.

222
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.630
It was the Wolf watching the whole time he was up on top of the Mount. I didn't,

223
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.550
I wasn't paying close attention to him after that.

224
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:13.990
And how long he hung out up there.

225
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.890
<v 2>I would think that you would want to keep an eye on that.</v>

226
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.100
<v 3>He knows you're stealing.</v>

227
00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:21.990
<v 4>Other times it wolves.</v>

228
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.830
<v 1>I spent lot, a lot of times around on the walls. There's a lot of times when.</v>

229
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.670
<v 0>The snow conditions are just right, you can actually keep up with walls.</v>

230
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.270
Believe it or not. I've stayed with wolves all day long,

231
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.670
going eight or 10 miles. When the snow is deep enough,

232
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.360
they start walking single file in every Wolf, in the pack,

233
00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:42.630
steps in exactly the same track and their stride.

234
00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:46.080
When they slow down to a walk like that is just right for me.

235
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.200
I can step right in their tracks. I don't even need snowshoes. Wow.

236
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.230
If there's less snow, you can't, you can't keep up with a Wolf. You know, they,

237
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.190
their normal gate they're trotting. You can't even come close to that speed.

238
00:12:56.191 --> 00:12:59.820
But when the snow gets deep and they get single file, if you're in good shape,

239
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.170
you can jog behind walls all day long. And I followed walls,

240
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:06.840
I followed a pack of 12 walls. One time, eight or 10 miles.

241
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.270
They were hunting caribou right in front of me. Um,

242
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.110
there was another time I remember taking caribou meat away from a pack of

243
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:16.050
wolves, which I didn't even see they'd killed the caribou, but you know,

244
00:13:16.051 --> 00:13:17.580
there's a lot of brush and different stuff around.

245
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.190
I discovered it because Ravens flew up off it.

246
00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:22.290
I went over there and judging by the tracks.

247
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.140
There are half a dozen walls around. I took that caribou that time,

248
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.180
brought it home and ate it. Um,

249
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.170
but I had a lot of interactions over the years with the wolves and I never had

250
00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:34.320
wolves act aggressive to me. I've had a Mac curious,

251
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.430
I've had a Mac scared. I've had them act in different.

252
00:13:38.431 --> 00:13:43.320
I never had wolves act aggressive to me until that time. January, 2012,

253
00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:46.290
when a pack of 20 wolves literally took after me out on the lake.

254
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.480
And I did shoot three of those wolves.

255
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.390
<v 2>What was that about? Why do you think they were taken after you?</v>

256
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.810
<v 0>Um, it was a very unusual situation. First of all,</v>

257
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.290
there were 20 walls in one place that's unheard of up there.

258
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.180
That's totally unheard of the largest pack of wolves I've ever

259
00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:04.410
heard account of that far.

260
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:08.760
North was 17 walls and that was back in the 1970s.

261
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.750
And usually there's five, six wolves in a pack up there. It's real hungry.

262
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.120
Country's hard for them to feed themselves at the pack gets bigger than that.

263
00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:17.760
They have to split up, go somewhere new. But, um,

264
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.930
I don't know what happened that year. I don't know if two packs combined,

265
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.680
I don't know if the pack just grew to that size, but it was unheard of. Anyway,

266
00:14:25.681 --> 00:14:29.250
I'm up on a mountain. I looked down at the lake. It's in January.

267
00:14:29.251 --> 00:14:30.810
It's just Twilight in the middle of the day.

268
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.320
I see this big brown spot on the ice. I'm like, what the hell is that?

269
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.970
It's like out in front of my cabin, about 500 yards, big brown spot. First.

270
00:14:38.971 --> 00:14:41.850
I thought it was water overflow that comes up through the ice.

271
00:14:41.851 --> 00:14:43.140
Sometimes when you get a crack,

272
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.000
get out the binoculars I'm looking and holy cow,

273
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.220
that's a giant pack of wolves that just took something on the lake.

274
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.010
I can see like one of those breaking off,

275
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.590
one of them's breaking off and then coming back over and I,

276
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.400
I realize what's going on there. There was very little snow that year,

277
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.570
even though it was January,

278
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.600
it had been cold since September by the very low precipitation,

279
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.210
there was only about maybe four or five inches of snow.

280
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:09.800
So I could literally run down the mountain.

281
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.630
I was down at the lake within 20 minutes and I went right to my

282
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.130
cabin and got my camera. I got my tripod. I'm like, this is phenomenal.

283
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:20.600
I got to document this.

284
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.500
And I start walking across the lake out to where they are to get pictures of

285
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:28.100
this. So I get about 350 yards from these walls.

286
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:32.390
I still don't know what the animal is that they got there. And you know,

287
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:36.230
I can hear him. You can hear bones break in his stuff, the walls, you know,

288
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:37.580
it's just amazing. Yeah.

289
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.170
And I start taking pictures and I run out of batteries.

290
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.900
<v 1>I'm like, oh. I ran out of batteries.</v>

291
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.490
<v 0>So I got to go back to the cabin. That's like 150 yards behind me, you know?</v>

292
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.560
And, um, I turned around,

293
00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:55.700
I started walking back to the cabin when I get about 30 yards or so from the

294
00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:56.390
cabin,

295
00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.260
I look back over my shoulder and the whole pack of wolves is racing across the

296
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:03.860
lake straight toward me. I'd never seen anything like it.

297
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.920
I sprinted like Jesse Owens through the door, that cabin,

298
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:09.620
I was only 30 yards from it. I turned it,

299
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.860
I looked back out the window and these wolves came right up into my yard.

300
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:17.540
They were 50 yards from the front door, 20 wolves. Whoa. Yeah.

301
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.650
Like this is unheard of bowls are usually high tail and out of there when they,

302
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.890
so, uh, I get my new batteries.

303
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.320
I get the camera set back up.

304
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.530
I go back out by the time I get back out in the yard,

305
00:16:32.531 --> 00:16:35.650
they're back over at this thing. They've killed like 500 yards away.

306
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.800
And I want to get more pictures of this. I got my rifle too. Of course.

307
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.760
So I start heading back over when I get about 350 yards and them,

308
00:16:42.761 --> 00:16:45.760
I start taking more pictures. I got a great picture. You can pull it up.

309
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:50.080
Maybe I'm going to see that it's in the notes section on my Facebook pages,

310
00:16:50.081 --> 00:16:54.520
a story and unusual occurrence with the wolves. Anyway, they're all eaten.

311
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.980
And I start taking pictures again.

312
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.690
And after I take some pictures,

313
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.790
first one and two, then three, the walls. They they're like, I can see,

314
00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:09.460
they stop eating. And they're looking at Villa 350 yards away,

315
00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:12.940
but I can just see that they notice that I'm back out there on the lake and

316
00:17:12.941 --> 00:17:14.530
they're sizing me up kind of.

317
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.290
And then I see some of them are just really slowly moving toward me,

318
00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:20.710
like walking a few steps and stop. And I'm thinking, Hm, yeah,

319
00:17:20.711 --> 00:17:23.290
I got my rifle and everything, but there's a lot of wolves there.

320
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.310
How do I know they're going to stop when I start shooting? You know?

321
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:31.780
So I decided to maybe it's best just make a slow retreat.

322
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:37.030
And I started backing up and walking back toward the cabin and

323
00:17:37.031 --> 00:17:37.660
the wolves.

324
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.350
It looked like they were slowly walking towards me as I'm walking toward the

325
00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:44.620
cabin. When I got about, if I remember right,

326
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.590
it was a hundred yards from the cabin.

327
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.280
Those wolves started galloping. They just,

328
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.860
all 20 wolves started galloping towards me. Oh.

329
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.040
<v 1>Christ. Oh, wow. Look at this picture. Yeah, those.</v>

330
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.280
<v 0>Wolves right there, they start galloping towards me.</v>

331
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.620
And I dropped that tripod right there. Where, where I was. And I, you know,

332
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.030
I was a hundred yards from the cabin.

333
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:13.920
They were 400 yards from me and I ran as fast as I could for the cabin because

334
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:17.760
I thought, Hey, if I start shooting, what if they don't stop the ones?

335
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.470
It's 20 Wells there. I got four or five rounds of if I had one in the chamber,

336
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:26.760
I had five rounds of ammunition there. Um, I ran for the Canon.

337
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.150
I go in the door and just like the time before they're right there in my front

338
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:33.270
yard, I look out in there, 50 yards away. They're all milling around 20 wills.

339
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.010
I'm like, Jesus Christ. This is amazing. I've never seen like this.

340
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.280
So, but I'm safe and sound in the cabin.

341
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.150
So I just collect my thoughts. I'm like, man,

342
00:18:44.151 --> 00:18:48.020
it's time to teach these walls a lesson. If I let those walls leave,

343
00:18:48.021 --> 00:18:52.460
now they're going to think I'm just food. I run away when they see me.

344
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.030
Right. That, I mean, I could be out there in the night in the dark,

345
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.820
not even know, wolves are around, get ambushed by him or something.

346
00:18:58.821 --> 00:19:01.250
So I had to shoot some of those walls.

347
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:07.010
So I loaded up gut made sure everything was perfectly right. You know, um,

348
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.760
put some extra ammunition in my pocket, checked everything out. Okay.

349
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.490
I'm set to go out there with this gun and,

350
00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.520
and talk to these walls about this situation. And, uh,

351
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.840
I go back out and they were back at the moose. It,

352
00:19:19.841 --> 00:19:21.260
it turned out to be a moose they'd killed.

353
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.250
They were back over there at the kill. So I thought, well,

354
00:19:25.251 --> 00:19:28.850
it'd be a lot safer if I shot from close to the cabin, you know,

355
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.280
rather than go out there on the open ice.

356
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.680
So I'll just see if I can log them back over here.

357
00:19:33.681 --> 00:19:36.350
And I started running back and forth right in front of my cabin on the,

358
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.810
on the ice just to get their attention. And sure enough,

359
00:19:38.811 --> 00:19:43.760
it worked that whole pack of 20 wolves started racing across that lake at a full

360
00:19:43.761 --> 00:19:45.650
Gallop straight toward me. I couldn't believe it.

361
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.360
I was right in front of my cabin.

362
00:19:47.361 --> 00:19:50.810
I just run back and forth like 50 yards out to my little waterhole in the ice

363
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.230
and back to the cabinet a few times. And they just started running right at me.

364
00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.070
So I sat right down there on the bank, on the shore, right. You know,

365
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.490
15 feet in front of my porch and started shooting.

366
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.970
I think if I remember the first one I hit was 264 yards.

367
00:20:04.971 --> 00:20:07.100
I measured it all off the next day. It was kind of interesting.

368
00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:10.250
Just checking out the tracks and seeing what had happened. I hit three of them.

369
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:12.643
Yeah.

370
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.020
<v 2>What happened when one got hit?</v>

371
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:20.420
<v 0>Um, they stopped at the closest tracks to me were about 40 yards.</v>

372
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:21.733
You know.

373
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:26.420
<v 4>When it was happening, it was, it was happening so fast.</v>

374
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:31.340
I was just sitting down, you know, braced shooting. I remember reloading.

375
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:36.050
<v 0>After I shot five times, it all happened so fast. But then the next day,</v>

376
00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:38.570
when I had time, I went out there and looked all tracks and measured.

377
00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:41.750
Everything is size up situation figured out where I'd hit different wolves and

378
00:20:41.751 --> 00:20:43.250
stuff. And I wrote that all down.

379
00:20:43.251 --> 00:20:47.090
That's what I was mentioning in the note section on my Facebook pays that story

380
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.590
I wanted when it was fresh in my mind to really have the details.

381
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.490
Cause I knew right then that something happened to me that doesn't really happen

382
00:20:54.491 --> 00:20:58.610
to people. I mean, to get, have a pack of wolves come after you is, uh.

383
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.180
<v 3>A very unusual occurred. You can read, you can read all over the place.</v>

384
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.750
<v 0>That wolves don't attack humans. You know, I've, I've read that many times.</v>

385
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:12.220
<v 1>But they have, they have, uh, at least historically,</v>

386
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.860
historically the whole.

387
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.240
<v 2>Little red riding hood.</v>

388
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:20.130
That's all because they were trying to warn children about wolves. Now,

389
00:21:20.131 --> 00:21:24.990
when you found these wolves and you like how,

390
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.920
when you start shooting and you hit one, did the other ones freak out?

391
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.090
Did they realize what's going on.

392
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.710
<v 0>The summer? They started putting on the brakes. But like I said,</v>

393
00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:39.600
the first Wolf I hit was over 250 yards and it was 264 yards.

394
00:21:39.601 --> 00:21:44.220
Something like that from me. And some of the tracks came about 40,

395
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.800
40 to 50 yards from me before they had stopped.

396
00:21:46.801 --> 00:21:49.830
They were doing U-turn you could see in front of, they were all just.

397
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.390
<v 4>Milling around when I was reloading.</v>

398
00:21:51.391 --> 00:21:53.640
I just remember seeing all these wolves milling around.

399
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.430
<v 0>In front of me, like running around in circles. And I was like, holy cow.</v>

400
00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.373
And I'm reloading.

401
00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.600
And I remember shooting one more time as they were headed away,

402
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.750
but they all took off. They headed into the woods.

403
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.220
And one of the walls that I had hit was peril, paraplegic,

404
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:13.890
but he was still going on two legs. So I ran in him. Yeah. I ran in the cat,

405
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.720
the other, the other two had just dropped immediately.

406
00:22:15.721 --> 00:22:17.100
One of them is hit right in the head, but I ran in the,

407
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.100
and grabbed my 22 because I didn't want to put a big 30 out six hole in this.

408
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.690
This Walter was paraplegic. And um, I chased him down,

409
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.140
caught up with him, Sharma 22. Then I could hear all the other wolves, howl and,

410
00:22:30.141 --> 00:22:31.470
and howl. And they're like, you know,

411
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.980
probably almost half mile away from me by then they were up in the woods on the

412
00:22:34.981 --> 00:22:39.060
other side of the lake. And I just ran her. I ran over to that, uh,

413
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.920
what they had killed. And this was the first time I saw it.

414
00:22:40.921 --> 00:22:44.730
It was a year and a half old bull moose. And it was still all there.

415
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.010
The legs were still on it. I got pictures of it and stuff.

416
00:22:47.011 --> 00:22:47.970
They had just started eating it.

417
00:22:47.971 --> 00:22:51.210
Not long before I started photographics was on your Facebook page. Um,

418
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.940
none of that moose, they put those on LBZ.

419
00:22:53.941 --> 00:22:58.080
I think what's LBZ life-long zero. Oh,

420
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.180
when they showed that story, that was way back. You know,

421
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.280
that's like six years ago. That was one of my first stories.

422
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:08.250
That's a different moose. Okay. Charged by one, one out there. So.

423
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.310
<v 2>So when you find the wolves that you did shoot and you know,</v>

424
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:15.270
you've, you shot and killed.

425
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.010
<v 1>Three of them. Yeah. Do you eat them?</v>

426
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.010
<v 0>You know, I ate some of those just cause I was low on food.</v>

427
00:23:20.011 --> 00:23:22.980
I don't like to eat Wolf meat. If I can help it.
