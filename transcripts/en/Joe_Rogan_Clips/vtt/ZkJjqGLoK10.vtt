00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.120
<v 2>My own point of view with all, with, with thinking that that, you know,</v>

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.600
extravagant is, is that I, I think I'm a complete soy.

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.240
I think everything around me is some sort of holographic thing that I'm dropped

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.120
into for the duration of my life. And when I die, it all disappears. Really?

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.190
Yeah. I kind of do things I think, I think it's, um,

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.310
I also think that there's, there's, uh, everything that is going to happen

8
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.430
has already happened and there's a paradox where free will also exists.

9
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.870
So I think that, I think I have the ability to go around and act with free will.

10
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.020
I don't think that things are completely determined. Um,

11
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.580
but I think the free will is informed by the biological programming we were

12
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:48.260
talking about before mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Um,

13
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:51.740
but I'm still choosing within a given set of what I'm allowed to choose from.

14
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.100
<v 1>Um, but the paradox is also that I think that by, you know,</v>

15
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.580
I'm probably on my death bed.

16
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.170
If you collapse time down and look at it as like a linear, you know, a thing,

17
00:01:02.171 --> 00:01:05.490
if you just, if you just observe it, it's like Neil's death is here.

18
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.490
His birth is here. These are these other events, theoretically with free will,

19
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.530
as you move through that three dimensional map,

20
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.490
these other events should change right. Each day with choices,

21
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.330
you make all of these other outcomes should move.

22
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.970
And somehow I don't think they do.

23
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.800
I think that they're kind of locked in place and NCHE speaks about that.

24
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:27.800
He calls it eternal recurrence and it's like eternal recurrence was something

25
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:31.040
that I got, I got quite interested in because it felt true to me.

26
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.600
<v 0>Uh, and it, how so? How so felt true?</v>

27
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.440
<v 1>Well, he says, he says that he says that what,</v>

28
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.640
what happens is that your life is set and all of the events within your life

29
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.870
not only are set, but they will also recur infinitely through time. So, um,

30
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:50.270
instead of the idea of reincarnation, it's almost like the,

31
00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:53.390
the idea of reincarnation into your own life internally.

32
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.390
And so someone else from a different point of view would be able to see the,

33
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:02.230
this event of like Joe Rogan's life and see you make these

34
00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:05.020
choices, they would see you begin and make these choices again.

35
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.980
And he kind of used it as a thought experiment where he said, he said that if I,

36
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.060
if I went to most people out in the world,

37
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.980
and I said to them that your life is gonna repeat exactly like this forever,

38
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.940
he said it was a burden that would be too heavy for most people to be able to

39
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.460
deal with &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. That their life,

40
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.530
that they don't wanna live their life over the way that they've lived it enough,

41
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:30.330
that, that it would be literally the worst burden that they could be given.

42
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.450
<v 0>I've I've pondered this before. And I've heard this brought up before, in fact,</v>

43
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.410
Ilio Gracie is a famous Brazilian jujitsu guy who was a

44
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.593
he's the,

45
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.200
he's a patriarch of like the greatest martial arts Klan ever. Yeah.

46
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.080
He believed that he believed you will live your life over and over again until

47
00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:51.914
you get it right.

48
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.000
<v 1>Yeah. NCHE is saying that you, you don't get the chance to do it. Right.</v>

49
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.040
It's locked in place.

50
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.480
<v 0>It's locked in place ex exactly the same way forever. Yeah.</v>

51
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.480
But why, why would he believe that? Because he can change,

52
00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:08.320
but if you believe in free will, that's the paradox. Yeah. So if you.

53
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.840
<v 1>Believe, I think you make the same choices over and over, but why,</v>

54
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.640
but cuz you're not learning each time you go back. You're not,

55
00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:14.880
it's not a different version of you.

56
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.870
<v 0>It's the same version of you, but why, why haven't you learned from the past.</v>

57
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.110
<v 1>Because you, it, to us, we are the birth and the death is one event.</v>

58
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.050
<v 0>Mm.</v>

59
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.950
But if you are having the same life experience over and

60
00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:33.310
over and over again, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what is you,

61
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.270
if that's you having the same?

62
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.140
Is it new versions of you or is it you? No,

63
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.460
it's just one person. You it's just yeah. Why don't you learn.

64
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.180
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; well, well what, what he &lt;laugh&gt; because from, from a,</v>

65
00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:51.820
from a three dimensional standpoint, in, in that linear timeline, when you die,

66
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.980
you, that feels like the end of the play from,

67
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.540
from a fourth dimensional different observational standpoint,

68
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.170
you can watch it repeating. Yeah. But his point was,

69
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.090
was with free will inside of that linear timeline,

70
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.090
you should live your life in a way that the, that,

71
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
that you would want it to go on forever. It was sort of a thought experiment.

72
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.330
Yeah. But what, what I was getting at was the feeling that, to me,

73
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:15.810
it feels like things are said in place. And because this comes from the,

74
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.640
the so cystic thing that we were talking about where I think that it's,

75
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.520
it's all in the, the person it's in the observer's eyes. Right.

76
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.800
And by the, and I also think time is an illusion as well.

77
00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:29.720
So by the time you get to the end of your life and you're,

78
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:33.280
you're lying on your death bad, um, you, you,

79
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.320
all of these events could have been a dream. It could just be a fever dream,

80
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.440
you know? Um, so they, they weren't cuz you free will exist in,

81
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.470
you acted on them. But time compresses down to this moment. And, and,

82
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.270
and that's the only thing that's there is this sort of this present moment that

83
00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:48.104
you're living inside of.

84
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.350
<v 0>But it's being committed to this idea that all these things are playing out.</v>

85
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.790
Is that comforting? Is that why you're willing to embrace it that way?

86
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.750
That there's no getting around this and that this is what.

87
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.420
<v 1>It is? No, I mean, I don't, I don't act like I don't have free will and, and I,</v>

88
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.500
I don't act like things are set in place. I just on a very, very deep,

89
00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:09.340
subconscious level. I feel like they are. I, I.

90
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.180
<v 0>So you feel like fate is real in some ways.</v>

91
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.420
<v 1>In some, in some ways it is. Yeah. I do think there's a paradox though.</v>

92
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.980
I think there's a definite paradox. Do.

93
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.900
<v 0>You think about that when you're making films, do you think,</v>

94
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.090
do you think like as cuz the,

95
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:26.210
the creative process of writing and then I'm sure I've,

96
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:27.090
I've never edited a film,

97
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:30.250
but I would imagine editing and filming it and choosing the angles.

98
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.230
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

99
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.050
you're visualizing this creation and you're putting it together and then

100
00:05:36.051 --> 00:05:38.610
ultimately you get a final product and yeah. That's what people go to.

101
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.170
It's it's.

102
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.690
<v 1>Similar to people's lives. I mean, you could say right. It, it,</v>

103
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.960
the try choices that you're making, cause there's infinite possible.

104
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.760
There's infinite possible outcomes. Right. And you're collapsing that down.

105
00:05:47.761 --> 00:05:51.560
You're collapsing the wave, the wave function into one outcome. Mm.

106
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.160
And so that's what I think is happening.

107
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.360
I think that we are given infinite numbers of options and we have the ability to

108
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.360
act on, on those. We choose a path and in, in the action of choosing,

109
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.680
we collapse all possibility to one outcome and the tree is crushed down.
