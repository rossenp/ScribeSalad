00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 2>He doesn't look happy. Wow.</v>

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.580
<v 0>Living in 1901.</v>

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.060
<v 1>Yeah. Average life expected. He's 40 years old. Average likes to say,</v>

5
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.510
say like 44, 45, really at that time. I mean,

6
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.940
but if you make it past childbirth, of course you, you have a better,

7
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:18.060
much better chance of surviving. But, but anyway, he,

8
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.860
he does name his company after his wife.

9
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.830
What's interesting is you wonder whether that was like,

10
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.300
whether she'd be happy about that attracted becomes this hated name in so many

11
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:29.640
ways, years later, but he's scrapping by.

12
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.640
He actually had tried to start a chemical industry in the late 19th century.

13
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:36.420
It had burned down and he didn't have any money. He's got these kids,

14
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.180
he's got this family. So like, to your point, I'm kind of,

15
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:43.290
when I'm reading this, I'm trying to understand how is this company starting?

16
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:47.610
What's the human story here? How do we get into this mess, you know, money.

17
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.780
And then, you know, we do, when you get, as you said to the fifties and sixties,

18
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.020
these agricultural chemicals become a huge part of their business,

19
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.300
but kind of back to Roundup 70, okay.

20
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.840
2, 4, 5 T. Now, now the lids off, you know,

21
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.990
the government starting to find out about it. People raising alarms,

22
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:09.630
scientists are talking about how toxic this stuff is.

23
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.150
And you know, they're looking for an alternative,

24
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.090
something that's not as toxic as this stuff.

25
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.040
And that's when John Franz fines, uh, glyphosate, interestingly,

26
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.300
you know, all like the detergent, all, yes, that was a Monsanto product.

27
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.640
Of course it was. But it had,

28
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.530
it had a phosphate based ingredient in it that helped it clean

29
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.690
clothes. But in the sixties,

30
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.640
phosphate based detergents were ending up in waterways and contributing to like

31
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.190
fish, algae blooms and fish death. Yeah.

32
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.540
And so they had to get rid of that phosphate detergent and they had all this

33
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:53.220
phosphate and they're like, what do we do with all this phosphate, boom,

34
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.450
all detergent, you know,

35
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:58.350
and all that phosphate ends up becoming the building blocks of Roundup.

36
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.090
Roundup is ultimately coming from elemental phosphorus. Wow, it's crazy. And,

37
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.950
but it was all designed to be healthy.

38
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.270
<v 0>I know a guy who lived in a community that was, uh,</v>

39
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.950
connected to a golf course and he grew up drinking water from a well and

40
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:18.900
him and a large number of people in the community got cancer.

41
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.570
And they firmly believe that it was because of whatever

42
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:29.550
pesticides that they were using or herbicides that they were using on the golf

43
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:31.200
course, that it leaked into the Wells.

44
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.460
<v 1>Can I show you what Roundup looks like nowadays? Uh, Jamie, there's a,</v>

45
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:37.230
there's a map in there.

46
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:41.460
That's like a map of the country and it's kind of brown and it shows you

47
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.710
kind of Roundup. Um,

48
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.610
mostly it says glyphosate cause that's the active ingredient,

49
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.280
but I just want to show you the change that's happened in the last several years

50
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.430
of glyphosate. So like that's glyphosate,

51
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:57.090
this comes from the USDS pesticide national synthesis program. Um,

52
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.990
this is what happened with Roundup ready technology. Like we were,

53
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.680
this is 92. So remember I said, Roundup is created in the seventies,

54
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.180
but it's not really used that much, you know, throughout the growing.

55
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.040
<v 0>It's interesting how it's used so much in California. Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.440
Proudly application of it that that's,

57
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.960
that the weird farmland on the way up to San Francisco,

58
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:20.380
if you're driving from LA and you see, you know, like, Joe Biden signs,

59
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.243
that's where they are.

60
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.450
<v 1>Yep. That's also, you know, the land of like,</v>

61
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.700
like 90% of our almonds, like nine, you know, all of the salad,

62
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.290
everything comes from there and yeah. And so much pesticide use and that valley.

63
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.290
Wow. But look at the Midwest. I mean, it goes from like.

64
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.810
<v 0>No, almost none, almost very little to swarm swarm.</v>

65
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.120
<v 1>And that's because you've made crops that are now resistant to</v>

66
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.841
glyphosate.

67
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:54.280
So you can spray it as much as you need to kill your

68
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:57.760
weeds. But, um, and to me there's a,

69
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:00.220
that you had that weed resistance graph going up,

70
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.180
but a fifth grader can tell you, well, wow.

71
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.100
When you spray that much Roundup on something or glyphosate

72
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:13.450
on something, you're going to start seeing resistance adaptation.

73
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.430
Exactly. Like it's nature of fighting.

74
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.520
<v 0>Like what's happening with, um, antibiotics.</v>

75
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:19.900
Where are you seeing these like Murcia,

76
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.580
like these medication resistant staph infections that are insanely difficult to

77
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:25.414
treat.

78
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.220
<v 1>Yeah. Just like it, you know, in fact, some of the weed scientists I talked to,</v>

79
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.420
I'll be honest. The, when I first was going to talk at Ohio state that I said,

80
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.130
the weed scientists are talking, I thought, oh, I thought.

81
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.213
<v 0>Marijuana.</v>

82
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.200
<v 1>Shut up. I was like, oh, this is cool too.</v>

83
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.690
<v 0>I want to find out how to make the stronger.</v>

84
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.730
<v 1>So, but these weed scientists at Ohio state who are great and helped out with a</v>

85
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:52.390
book, um, fantastic folks, you know, some of those tribes, you know,

86
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.180
they're like glyphosate was like penicillin, man. It was, it was so powerful,

87
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:59.440
so effective at killing weeds and we burned through it because these weeds

88
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:01.960
became resistant to it. And so,

89
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.560
and that's where we're at now kind of going back to your point about, um,

90
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.940
chemicals and exposures,

91
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:11.740
like Roundup was introduced because it was seen as an environmentally

92
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.680
more friendly herbicide at the time and the seventh,

93
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.570
then agent orange and then yeah. Yeah.

94
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.910
You're comparing it against some pretty bad, uh it's like.

95
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.590
<v 0>Would you like to get punched or shoot you?</v>

96
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.200
<v 1>And you know, it had to do with, you know, the way it worked and,</v>

97
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:29.140
and the mechanisms there, but what's happening now because of that resistance.

98
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.540
And Jamie, I hate to bring it up again because it's actually kind of cool.

99
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:33.760
You get to see this this first time we put it together.

100
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.140
But when that weed resistance takes off, I think it's the next graph after that,

101
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.030
what happens is you take this out, okay, this is, this is what's happening.

102
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.400
I put this together with a friend of mine is data science.

103
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.260
<v 0>I try to remember that a lot of people are just listening. They're just,</v>

104
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.600
let's say.

105
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.060
<v 1>A huge percentage is fair enough. So I'll try and describe it.</v>

106
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:55.960
So what we're looking at is pounds of herbicide per acre of soybeans.

107
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.760
So this is just looking at soybeans as a case study.

108
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.960
And we're looking at the amount of herbicides it's being used on farms per acre

109
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.300
in the U S and specific states, just because they had data for this to,

110
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.860
for us to compare. And what we're seeing is this like explosion and Roundup,

111
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.330
glyphosate, that big dark line going up like that. And notice, look,

112
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.620
we,

113
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.840
we started seeing the decline and all these other herbicides that really toxic

114
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:26.750
stuff like chlorinated compounds and things like that.

115
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.130
They're going down and down and down, but check out weed resistance, 2004,

116
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.350
two thousand five thousand six, boom,

117
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.250
all those herbicides that were really toxic, including by the way,

118
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:39.140
the other half of agent orange two,

119
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:43.460
four D is now being used to try and beat back

120
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.820
Roundup resistant weeds. Wow.

121
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.640
And so last missed crazy.
