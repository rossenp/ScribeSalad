00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.360
<v 1>Uh, uh, as breaking news just today, Marineland had built this fence.</v>

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.920
Apely named Phil's fence around the park.

4
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.840
And just today we found out they blacked it all out with tarps because come, uh,

5
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.440
this Saturday, uh, May 18th, and certainly I'm inviting every,

6
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.830
everyone to come join me. Uh, I'll be joining as an, as a guest,

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.990
uh, a big demonstration outside of Marineland and we're gonna protest it, uh,

8
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.430
as they're, and as they're anticipating,

9
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.990
because on account of my coming on this show,

10
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.230
they worked very hard to try to keep me from a coming B speaking of anything,

11
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.100
C certainly not promoting this event. So I certainly hope that this event is a,

12
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:46.860
is a, is a well attended. How do they try to do that? Well,

13
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:49.180
because we're in litigation. What happens at,

14
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.660
in litigation is you come to a point where you start to negotiate

15
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.180
and so's things that they want from me.

16
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.770
There's things they really want from me. They want my silence.

17
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.730
The problem is they're never gonna silence me.

18
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.610
It's not an option. I've said it before. I'll say it again.

19
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:15.490
They can offer me a million dollars to shut up, go away.

20
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.370
It's not gonna happen. I'm not gonna delete my Twitter.

21
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.800
I'm not gonna any of my tweets that have the word Marineland in them.

22
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.280
Is this a request? These, this is layers and layers,

23
00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:33.200
and there have been layers of requests. Basically.

24
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.160
They'd hope that I wouldn't come here.

25
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.080
They'd hope something could be worked out in our litigation. We have, uh,

26
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:41.520
so now I I've chased Marinelands.

27
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.030
So back when Marinelands all owner was still alive, uh,

28
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.190
I put forth a huge campaign to try to get him to be examined legally by my

29
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:51.910
lawyer, much like I've, uh, had to sort of submit myself to. Um,

30
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.830
but as these lawsuits and as,

31
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.790
as litigation continues to reveal itself as just the perfect method of abuse,

32
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.990
you know, that they're just the only result.

33
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.140
All of these things appear to serve is to exhaust

34
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.340
both parties and have them come together with a resolution.

35
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.700
So after six and a half years, uh, Marineland seems intent on a resolution.

36
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.220
They don't want to go to examinations. So while we were in,

37
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.810
so while I was there to be examined a couple weeks ago, my large said,

38
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:26.290
take a walk. And the two lawyers began their talks.

39
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.570
We put off the examination because we believed there could be some good faith

40
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.770
that could be shown between parties. Um,

41
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.810
it became quite evident that it was not the case.

42
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.650
And when we re were to resume our examinations,

43
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:44.520
which was to be last week Marine land on account to the fact that I was on this

44
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.200
show through an absolute tieade and said, we are not doing this now,

45
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:54.200
bear in mind, this is a court ordered examination date. I've got a, uh, a trial,

46
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.160
uh, coordinator who is trying to nudge this thing forward because I mean,

47
00:02:58.161 --> 00:02:58.801
that's something that's a,

48
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:02.040
that's a motion I had to win in the litigation itself is to try to get someone,

49
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.840
to look at this thing so that it could actually move forward.

50
00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:06.800
Like let's get someone to manage it. So we're, we're in case management.

51
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.120
So that case management judge has issued a very aggressive schedule.

52
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.600
It's in back in February, we had a court date of which thank you very much.

53
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.680
I won, uh, handed Lee. Marineland had to pick up, uh,

54
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.830
just a more than $12,000 of my legal bill,

55
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:25.310
which is really on this particular motion in this event, uh,

56
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.790
kind of a drop in the pan, but, um, nonetheless, a a, a,

57
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.830
a sound victory in court. Um, you know,

58
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.710
we have a case conference call next week. Now, I don't know where this,

59
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.620
because now Marineland has breached the court's order. So we went,

60
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.460
they didn't show up to the examination. I got, uh, a fourth, uh,

61
00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:50.060
what's called a, um, certificate of non-attendance.

62
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.180
It means the person that was supposed to be examined, that they didn't show up.

63
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.220
Uh, marineland's owner John Holder, who's now passed away. Uh,

64
00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:59.380
didn't show up to two of ex his examinations knowing full well that I'd have to

65
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:03.250
pick a up to 1700 bucks to co to just to be there, to get the certificate.

66
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.850
And he is just not gonna show up no big deal.

67
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.370
There doesn't seem to be any punitive damage at their end. They, they, I mean,

68
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:12.570
we're almost seven years into this thing and they're still like brutalizing me,

69
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.610
but we're at a point where they're actually in a very uncomfortable position of

70
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:18.730
having to keep this thing.

71
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.840
If you don't want this ation to be on the public record and transcripts and

72
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.960
evidence and everything you have to stop. It seems to me, the courts, uh,

73
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.560
appear to facilitate resolutions of that sort. They like settlements.

74
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.000
I was promised to trial on day one. It's what kept me going.

75
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.360
They're lying about me. They're lying about everything,

76
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.880
everything they're saying.

77
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.110
&lt;affirmative&gt; and they're trying to exhaust you financially. Well,

78
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:44.710
of course they are. I mean, that's so the,

79
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.270
the premises are you countersuing them as well?

80
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.790
I'm countersuing the premise of my countersuit is so that they couldn't merely

81
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.790
drop my, my, the lawsuit against me over a period of time.

82
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.150
And then that just be it. And that I would,

83
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.470
I would then have to actually file a motion to get some costs back.

84
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.990
I'd be lucky to get 50% and everything. Uh, in the,

85
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.580
the early days my lawyer said, let's Sue 'em back. And so we did,

86
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.860
I'm suing them for abuse of process. They're,

87
00:05:06.861 --> 00:05:10.420
they're using the court's time resources. Uh, they, I mean,

88
00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:13.700
even for that matter, we can extend that to the police and other, uh, you know,

89
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.140
uh, departments and organizations, uh, they're exhausting, uh, these things, uh,

90
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.090
in bad faith, they're doing it because they just want to try to, they basically,

91
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:24.650
they wanna take away my right to, uh, free expression,

92
00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:26.170
which is a Canadian chartered, right? I mean,

93
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.770
I'm protecting my own history here. I mean, this is Insa.

94
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.250
I can't even believe that after six and a half years,

95
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.770
I'm still here at risk of being silenced. That the fact that, uh, I mean,

96
00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:41.210
look full disclosure i'mowed money. The last time I was on this show, we raised,

97
00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:45.640
I mean, and again, thank you so much, 60, maybe almost 70,000.

98
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:49.400
That's in a year and a half. That's gone. I spent my last penny last month.

99
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.560
It was a very aggressive, last three months.

100
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.280
Do you have a GoFundMe? I have a GoFundMe. Uh, do you out the information? Yes,

101
00:05:57.281 --> 00:05:58.880
please. Um, what is it it's uh,

102
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:03.160
if you go to savesmoohi.com S a V E S M O O S H

103
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.680
i.com. You can go there. There's a small documentary. It's a little dated now,

104
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:09.920
but on account to the fact that legislation nothing's really moved forward in

105
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:12.000
the lawsuit and the legislation's only just wrapping up,

106
00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:15.680
it's still very current. So please spend the 14 minutes to sort of, uh,

107
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.230
appreciate the story more. I guess you'll get a better, uh, more context to it.

108
00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:24.830
There's, you know, some, some footage in there, some back, uh, backstage stuff,

109
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:27.550
some, you know, it, it tells the tale quite well. It's a, it's a,

110
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:28.670
it's a good piece. Yeah.

111
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.910
<v 2>Folks, if you're, if you're hearing this, please help it out. If you can.</v>

112
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.590
<v 1>You know, joy, just say it all the time.</v>

113
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.950
It's the thing I hate to do most is ask for help. I really makes me F.

114
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.940
<v 2>Well, your intentions are pure. You know, you really are, uh,</v>

115
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.820
a person who is going about this because you feel like you are uniquely

116
00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:50.140
qualified to talk about it. You have the actual information, you know,

117
00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:53.100
what's wrong. You, you, you know, and you are a part of the system,

118
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.260
you understand it better than anybody and the outside code.

119
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.210
<v 1>And they have my walru and they have your.</v>

120
00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.250
<v 2>WALS still.</v>

121
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.330
<v 1>We think. And so when, and so when in the litigation, my lawyer says,</v>

122
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.730
well, here's what marineland's prepared to offer. I say to my lawyer, well,

123
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:12.730
what about the walru? And he says to me, dude, we talked about this.

124
00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:15.250
This is crazy. You're not getting a Wallris. And

125
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.520
I said to Marine land, I don't want no money, not a penny.

126
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.600
I want the wallers. There's two left, uh,

127
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.440
three have died in the last it really in mere months, uh,

128
00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:33.040
secretly I find out what would you do with her? I mean,

129
00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:35.800
ideally what I would like is I just want her transferred at this point to

130
00:07:35.801 --> 00:07:38.440
another facility. I would love to see her transferred to the Vancouver court,

131
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.870
or there's a facfacility in quebecca as well. I just want be a POS.

132
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.910
I just want to possibly be in her life if she needs me, which we, I mean,

133
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.110
there's a reason she's one of two still alive. Would I, if I would ACC listen,

134
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.150
would you move to Vancouver? If suddenly Dan billsariaan gets on the horns?

135
00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:57.790
Just feel like at this? Uh, well, actually I, well, wait,

136
00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:00.940
there's a backstory to that too. You got some beef with him inadvertently,

137
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:03.660
but we we'll get back to that. But you know, if he were to, to suddenly say,

138
00:08:03.661 --> 00:08:06.940
Hey, I got this, uh, Arctic beachfront home and, uh, dude,

139
00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:09.660
I'll buy you a Wal yeah, I'll move. Absolutely. I mean,

140
00:08:09.661 --> 00:08:12.060
she's got another 10 years of her life. I do, you know,

141
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.900
there's only one way to Arctic.

142
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.580
<v 2>To be with this walrus, play the music.</v>

143
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.570
<v 1>Is there a better end to this, to this story? I really, it all sounds so crazy,</v>

144
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.490
Joe, but here's 66 and a half years ago. I was like, I want the WALS right.

145
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.410
Suddenly here I am negotiating for a walris call me crazy, but look at this.

146
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.450
<v 2>So are they willing to negotiate for the walris?</v>

147
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.050
Is this actually in consideration?

148
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.250
<v 1>Yes. Yes. Not without layers and layers and layers of compromise of, and,</v>

149
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:43.280
but bear in mind, not in the capacity that I see it more of a,

150
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.240
yeah, maybe, maybe we won't send her to China.

151
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.440
How's that maybe we'll send her somewhere and not deter that facility from, uh,

152
00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:53.760
you visiting. Maybe we could do that for you. That's what I mean.

153
00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:55.120
It's it's really bad faith negotiate.

154
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.080
The problem with the thing that I have a hard time dealing with is look,

155
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.360
we're in litigation in, you know, in,

156
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.320
in litigation you have to exercise a certain amount of decorum and it's not

157
00:09:05.321 --> 00:09:07.000
exactly my strong point. It's just not,

158
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.760
I find decorum to be just a thick layer of. I just do. Yeah.

159
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.670
You of hope that there's gonna be some type of good faith negotiation. I, I,

160
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:18.703
I want that

161
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.110
Marineland negotiates with additional hostilities and threats.

162
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.350
It's not worked for them in six and a half years.

163
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.150
What makes you think it's gonna work now? So here,

164
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.070
I think we're going down a path of possibly good, uh, good faith negotiations.

165
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.260
The, the owner, the, the villain of the story is he's outta the picture. Uh,

166
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.500
the, the new president who is the, the widow, the wife is a wonderful woman.

167
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.700
I mean, listen, if I,

168
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.460
I honestly and truly believe if the lawyer himself wasn't the controlling mind

169
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.340
of the business now tr uh, he got sort of facilitating this transfer of, of,

170
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.820
of the business as it was to just being sold off, pieced off and, and, you know,

171
00:09:54.821 --> 00:09:57.450
distribute the wealth to the, to the remaining family members.

172
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.970
I think that we could, I think this story ends on a good note. I mean,

173
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.010
I have no hostilities, you know,

174
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.050
I have every reason in the world to despise the man who sued me. And I don't,

175
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.250
I don't even think about him. It was never about that.

176
00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:11.330
They made every case in the world,

177
00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:15.250
every argument that this was personal between me and him and well that's cuz you

178
00:10:15.251 --> 00:10:18.720
look in the camera and I you to people it's personal between me and donplet you

179
00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:21.880
can bet your. That's a different story. &lt;laugh&gt; but you know what I'm saying?

180
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.320
Did I make 'em famous? Well, you &lt;laugh&gt; in a way maybe, maybe.

181
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.560
Um, so where do you stand right now? Well, I don't know.

182
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.000
So next week we're having a case management, uh,

183
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.310
the case manager's gonna tell and we're gonna see what becomes of Marinelands

184
00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:42.790
once again, skipped examination. It's so hard to believe this is still going on,

185
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.390
dude. Welcome to my words.

186
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.790
From the time you first came on the podcast to now this has been just this

187
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.070
scratch and claw every day of my life.

188
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.710
I live with this looming cloud of, uh,

189
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.740
threat of like there's people out there that really want me,

190
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.380
I'm not talking physical threat. Okay. They, they did, they played their games.

191
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.180
You know, I called every one of their Bluffs every,

192
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.420
at every corner of this thing. But you know,

193
00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:12.900
there's something about when you say they played their games? Well,

194
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:14.660
they sent goons to my house. Yeah. There's video.

195
00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:16.820
In fact that there's on that documentary. You'll see these,

196
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.130
they send some tough guys. I mean, they were sending people at 6:00 AM,

197
00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:22.890
harassing my girlfriend while she's taking the garbage out. I mean, it,

198
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:27.290
it really got pretty intense. Um, but we stood our ground. I was like,

199
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.650
this is not gonna go down like this. It's like, you're with the wrong guy, dude.

200
00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:33.410
Like, listen, I come from a place called well end Ontario.

201
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.850
I don't know that you're familiar with it.

202
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.290
I'm gonna assume not probably few people are,

203
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:40.480
unless you're an avid hockey fan because we have produced some pretty, uh,

204
00:11:40.481 --> 00:11:45.320
amazing, uh, NHL talent. But um, you know, this population of like 50,000,

205
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:50.720
I'm a wellender I don't know any other and I'm Frenchman. I mean,

206
00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:51.720
it's probably another thing to stress,

207
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:55.360
but I don't know any other way to deal with things other than sort of fight it

208
00:11:55.361 --> 00:11:59.640
out. You know, you don't COER and run you don't, you know, you stare the threat,

209
00:11:59.641 --> 00:12:01.280
especially when you're on the right side of things.

210
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.120
I'm not gonna sit there and take. I'm not gonna,

211
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:09.360
it's not gonna work for them to continuously try to threaten me because dude I'm

212
00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:10.920
invested and I'm not talking money.

213
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.110
I I'm mean a it's like a hostage situation. It's how it started.

214
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.830
My only interest is ending the hostage situation that not my only interest.

215
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.590
I shouldn't say that. Of course not. You know, I have interest in, in, in,

216
00:12:24.591 --> 00:12:27.470
you know, I've been advocating for the, for bills and OB obviously advocating,

217
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.670
uh, letting people know the, you know, sort of taking the veil off the, uh,

218
00:12:31.671 --> 00:12:33.260
that the industry produces feel.

219
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.180
<v 2>Like you're negotiating for a hostage in mooshhi.</v>

220
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.780
<v 1>They're they're using her as that type of chip.</v>

221
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.500
Yeah. That's their bar. That's their bargaining chip. That's what they got.

222
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.220
<v 2>And they're keeping this constant pressure on you. This constant financi.</v>

223
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.010
<v 1>Add pressure threats, uh, constant, like my lawyer, in fact,</v>

224
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:56.690
and this is where it gets kind of weird because listen, I don't understand.

225
00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.370
He's supposed to be representing me. The answer is no to everything, fight,

226
00:13:00.371 --> 00:13:03.370
fight, fight. I want a trial. He instead is coming with, listen,

227
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.250
this is not how litigation ends for, like,

228
00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:07.170
you don't seem to understand how this ends.

229
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.330
You don't have a grip of how lit litigation works. And I'm just like,

230
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.770
I'm glad that I don't, because my guess is I representative of what?

231
00:13:12.771 --> 00:13:16.000
90% of the population that don't know. And it's important that we find out,

232
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.360
I was promised a trial because they said, I was this, this, this, this, this,

233
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:21.440
well, let's get to that trial. This is what I've been doing.

234
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.640
This doesn't end with negotiations. I want the trial. Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.840
I don't understand like what, why would you Sue me unless you want the trial?

236
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.880
Oh, because it's a lawsuit. Well,

237
00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:32.720
then I want the trial because I need to show that I need that on my record.

238
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.670
I want that. I want the truth. They at the wrong guy. &lt;laugh&gt; I hate to say it.

239
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.110
I'm the, only of all the lawsuits they've launched and they launched in, in,

240
00:13:42.111 --> 00:13:44.350
you know, in excess of like 12 and threatened and,

241
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.430
and it's important to note I've been threatened and I'm constantly under threat

242
00:13:47.431 --> 00:13:52.310
of additional litigation. I'm the only one left. I'm the only lawsuit.

243
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:56.980
That's, I'm the only person who hasn't had to co as, uh, their free expression.

244
00:13:59.050 --> 00:13:59.740
It's.

245
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.580
<v 2>Uh, it's a dirty secret about the legal business, right?</v>

246
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:06.620
That this is a loophole. This is something people can do to people to silence.

247
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.220
'em just to drag them through hell for six years.

248
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.500
<v 1>Maybe 10, who knows how long this goes, 10. Right. Who know?</v>

249
00:14:12.501 --> 00:14:14.020
And this is a case managed. I mean,

250
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.650
I had to fight in court at great expenditure to get this case management.

251
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.130
<v 2>And if you put this up to the general public and have them look at what the</v>

252
00:14:22.131 --> 00:14:24.850
actual facts are and have them look at what these people,

253
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.210
what their business is, what they're actually doing,

254
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.490
it's game over it's game over. It's a real problem for them.

255
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.290
The real problem is it's an indefensible activity.

256
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:39.280
Having those animals in swimming pools for people's

257
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:40.200
enjoyment. Like.

258
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.920
<v 1>But to follow that up with trying to crush people. Oh yeah.</v>

259
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:47.680
Trying to crush my fiscal sovereignty. I mean, look, no, there's.

260
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.800
<v 2>Nothing good on their side for what they tried to do to you for what the</v>

261
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.080
business is. I about.

262
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.600
<v 1>I operate in full, uh, sort of transparency because look, I'm,</v>

263
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.320
I guess I'm sort of sponsored by the public. So I feel like a level of, uh,

264
00:14:59.321 --> 00:15:02.040
transparency and all this, but, you know, I had a little bit of money.

265
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.200
I'd won a TV show called wipe out,

266
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.400
and I had 50,000 Canadian dollars tax free in the bank,

267
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.670
which I sat on because I didn't know per precisely what it is I was gonna do

268
00:15:11.671 --> 00:15:14.670
with it. And I felt like there was a potential of a rainy day around the corner.

269
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.270
You know, it took that in the first six months to six months to,

270
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.390
to hire lawyers for everybody, everyone that was getting sued, I was cutting,

271
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.550
you know, $5,000 retainers for going, there's a purpose for this money.

272
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.110
I only have it because I got on the show because of my relationship with the

273
00:15:29.111 --> 00:15:32.820
wall. So I'm in for a good chunk of change here.

274
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.660
Uh, it's crazy. The lengths of which,

275
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.300
and the ability corporations have to destroy individuals.

276
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.260
The fact that the court is there to facilitate it is precisely why I

277
00:15:49.261 --> 00:15:52.250
want to go to trial. I've been told the F figures are,

278
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.890
and please don't quote me and I'd love the facts,

279
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.490
but I've been told that something in the area of like 90% of lawsuits get

280
00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:01.530
settled without going to discovery. I wanna be,

281
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.890
I wanna be the 10% or less. I want, I want a resolution by the, by the judge.

282
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.010
I can sleep at night. If the judge says, okay, it ends with this, Phil, you get,

283
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.890
uh, $50,000 of your,

284
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.680
at this point in excess of 200,000 in legal bills.

285
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.840
And Marineland you lost. So, you know, you,

286
00:16:18.841 --> 00:16:20.080
you gotta eat the shame and walk away.

287
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.440
I would assume be more comfortable with that than if Marineland said here's a

288
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:28.480
hundred thousand dollars. Don't talk about the, um, I mean,

289
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.840
let's say in the best scenario, they said, here's a chunk of chains. Let's,

290
00:16:31.841 --> 00:16:33.870
let's just use a hundred thousand dollars and said, uh,

291
00:16:33.871 --> 00:16:36.030
just don't talk about the terms of the settlement. But other than that,

292
00:16:36.031 --> 00:16:38.190
you have no impeded speech. You can just be free.

293
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.990
I would be more comfortable with the judge's decision than that a hundred K

294
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.830
because then at least I know exactly what it is that I went through. I,

295
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.590
the world can find out what function these courts have and what their version of

296
00:16:50.591 --> 00:16:52.870
justice is. I mean, I'm just,

297
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.180
I'm trying not to be jaded because obviously it's a heavy load to carry as in

298
00:16:57.181 --> 00:17:00.940
your day to day. It's, uh, you know, I've been on the cusp of crazy. Um,

299
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.460
I'm thankful for plant medicine for sort of keeping me, uh,

300
00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:08.460
grounded and keeping me in, uh, with the proper perspective, but plant medicine,

301
00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:10.620
listen to you hippie &lt;laugh&gt;. Well, &lt;laugh&gt;

302
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.650
they do try call me hippie a lot too. That's interesting. I

303
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.930
meanpy a little bit of a, of a different version of hippie, I suppose. I mean,

304
00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:23.490
yeah. I don't mind war &lt;laugh&gt;. Well, your, um,

305
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.490
your guy cares about these Marine mamals now Walworth is like my daughter, dude.

306
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:30.890
It sounds crazy, man. I believe stressed it, but it's just,

307
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.450
as soon as you consider that fact, you're just like, dude, that he's got,

308
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.400
they've got your daughter, that's a mess.

309
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.200
Just try to put yourself in a perspective that if they had your dog,

310
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:43.200
your neighbors got your dog and is, uh, is UN unmpededly, uh, uh,

311
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.800
by your definition abusing or neglecting their life.

312
00:17:45.801 --> 00:17:48.520
And you're there to just watch silently. I mean, that's disgusting. Yeah.

313
00:17:48.521 --> 00:17:51.800
That's a disgusting scenario. This is the poison that I live with. I,

314
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.240
I need, I need a proper closure.

315
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.680
I'm relying on there being a level of justice.

316
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.760
So that one day I can live in this world without being just that old

317
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.120
jaded dude. Look, last time I was here, I was not nearly as gray. Like

318
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.670
I'm starting to feel the effects of long term litigation. You don't.
