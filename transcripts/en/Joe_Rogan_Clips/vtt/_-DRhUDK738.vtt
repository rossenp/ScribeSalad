00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Why China?</v>

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.120
<v 1>Because they have this incredibly large population, 2 billion,</v>

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.960
they've got this food supply that is largely wildlife that comes into these

4
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:17.160
markets where there's this incredible contact between people and these animals

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.070
and the crowded nature of that. I mean,

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.430
I think one of the things that surprises people when they go to China,

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.390
15 million population cities are common over there. I mean,

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.390
we think of the United States, we think of LA and New York, and that's big.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.350
Okay. Over there. I mean, in Wuhan, a city of 15 million,

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.510
the entire metropolitan area is 60 million.

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.950
And so you have people crowded.

12
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.460
It's so closely together that if you add in the bugs,

13
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:48.540
coming from these animals and then the potential for this kind of,

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.020
of contact where it spreads quickly, China's been a, a, a, you know,

15
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.460
a bacteri and viral soup vessel for a long time. That's again,

16
00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:00.100
why we have to protect ourselves here because a,

17
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.090
a bug anywhere in the world today can be a bug everywhere tomorrow.

18
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.810
<v 0>Everywhere. And particularly when you're dealing with a massive number,</v>

19
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.850
like these kind of cities. Yeah. So these wet, they call 'em wet markets.

20
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.610
Is that what they're wet markets? Yep. So that's what it is. A lot of it.

21
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.210
<v 1>Is wildlife. Oh, it's incredible. You know, you know, I've hunted my life,</v>

22
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.440
you know, I've always, I, I love to fly fish. I, I love the outdoors. Okay.

23
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.080
I could never have imagined the animals. You know,

24
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:29.760
I've spent time in these markets. Uh, I remember one day, uh, spending a,

25
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.920
a day in the Bangkok tank, Thailand market.

26
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.880
And it was about a mile by a mile and a half wild, big, I mean,

27
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.480
and these tight aisles, every animal imaginable to humans. And I swear to God,

28
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:41.480
there were some out of the movies I think that were in there.

29
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.630
And they're all just right on top of each other.

30
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.670
And I actually have a picture that I show in some of my lectures,

31
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.310
there was a situation where there was all these chickens in a cage.

32
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.270
I know 15 or 20 of 'em. Okay. And a big wire cage.

33
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.350
And it's sat on top of a wire cage full of ferrets.

34
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.830
And ferrets are actually an animal model from flu standpoint that they do really

35
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.460
well infected with flu viruses.

36
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.340
If you wanted to create the perfect experiment that no, no university, you know,

37
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.820
research group would let you do is you'd put birds and Ferres like that

38
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.740
together. And that's just common. That's just common. That's common.

39
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.500
<v 0>And so birds and ferrets together, the it's something that's infecting.</v>

40
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:21.900
The birds could jump to the ferrets.

41
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.490
<v 1>Farts could breathe it out and we could get a infected oh Christ.</v>

42
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.450
And so these markets and, and the, I, I don't know what's gonna happen here,

43
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:32.610
but for the first time we really saw the Chinese after this outbreak in Wuhan,

44
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.530
really start to put down some markers on what they're gonna do to supervise

45
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:38.210
these markets. I mean, they still have to eat,

46
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.490
but I think this is a dangerous practice where we see it. But, you know,

47
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.440
it happens in, look at Africa with Ebola, right. You know,

48
00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:47.960
Bush meat is still very important and there's so much of the world that that's

49
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:48.760
their primary food.

50
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.360
<v 0>Supply. And when they say Bush meat, it's basically.</v>

51
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.240
<v 1>Everything. Everything from bats, we think bat was the, uh,</v>

52
00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:59.080
the primary source of this outbreak in west Africa was, uh,

53
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.640
a human bat that was consumed to eat 'em all the time. Do they really? Yeah.

54
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.880
Yeah. So, you know, and some of 'em are pretty big bats, you know, they're,

55
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:10.280
they're literally three feet wingspans. They're, they're big. And so, um,

56
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.000
you know, that's one of the challenges we have with, with China.

57
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.240
We know that this is gonna happen. It's gonna occur.

58
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.280
We think of the flu viruses the same way. And, uh,

59
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.510
that's how we knew doing better flu vaccines. You know,

60
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.790
this could just as easily be a flu pandemic, the same thing, like 1918.

61
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.390
<v 0>So these wet markets,</v>

62
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.350
they just have all these animals hanging out and some of 'em are still

63
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.270
alive. Is that what.

64
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.950
<v 1>It is? Many of 'em are alive. And then they'll, they'll actually, uh,</v>

65
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.350
prepare 'em for you right there. They,

66
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.980
they basically kill him and got 'em and so forth. You got some pictures up.

67
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.020
<v 0>Bizarre Wuhan west. There you go.</v>

68
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.860
Market menu shows over a hundred wild animals sold as food linked

69
00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:52.500
with virus. Unclear. Exactly. So it looks like in here, I'll show you the list.

70
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.140
<v 1>You can. It, it's pretty amazing.</v>

71
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.340
<v 0>Yeah. Let's see some images. Woo. Well, look at that rip. Look at that list.</v>

72
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.250
I know peacocks. Yeah. People are eating peacock. Oh yeah, absolutely.

73
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.250
Deer crocodiles, Turkey, swans, eating swans. How dare you. Kangaroos squirrels.

74
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.410
Snails, foxes.

75
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.570
<v 1>Foxes and civic. Cats were the cause of the SARS.</v>

76
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.530
<v 0>Outbreak. Yeah. OSTs I've had that pre delicious. Yep. I'm a hypocrite.</v>

77
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.360
Look at me eating otros Santa P geese. Hedgehogs. Goats.

78
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.963
Jesus.

79
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.280
<v 1>So.</v>

80
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.320
<v 0>Yeah. It's, that's a pheasant, right? That's normal. Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.080
It's just a picture of it. So do we have a video of the market?

82
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.600
I wanna see what, whoa, look at that. Freaky looking Saland,

83
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.200
look the size of that sucker big. That's a huge Saland.

84
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.270
I went lights for you first. The pictures. I was fine. Uh, dark.

85
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.390
Yeah. Yeah. Come on. What do you got? Cages of turtles and cages of bunnies.

86
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.750
Let's stuff like let's see it. Uh, bam. Wow. This wet market is very,

87
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.710
very strange. So, and these are enormous markets, right? Oh, they're huge.

88
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.430
<v 1>They're huge. And the number of people in them is incredible. I mean.</v>

89
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.420
<v 0>They're getting the, from, they're getting 'em from the wire rural area.</v>

90
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.460
<v 1>From rural areas. Yeah.</v>

91
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.380
<v 0>Yeah. And are they growing these things and, and farming them or are.</v>

92
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.140
<v 1>They just some cases? Both. Some cases,</v>

93
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.060
both like a lot of the seafood today is actually being farmed.

94
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.220
<v 0>So this is really like a giant Petri dish. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.050
I mean it's wow. Fish. You're looking, the fish looks not. Yep.

96
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.250
Not that fresh. Whoa. What's all that stuff. Rabbits and rabbits.

97
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.530
I couldn't tell you where all they at.

98
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.670
<v 1>But Jesus.</v>

99
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.330
<v 0>But you're getting an idea. Explain 'em on the ground.</v>

100
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.690
<v 1>Of why, you know, if we can't stop that we surely can try,</v>

101
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.610
but if we can't stop it,

102
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:37.850
we need to stop the infectious diseases coming from those animals to us.

103
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.050
<v 0>Look at 'em all wearing masks. That's hilarious.</v>

104
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.320
<v 1>That was, I think with the, uh,</v>

105
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.960
outbreak was that that might have been since the, those.

106
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.880
<v 0>Those gigantic things a Malus what is that? What are those things?</v>

107
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.920
I can't tell those look like giant Malus that's like flat. Yeah, they are right.

108
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.680
Can't tell the difference. No, because look at the ones behind,

109
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.400
I think you're right. You're right. They like huge muscles.

110
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.400
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; wow. Look at those suckers behind them. Wow.

111
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.960
Yeah. There's a lot of people in China, they gotta eat.

112
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.600
That's where it gets weird. Right. It's like,

113
00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:11.520
how do you tell them that they've been doing,

114
00:06:11.521 --> 00:06:13.000
they've been doing this for who knows? How long,

115
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.030
how do you tell them to stop doing it? Or is, is that an impossible?

116
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.070
And is it more possible to just accelerate our vaccine program and

117
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.910
try to preemptively create something to, to address coronaviruses yeah.

118
00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:29.870
To address various, various different.
