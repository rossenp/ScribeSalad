00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.970
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I had to, well, I don't hate to,</v>

2
00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:06.110
because I wanted to do this.

3
00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:10.340
I want to toss a little hand grenade at you and see what you want to do with it

4
00:00:10.341 --> 00:00:11.210
here. But, um,

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.370
I've been thinking about this a lot lately and you know,

6
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:21.320
wanting to communicate my story and these things that have happened

7
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:25.070
to me. And then this opportunity came up and this opportunity to,

8
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.000
to reach a lot of people into there's that quote that says,

9
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.970
be the person that you needed when you were younger, you know,

10
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.140
and Gina has that on her wall and it's stares me in the face every day.

11
00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:41.000
And I realize that I now am the person that I needed

12
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:41.990
when I was younger.

13
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:45.830
And if somebody would have opened up their mouth and let me know that I wasn't

14
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:50.600
alone in that, that I wasn't so isolated in so many,

15
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.100
so many horrible things that we all deal with is because we feel isolation.

16
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.200
We don't think anyone could understand it.

17
00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:00.530
And we don't think that anyone else is going through these things.

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.700
And if we did just that knowledge of not being alone,

19
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.800
it would be so significant. But when I was 14 years old,

20
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.200
I was molested by my stepmother.

21
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.520
And this went on for well over a year,

22
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.750
close to two years.

23
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.060
And it was obviously detrimental to me. And these are these,

24
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.380
these are things that I'm just now finally starting to be able to

25
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.820
understand and,

26
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:33.620
and realize that wouldn't happen to me and realize how

27
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:37.610
young I was at the time. You know, when I meet of a 14 year old kid,

28
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.890
like you're baby, you're a baby. You, you know,

29
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.950
when we think about ourselves, when we were younger, like at least myself,

30
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.280
I'm like, I still feel the same. I did when I was younger. I was just a little,

31
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.623
you know what I mean?

32
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.730
But you don't really understand how little you were until you have like a

33
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:58.520
little 12, 14 year old kid standing next to you. I'm like,

34
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.530
you're not like you don't even have to. Okay.

35
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.210
How could that happen in like,

36
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.100
thinking about how I saw a study that said one in six males

37
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.710
are abused by the time they're 18,

38
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.270
which means every one of us probably know somebody that this has happened to,

39
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.560
you know, and to think how devastating it is to women. Um, but,

40
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:24.260
but, but turn man, it's, it's, it's,

41
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.400
it's such a different thing because you're almost, it's almost viewed, uh, well,

42
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.370
and when it happens from a woman, you know, it's,

43
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:36.350
it's almost viewed as like a good thing. Like it's a positive thing. Like, ouch,

44
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.990
that wish that happened to me when I was a kid, like I want,

45
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.630
I want to be molested and, um, you know,

46
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:45.690
we're not able to really understand it, um, and,

47
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:50.600
and understand the damage that it, that it does. And, and, you know,

48
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:52.850
I, I, I, I,

49
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.700
if I wouldn't have felt so alone and so isolated at the time, I,

50
00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:02.830
you know, I necessarily know if things would have changed,

51
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.570
but I definitely would have wouldn't have felt so alone. You know,

52
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:11.050
I wouldn't have felt like there's nobody in the world that could possibly

53
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.440
understand this. There's nobody that, who can I talk to about this? You know,

54
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:17.560
like I can't talk to my friends. A couple of my friends knew,

55
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:20.860
they thought it was the coolest ever, you know, they're like, I want that.

56
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.090
I want that bad. And I'm like, well, it was your step-mom too,

57
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.190
which is dude, it was, it was

58
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.750
so confusing. You know, it was always,

59
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.320
I was very conflicted by it, you know,

60
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:43.300
like I couldn't understand it at all. And then to have this person,

61
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:44.134
like

62
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.630
money mentally manipulating meeting and making like, oh, it's not a big deal.

63
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.840
It's okay. It's almost like, it's a good thing. You know, like, it's like,

64
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.530
there's nothing wrong, you know, it's, it's, um, you know,

65
00:03:56.531 --> 00:04:01.210
I'm not a stranger and, and this, um, you know, even prior to that,

66
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.160
as I said, I started drinking when I was 12, but,

67
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:07.810
but this really just derailed me so much

68
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:12.370
and made me internalize and put up these barriers and

69
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:15.520
walls around me and things that, um, I, like I said,

70
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:18.550
I'm only even just at this age,

71
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.100
starting to understand like the negative habits that this

72
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:28.740
created in me, um, F of distrust in, of, of, of, of,

73
00:04:28.741 --> 00:04:33.160
of negativity and of, of, of, um, you know,

74
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.050
having to be, having to be alone and not trust people, you know,

75
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.510
in so many things like that, that, you know,

76
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:45.130
like Jean is probably the only person that I've ever talked to in depth about

77
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:48.340
this. I mean, my couple of people in my family know,

78
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:52.900
and almost none of my friends, not number of spoken to this to anybody,

79
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.880
you know, I, I, I try to, uh, go to a therapist once and,

80
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.970
and talk about this, but I started realizing like,

81
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:02.980
this therapist is getting more out of this, our,

82
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.890
our interaction than not than I am. Like, he's, you know,

83
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.630
like a overweight person that needs like, self-confidence self I'm like, oh,

84
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.040
geez, man. Like, like who can I, I can talk to about this? And, you know, maybe,

85
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:16.300
maybe I can't talk to anybody,

86
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:20.590
but I am in a position to where I can

87
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.680
reach out and let other people that know that they're not the only ones going

88
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:31.480
through this. And that has been weighing on me so much lately,

89
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:34.690
especially over the last few years. Um, now I'm like,

90
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.020
you are in a position to be able,

91
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:41.080
even if it only helps one person like you can,

92
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.710
you just don't know how to like, well,

93
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:48.310
I could write about it or I could do like a video blog or something.

94
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:51.340
And now I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I'm like, how do I,

95
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.760
how can I do this? And like, should I do this? I'm like,

96
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:57.650
I don't know if that's like a good thing. Like, um,

97
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.710
it's not like I'm a like psychologist or someone that can like help with this.

98
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:02.120
And, but I,

99
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.870
I just felt like I need to

100
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.220
express this and, and, and, and communicate this.

101
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.140
And maybe it can do some good for even one

102
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:19.040
person. And then if I didn't, I, that would haunt me forever.

103
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.943
<v 1>I, uh,</v>

104
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.450
I hadn't experienced when I was 13 with a girl who lived up the street,

105
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:29.710
who was 21, a couple times, but, um,

106
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.000
is very different than your experience. It was, uh,

107
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.730
I mean, not ashamed to say it. It was kind of fun, you know, it's,

108
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.380
it was different. It was, I couldn't believe it. It was very weird. Yeah.

109
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.050
But it definitely like,

110
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.500
kind of screwed up my idea of what boy, girl interaction was.

111
00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:57.460
I didn't go from the like 13 year olds. Most of the time, they're like,

112
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.970
you want a kiss? I don't know. Do you, I don't know to, you know,

113
00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:05.050
this girl grabbing my Dick and pulling her out. She was a woman, you know,

114
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:08.920
she was 21 and it didn't,

115
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.080
it didn't hurt me. Like your story, like your story hurts. Like,

116
00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:16.330
it sounds like you were betrayed and you were, you were,

117
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.130
and also the fact that it was your step-mom. I mean, with me, it was like,

118
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:25.270
what the was that all about? And I don't, I didn't tell anybody. Yeah.

119
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.600
I didn't tell anybody for like years and years later,

120
00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:32.200
I probably didn't tell anyone until I was in my twenties. And, uh,

121
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.890
I think I probably told a girlfriend when I was in my twenties. Yeah.

122
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.740
And she was like, when was the first time you ever fooled around? I was like,

123
00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:40.090
wow. You know?

124
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.420
Cause that was really the first time I had ever fooled around with anyone was

125
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.860
this 21 year old woman.

126
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.380
<v 0>It was the same thing for me. You know, I, I,</v>

127
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:52.360
I didn't even kiss a girl until I was, I don't know, 12,

128
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:55.750
13, like late, late, cause I was such a shy person.

129
00:07:55.751 --> 00:08:00.100
So I went from just kissing to that. I think it was November.

130
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.910
I think the.

131
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.180
<v 1>Same with me. I think. I don't even think I kissed, I think our kissed her.</v>

132
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.790
Yeah. I think she was the first person I kissed. Yeah.

133
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.340
<v 0>Yeah. And, and, you know, to, uh,</v>

134
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:14.530
just have your innocence ripped away like

135
00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:19.090
that and to be thrust into this adult thing,

136
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.260
um, you know, obviously the situation was that much worse. Um, it being,

137
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.300
you know, my stepmom and it being, uh, um, being molested and,

138
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.540
um, you know, it's such a different thing than

139
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.330
a woman or being raped, forcefully raped it's way different. Yeah.

140
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.100
But psychologically and emotionally, you know, it's, it's, it's,

141
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.540
it's devastating. It is. It is obviously.

142
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.090
And you were living being with her as well. Yeah. Yes.

143
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:53.710
<v 1>That's the whole thing is terrible. And you said it went on for a year.</v>

144
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.180
<v 0>Longer than a year. It probably close to a two years.</v>

145
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.490
<v 2>How did it stop? I stopped.</v>

146
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.170
<v 0>It actually, you know, this was, this was something, you know, I never,</v>

147
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.490
I never felt right about this. I was very conflicted by it, you know?

148
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:13.150
And I was like, this definitely, isn't a good thing. I find, I don't like,

149
00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:17.970
I don't know. Like I definitely, I didn't understand how bad of a thing it was,

150
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.810
you know? And then again, she's very manipulative in and, you know,

151
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.380
anytime I would kind of bring that subject of like, yeah,

152
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:29.670
I don't think this is okay. You know, this is, this feels wrong.

153
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:33.870
And she'd be like, no, no, it's, you know, and find this way to, uh, you know,

154
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:38.040
rationalize it or make it okay. And, you know, but as time went on, like,

155
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.790
I was just like, there, this is bad. How old was she?

156
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.730
She was probably 30 young thirties. You know,

157
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.530
now that was another thing once I got to that age and then I saw a 14 year old,

158
00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:54.050
I'm like, what the? Like, I didn't even,

159
00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:58.730
I couldn't even conceptualize how twisted this person was until I

160
00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:03.560
got that age. Hmm. Like how could you, how could you look at a baby,

161
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.850
a child and, and do that? How could you do that?

162
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.610
<v 1>You know, the expression hurt people, hurt people. Yeah.</v>

163
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.890
<v 0>And, you know, in, in, in, in, in,</v>

164
00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:17.870
unfortunately a lot of that for me is helps

165
00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:22.850
you like rationalize it and make it a like, oh, well, you know, she's up. And,

166
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.490
you know, even, even my father, you know, after he found out,

167
00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:29.030
like he kept this lady around for awhile really? Yeah.

168
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.500
After he found out yeah. I mean, they, they, they kind of split up and divorced,

169
00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:37.670
but, but, um, they kind of work together still and, you know,

170
00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:40.580
he kept her around for, for quite some time. And, you know,

171
00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:43.790
that alone was extremely damaging to me.

172
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:46.880
And in such a betrayal in such a,

173
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.860
such a traumatic thing that I didn't even really

174
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:57.290
understand how damaging that was after the fact until really till

175
00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:02.210
recently, you know, because I, myself would rationalize it. Well, you know,

176
00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:06.290
he didn't want to like, like be an and like send her off. And like,

177
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:09.950
she was an alcoholic too. And, you know, you know, he was like, oh, you know,

178
00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:14.270
he's just trying to, you know, make this horrible situation like, okay,

179
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.430
for all of us. And, you know,

180
00:11:16.431 --> 00:11:20.480
I didn't really think about like how up he was in the whole situation and like

181
00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:20.870
how,

182
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.550
how much more damaging it was in the long run to me by not having my

183
00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:29.660
father protect me. Like if Mike, this happened to my child,

184
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.160
I would murder a woman that did this. You know,

185
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.960
I certainly wouldn't keep her around, you know, and I certainly wouldn't,

186
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.080
um, like just handle it, handle it the way that he did, you know, and that was,

187
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.950
that was almost it magnified the,

188
00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:53.120
the damage that much more so because of the way that it was handled,

189
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.120
you know, and to not have that to not be taken care of by adults,

190
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.220
by not be taken care of by my father,

191
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.230
by the people around me that were supposed to love me and take care of me. And,

192
00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.430
and they did the exact opposite.

193
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.410
Like they up to my world, you know? And I,

194
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:18.220
I put band-aids of alcohol on it my whole life, you know, and,

195
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.030
and I understand like why I,

196
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.800
why I did that and why it was, I mean,

197
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.500
I really was trying to all myself

198
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.380
really. I mean, when you look at it, that's what I was doing.

199
00:12:31.381 --> 00:12:35.110
I was just doing a long process of it, you know, and that's, that's,

200
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.340
that's what we do. It's like, we don't want to take a gun and kill ourselves,

201
00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:41.280
but I'm going to, I don't want to really live. And I want to, like,

202
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.670
I want to check out of this place, uh, the sooner the better.

203
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.730
So I'm going to do everything in my power to make it happen.

204
00:12:47.731 --> 00:12:49.620
And that way I can't say I killed myself,

205
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:54.090
but I was killing myself every day and putting myself in situations that were

206
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.620
extremely dangerous and detrimental and damaging.

207
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.450
And, uh, that's what I was doing. And it didn't, you know,

208
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.610
half of my life was I was just destroyed and,

209
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.503
you know,

210
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.100
I'm trying to use this second part of my life too,

211
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.480
make up for that, make up for, um,

212
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.900
the damage that was done and into try to

213
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.510
turn a horrible situation in a negative situation and something that I could

214
00:13:27.511 --> 00:13:31.530
easily point to and allow destroy my life,

215
00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:36.300
which is what I was doing. Um, and trying to do the opposite,

216
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.330
you know, again, with it that the fight approach is like, you have a loss,

217
00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:41.160
you have a horrible thing happening, you have an injury,

218
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.720
what are you going to do with it?

219
00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:45.540
Are you going to let it destroy you and break you and never do this again,

220
00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:48.540
and then be depressed and and complain and whine about it.

221
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:53.340
We're going to say things happen to all of us, up things happened.

222
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.200
And we all have the excuse to let it destroy our lives and

223
00:13:58.201 --> 00:14:02.940
to use it, to, uh, make ourselves feel better about, uh,

224
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.680
um, drinking and drugs and just being an. And, you know,

225
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.120
like we all have reasons to be and we all have reasons to, um, you know,

226
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.830
take it out on other people. But that doesn't mean that you should,

227
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:19.470
and that doesn't mean that you don't still have a choice.

228
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.910
It's that victim mentality. And this was something that I, I just,

229
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.740
just started understanding. Cause you know, that,

230
00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:28.860
that term victim and telling me, I'm like, yeah, well I'm a victim,

231
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.410
but what victim mentality really is,

232
00:14:31.411 --> 00:14:35.850
is feeling like you don't have a role to play

233
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.250
from that point. Yeah. Yeah.

234
00:14:38.251 --> 00:14:41.520
You might not have been able to control these terrible things that have happened

235
00:14:41.521 --> 00:14:45.270
to you, but you do have control over what you do from there.

236
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.850
You have control over whether you use that too,

237
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.880
go into a more positive light or you use that to, to drastically damage you in,

238
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.620
in, you know, be this burden that you carry.

239
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.790
<v 1>Well, sometimes I think when someone like you goes through something like</v>

240
00:15:03.791 --> 00:15:06.880
this and comes out on the other end,

241
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:12.400
what you can do by talking about this can set a

242
00:15:12.401 --> 00:15:17.200
path for so many people to understand that, you know,

243
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.790
someone looks at you, you know, they see fighting on television and they, they,

244
00:15:21.791 --> 00:15:26.740
they, they see you on the internet and, you know, successful Moya Thai fighter.

245
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:29.380
And you know, you look cool, you have this beautiful girlfriend,

246
00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:31.690
everything seems so positive. You know,

247
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.520
when you're a young kid and your life is like mine was clearly like

248
00:15:36.521 --> 00:15:40.900
yours was you, you look at these people, like they're nothing like you,

249
00:15:40.901 --> 00:15:44.560
they're aliens. There's some different thing. They they're, they're,

250
00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.940
they're it's the world is opened up to them so easily.

251
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.860
And they're better than you.

252
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:56.260
When someone hears you talk about your experience, the alcoholism, the abuse,

253
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.340
the isolation,

254
00:15:57.341 --> 00:16:02.260
the feeling like a loser and all the things that are so relatable

255
00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:06.550
to so many people. When you can talk about this, you can,

256
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:11.650
you're, you're setting a map that other people can follow.

257
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.960
Yeah. And this is something that's so important in culture and in

258
00:16:16.961 --> 00:16:17.471
human beings,

259
00:16:17.471 --> 00:16:22.390
we're all a part of some strange evolution of the human race and

260
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.310
the things that our grandparents went through were likely unfucking,

261
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.911
believably,

262
00:16:27.911 --> 00:16:31.360
horrific the things their grandparents wore and went through were probably

263
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.400
magnitudes worse.

264
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.470
And this is just how human beings have gone from being monkeys to

265
00:16:38.471 --> 00:16:41.710
being what we are now and it's happening very rapidly.

266
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:47.050
And one of the things that accelerates this understanding of

267
00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:51.820
consequences and have the ability to rise

268
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.400
to the occasion and overcome obstacles,

269
00:16:54.401 --> 00:16:58.420
and to be able to use adversity as a tool to better yourself is someone like

270
00:16:58.421 --> 00:17:02.800
you. What you're doing right now is very, very beneficial to so many people,

271
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.670
millions of people listening to this right now. And so many of them,

272
00:17:06.671 --> 00:17:09.490
this is going to resonate with them. And they're going to say, oh,

273
00:17:09.491 --> 00:17:12.940
this guy who is his bad-ass Kickbox or moist, excuse me,

274
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.330
bad-ass dude. Who's just like, you know,

275
00:17:16.331 --> 00:17:20.710
like people admire you and to hear this is so it's so

276
00:17:20.711 --> 00:17:24.820
powerful. I mean, it's it, I'm so glad you said it.

277
00:17:24.821 --> 00:17:27.880
I'm so glad you talked to all of it from the beginning, you know, your,

278
00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:32.440
your earlier struggles to this, because this is medicine for people, man.

279
00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:35.200
There's a lot of people that are hearing this right now and they're going,

280
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.070
I can do it too.

281
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:43.870
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
