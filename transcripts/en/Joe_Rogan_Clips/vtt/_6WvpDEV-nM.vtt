00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.600
<v 3>Sure. All your kids just cut loose on YouTube.</v>

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.040
<v 1>Do no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Luckily one of my kids,</v>

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.520
all she likes to watch on YouTube is like, there's a girl named sniper Wolf. Hm.

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.600
Who's very funny. And she does like these reaction videos to stuff,

6
00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:20.440
but it's very grated and she loves watching her and you know,

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.470
know there's, you know,

8
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.190
but I keep an eye on what they're doing and I don't allow them to just start

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.030
going crazy. Yeah. Cause it's just, you just, you know,

10
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.750
you never know. I mean, one day you just stumble upon an ISIS behead video.

11
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.310
Yeah. Now you have, you know,

12
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.510
your kids waking you up in the middle of the night, crying and screaming.

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.900
Cuz they can get this image outta their head. It's terrifying.

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.660
<v 0>It is to be on the other side of it too. Cause when you're young,</v>

15
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:50.660
all you wanna do is throw off the chains. Oh yeah.

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.260
And then all of a sudden you're like in the position of putting the chains on.

17
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.100
<v 1>Yeah. You gotta it's like how much freedom do you give them?</v>

18
00:00:57.101 --> 00:00:59.100
Like how much do you talk to them about stuff?

19
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.180
How much do you let them figure this stuff out on their own?

20
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.690
&lt;affirmative&gt; you know, it's uh,

21
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.370
it's tricky and it's a weird world because it didn't exist previous.

22
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.450
Like it's not like we're dealing with something that we went through when we

23
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:12.890
were children. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; there was no Google when we were children,

24
00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:15.810
there was no, you know, live leak. You ever go on live leak and,

25
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.570
I know about it, but yeah. Horrible videos.

26
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:22.400
You can watch a lot of car accidents and animal attacks and just wild. Yeah.

27
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.040
That's not, you know.

28
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.120
<v 0>Although I have been on that. Yeah. I have, I have stumbled into that.</v>

29
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.480
<v 1>But that wasn't, that didn't exist before, when I was a kid.</v>

30
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.040
If you wanted to watch something up, you had a plan for it.

31
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.480
Like we wanted to watch faces of death. Somebody had to get the video. Someone,

32
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:40.680
one of our friends had to watch the door, you know?

33
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.110
So like we were in the basement. One of the friends wash the door,

34
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.470
make sure the parents didn't come down and then we put it on the VCR and we,

35
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.230
we were ready. Like if someone came down, you'd pop that tape out and hide it.

36
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.350
These kids today, all they have to do is just have a phone. You know?

37
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:58.190
And a lot of times kids are 11 and 12.

38
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.550
They have phones and 12 year olds with a phone. I mean,

39
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:05.420
they're gonna start Googling people, people getting killed.

40
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.820
They're gonna see the most crazy. Have you seen this? Your friend are gonna say,

41
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:10.500
have you seen that? And then you're gonna look on your phone.

42
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:13.740
There's there's no way to stop it. There's no way to stop it.

43
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:18.580
Kids have wild work arounds for, for like little,

44
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:21.860
little restrictions, my sneaky little kid. You know what she did.

45
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.410
She screened recorded. Um, my wife,

46
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.810
when my wife went and put in a password &lt;laugh&gt; for her

47
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.530
screen time. Yes. Nice move. Very nice move.

48
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.610
She handed her phone over to my wife.

49
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.330
My wife goes in and puts a password in for her screen time.

50
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.450
So she can only get an hour's worth of screen time a day.

51
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.000
And then my wife checks and she's like, how you have four hours of screen time,

52
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.280
like what's going on here? So she,

53
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.560
and then she figured out that the really the little monster. Yeah, I got did.

54
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.960
<v 0>You guys have public access, man? When you were growing up smart.</v>

55
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.360
My public access TV, I used to see, I remember that's my first.

56
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600
<v 2>Exposure to faces of death was after 10 o'clock.</v>

57
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.600
They could show whatever the they wanted for whatever reason,

58
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.400
really PO not blatant porn, but porn really.

59
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.640
I saw that's when the bud der Dwyer video of him shooting himself in the face.

60
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.760
You saw that on TV to the 21 gun salute when I was going to bed and I was when I

61
00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:22.190
was like 10 years old, what? Yeah. Huh? No way. Wow. And then this guy ended up,

62
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.350
I was talking with some of my friends when I was back at home. In my reunion,

63
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.950
this guy was, we all knew about him when we were like 12, 13 years old,

64
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.310
had a show painted up like an insane clown posse type character and would

65
00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:38.950
have like blood girl, girls, vaginas lips, all sort.

66
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.940
It's a wild. Really wild.

67
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.660
And it was just like the government was putting it on technically cuz it public

68
00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:45.660
access. So in.

69
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.740
<v 1>Public access there's no restrictions like there are.</v>

70
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.660
<v 2>That's what I was asking. I don't did not.</v>

71
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:52.300
You guys didn't have that's like what Wayne's world was that's my only thing I

72
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:55.500
knew growing up was like Wayne's world on the SNL was a public access show,

73
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:59.930
but then we actually had public access and that's where wild was happen after 10

74
00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:01.170
o'clock. I had a friend of.

75
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.210
<v 1>Mine who read a public access show, my friend, uh, Larry Raucci,</v>

76
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.250
who was a standup comic in, uh, I think it was Larry's show,

77
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.050
but he was a standup comic in Boston. We all did a public access show.

78
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.050
When we were like struggling comedians, we all went on. You did it too. Yeah.

79
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.570
I wore a dress. I wore a dress and a wig and I was like, we had like a,

80
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.360
like a dating and.

81
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.000
<v 2>This is the wild guy that I would, this is from the nineties.</v>

82
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.400
I think I found it on YouTube. It still exists.

83
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.640
It's like very David Lynchian then it so it's just so weird to watch Z.

84
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.400
<v 1>Oh, so he would that's him on the right and him on TV. Oh,</v>

85
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.680
so he really playing this out.

86
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.680
<v 2>This was some weird. Wow. This is he's doing Coke.</v>

87
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.230
He's the tamp like again, I was a kid when I was seeing this stuff. Wow.

88
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.990
So like to me, it's not that.

89
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.190
<v 0>Robert Smith and.</v>

90
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.630
<v 2>The cure man. Someone found him. I don't know.</v>

91
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.510
I'm sure he is like on Facebook or he's probably doing this stuff still let's

92
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:55.910
find him. Well, he's gonna find out now. Oh Jesus Christ.

93
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.630
<v 1>Wow. Yeah. So he got away with this. This is all on. Yeah.</v>

94
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.620
<v 2>But he wasn't even the only one was a clown called like angst though.</v>

95
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:04.820
The clown that was like, I'm sure red band knows about this stuff.

96
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.300
Cuz he was a little bit older than me in the same area is probably why he,

97
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.300
he was probably watching the same. Where were you brought, brought up.

98
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.540
This is why it might make sense. Now. Where were you brought up in Columbus,

99
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.260
Ohio. Huh? Weird. There's I mean this,

100
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:18.500
and then looking back into some of the stuff that was happening there,

101
00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:21.300
it kind of makes a little bit of sense. But if this isn't wasn't going on,

102
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:23.570
every aware that's sort of like strange. I never.

103
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.610
<v 1>Saw in Boston, but I might have been out the loop might have,</v>

104
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:28.370
might have existed. I just wasn't aware of it.

105
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.930
But I thought the regulations were across the board. If you were broadcasting.

106
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.290
I didn't think that public access was different. Was.

107
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.970
<v 2>It? Cuz it's local maybe.</v>

108
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.530
And then there's like free speech laws that were getting into, I I don't,

109
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.520
again, I was a kid, so I have no idea. I was just, Hmm. I was excited to see it.

110
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.800
&lt;laugh&gt; I.

111
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.000
<v 0>I just, I haven't, it's not, it won't be available until spring, but um,</v>

112
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.160
for the last couple years I've been working on a, a book,

113
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.400
you know like this is the thing I thought I'd never do.

114
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.520
I used to be annoyed by people who thought about their kids before I had kids,

115
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.320
but I have a book I just finished called uh, outdoor kids inside world.

116
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.960
And it's about, you know, kids in nature,

117
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.440
raising kids and yeah, man, if you'd asked me dude like 10 years ago,

118
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.710
I'd been like the way I would do something. Like, but it's just harrowing man.

119
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.790
It's like scary. What is scary having.

120
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.270
<v 1>Kids. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Worried about them and just like.</v>

121
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.830
<v 0>Danger. Yeah. And like trying to guide their guide, their experience, you know?</v>

122
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.870
And for me, I don't, yeah. I've, I've found that, um, that,

123
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.660
that ex you know, exposure to nature experiences in nature,

124
00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:45.100
understanding nature is like winds up being an avenue of approach that I have

125
00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:47.660
with them that works for both of us.

126
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.140
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is like a common language, you know? Yeah. But yeah, man,

127
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.060
it's, it's, it's, it's terrifying. And then the, the,

128
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.410
the feeling of hypo hypocrisy that you get of

129
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.090
things that meant a,

130
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.210
that when you were young things that meant a lot to you and felt very authentic

131
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.650
to you, like freedom,

132
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.850
freedom to consume what media you wanted freedom to talk to.

133
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.850
He wanted to talk to freedom to go where you wanted to go. Um,

134
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.360
that later you're in a position where you're a, um,

135
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.160
denying, denying someone,

136
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.000
something that you really wanted in an honest way when you were young. Yeah.

137
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.160
<v 1>Um, I had a conversation with it's a push and pull man. Jonathan,</v>

138
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.680
hate about that. You know, he talks about the,

139
00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:37.320
the concept of free range kids. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; about,

140
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.830
he lets his chill wander. It was Jonathan hate, right. Was right.

141
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.230
The codling of the American mind. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

142
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.550
he lets his kids wander around New York city.

143
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.110
Like he lets his kids walk home from New York city. And you know,

144
00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:51.990
he was talking about one time his, uh,

145
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.310
his kid got a little lost and they were really, really scared. You know,

146
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.740
it was like they were trying to find him and it's like a tariff fine feeling.

147
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.340
But that ultimately the development that the child receives

148
00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:09.340
from being able to navigate the world on their own is very valuable,

149
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.860
but there's a risk. And so you like have to weigh this risk versus reward.

150
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.260
And the opposite of that is people do he helicopter parent.

151
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.770
And we know how that turns, right?

152
00:08:19.771 --> 00:08:23.810
That's not good when you overly coddle your kid and your, your,

153
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.250
your kid is not exposed to any sort of adversity or any sort of danger or any

154
00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:31.970
sort of adventure or any sort of, uh, independence that it,

155
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:32.850
it could be stifling.

156
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:37.450
And then it takes a long time for the child to develop outside of that parental

157
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.480
environment. Once they become free, they're like different kinds of kids, right.

158
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:44.560
There's kids that grow up in bad neighborhoods with very little parental

159
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.240
guidance and they're 18.

160
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.920
And then there's kids who grow up completely coddled and completely protected

161
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.680
and insulated and they're 18.

162
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.280
And then they run into each other totally different life experiences. Yeah.

163
00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.800
And I was the former, you know,

164
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.840
I was the kid that didn't have a lot of guidance when I was a kid and I was kind

165
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:05.200
of a lock key, a latchkey.

166
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.160
<v 0>Kid. That's I'm glad you just used that word.</v>

167
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.840
<v 1>Yeah. It's common word. Right? Common phrase. Well, apparently it's not.</v>

168
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.200
<v 0>No, I grew up with that word. Yeah. Key.</v>

169
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.440
I was commenting on how my wife and her,

170
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.710
her early years was a latchkey kid and she's like,

171
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.110
I haven't heard that word in a long time.

172
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.630
&lt;laugh&gt; like that used to be a word dude. Like latchkey.

173
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.350
<v 1>Kid. Yeah. You got a key, you got a key and you,</v>

174
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.390
you came home and no one was home, you know, when I was.

175
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.830
<v 0>12 Years old. I'm great. Yeah. Just, I mean,</v>

176
00:09:26.831 --> 00:09:29.230
it wasn't like five days ago someone was pointing out to me that that word

177
00:09:29.231 --> 00:09:30.070
doesn't get used anymore.

178
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.630
<v 1>Yeah. Well kids don't, I mean, it's like kind of a different thing.</v>

179
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.420
You really see 12 year old kids walking home with a key and opening up their

180
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:41.260
front door anymore. Yeah. I mean,

181
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.020
I think about my children and how young they are. And I,

182
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.020
I can't imagine them doing that, but I did that.

183
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.900
And I think that the independence that comes from being a kid who walks home

184
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:56.690
from school by yourself and opens your door by your herself and you know,

185
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.850
and then my parents didn't come home till, you know, whatever it was,

186
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:03.490
they worked till five and then they were home. I was out, I would go places,

187
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.890
no knew where the I was. There was no phones. There was no cell phones,

188
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.570
you know? Yeah. I could leave a, a little post-it note or something like that.

189
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.440
<v 0>It it's, it's been interesting to watch, um, as a parent, the way that you,</v>

190
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.800
that different parents find what dangerous things they're comfortable with. Mm.

191
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.640
Um, friends of mine, like my friend Kelly lives in New York. Right.

192
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.400
And she'll talk about, and we have similar mindsets,

193
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.330
um,

194
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:34.320
about ex exposing kids to risk and her kids will

195
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:38.870
take the subway. Right. Or whatever home. And to me, where I, where,

196
00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:42.550
where I live and have not had kids that age in a city, like,

197
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.670
I can't picture what she's getting at. You know what I mean? I, I go like, wow,

198
00:10:46.671 --> 00:10:51.470
that seems just kinda like crazy. Yeah. Like how old you, you responsible? Uh,

199
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:56.310
I'm trying to think how 14 and nine or 10 somewhere in there. Mm. Um,

200
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.620
and don't know they've been at it for a while, but either way,

201
00:10:58.621 --> 00:11:02.220
like things that some people would regard things that people from the outside

202
00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:04.820
would regard as like hard to picture mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, you sort,

203
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.660
but at the same time,

204
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:13.020
I expose my kids to like danger that I have decided is like an okay

205
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:16.300
danger to court. I'll expose 'em to being, you know,

206
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.330
they can be around on grizzly bears.

207
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:22.850
They can be on escorted in areas that have Mo a lot of mountain lines and bears.

208
00:11:22.851 --> 00:11:26.850
We take small boats out in the very big water. Um, we do all kinds of things,

209
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:32.250
but it it's like things that I've decided are, um, good risk.
