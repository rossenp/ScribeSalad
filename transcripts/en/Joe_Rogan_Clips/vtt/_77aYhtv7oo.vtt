Nothing can stop us nothing because we have some weird DNA bend

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.220
I uh, but you were you saying that standup wasn't sparking joy. Yeah.

19
00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.260
<v 0>When was it? It.</v>

20
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.180
<v 1>Wasn't sparking joy.</v>

21
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.970
<v 0>In the past. Yeah. In the last few mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know, in a while.</v>

22
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.050
Cause I'm so nervous. It's like, oh my God, I get so nervous cuz I,

23
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.210
I don't really know. I don't really know anymore. You know?

24
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.290
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't really the funny moved.

25
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.970
<v 1>I see what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it does.</v>

26
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.330
<v 0>And um, like I was saying,</v>

27
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.120
I need a line one killer line,

28
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.600
one killer opening line that encapsulates the entire

29
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.720
year. I've just lived through. Right, right.

30
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.960
I need that kind of a line or it's not gonna work for me, you know? Um,

31
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.520
cause everybody knows something happened. Sure. Yeah.

32
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.150
And I just don't talk about it that much. I can call everybody a and you know.

33
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.190
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; do you ever work with writers? Like stand standup writers? Yeah. No, I.</v>

34
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.270
<v 0>Want to, but all my friends are dead. Oh</v>

35
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.910
co-writing comic friends are dead.

36
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.430
I'm sure we connect to Israel and became COBA.

37
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.630
<v 1>You know, who would be great? Who Tony Hinch. Cliff. Who's.</v>

And he writes for roasts all the time. He's a big roast.

00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:43.690
Well some's and they're going, they're looking for a smack down.

54
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.920
I see this every and believe me when the day comes,

55
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.640
they will get their smack down from me, Joe. I believe that.

56
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:53.840
And it will not be like no smack down they've ever had before in their

57
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.360
privileged little lives.

58
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.280
&lt;laugh&gt; this will be your you're gonna raise your kids on welfare when I'm done

59
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:04.400
with your. Whoa kind of thing. Cuz I was raised on welfare. I was.

60
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.640
<v 1>As well. Were you? Yeah. Well until we were like 13,</v>

61
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.960
14 mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah.

62
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.320
<v 0>Did you get the government.</v>

63
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.200
<v 1>Cheese? We did. We didn't get the government cheese.</v>

64
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.680
<v 0>No. Hey, my dad used to take that whole five pound brick of cheese.</v>

65
00:03:15.681 --> 00:03:19.830
You know my dad was the greatest comic really &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. But crazy.

66
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.510
Like never knowing when to stop. Cause it stops being funny at a certain point.

67
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.550
Right. But keep pushing it and pushing it till somebody slaps you down.

68
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.150
Like yeah. It's that DNA thing that comics have it's bad.

69
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.110
It is bad. Like my friends, Sue mans. Remember her.

70
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.460
<v 1>Joe Sue angers. I do know the name. Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.020
<v 0>Well she was a kinder, kinder, whatever it was,</v>

72
00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:50.860
where they moved these Jewish children from Germany to England kinder

73
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.980
sport or something mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and uh, you know, to save them.

74
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.540
And she was one of those and uh,

75
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.450
her dad was a in Germany and it's just so it's so weird

76
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.450
how things go around and around and we'll get to what we're gonna talk about

77
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.210
today. But her dad was a comic in Germany, uh, you know, real funny,

78
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.370
real popular. And uh,

79
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.130
Hitler came and took over and he kept on telling the jokes. You know,

80
00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.090
he was telling the jokes,

81
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.000
wherever he went every little club doing the jokes and he was warn don't,

82
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.120
you know, switch up your joke, man, if you wanna keep working,

83
00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:30.280
switch that joke up to be, you know, not what you're saying,

84
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.200
you know, and he wouldn't do it.

85
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.840
And she said he even got louder and he was arrested and of course

86
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.950
murdered in Auschwitz, but she, he lived and she said, I said, what,

87
00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:46.070
what would you say to your dad? Now? She said, you know,

88
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.670
at a certain point it stops being funny, do something different, you know,

89
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.350
don't be, don't write it to the destructive.

90
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.630
Don't go all the else way over, you know, try, stay in the middle.

91
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.580
Don't destruct yourself for comedy.

92
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.500
<v 1>Isn't that the problem with some comics though,</v>

93
00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:07.060
like we don't really know where the line is until you cross it and then you go,

94
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:07.780
oh, I up.

95
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.180
I crossed the line mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but you're just trying to be funny.

96
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.100
Yeah. And that's, that's something that I think that noncoms,

97
00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:16.860
don't really understand when, when a comic up makes a mistake.

98
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.380
They're just trying to be funny. They're not trying to be mean. Yeah.

99
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.210
And they just missed, they missed. Right.

100
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:25.690
And it happens all the time because you're creating, you know, you're,

101
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:26.970
adlibbing, you're, you're,

102
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.250
you're basically improvising and that's a lot of what comedy is,

103
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.010
is improvising a line and trying to say something.

104
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:34.730
And in the moment you might think it's funny,

105
00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:38.370
but if you had more time to think about it, you might have said, oh,

106
00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.130
I shouldn't say it that way. People are gonna get it wrong.

107
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.640
Or maybe I should recorrect. But.

108
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.600
<v 0>But that's when you start being not funny. Cause self censorship,</v>

109
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:50.160
that's how they want us to be. They want us to like always be like,

110
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:52.600
should I say this? Or shouldn't I say this? And you know,

111
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.680
just like her dad there in Germany, you know, should I say this?

112
00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.440
Or should I say that? Or instead of, I guess the more intelligent of us go,

113
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.880
how can I say this and reach people? Yeah.

114
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.520
Cause you know, the people are thinking just like you cuz they're people too.
