00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.121
<v 2>You know,</v>

3
00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:07.890
I think one thing that young boys and men as well need in

4
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:11.550
this world is guidance and mentorship.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.800
And to get that from martial arts is one of the best ways and one of the most,

6
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.500
uh, one of the most fulfilling and satisfying way.

7
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:24.480
So w I I've found you from a video that a bunch of people sent me of

8
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:28.650
you working with a young boy who was having a hard time, uh,

9
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.490
dealing with the pain of like punching through a board, you know,

10
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.610
the video and just the way you were communicating with him and letting him know

11
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:38.070
that it's okay to cry and that, you know,

12
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:42.270
just express yourself and it was refreshing and it was authentic,

13
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.710
but it was also like, you could tell, like,

14
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.920
that kid is going to get a lot out of that exchange. And I was like,

15
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.203
I wanna meet.

16
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.111
<v 1>Oh yeah, man. I mean,</v>

17
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:53.730
that video opened my mind up to really what men were dealing with

18
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.630
inside because when that video went viral, our offices,

19
00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:00.000
that our nonprofit had to shut down. Okay.

20
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:04.290
So the cave of Adullam the martial arts program you're speaking of is under the

21
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:07.950
umbrella of our nonprofit, the union. And so when this video went viral,

22
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.490
my wife calls me who was ISO creative director. She says, Jason,

23
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:16.230
is there a video that's going viral? And I'm like, what do you mean 2016?

24
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:19.350
I didn't really understand the terminology. And sure enough,

25
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.160
this video started racking up a lot of views shortly thereafter,

26
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.090
our phones wouldn't stop ringing. And it was men from all over the world,

27
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.010
crying to our staff, calling and crying, saying, I want to be free.

28
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:33.750
I'm tired of holding all of this in.

29
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.710
I wish my coach would have talked to me that way when I was going through.

30
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.850
<v 0>Well, it's, it's hard to find a good mentor.</v>

31
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.560
And I think every man needs a mentor. And you know,

32
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:53.790
one of the things that martial arts does that I think is really important is it

33
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:56.250
gives you these goals to work towards,

34
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.230
as you move through a belt system or whatever kind of system that each

35
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.220
martial art that's different has as you develop your skills and you,

36
00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:09.690
you, you get more proficient and you improve you,

37
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:13.230
you have like tangible progress and you can see it.

38
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.200
And I think there's a lot of people that go through life.

39
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.590
Not exactly sure where they stand, where they're at.

40
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.840
And I think martial arts provides you with real feedback in one of the most,

41
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.860
I think one of the most emotionally and physically difficult things that a

42
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:29.694
person can do.

43
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.810
<v 1>Yes. And so many people don't realize the young boy in that video, Bruce,</v>

44
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.940
he was actually had a fear of failure.

45
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.420
He had broke that board easily the week prior,

46
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.720
but because of this test and the pressure and everyone watching,

47
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.470
he just froze on his non-dominant hand and he couldn't break through.

48
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.490
So he broke down crying, and I will welcomed his tears and said, look,

49
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:55.080
we cry as men, you know, let this go. And men and I love about martial arts,

50
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:56.370
more than sports.

51
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.970
It makes you face your fears and nothing like of a punch is coming at you,

52
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:01.361
a kick,

53
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.970
or if you're grappling and you concerned that someone's going to take your back

54
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.540
and choke you. I apply all these principles in life as well.

55
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.580
And so when you give a man or a male,

56
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.170
a safe space to really be emotional and let go of anxiety that he feels every

57
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.980
day, the father wound his fear of failure, his lack of confidence,

58
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.690
where he can have a moment.

59
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.410
We call it a moment on the mat where you can stop the training and you can

60
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:28.090
express. What's overwhelming you in that moment. They transform instantly man.

61
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:29.860
And it's a great thing to see.

62
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.690
And I've never seen anything work like the arts, even with my son,

63
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.990
he's 13 years old, you saw him, you know, six, one and a half.

64
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.050
Everyone says you're going to play basketball. And it's like, no,

65
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:44.620
there's other things that I want to do. And so even with sports, I say, son,

66
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.630
it'll give you some confidence. But when we spar, we, we training the anxiety.

67
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:53.650
He feels the voices. Uh, man, uh, Chris hits you again,

68
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.550
what are you going to do about that?

69
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:56.470
How are you going to maneuver how you're going to respond?

70
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.100
And I allow him to break down in that moment. I said, okay, cool.

71
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:04.510
Now it's time to recover, reflect on it. What's the lie. What's the truth.

72
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.840
Do you think this man is not supposed to hit you? He's a skill fighter.

73
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.310
The goal is not for you to be the best. The goal is for you to learn. All right.

74
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.510
So when I give them that freedom to feel, to feel the fear,

75
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.350
now they're not, they don't succumb to it when it really happens in real life.

76
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.520
And so that's why I love the arts, especially the grappling arts, which I hate.

77
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.880
I didn't discover it until later in my training,

78
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:32.590
because nothing likes someone invading your space. You know,

79
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:35.560
we can keep this, this striking and we're comfortable here,

80
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.640
but when someone invades your space or when a problem happens in your life where

81
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:42.760
it's so close and personal, that you can't just shake it,

82
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.730
you have to learn how to buy your time and maneuver,

83
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:47.380
and don't let it come around you.

84
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.680
Or you can get tapped out by the stress of that situation.

85
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.870
The arts is just amazing.

86
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:56.590
If it's taught in a way that men could apply it to life, how long,

87
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.290
how many years have you been mentoring young boys?

88
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.350
I would say almost 16, 17 years. And how did it get started? Um,

89
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.400
in 2000 and well, I founded a nonprofit in 2003.

90
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.990
And from there, uh, my father wasn't actively in my life, you know,

91
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.030
he was around, but wasn't there. And I had,

92
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:20.020
what's called a father wound and basically just an absence of a male figure in

93
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:24.190
my life specifically, my father, uh, he was verbally abusive. You know,

94
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:27.520
I could make, if I knocked this cup over, I would get cursed out, you know,

95
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:29.950
things like that. So I had to overcome a lot of that.

96
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.120
So in Detroit I saw a great need for, uh,

97
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.620
black boys to be mentored.

98
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.370
And so at first I started the cave of a Dublin was just martial arts,

99
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.030
but then I quickly discovered after these boot camps,

100
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.760
bootcamp programs kept failing over and over again.

101
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:49.480
And skill straight programs was that our boys didn't need more discipline.

102
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.620
They needed more love. So then I made the cable of a Della more comprehensive.

103
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:56.860
So I still use the arts focus on what works,

104
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.100
but also give boys a safe space to release the trauma they're dealing with in

105
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:03.590
their lives, the emotional pain, the lack of confidence,

106
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.950
all these other things that they're dealing with and give them this space where

107
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:10.010
they can release it and become strong. So that started,

108
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.720
I had my first pilot in 2008. And then after that, um,

109
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.010
2013, I was awarded a grant for, um, just, uh, developing the cave.

110
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.140
And that's when we just started going,

111
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.830
full-time at our own location and we haven't looked back.

112
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.360
Then we have almost 500 boys on our waiting list. Wow. Yeah. And,

113
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.090
um, you know, it was, it was interesting, Joe. I,

114
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.940
I thought it was just a black thing, you know, cause again,

115
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:36.140
if that's all you around,

116
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:39.800
you think that's the only youth that are dealing with these issues.

117
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.430
I had a group one time, it was multicultural, which was great.

118
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:46.970
It was my first time. And I saw white kids, you know,

119
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:50.990
that I cared about were struggling so much and weren't used to releasing what

120
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:51.824
they felt.

121
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.110
And one of them a direct message me a 16 year old, he says,

122
00:06:57.111 --> 00:07:00.920
Mr. Wilson, please don't ever forget about us because he was concerned because,

123
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.760
um, it was a lot of school shootings at the time.

124
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.250
He says a lot of times we were abused and we don't know how to process this

125
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:10.820
emotion.

126
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.940
Then we grab a gun and it's the only way we know how to express ourselves.

127
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.160
It's no different from a man who was volatile and abusive to his wife. You know,

128
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.810
I used to hit things in my home, Joe, I'm not proud of saying, you know,

129
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:27.350
my wife would say things that would trigger me and I would knock holes in the

130
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:31.730
wall just in anger because I didn't know how to express hurt or sadness,

131
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.600
or just feeling dismissed and passively dismissed for how I felt.

132
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.700
And as a result, I became a very unstable, uh, man, mentally,

133
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.980
emotionally. And, um, I was just what I call just a masculine male.

134
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:47.930
I wasn't comprehensive at the time.

135
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.480
And so I've saw a direct correlation when I allow a male that

136
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:57.650
freedom to feel, to be angry when you're upset,

137
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.870
but then teach you how to reset from that anger,

138
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:02.630
how to use that anger for good cause anger isn't bad.

139
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.380
It's only bad when it caught you allow it to make you do bad things.

140
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.290
The greatest statistic I love in our academy is that over 78% of our recruits

141
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.820
improve their grade point average by one letter grade without tutoring that's

142
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:19.250
because we allow them to be who they are inside.

143
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:20.930
Allow them to live from the good in their heart,

144
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.670
allow them to talk about the things they are experiencing at home to the things

145
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.900
they're experiencing at school.

146
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:31.370
We don't just go on to training in martial arts because then they could be great

147
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:35.690
that day in training physically, but leave. They're still mentally, uh,

148
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.910
traumatized or emotionally damaged.

149
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.440
And so the cave is just that it's a, it's a,

150
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.000
it's an Institute or an academy where we allow boys to feel, you know,

151
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:51.260
our mission is to teach, train and transform boys into comprehensive men,

152
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:53.870
men who are physically conscious, mentally astute,

153
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.620
but spiritually enough to navigate through the pressures of this world without

154
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.320
succumbing to their negative emotions. So.

155
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.700
<v 0>When you're doing this, you're,</v>

156
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:06.810
you're learning yourself and you're also teaching these kids.

157
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.420
So how much of a process was it to develop the curriculum,

158
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:17.220
to develop this program and to figure out what is the best way to address these,

159
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.570
these boys and their insecurities and their issues and how to,

160
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.810
how to give them, give them strength and give them love,

161
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.900
but also give them discipline. Also teach them how to,

162
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.030
how to get through work through pain, work through emotions. It must've been,

163
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:33.953
oh man. A lot of.

164
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.360
<v 1>It was a lot of trial and error. Um, more so Joe,</v>

165
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:42.120
I had to become transparent. Um,

166
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.850
in that moment when that video went viral,

167
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.180
none of my recruits really ever seen me cry. You know,

168
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:50.670
I was still just tough, man.

169
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.250
And at the time my mother was going through dementia.

170
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.120
So I'm still trying to develop this curriculum and saying, okay,

171
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:59.850
it's coming along, but it's still missing something.

172
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.430
And what it was missing was giving men the freedom to be vulnerable at

173
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:08.760
any given moment. And for them to feel that liberating power.

174
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:14.730
When my mother developed dementia, Joe, um, she was like my sensei,

175
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:18.900
man. Um, meaning the emotions that I could hide in martial arts training,

176
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:22.920
because where I came up, you couldn't express that, you know, they would,

177
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.570
you know, once school I was at,

178
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:27.270
they would just rush you to instructor would say everyone on Jason.

179
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.380
And you know, we would shake going into this school. Our hands would shake.

180
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.520
Cause it wasn't just grappling. We dealt with real knives. You getting kicked?

181
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:38.190
No pads, none of that man. But.

182
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.070
<v 0>It dealt with real knives. Yeah. So you're doing like knife.</v>

183
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.120
<v 1>Because this whole thing is like everything. He's a masterful teacher.</v>

184
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.660
A lot of this stuff is choreography. Okay.

185
00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:51.360
You see some of the gun defenses and things like that. It's like, come on, man,

186
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:55.890
that wouldn't work. The way he taught us is like, if someone has a knife,

187
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.280
you can get away go, oh, I think Jocko said the same thing.

188
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:01.260
If someone has a knife go the other direction.

189
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.300
But if you have to defend yourself,

190
00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:05.580
first thing you need to realize is that they should cut you.

191
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.630
If it's just your uncle drunk at a barbecue, they should cut you.

192
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.530
Can you deal with that pain and that emotion,

193
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:16.830
seeing your own blood run down your arm and still eliminate the threat.

194
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.100
So these things, we would practice with knives because he says,

195
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:23.430
if it's plastic in your head, what happens when the real one comes?

196
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.920
But I couldn't express really who, what was going on inside of me,

197
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:33.630
that would make me feel the fear. You know, the cave needed that element.

198
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:37.890
It needed to say, why are you pulling back? Why aren't you applying that armbar?

199
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:41.340
Why are you scared to get thrown when your partner needs you to practice his

200
00:11:41.341 --> 00:11:43.410
own? And we tie the throws,

201
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:48.060
especially judo throws to a fear of failure. Because as you know,

202
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:51.390
in judo, if you're not relaxed, when you take that fall,

203
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.400
it hurts significantly more in life.

204
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.260
If you don't just go with it and allow yourself the freedom to make a mistake or

205
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.930
freedom to fall or freedom to fail. When you hit that ground,

206
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:04.870
when you fail to hit that wall, it hurts that much more.

207
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:10.060
And so what I had to do was first allow my students to see what hurts

208
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:14.590
me. My mother had a stroke one day and my wife comes in and said, Hey,

209
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:18.760
you need to leave immediately. Your mom has had to get rushed to the hospital.

210
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.950
I start breaking down and all of my kids imagine all of them in the father's

211
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.910
Deere surround you, hug you and pray over. You just say, just hugging me.

212
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.100
And at that moment, I said, this is what they need.

213
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.050
They need to see a comprehensive man. Someone who's strong, but sensitive.

214
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.570
Someone who's courageous, but compassionate.

215
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.340
Someone who freely lives from the good in their heart and doesn't allow their

216
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:49.660
fears to stop them from living. When that happened, Joe,

217
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.940
these boys became not only greater at martial arts,

218
00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.160
but greater sons, greater community service, greater students,

219
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.580
able to deal with bullies. One of my students, a beautiful kid,

220
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:07.750
Josiah short curly hair, beautiful personality.

221
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.940
He was getting bullied at school,

222
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.840
but he thought it wasn't Christ-like you know,

223
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:16.300
or the Christian thing to do was to defend yourself. You know,

224
00:13:16.301 --> 00:13:18.790
you're supposed to take it. I'm like, I don't know where you got that from.

225
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.150
I said, if someone is trying to harm you to defend yourself.

226
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.770
So the bully grabs a one day, oh, Goshi he grabs him from behind. He throws him,

227
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.100
kick the legs out and slammed the bully down to the ground.

228
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.850
You would think he was celebrate just defending himself.

229
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.560
But what made Josiah the proudest was that before the bully hit the ground,

230
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:42.460
he pulled up on his hoodie to stop his head from hitting the seaman.

231
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.860
Wow. That's when I knew, I said,

232
00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:50.230
this is it where the good kids, the gentlemen,

233
00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:54.850
the kids were bullied and overlooked can defend themselves,

234
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.210
turn on the lion, but reset back to the lamp.

235
00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.880
No one wants to be a prowling all around defending and looking rough all

236
00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:08.050
the time. Having the hit of and being just in that fight or flight mode, 24 7,

237
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:13.300
someone tries to harm you. You defend yourself demonstrably, but you reset.

238
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:18.190
You don't ever allow your kind spirit to conform to something that's callous.

239
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.450
And so that's the main principle that we teach is,

240
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:27.340
do not live from your fears. Live from the goodness inside of you.
