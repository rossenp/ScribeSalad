<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.050
Develop these suits for people to wear around bears or these bear suits.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.740
They'll like these big metal suits with spikes popping out of them.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.610
Have you ever seen any of that? See me? You'll find those there.

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:18.150
Bear proof suits develop cheese. Yeah. Well,

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.950
I think they've developed. I think they started out in Siberia. He was wearing,

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.220
it does look for 2,500. That's a Siberian bear hunting suit.

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.690
So they literally developed a suit that's covered in spikes so that if the bear

9
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:37.440
tries to bite you, it hurts his teeth. I mean,

10
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:40.260
you got to have to ask that dude, but since we have his jacket,

11
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:44.940
I doubt he's alive. You know, I guess a good point. That's a good point.

12
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:46.530
Probably peeled them like an avocado.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.270
<v 1>That's going to be, that's going to be a Yeezy outfit. They six months.</v>

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.870
<v 0>It wasn't literally, I wasn't joking. When I said I looked at his jacket. Oh,</v>

15
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.053
wow.

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.100
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.200
<v 0>Oh, this was he. When he was on stage with a mask on.</v>

18
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.820
<v 1>He had a stocking cap on his face. That is what he's wearing.</v>

19
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.980
<v 0>We're in a bear hunting jacket. Wow. Wow. That is crazy.</v>

20
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.440
<v 1>And that jacket probably cost $3,000.</v>

21
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.690
<v 0>30,000. Yup.</v>

22
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.520
<v 1>What's so crazy. Is they going to buy it to Joe? Of course.</v>

23
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.240
And they going to buy that? Ma I keep telling black people. I say Kanye is rich.

24
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.620
He's a genius. Y'all can't walk around United States being black,

25
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.990
but that on your head, it's like, you got to rub the gas station.

26
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.490
If Tanya had food stamps, black people would buy it for $3,000 a pop. Not me.

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.720
<v 0>Connie's an unusual human and you're mad at him. No,</v>

28
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.860
his brain is firing at a different RPM than everybody. Else's

29
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.500
he's just going, like, he's probably simultaneously thinking about new products,

30
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.660
always thinking about new songs while I was thinking about,

31
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.830
he wants to re-imagine housing and wants to build houses. He wants to like,

32
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.970
develop like communities that are, are self-reliant communities,

33
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:02.130
where they grow their own food and use solar power on.

34
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.210
And the dude is just constantly going with new ideas constantly.

35
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.790
They're like still like a he's like, do you know?

36
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.980
There's there's people whose brains just don't work at the same speed as ours.

37
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.490
Right.

38
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.390
And that's one of those people and his just constantly trying to process things.

39
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:21.330
And he was saying that when they've tried to get my medication, they were like,

40
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.570
listen, you gotta get on medication. Like there, they tried to calm him down.

41
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:29.470
But the medication made him, he, he, he started getting [inaudible].

42
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.170
<v 1>He looked different. He looked slow. He looked unhappy.</v>

43
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.570
And you know, like he, I mean, he,

44
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.190
it was a droopiness to his face. And I remember the black committee,

45
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.750
like what the is Kanye. Hell.

46
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.830
<v 0>Wow. You.</v>

47
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.490
<v 1>Know? But then when he got out of it, he came alive.</v>

48
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.100
I don't know why he put the stocking cap on his head,

49
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.460
but I guarantee you he's across the top.

50
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.180
And you won't see a whole bunch of people with ski masks on.

51
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.710
<v 0>Well, in this day and age where everybody has to wear a mask,</v>

52
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.060
that's the solution. And here's.

53
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.710
<v 1>The solution for us.</v>

54
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.800
<v 0>Kim was wearing one too. She was, she wore one to show the whole deal.</v>

55
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:13.600
Her kids were like, what the are you wearing? Mommy?

56
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.510
<v 1>You paid three. You'll pay 3000 for your makeup. And now you got on a screw cap.</v>

57
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.350
<v 0>I wonder how many people are gonna wear those bear hunting suits around now.</v>

58
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:22.770
Now.

59
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.710
<v 1>People going by a.</v>

60
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.743
<v 0>Hundred.</v>

61
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.250
<v 1>Well, when you like, or notice you buy them, look, I'm not even be unsay size,</v>

62
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.460
but I find myself waiting on an avid park shoe. I can't wait.

63
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.080
would be unsafe shooting. She dropped,

64
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.000
but waiting on avid POL to drop some. You hear me?

65
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.160
I have four phones on the laptop going,

66
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.590
I got to get me a pair of avid pod shoes.

67
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.320
<v 0>When Kanye came on the podcast, before he came on,</v>

68
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.680
w w there was one point in time where he wanted to redesign my studio.

69
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.460
He's like, I want to redesign a studio. Want to do it somewhere else?

70
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:58.690
We're going to redesign. I was like, oh, okay. But then, uh, Jamie got COVID.

71
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.010
Jimmy was not there for the Kanye interview, unfortunately. So he, uh,

72
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.400
so we had looked, man, we just lost our producer. We got to do it in our studio.

73
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:10.060
So he did it and in here in our old studio, but he did not like it.

74
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.520
He did not like this static. So the old studio was like,

75
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:16.930
his mind is always thinking about design. And, and when he told me this,

76
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:20.470
I was like, okay. And so then all of a sudden we're on FaceTime.

77
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.040
He starts showing me sketches that he already has of the new studio that he

78
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:27.760
wants to design. He was making a studio like a womb, like this big,

79
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.770
crazy studio. He had this, these wild ideas. Like his brain is on. It's like,

80
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:35.030
he's on jet fuel, just constantly going.

81
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.310
But that's why he can do all the that he does. It's not a normal mind.

82
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.540
<v 1>He had two listening parties. Did he drop the album yet? I don't think so.</v>

83
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.520
And I still ain't dropped out and people, well,

84
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.710
what the can you it's like crack to him now?

85
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.900
<v 0>What he does. He gets everybody excited about things. He's a genius. Yeah.</v>
