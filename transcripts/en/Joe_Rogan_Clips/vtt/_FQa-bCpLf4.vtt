00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.920
I have this sober October group text that I'm in with Uh-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; Ari,

3
00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:09.680
shapfi Burt Chrysler and Tom sgarra and it's ridiculous. Yeah.

4
00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:13.720
Sometimes it's so re it's sometimes it's so ruthless and so ridiculous.

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.600
I just go, oh. I'm in a few of those texts. Yeah, me too. And texts,

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.920
group texts with other comics are the Best's.

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.753
<v 1>So great.</v>

8
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.310
I also have a group text that's with a couple of my female friends and like that

9
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:29.670
one I'll look away from my phone and then I'll look back a minute or two later

10
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.310
and there's be like 96 &lt;laugh&gt; texts. And I'm just like, what happened?

11
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.870
And there's three different conversations going on.

12
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.510
<v 0>Simultaneously. Yeah, I can't do that. It's I don't understand that.</v>

13
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.453
It's really.

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.780
<v 1>Like I, being, being friends with women is a lot of work.</v>

15
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.233
Mm.

16
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.940
<v 0>It's. Like, do you prefer being friends with men?</v>

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.860
<v 1>I, I love being friends with men.</v>

18
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.940
I also love being friends with women because there's stuff that they,

19
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.980
you can talk to them about that just like either you can say it to men,

20
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:02.410
but they're not gonna have the in depth discussion about it that you want it to

21
00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:06.370
happen. Mm. You know, like women will just indulge each other and be like,

22
00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:11.370
but how did he say it? &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, &lt;laugh&gt; like,

23
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.250
oh, he put a period. Like, was there a period after the text and HES, like,

24
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:18.490
yeah. There's a period. Well then, yeah. I don't think that's good. Yeah. If he.

25
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.680
<v 0>Just left it open, maybe it's casual. You know what,</v>

26
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:25.720
how many times have you ever a conversation when someone just writes something

27
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.000
like, sure. Yes. Like what does that mean? I do it all the, what does.

28
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.040
<v 1>Sure mean I do it accidentally sometimes I'll be like, yeah, sure. Well, no,</v>

29
00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:34.880
I don't wanna say yeah. I'll just say sure.

30
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.120
<v 0>Right. Do you want to go there? Sure. Okay. She's mad. Yeah. She's mad. Sure.</v>

31
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.710
<v 1>But sure mean, sure. Sounds like a fight is about to happen. Yeah, sure.</v>

32
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.133
<v 0>Sure.</v>

33
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.310
<v 1>You always decide. You always.</v>

34
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.350
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; another like more aggressive would be fine. Fine. Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:55.550
Do you wanna go there? Fine. Oh fine. Yeah. that? I'm in trouble.

36
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.750
Fine's not, I' got a lot of trouble. Fine's not good. You go, go to pick her up.

37
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.870
She's not smiling. Like what are we doing? &lt;laugh&gt; should we do this?

38
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:02.704
Should we stay home?

39
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.860
<v 1>Fine. If you wanna fight,</v>

40
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:08.420
let's just do it now and not wait till we get to the restaurant. &lt;laugh&gt; well.

41
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.300
<v 0>What's fine. The. Does that mean?</v>

42
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.380
<v 1>I also think it's good for men when women have a lot of female friends,</v>

43
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.580
because like, oh, good.

44
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:19.340
For the either person you're dating or married to you should want your

45
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:22.780
girlfriend to have a couple female friends so that she can have the

46
00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:26.610
conversation. Oh yeah. With like the more I think about relationships,

47
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.250
the more I'm like no men and women, like a husband and wife,

48
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:35.970
shouldn't be having all of those discussions. Like he doesn't wanna hear it.

49
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.610
He doesn't wanna hear it,

50
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.410
have it with your girlfriends and then just talk to him about whatever else.

51
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.313
Like.

52
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.880
<v 0>Yes. Like couldn't agree more. It's it's.</v>

53
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.120
<v 1>It's an unrealistic.</v>

54
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.800
<v 0>Expectation.</v>

55
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.120
I go on double dates with my wife and her and her friend mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

56
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:52.120
and me and the, and it winds up being two different conversations.

57
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.000
I get stuck with a husband mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and she's talking to her friend,

58
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.240
like, oh my God. So cute. Oh my God. Did he say that? Oh my God. Oh my God.

59
00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:02.800
Oh my God. Yeah. Like just have these, these rambling girl conversations. I go,

60
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.840
Hey, Hey, let's have one conversation. Yeah.

61
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.560
We can't do this two conversations things. Yeah. And it's.

62
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.160
<v 1>Like, it's so it's so nice to have like the girls just to be like, yeah,</v>

63
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.080
I get to indulge the girl side of myself that like.

64
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.910
<v 0>Right. That's that's a thing. That's a real thing. &lt;affirmative&gt; it's a.</v>

65
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.790
<v 1>Real thing. Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.910
<v 0>Yeah. Like some,</v>

67
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.590
some people wanna pretend that men and women are the same thing.

68
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.270
<v 1>This is,</v>

69
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.150
I think that's such a detriment to both men and women like saying that women are

70
00:03:29.151 --> 00:03:31.310
the same as men. It's like, well, we're not,

71
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.030
but also why do we want to be right?

72
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.190
<v 0>Why is that happening?</v>

73
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.980
<v 1>Why is that even the standard, right? Like just let women be what you are. Yes.</v>

74
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.540
And men can be what they are.

75
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.060
And then there's some people that do float in the middle, but like, well.

76
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.980
<v 0>I think it all gets conflated with equal rights. Well like equality,</v>

77
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.460
equal rights, equal laws, equal, you know, willingness to,

78
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.020
to try different jobs, those kinds of things. Yeah.

79
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:59.460
And then we decide that men and women are not any different and that the,

80
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.610
these are all cultural creations and these are,

81
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:07.050
these are things that are concocted by society. Right.

82
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.050
<v 1>And I think, I mean, I think it's kind of,</v>

83
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.450
it's bad for women when we say, well, we're just the same as men,

84
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.410
because it's like, you're saying with that sentence,

85
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.200
that men are correct. And when you start,

86
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:26.160
finally start to think of us as men, as the same as men now we're correct too.

87
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.793
Hmm.

88
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.240
<v 0>Well, what I like to say is that men and women, aren't math. Exactly.</v>

89
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.920
We're not equal. We're different things. Yeah. It's not,

90
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.520
it's not an equality thing.

91
00:04:35.521 --> 00:04:38.640
You make all the people like there will never be equal to you.

92
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.270
You make every human ever made is made in a woman's body. Exactly.

93
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.270
This, this whole thing though, is weird to me because I'm like,

94
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:46.991
where did this come from?

95
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:51.310
This didn't exist before the equal rights thing existed before. Yeah. But this,

96
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.173
that, that,

97
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.590
it's some sort of a cultural creation that women are different than men,

98
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.900
that this is, uh, something that society has sort of impose on women.

99
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.300
Like no women, like different things. Yeah.

100
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.340
<v 1>And like, we, like,</v>

101
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.140
we just sometimes just like to be around each other, which men,

102
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.460
I think sometimes just like to be around each other too. Oh yeah. For sure.

103
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.620
You know, like, it's like, I can hang out with the boys. No problem.

104
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.340
I grew up with older brothers, you know,

105
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:21.970
like all I ever did was hang out with boys, but now,

106
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.450
like I also see so much value in just getting to be with girls.

107
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.490
<v 0>Yeah. You should. I mean it's and, and men do with men.</v>

108
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:34.610
There's a lot of stuff that men like that women don't a lot of women don't have

109
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.370
interest in. Yeah. Yeah. And that's okay, it's fine. But this idea,

110
00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:41.930
like that's toxic, like toxic masculinity, like, oh,

111
00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:43.480
the nonsense that we hear today,

112
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.040
it's all exactly what we were talking about before,

113
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.440
where people trying to control people and define people. Yeah.

114
00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:49.720
And it's the same thing. It's.

115
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.680
<v 1>Like, I think that's one of the reasons you see it a lot,</v>

116
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.640
especially online from white women.

117
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.520
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because we wanna have power, you know, like we wanna,

118
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.560
we wanna be able to, and I mean,

119
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.480
us being able to tell other people what they can and cannot do or say

120
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.440
is us just being like, yep. That's our power. Now.

121
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.280
We might never be better than white men, you know,

122
00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:16.000
but we can at least control mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what you get to say about us.

123
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.110
Mm. And I think as soon as white women are like, yeah,

124
00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:23.110
we do like to have control. Then we'll be like, thank you.

125
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.750
Let's dismantle all of this. &lt;laugh&gt; it's the same.

126
00:06:27.751 --> 00:06:30.470
It's the same kind of toxic masculinity, you know? Like, it's just like,

127
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.870
it's all toxic. Yeah. You know, like, how dare you tell what black people,

128
00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:36.510
how to feel about, you know,

129
00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:39.980
like what joke we can and cannot say about black people. Did you ask any of 'em?

130
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.220
You know, like, I you'll see it.

131
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.900
I'm sure you see it at stand up shows where there's like white women with their

132
00:06:45.901 --> 00:06:47.820
arms crossed. And then like,

133
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.700
when you start talking about race and then black people who are laughing and

134
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:53.380
you're like, they're like,

135
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:55.820
you shouldn't be able to tell jokes about black people like that. It's like,

136
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.380
did you.

137
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.250
<v 0>Look? Well, I think lot of it too,</v>

138
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.970
is people working in offices all day where they're constantly suppressed, right?

139
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.451
Like the,

140
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:05.970
the way you communicate it in an office is so vastly different than the way a

141
00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:08.290
comma communicates on stage in front of a nightclub. Yeah.

142
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.250
It's so different that most people,

143
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.330
the vast majority of their day is under the spell of human resources. Right.

144
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.200
You know, they're, they have this imposed standard of communication. That's,

145
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.480
it's not how they wanna talk. It's not how they wanna behave and think like,

146
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:27.000
look, and also men and women working together is strange.

147
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.960
It's strange. And anybody says, it's not strange,

148
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:32.080
never worked with women and men together. Right.

149
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:35.120
Because people get attracted to each other. People get petty,

150
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:40.110
people get jealous, people get flirty, people get, people get controlling.

151
00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:42.470
They play social games with each other. Yeah.

152
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.430
<v 1>And like, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like,</v>

153
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.630
you can't even broach the subject now. Right. Because people are like,

154
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.270
it's not an issue. And I'm like, no, there are so many issues.

155
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.550
It's fraught with issues. Yes. Like, let's talk about it. Like, okay. Yeah.

156
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:57.590
There's a lot of sexual harassment that happens in offices,

157
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.820
but there's also a lot of legit tointimate relationships that happen in offices.

158
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.100
Yeah. Like there's flirting. There's one night stands. There's you know,

159
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.460
like all of.

160
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.420
<v 0>This is happening. People get married and have kids, people.</v>

161
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.220
<v 1>People for a while and then they might hate each other,</v>

162
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.060
but they still gotta figure out how to work together.

163
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.900
<v 0>That happens all the time. All the time.</v>

164
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.490
The hilarious thing is when that happens and there's a boss and someone who's

165
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:23.690
below them. Yeah. They'll say, oh, he abused his power.

166
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.010
<v 1>And again, I, I look at it from my perspective where I'm like,</v>

167
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.250
I'm attracted to men who are good and powerful.

168
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.810
So if I were gonna have,

169
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.570
if I worked in an office and my boss was really good looking

170
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.200
and I was attracted to him and there was a chemistry and we started sleeping

171
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.920
together. Woo. Like, that's what I wanted. &lt;laugh&gt; and then, you know, like,

172
00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:47.630
like.

173
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.520
<v 0>Yeah, this is like, you're gonna get canceled just for saying that a hundred.</v>

174
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.560
<v 1>Percent &lt;laugh&gt; you can't.</v>

175
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.000
<v 0>Say that. You can't say that you wanna be with someone powerful and uh,</v>

176
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.160
someone who's, uh, who holds something over you. Yeah. I do see.

177
00:08:58.161 --> 00:09:00.400
So you should the janitor. Be a good person. Yeah.

178
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.480
<v 1>I mean, if he's really hot, you know, I might get ever shot pretty.</v>

179
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.280
<v 0>Anyway. Oh, well you could hook him up.</v>

180
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.360
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; we get married now theres the whole thing. Yes.</v>

181
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.520
<v 0>But take it seriously. It's it's important for his culture. &lt;laugh&gt; don't be.</v>

182
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.910
<v 1>An. I about it. I'm his, I'm his, uh I'm and there you go. I do think like,</v>

183
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.710
I do see it now, and this is a weird thing, but like super feminist women.

184
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.670
I do see a lot of them kind of dating.

185
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.510
Like jawless like kind of pushover

186
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.030
guys. Yeah. And I'm like, I'm like, oh,

187
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.780
maybe they're maybe they're the women I'm talking. They're like, no,

188
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.900
I found these short, I found these soft bone men, you know, like.

189
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.060
<v 0>Jawless is a fun way to describe it. They're so jawless.</v>

190
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.083
<v 1>Jawless.</v>

191
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.100
<v 0>Jawless men. That's such a bummer,</v>

192
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.380
but really bad jeans like that. Like, Ooh.

193
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:52.100
There's not a God thing they can do about that.

194
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.380
<v 1>No, I don't. I don't think you can get a new jaw. You.</v>

195
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.490
<v 0>Can give you a jaw surgery that could like try to grow your jaw out with like</v>

196
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.250
the cut your jaw and break it. And Ugh.

197
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.570
&lt;laugh&gt; I know a lady who got a chin. She had a chin,

198
00:10:07.571 --> 00:10:11.610
like mm-hmm She didn't wanna keep it chin. No, she didn't wanna keep it.

199
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.730
So she got a, a chin implant.

200
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.760
I think they might have done something to her actual jaw itself too.

201
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.120
But it was one of those very unfortunate chins mm-hmm.

202
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
<v 1>&lt;Affirmative&gt; you know? And then she, what couldn couldn't eat for? Like.</v>

203
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.440
<v 0>I don't know. They put a piece of plastic or something where a chin,</v>

204
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.400
like it used to go in too far. Yeah. And then it came out a little bit.

205
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.680
Did she have syphilis? I don't know. I didn't ask. I didn't know her that well,

206
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.510
she told me she had a chin implant. I was like, what, what you on a what?

207
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.870
Like your jaw. She didn't like the shape of her jaw.

208
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.390
So she got her jaw reworked.

209
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.190
<v 1>Well, some of these guys should get, look.</v>

210
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.550
<v 0>Into that. I don't think there's much she can do.</v>

211
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.710
If you have a tiny little jaw &lt;laugh&gt;. That's a bummer.

212
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:52.950
But.

213
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.670
<v 1>Yeah. Working with men and women working, together's like,</v>

214
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.620
there's a way to figure it out, but it's FRT with complications.

215
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.280
<v 0>It is.</v>

216
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.860
And the real issue is people holding things over you in order to get you to

217
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:06.980
sleep with them. It's not you a hundred percent.

218
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.900
You being someone who works for someone who's legitimately attracted to this

219
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:12.740
guy, and then you get together. It's still, if I was running a company, I'd say,

220
00:11:12.741 --> 00:11:16.540
Hey, don't each other. You. I'm trying to make money. Right. You know.

221
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.690
<v 1>I, I don't and I don't want, yeah. Like.</v>

222
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:24.530
<v 0>I don't wanna, and I can't, I can't condone it legally. Right, right.</v>

223
00:11:24.531 --> 00:11:28.650
Cause if I say, yeah, what are you banging your secretary, right. Yeah.

224
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.770
Take a picture. Come on. You know, like, what am I gonna say? You,

225
00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:36.410
you would have to say that it's in the rules and regulations.

226
00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:37.230
You would have to say,

227
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.960
but it's there no way you can tell me that it's not possible for a man

228
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.800
and a woman who working together and the guy's the boss and the woman works

229
00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:47.560
under him and they fall in love and they have an amazing relationship. It.

230
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.200
<v 1>Happens all the time. It does bill and me gates. Ooh. She worked at Microsoft.</v>

231
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.320
Ooh. That piece of bills.

232
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.520
<v 0>A piece of. I mean, he's a power hungry piece of. Abused his.</v>

233
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.360
<v 1>Power. And you can see it. When you look at him, it's basically rape. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

234
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.640
<v 0>It's basically rape. Basically. He got power over her basically. Yeah.</v>

235
00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:05.440
He has power. He's.

236
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.273
<v 1>Actually been aprisoner.</v>

237
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.720
<v 0>Oh my God. I can't believe this. We gotta give her half of that.</v>

238
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.590
A hundred billion dollars that he has out of that. But that's like ivory tower.

239
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.070
<v 1>Of course this happens.</v>

240
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.390
<v 0>Of course. Yeah, of course it happens. Yeah. It's what the real issue is.</v>

241
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.710
Someone's sexually harassing you.

242
00:12:21.711 --> 00:12:26.310
Like some guy was holding a promotion over your head saying that he wants you to

243
00:12:26.311 --> 00:12:29.870
sleep with him or making lude comments and make you feel disgusted. Right.

244
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.550
Or you show up to work and you're not interested in that person at all.

245
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.980
You just to wanna do your job and they're making comments about your breasts or

246
00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:37.380
your legs or your mouth or.

247
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.180
<v 1>Oh, the mouth comments are the worst. What?</v>

248
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.820
They're somehow creepier than like the breasts or the butt.

249
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.620
It's just like your mouth. Oh.

250
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.700
<v 0>Stop it. Just picture him with his, just fly down. Pantst still on. Oh, his car.</v>

251
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.330
<v 1>Oh God. Oh, look at that little man out. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

252
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.570
stop talking about my mouth. &lt;laugh&gt;.

253
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.170
<v 0>There's no, the problem is there's no equivalent with men.</v>

254
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.570
There's no one thing that a woman could say to a man that makes him feel like a

255
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:07.370
piece of meat like that, like, like humiliating. They're you.

256
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.450
<v 1>It's so hard to sexually harass men because they're in those so much of it.</v>

257
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.610
Yeah. Would like it. Yeah.

258
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.040
<v 0>Yeah. Especially if we're attracted to you, you sexually harass.</v>

259
00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:20.240
Like if your boss yeah. Is like, you want this job, you gotta eat.

260
00:13:20.241 --> 00:13:21.920
My pussy'd be like, oh, &lt;laugh&gt;.

261
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.920
<v 1>Just do this here or later. Or &lt;laugh&gt; you on that.</v>

262
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.880
<v 0>Desk right now? How much am I getting?</v>

263
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.520
How much of a raise are we talking about here?

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.680
<v 1>Can I also get a couple reserv vacation days? How many days.</v>

265
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.510
<v 0>Do I get and how many can I.</v>

266
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.470
<v 1>Get? Does it depend on the performance? Yeah. Right, right, right.</v>

267
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.630
<v 0>Like what if I really know what I'm doing? &lt;laugh&gt; could we do this a lot?</v>

268
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.670
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; she's like, well, let me see. I don't know.</v>

269
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.990
I'll give you a performance review.
