00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:03.663
<v 2>There's uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.160
occasionally you'll see a fighter that does something very artistic and

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.120
striking that sort of elevates the standard. Like,

5
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:15.280
did you see the Derek Lewis Cy go fight? No, no.

6
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.240
You need to see that there's.

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.880
<v 0>A knockout that Derek Lewis got a knockout, right?</v>

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.790
<v 1>Noy go beat the out of him. Oh. He shut him out. He shut him out.</v>

9
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.390
Like it was a shutout for, I think, I think he stopped him in the third,

10
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.590
but I meany gone. Who's six foot

11
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.110
five, two hundred and forty seven pounds moves like 170 pounder. It's crazy.

12
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.940
He's he's bounced, like wonder boy, like bouncing like this,

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500
the entire fight. Bouncing, throwing faints,

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.900
like completely changed the standard of heavyweight striking.

15
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.620
And I'm not exaggerating. I watched it three times. I watched it today. In fact,

16
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.420
I watched it in the gym today while I was working out so better than.

17
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.180
<v 0>Like in God, in terms of movement, in terms of he's like the best,</v>

18
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.330
the moving heavyweight.

19
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.050
<v 1>There's no question. He is the best moving heavyweight I've ever seen.</v>

20
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.450
No question the best moving. It doesn't mean that like,

21
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.530
this is the way he fights, like, look at how he like interesting.

22
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.490
Every time Derek Lewis goes to set up to move towards,

23
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.320
Himy gone is nowhere to be found. He lit Derek us up man. And Eric,

24
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.960
every time Derek Lewis comes to him, like, look at that jab.

25
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.280
I mean his movement in terms of closing the distances, spectacular,

26
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.160
look at that front leg, front kick to the body.

27
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.880
And I was severely impressed. I mean,

28
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.840
he had beaten a lot of really good guys. Like he beat Jaren, you Rosen strike.

29
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.910
He beat ju dos. I whose best days are behind him. But you know, he's,

30
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.190
he's beaten some very, very good fighters,

31
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.270
but to watch the way he beat Derek Lewis,

32
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.110
who's a legit one punch knockout threat,

33
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.990
and the technical acumen that he showed the skill,

34
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.870
the technique, the footwork, the movement, the understanding of distant,

35
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.860
the ability to control everything that happened inside the octagon was

36
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:08.780
spectacular. That's art. I,

37
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:12.580
it changed my opinion of how it would a fight with him and Francis and Ghana

38
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:14.180
would go down at first.

39
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.180
My thought is that Francis and Ghana has the nuclear option with everybody. He,

40
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.340
he has such power. So, so does Derek Lewis. So does Derek Lewis,

41
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.890
but Francis and Gono.

42
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.530
<v 0>He has the hydrogen bomb. Derek Lewis.</v>

43
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.450
<v 1>Is the atomic. Well, they both, they both have crazy one punch power,</v>

44
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.010
but when you watchy go, you go, man,

45
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.010
how the does anybody it's?

46
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:41.890
It's like Francis has excellent technique.

47
00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:43.930
Francis has ridiculous power,

48
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.480
but he doesn't have the movement that go has the question is can Francis

49
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.080
deal with the movement and,

50
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.040
and maybe threaten him in a way that Derek Lewis didn't figure out how to,

51
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:57.800
and that's what makes the fight so interesting. Yeah, but the,

52
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.960
the way that guy moves is something special, man. It's, I mean,

53
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:03.720
you only saw like little highlights of it there,

54
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.680
but I've watched it pretty carefully in the three times that I watched it. I,

55
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.320
I can't think of a single heavyweight that I've ever seen move like that.

56
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.720
And there's no flaws in his clinch game. He understands like how to,

57
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.150
how to avoid the take down. He understands puling.

58
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.270
He understands distance and where he is safe, where he is not safe and,

59
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.070
and what to look for when he is pulling out of the clinch to not get hit.

60
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.750
It's really amazing, man.

61
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.110
He's on a real high level and he's undefeated. So I think he's not,

62
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.950
I think he's nine and oh, now or 10 and oh, so he is gonna get a title shot.

63
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.940
Well, he's the interim hip V eight champion now. Oh, that was for the,

64
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.500
for the heavy champion, which is weird. Right?

65
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.980
Cause like in Ghana just won the title. He's not injured.

66
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.820
It's just like the UFC and in Ghana were, it's some sort of a weird impase.

67
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.700
So they decided to make a, uh, interim title, which brings up all sorts of,

68
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.420
you know, ethical discussions about what is,

69
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.250
what is an interim title? When is it? If, if the organization could just decide,

70
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.690
oh, the negotiations aren't going so well,

71
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:10.170
we're just gonna have an interim title, right? Like how many months after the,

72
00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:15.010
like, when did he fight Steve bay? When did Francis and Ghana fight?

73
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.690
Steve bay let's take 2020. Was it?

74
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.560
I think so it was definitely during the pandemic because it was at the, uh,

75
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.760
this November or something like that. It was at the, uh, apick center,

76
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.120
March 27th, 2021. Yes. Yeah. So it feels like way longer ago.

77
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.120
Five months ago. Yeah. Five. Okay. Five is long. That's kind of crazy. Yeah.

78
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.670
You know, like how much time do you give a guy before, you know,

79
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.470
he defends his title. The difference in boxing is so different. Like boxers go,

80
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.550
they long stretch and boxers enter into negotiations and negoti like Caleb plant

81
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.630
and Canella Avarez,

82
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:55.470
they've been dancing back and forth as to whether or not they're supposed to

83
00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:58.510
fight and the negotiations fall apart and they, they come back together again.

84
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:02.460
And now they're supposedly in negotiations again for November, you know,

85
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.380
boxing is so different. Watch the entire episode for free only on Spotify.
