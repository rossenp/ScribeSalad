00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.370
<v 1>So what do you do now in terms of like you got over this five</v>

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:11.880
years ago, you're in this bad situation where your body's not working right now,

4
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.170
everything's working great. Again.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.870
<v 2>Heart surgeries also. Whoa. So you know, it was on your heart.</v>

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.900
So I had a hole in it. So, you know,

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.020
you're not supposed to have a hole in your heart and be a seal and it would be

8
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:29.880
born with it. I was born with it, it went undetected and me pushing so hard.

9
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:34.590
So in 2009, Australian fish race across America. And,

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.720
um, I just couldn't go anymore.

11
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.220
Another pitfall in my life was the hole and I was pretty much off active duty

12
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:44.760
seal for three years. You know, I had to harsher them trying to fix it.

13
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.600
So the hole was significantly large. Okay. How big is it?

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.490
They say it was as big as a quarter. I'm like,

15
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:52.050
how the hell is the biggest a quarter? Yeah. That's,

16
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.110
that's a pretty big hole in your heart. Cause they had two helix patches.

17
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:58.500
I'm like, that's impossible that the helix patches they're in my heart.

18
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.970
So the two stance, what is a helix patch? It is like a, a little mesh.

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.120
<v 1>Very like what they do for hernias. Like something like maybe.</v>

20
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.953
<v 2>Something like that.</v>

21
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.260
So they went up through my femoral artery and they placed this patch.

22
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:12.720
But to go through your artery. Yeah. They went through my, for more artery.

23
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.680
Yeah. It was a.

24
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.700
<v 1>Camera. Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.270
<v 2>No, the camera was down through my throat. Whoa.</v>

26
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.170
And they put this catheter through my femoral artery that went to my heart.

27
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.603
They,

28
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.140
they went and they took this helix patch that they placed it in there.

29
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.770
And then they found out six months later that the hole wasn't covered up enough

30
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:35.790
yet. Cause the hole was this, I mean in the helix patch was very big.

31
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.670
So they put, go back in there in 2010.

32
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.130
<v 1>How does the patch adhere to your heart?</v>

33
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.650
<v 2>I guess your heart heals around the patch.</v>

34
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.020
<v 1>So, but how did they stick and in place? I.</v>

35
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.520
<v 2>I guess they put it where the holes at and then it kind of like inflates,</v>

36
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.140
oh wow. Where the hole is at.

37
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.610
And then that thing goes in there and then it kinda covers the hole and then the

38
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:57.444
heart.

39
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.780
So there's two things in my heart right now that the heart is kind of covered

40
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.620
up. Whoa.

41
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.390
<v 1>Okay. So here's it. Jamie's got a, an image of it for us.</v>

42
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.310
Whoa. So, so it's attached to this little probe,

43
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.260
right? And then they put it over the area where the injury is. Wow.

44
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.094
That's insane.

45
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.760
<v 2>Yeah. Atrial septum defect. I had atrial septal defect.</v>

46
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.550
So basically everything I had done, I got from.

47
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.390
<v 1>Medicine. Oh.</v>

48
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.520
<v 2>Crappy done. I'll be.</v>

49
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.710
<v 1>Done. That's so crazy that they could do that.</v>

50
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.310
<v 2>Yeah. So I was out for, um, I was off active duty for three years. So I stuck,</v>

51
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.840
I was in, uh,

52
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.700
a recruiting area for three years trying to get back on active duty and that's,

53
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.990
that was my life for three years.

54
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.640
<v 1>So they put that patch in. Yep. And now your heart's a hundred percent. It's.</v>

55
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.810
<v 2>Present as a hundred percent. Wow. Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah.</v>

56
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.530
I was losing blood and I was this, I was a bad.

57
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.190
<v 1>Add off,</v>

58
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.190
which is amazing that you were able to do all that with a hole in your heart.

59
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.770
<v 2>For the doctors were saying, you know, cause they ain't know I was a seal.</v>

60
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.640
So I went in and the doctor that found the hole are like, so they'd gave me,

61
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.350
EKG is all this stuff. Once again, man. It's after I ran like 200,

62
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:11.650
five miles, you know like, man, you're in great shape. I'm like, man,

63
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.970
I just don't feel good. Like walking up the stairs is making me jacked up.

64
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.230
So the doctor, doc Shrek, he's like, you know, it gave me EKG. He goes,

65
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.970
go to the doctor, get an echocardiogram. So I'm in there getting echocardiogram,

66
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.400
just chilling out in there. And the guy's talking to me,

67
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.850
he has this little wand in my heart. We're bullshitting the boss stuff. And he,

68
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.020
when people get quiet, that's not good man.

69
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.830
So he's in there and his head is one of my heart chilling out. Yeah man,

70
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:43.150
what are you doing? Yo, what's going on there? Like,

71
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.040
and he says, I'll be right back. He goes and gets a doctor. Doctor comes in,

72
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.790
puts things on my heart. The doctor gets another doctor.

73
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.750
Now I'm just freaking the out. I'm like, okay.

74
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.640
Cause when it comes to your heart, you know, as big deal.

75
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.720
So they come back in and they say, Hey, we can stop the echocardiogram.

76
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.080
When they talk to you in the hallway, you have a hole in your heart.

77
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.490
And the guy didn't know that I was, he knew I was a Navy guy.

78
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:12.860
I don't think he was a seal because not many black guys are seals. And he,

79
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.840
we had a conversation about, you know, we gotta fix this real quick. I said,

80
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.170
yeah. I mean, then I came up, I was a seal. He said, man,

81
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:23.470
you could have died jumping. You could die diving. You could have died.

82
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.260
And all this stuff, cause basically the hole in your heart,

83
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.500
if it gets plugged with something like anything, like, you know,

84
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.190
let's say you get a bubble from diving or something like that. You gotta die.

85
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.990
Right. So I, I, I call it luck. I call it luck.

86
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.980
Wow. So I, uh, I got through two surgeries. They put me back on.

87
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.430
<v 1>They give you the first one. And then when did they realize that it's not,</v>

88
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.330
not good enough.

89
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.960
<v 2>So they take you back and you got to get a bubble study, a bubble test. So they,</v>

90
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.740
so they like literally send bubbles that way, safe bubbles.

91
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:57.870
That way to see if the bubble goes through your heart. So they have this, this,

92
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.970
um, echocardiogram again and they hook you up,

93
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:02.500
I think to Ivy or something like that.

94
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:06.280
And they throw these bubbles through your heart and they see if it goes through

95
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.720
after six months when it should have been healed up, the bubble went through.

96
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.580
So he had to tell me, Dan, Hey, we got to, you know, you're not,

97
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.773
you're not good to go.

98
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.210
So I had to take a year before I could have another surgery

99
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.280
because that patch had to be completely, completely healed.

100
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.450
So before they can go through.

101
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.440
<v 1>All this time, you knew you.</v>

102
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.170
<v 2>Had a hole, right? So, so they knew how to hold because of the.</v>

103
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.770
<v 1>Right. But all this time, like when you're waiting for it to heal, you know,</v>

104
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:37.120
you have an extra hole. I know.

105
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.050
<v 2>I have a hole in.</v>

106
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.910
<v 1>It. What were you allowed to do with your body then?</v>

107
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.590
<v 2>Well, at that time, they go, you know, do how you feel comfortable. And so,</v>

108
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.150
you know, the, the whole is not going to kill you right now, but you can't die.

109
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.550
You can't jump. You pretty much wouldn't steal anymore.

110
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:54.340
So I was a recruiter for a period of time. Um,

111
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:58.910
so basically I was crazy about that is before my second

112
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:03.410
surgery, I was actually training for Delta force. I was, I,

113
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.180
I wanted to go to Delta and I was rucking, ruck running a lot.

114
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.170
And.

115
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.000
<v 1>Before my second truck running and you're running with a.</v>

116
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.120
<v 2>Pack, a pack on my back with some weight on how heavy is the pack, 50.</v>

117
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.930
<v 1>60 Pounds.</v>

118
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.430
<v 2>And you run with that on, well,</v>

119
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:19.670
you're supposed to hike or hump like ruck humping. Right.

120
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.350
I ran with it because I w cause you know, that's what I did. Right?

121
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.190
So the day before, the day of the day of heart surgery,

122
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.530
I did a ruck run. Jeez,

123
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.830
because I knew I was gonna be out of commission for awhile.

124
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.050
So it matter. Get my last one here. And dude, Jesus Christ. So I could do,

125
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.390
I have, I have my training logs after my second heart surgery,

126
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:44.240
all I could do was walk. So I became an ultra Walker,

127
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.800
walk my off. And over a period of time,

128
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:51.890
it took a year for that thing to heal up the hill. You know,

129
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.000
my first Bible study,

130
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:56.360
after my second heart surgery came back negative or positive,

131
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.500
the bubble went through again. Oh no. And they're going to crack me open.

132
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.430
Oh man. Over that period of time, a heart healed around that thing nicely.

133
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.890
And I passed the second bubble test. So.

134
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.710
<v 1>The first bubble test was how long after a year it was.</v>

135
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.560
<v 2>So the first bubble test after the first surgery was six months.</v>

136
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.890
<v 1>And then you had to go through a full six months after that for,</v>

137
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.440
to totally heal. Then you have the second heart surgery.

138
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.170
And when does the bubble test fail? After the second heart surgery.

139
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.050
<v 2>It was about six months, Jesus Christ. And they said,</v>

140
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:27.020
and the doctor looked at me and said, you know, I'm sorry to informing me.

141
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:29.660
We hit the crack, your chest open the next time. They're really getting there.

142
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.540
And so I sat back thinking there's gonna be a third heart surgery. And then, um,

143
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.950
that one, they said,

144
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:40.700
we have to wait for six months to see if this thing's going to close up. Right.

145
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.550
And I came back thinking, man, I'm about to get cracked the open.

146
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:48.080
And that bubble got pinned up, man. Did they go.

147
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.090
<v 1>Through, maybe force it through with your mind. I.</v>

148
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:50.923
<v 2>Know, right?</v>

149
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:57.320
<v 1>When you visualize and that's it, man, it's something to visualize. Holy, man.</v>

150
00:07:57.321 --> 00:08:01.490
That is crazy. It's crazy. One on a ruck run with a hole in your heart to, mm.

151
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.060
<v 2>Well I did it for several years. I said, it. I might as well keep on going, man.</v>

152
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.120
<v 1>That's amazing. Now after all said and done, everything's good now.</v>

153
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.230
<v 2>Yeah. Everything. I mean,</v>

154
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:15.110
I'm sure if something was to pop up in my and I have to do that, you know,

155
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.723
everything's good right now.

156
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.830
I'm always waiting for the next thing to pop up and I handle it the same way I

157
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.350
was attack it. But yeah, as of right now,

158
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:25.370
I'm in the best shape of my 43 years old just turned 43, February 17th.

159
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.980
I am in the best shape of my life. I'm not knocking on wood because life it.

160
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:33.980
Life comes at you dude. So knocking on wood. Come at me.

161
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.180
<v 1>I mean, I would think that you would be a go-to guy for injuries.</v>

162
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.620
Like if anybody's had.

163
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.830
<v 2>I've had them all I've had.</v>

164
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.070
<v 1>When you broke the world record for chin-ups didn't you rip your arm apart,</v>

165
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:46.640
pull up. See?

166
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.160
<v 2>Yeah. So if you pull up the picture, man, there's a picture of my hand.</v>

167
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:50.060
You'll see. I'll know.

168
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.900
<v 1>What is it? Pull ups are so pull ups are here, hands out,</v>

169
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.440
hands out and chin ups, our.

170
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.200
<v 2>Hands for hands forward. So I fell three to,</v>

171
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.580
I fell twice before I finally got it the third time. And um, I,

172
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.530
the first time I ripped the on my forearm and then the second time,

173
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.393
you'll see,

174
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.290
there's a picture of my hand and it is a third degree burn.

175
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.640
So that's my hand.

176
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.650
<v 1>Oh Jesus man. What in the is going to look at you a bit by a wall.</v>

177
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.990
<v 2>So what's funny about that as you see that, uh,</v>

178
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.490
that doesn't create after one pull-up. So if you can imagine the pain of,

179
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.420
cause you know, you have one contact point, that's it it's like running.

180
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.050
You can overcome it because you have these big, giant legs and it's,

181
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.030
it's different when you have these little fragile punk hands touching the bar,

182
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.700
you know, imagine 4,030.

183
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:46.260
Pull-ups how many times you're coming on that bar coming off right now weigh 207

184
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:50.670
pounds at the time. So I was, I was a bigger guy. I'm like 1 95, 180 5 now.

185
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.190
So I was the most, I was 22 pounds heavier.

186
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.780
So I was a lot bigger than I am right there. Bam. You look pretty get that, man.

187
00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.910
<v 1>So you were doing it in sets of.</v>

188
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.460
<v 2>Five, testified. So as you see,</v>

189
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.540
you have these different people who are witnessing you, you have to have your,

190
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.170
your, your number there to make sure that you're, um, you know,

191
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.230
qualify for the guest book of rose record. That's 1450.

192
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.070
I have a long way to govern the 4,015 pull-ups to go hard.

193
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.190
Jesus Christ. So, yeah. And how long.

194
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.970
<v 1>Did you do this? Over.</v>

195
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.690
<v 2>24 Hours. It was seven, so I broke it up 17. Wow.</v>

196
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.040
And I was over it.
