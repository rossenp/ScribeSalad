00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What's an interesting.</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.240
<v 1>Segue on that too, because that's like in part,</v>

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:08.910
some of the nonprofit stuff I do on this side is,

4
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:13.380
is solely based on that the individualized treatment for veterans specifically

5
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:17.160
in law enforcement, because you see a lot with the military DOD, the VA,

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.520
it like you're saying, you show up, don't feel good. It's a blanket treatment,

7
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:23.670
right? Here's some antidepressants, here's all that. But unless it's, you know,

8
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:25.170
it's a band-aid for a bullet hole.

9
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:28.020
And if you're not actually figuring out what the cause is,

10
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:29.130
and you're treating symptoms,

11
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.490
then the third and fourth order effects of those treatments are going to make

12
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.130
that individual worse. You know, some of the issues they have, like,

13
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:37.860
I think I have PTSD. If that that's a guy saying there are PTs,

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.780
they go through and they find out they have TBI and 40% memory function,

15
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.860
short-term memory function.

16
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.490
And so now you go to cognitive therapy and you get the guys or gals working

17
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:48.324
through it that way.

18
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.170
But the only way to figure that out is through brain scans and blood work,

19
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:55.290
and actually focusing on the individual rather than being lazy and say, Hey,

20
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.080
here's some antidepressants when the whole time the issue was something

21
00:00:58.081 --> 00:00:58.914
completely new.

22
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.550
<v 2>And then you have budget problems, right?</v>

23
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.510
So the veteran's hospitals don't have enough money to send you through all these

24
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:09.440
different scans and all these different doctors and specialists and try to fine

25
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:11.180
tune what's wrong with you. Well.

26
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.830
<v 3>I think that that's, you know,</v>

27
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:17.150
one of the things that we talk about a lot is the,

28
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.440
our, our politicians will say our leadership. They,

29
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.760
they love to go to war. They love it. Like, you know, Hey,

30
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:29.560
how many times can we send more guys to war? How many countries, you know? And,

31
00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:32.120
and I'm, I'm a participant in that endeavor by the way, right?

32
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.490
I've invaded Iraq. I've spent a lot of my adult life in,

33
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.010
in war, uh, specifically in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

34
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.150
But the thing that I've noticed in my adult life is that politicians love it.

35
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.130
They love to send, you know, 18 to 26 year old men and women.

36
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.720
They love to send them to war. What they hate is paying the bill, right?

37
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.870
That's what they hate. They hate paying for the aftereffects.

38
00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:01.250
They hate standing by their word in the sense of, Hey,

39
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:03.830
we're going to take care of you. You're all your health problems,

40
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:07.520
your education, we're going to start really, uh,

41
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.160
fixing the VA system. So there's,

42
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.880
long-term care what most veterans that I know,

43
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:17.750
what they have to do is they have to continue to lobby the government over and

44
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:22.640
over and over for them to prove that what's happened to their

45
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.470
body is connected to their service.

46
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.690
But the issue that I continue to see is that this is

47
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.440
a lack of, of one, it's a lack of experience for our politicians.

48
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:37.250
They don't quite understand what war is and the long-term effects on individual

49
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:41.600
soldiers, uh, after decades of service. And I think, you know,

50
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:42.980
hundreds of my friends,

51
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:47.630
every one of every one of us has some type of long-term effect from their

52
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:52.250
service. Every one of us, in the sense of do you have sleep issues? Do you have,

53
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.110
you know, gut issues? Do you have inflamma inflammation? Are you missing a limb?

54
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.740
And really it's, it's disgusting the amount of,

55
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.800
uh, emphasis there is ongoing and then the lack of emphasis

56
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.640
on care. It really, it,

57
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:16.090
it saddens me as a society when we have to rely on nonprofits

58
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.520
to pay for the care of veterans because the military or the

59
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:25.870
DOD and the tax, the tax, essentially. And I think if they understood this,

60
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.710
if they knew they weren't paying for the long-term care of her service members,

61
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:31.000
to the degree that they needed,

62
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.440
they would absolutely have no issues stepping up and saying, Hey,

63
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.250
we have to do something about this. Uh, and it's,

64
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.170
it's really, when we look at the entire system and how it's put together,

65
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:47.830
there's no way that a person, this is a good story from my friend, Clint,

66
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.440
he's missing both his legs recently from last year during COVID,

67
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.810
what was happening is that his leg was changing as far as the shape of

68
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:01.990
it because he was growing in addition, additional layer of bone,

69
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.190
where his leg was blown off and he needed a new leg,

70
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.070
but he couldn't get in to get a new leg.

71
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.020
So he was confined to his wheelchair for almost six months during this process.

72
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:18.310
And he couldn't get an appointment. There's no reason why that should happen.

73
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.590
There's literally zero reason.

74
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:23.830
We can't have the largest transfer of wealth from our taxpayer into the military

75
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:27.730
industrial complex in modern history without

76
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.470
zero ethical argument, as far as our entire political system,

77
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.220
and then not continue to care for our veterans.

78
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.680
There's just no way that we can do that as a society.

79
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:42.610
Because I think ultimately that defines us in who we are collectively,

80
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:43.780
and it's not a good grade.

81
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.050
<v 2>A long history of the United States doing that.</v>

82
00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:49.260
Remember when people were coming back from the first Gulf war and they were

83
00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:52.110
having all these issues with radiation, because they use that.

84
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.700
W what is a depleted uranium rounds. Yeah. And they kind of denied,

85
00:04:56.701 --> 00:04:57.900
first of all, that they use them.

86
00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:00.300
They denied that this effect was related to that.

87
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.500
And then birth defects and all sorts of like real weird radiation sickness

88
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:07.380
issues that people were having. They were calling it Gulf war syndrome,

89
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.850
but they did their very best to not take care of these people. Yeah.

90
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.121
<v 1>Well,</v>

91
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:16.230
you look like from agent orange in Vietnam and the long-term effects of that,

92
00:05:16.231 --> 00:05:19.410
and all the studies and the research that's coming out right now with the burn

93
00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:23.250
pits and the carcinogens and how much cancer, but then they're like, ah,

94
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.940
you can't really draw the conclusion that it came from burn and for six months,

95
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:29.970
you know, and, and to Evan's point as well, it's, it's,

96
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.320
it's tragic to be honest,

97
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:34.800
that there's tens of thousands of nonprofits that are having to do the leg work

98
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.990
without government grants or funding.

99
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:40.650
The money is coming from people that are being, you know,

100
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.090
participating in philanthropy saying,

101
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:45.930
I want to do something good for these guys and gals that have real issues like

102
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.740
to Clint,

103
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.860
he's missing his legs and you're going to make them be in a wheelchair for

104
00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:53.880
months because of it. For me, that's just absolutely unacceptable.

105
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:55.680
And there has to be change.

106
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.960
<v 2>The story you were telling before the show about your friend who lost her arms.</v>

107
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.100
Yeah. Explain that.

108
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.400
<v 1>One of our good friends, Mary she's, a EOD tech, um, had both of her arms, um,</v>

109
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.370
blown off when she tried to catch some ordinance that they were, uh,

110
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.860
going to dispose of. And, uh,

111
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.610
essentially she has a full-time caregiver and she went to go see her family for,

112
00:06:15.611 --> 00:06:16.720
I believe it was a month.

113
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.960
And during that time she didn't have the caregiver because she's with her

114
00:06:19.961 --> 00:06:22.450
husband and family and they were taking care of her. Well,

115
00:06:22.451 --> 00:06:26.860
the VA determined after that stint that she doesn't need a full-time caregiver

116
00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:29.650
because she obviously was fine that month. She was away.

117
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.550
And this is a young lady who amazing person,

118
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.820
like just nubs there there's, you know, she calls herself wondering nubs,

119
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.450
bless her heart. She's hilarious. But she,

120
00:06:39.451 --> 00:06:44.350
she can't do things that come so easily to us, like grab things, use the toilet,

121
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:46.780
like, and she has a really funny Twitter about, you know, wiping her,

122
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.580
I believe she said, but, um,

123
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.690
the fact that that's happening and someone in the VA wasn't like, oh,

124
00:06:52.691 --> 00:06:56.740
that's stupid. Here you go. Full-time caregiver like that. I mean.

125
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.500
<v 2>Trying to find a way to cut money left and right.</v>

126
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.410
And it's just numbers on a piece of paper. Yeah. It's numbers.

127
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.380
<v 3>On a piece of paper and it's,</v>

128
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.010
I don't think people want to be reminded. Right.

129
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.960
<v 2>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

130
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.110
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

131
00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:19.510
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

132
00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:23.230

That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

134
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.050
