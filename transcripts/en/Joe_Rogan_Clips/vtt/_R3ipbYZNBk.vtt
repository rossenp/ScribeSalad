00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.330
<v 2>What was it like fighting Connor when he wasn't an</v>

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.663
was that.

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.890
<v 0>Dude, you know, fighting is hectic already.</v>

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.340
You're about to go in there for 25 minutes and you've been training. So,

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.580
you know, what's on the line. So it's just a lot of pressure. So, uh,

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.560
just it being a little bit more calm for me was, was, was smooth sailing, man.

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.070
You know? Cause it's already hectic enough. I say the same thing about the fans.

9
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:29.640
Like when I fought at the apex, it was nice, you know? Cause like I said,

10
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.700
fighting is crazy. So without having guys spilling beer yelling,

11
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:34.140
you're going to die, you know,

12
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.620
we're on the way to the walk is isn't it it's relaxing to me. Yeah. Yeah.

13
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:39.300
So it's just makes it, makes it smooth sailor.

14
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.820
<v 1>So it's not good for him. It's really better for him to be an, to be an</v>

15
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.850
But it seemed so odd. It's just like,

16
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:53.280
he just decided that he respected you and just.

17
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.930
<v 0>But he did the same thing with cowboy.</v>

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.430
I thought like maybe this is him just maturing and he's got a few kids now.

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.290
I think he has one on or he does have one on the way.

20
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.440
Like maybe it's just maturing and he's a different, you know, we all change.

21
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.940
Maybe he's a different person, but yeah.

22
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.990
<v 1>Could be.</v>

23
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.550
But I think also the amount of that he

24
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:16.170
caused in the Khabib fight me realizing at the end of it,

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.150
what had happened, dudes jumped into the cage and beat his guys were jumping.

26
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:22.650
I mean it could be jumped out of the cage,

27
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.570
got a fight with Dylan Dannis it's chaos. I mean, it was so nuts.

28
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.370
Yeah. And then,

29
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.180
you know what had happened before that with him throwing the card at the bus and

30
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:37.230
you know, fights got canceled cause broken glass key ESSA got caught.

31
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:39.730
I think a couple of other guys got cut with, with,

32
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.460
with the glass that was flying. It's like he had done so much and up so much.

33
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.370
<v 0>Throwing energy cans at press conferences member. Oh that's right.</v>

34
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.050
<v 1>That's right. Yeah. But that was kind of like minor compared.</v>

35
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.050
<v 0>To compare us cutting people with broken glass and it was yeah. But the.</v>

36
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.050
<v 1>Um, the Cassidy causes so much,</v>

37
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.860
but that had also been a part of what sold fights. Yeah.

38
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.270
Like con like the Josie Aldo fight. He tortured Josie Aldo for months.

39
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.000
Remember they did that crazy press conference where they toured all over the

40
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.020
world. I mean rip the picture and stole his belt. It's my belt.

41
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.680
And by the time they got into the cage, Josie Halsa was frayed. Right.

42
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.750
<v 0>I wouldn't know. Afraid. Just over-thought yeah. Oh, you know, in his own head.</v>

43
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.010
<v 1>In his own head. Yeah. He seemed compared to what I would I'd seen from,</v>

44
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.960
although in the past he seemed much more nervous and much more aware of the

45
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:34.080
magnitude of the moment. And Connor seemed so relaxed.

46
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.450
<v 0>I felt that same thing though. The first time I fought Connor,</v>

47
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.600
I felt like that when the bell rang, I was like a deer in the headlights.

48
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.730
It's happening. Here we go. All this, you know,

49
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.960
all that talk and everything over the months just sat in my head and uh,

50
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.030
I just read into it too much thought too much.

51
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.730
And I think that's probably what happened with Alto. Dad.

52
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.620
<v 1>Is with talking can do to a person.</v>

53
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.520
<v 0>Right. It's the art of war, man. I mean, yeah. Fighting is, is,</v>

54
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.220
is mental, you know, as much as it is physical, I believe.

55
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.630
<v 1>Well there's so much mental involved. I mean, it's for sure physical,</v>

56
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.810
but it's also look it's mental just to get yourself through training camp,

57
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.650
right?

58
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.430
<v 0>Yeah. To cut weight, to show up, to do interview after interview,</v>

59
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:14.410
press conference, after the press conference, you know.

60
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.460
<v 1>Does that to do while you getting ready for a fight while you're cutting weight,</v>

61
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.510
it's doing these interviews and they're boring questions.

62
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.780
<v 0>Same question over and over. What's different between uh,</v>

63
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.600
this Dustin and Dustin six years ago when Connor beat you.

64
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.750
Like if I heard that question a thousand times, um,

65
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.750
it just gets redundant as aggravating, you know,

66
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.900
before you even sit down and do the interview, you know the questions you,

67
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.050
and it's just going through the motions. I just,

68
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.310
some are fun though. Some, some interviewers are good and change it up.

69
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:47.980
And then it's a fun conversation. But most of them it's the same thing.

70
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.630
How was camp? How are you feeling? What's different between this Dustin and.

71
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.990
<v 1>Well, how much of that stuff sells a fight either. I really don't.</v>

72
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.600
I feel like you should cut it off about two weeks out.

73
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.070
I feel like you can get two interviews in before and then the last two weeks,

74
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:06.670
just leave the fighters alone. Leave them alone. Just let them.

75
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.690
<v 0>Again, only do the big ones, like an ESPN sports dinner interview or just the.</v>

76
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.700
<v 1>Big ones. Just a quick one. We'll cut.</v>

77
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.650
<v 0>Out all the media, MMA media. Like.</v>

78
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.990
<v 1>How many hours of that do you have to do in a week.</v>

79
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.050
<v 0>For this Connor? This last counter one.</v>

80
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.740
I was stuck in the hotel on fight island. So it was all mostly from my computer.

81
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.520
I would say over that whole fight week, um,

82
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.620
three hours maybe total.

83
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.170
<v 1>Nah, that's not too bad. Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.010
What'd you think of Connor pulling up to the fight island and a yacht.

85
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.240
<v 0>That's baller, man. I was mad. I'm like, I want a.</v>

86
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.510
<v 1>I do. But she don't,</v>

87
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.730
you know that that seems like you have to have so much more money than the

88
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:52.330
yacht cost to enjoy the yacht. You know what I mean?

89
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.390
It looked like it looked like a big one, but if you have a yacht,

90
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.200
this is my thought. Like if you, if you have a yacht and the yacht is worth,

91
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.980
whatever a yachts were, it was a yacht costs. 10 million bucks. Okay.

92
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:05.260
Let's say 10 million. That one probably more, probably more.

93
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.520
Let's say 20 million bucks.

94
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.390
Let's see you got a $20 million yacht for you to not be sweating. That yacht,

95
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.270
you better have a hundred million. Right. You know, you gotta like,

96
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.510
how much does it cost to gas up? How much does it cost?

97
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.660
How much does the pilot cost? How much did the captain, what does, uh,

98
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.490
what do I do on for repairs.

99
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.870
<v 0>Those big yachts have to have a crew. I think you're year round. Yeah.</v>

100
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.310
All year round. All year round. So you're paying a staff salary.

101
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.130
<v 1>We live on it. It's their house. You just go and sit in every now and then.</v>

102
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.340
<v 0>And I heard there's a big docking fee as well. So wherever the boat stays,</v>

103
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:37.480
you paint a big docking fee.

104
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.180
<v 1>So you thinking about all that while you're about to fight,</v>

105
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.810
that seems like more money, more.

106
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.730
<v 0>Problems. He's got that whiskey money, man. He's all right.</v>

107
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:46.564
He does have that whiskey.

108
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.390
<v 1>That is a different thing. I get that whiskey money, whiskey money.</v>

109
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.140
<v 0>The thing I'm building it up, man. I got the hot sauce money coming in.</v>

110
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.270
I'll pull up on like a bass boat. Next time.
