WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. Like we got real problems in this country.</v>

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.950
It's not a joke anymore. Yeah.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.010
That Charlottesville thing that just showed everybody.

4
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:14.450
When you saw those guys walking down the street with those citronella home Depot

5
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:19.040
torches, I was like, this is the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life.

6
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:23.930
Screaming white lives matter crazy. Like, you know who said it best,

7
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:28.370
man, I have a great quote. Um, Sturgill Simpson sent me this,

8
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.950
um, because, uh, he had, uh,

9
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:35.120
an email exchange with Dr. Rick Strassman,

10
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.770
who's the guy that wrote, uh, the DMT, the spirit molecule, and, uh,

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.800
they had an email exchange and he said, for starters, I would say,

12
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.720
this is a Rick. Strassman saying this,

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.890
that what we're seeing is a failure of the educational system. Um,

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.140
this is due to faults within the system itself,

15
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.360
as well as the attacks on the system,

16
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.490
that system from outside by forces and institutions that gain to

17
00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.100
benefit from ignorance in addiction,

18
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.050
both religious faith and the love of community have degenerated

19
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.190
into crude parodies of what they're capable of being

20
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.440
regarding where this is all heading. He says,

21
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:15.770
my Zen teacher used to say that the force of good, this is what we're,

22
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.940
what if that was really interesting?

23
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.090
The forces of good relative to the forces of evil,

24
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.950
evil are always around 50.1% versus

25
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.740
49.9%. There's a similar,

26
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.720
similar notion in Judaism along these lines that the future of the world

27
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:35.270
depends upon a single individual's actions.

28
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.810
And I think it says something like a paradoxical,

29
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:43.790
like we are a speck of dust and the fate of

30
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:47.780
the universe hinges on us. Wow. That, that quote right there,

31
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:51.170
we are a speck of dust. And in, in quotes,

32
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.320
the fate of the universe hinges on us that when I read that today, I was like,

33
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.610
holy. Like that's so true. Yeah. And I mean, you see this right now,

34
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:05.720
like what's going on with Charlottesville and what's going on with the way Trump

35
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:10.070
is reacting to it all and the way people reacting to it all and people are

36
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:12.200
digging in their heels and forming sides.

37
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.080
And this is any group,

38
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.270
any group that wouldn't think that this is completely insane

39
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.920
and totally out of control.

40
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:26.510
Like any group of people that wouldn't think that someone driving a car into a

41
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:30.110
group of protest, or just randomly running over a girl,

42
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.340
any group that wouldn't denounce that instantaneously as one of the most heinous

43
00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:38.020
things ever, this is exactly what we're terrified of.

44
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.880
We see happening in Paris and in other parts of the world,

45
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:45.710
and here we have an American doing it and are different is not

46
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:47.060
even that, you know, we're, uh,

47
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.800
we're being attacked the way we're looking at it in terms of it's white

48
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:56.150
people and white nationalists versus Antifa, right?

49
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.650
We're not even looking at it. Like we're all Americans, we're not looking at it.

50
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:02.470
Like we're all on the same team. We're w we're we're,

51
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:05.620
we're literally home growing terrorism.

52
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.460
That's a homegrown terrorist activity. A hundred percent, a hundred percent.

53
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:12.070
I mean, so you worried about Al-Qaida you worried about ISIS,

54
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.270
you're worried about the Tallyman.

55
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.490
You've got something right here that is willing to drive a car into a

56
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:23.050
random group of people that look just like him. A bunch of white people.

57
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.280
I mean, this is, this is completely insane.

58
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.050
<v 1>The craziest part is they're not doing it to overthrow it. The yoke of empire.</v>

59
00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:33.210
It's not like, like, you know, uh,

60
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.090
Ireland back in the seventies with British control,

61
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.650
like at least you can kind of be like, ah,

62
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.930
they don't want to be controlled by the bursts.

63
00:03:38.931 --> 00:03:43.440
These people are literally living in the most free country. Like, you know,

64
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.410
they're prosperous to the point of almost boredom where they start.

65
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.180
And I don't think Antifa realizes how much similarity they have to,

66
00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:52.380
the people they claim to be fighting.

67
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.610
<v 0>It's a natural progression. When you have extremely violent protests,</v>

68
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.010
like these people are happen. Everybody ramps it up.

69
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.020
They ramp it up on the left. They ramped it up on the right.

70
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:04.320
Everybody gets angry and this drives into a bunch of people,

71
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.260
man, it's awful. And then Trump said, here's the thing. All this happened,

72
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.480
right as were taking down a statue of Robert Lee,

73
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.610
who's the leader of the Confederates, right. Trump literally said, said today,

74
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:20.820
what's next? Are we going to take down a statue of George Washington?

75
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.350
It's like, what? That's a bit of a false economy.

76
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.690
How the can he even say that this is CU,

77
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.880
he's got some weird thing going on.

78
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.200
We asked to dance around his support for white supremacists or white

79
00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:39.600
nationalists. He has to dance around it.

80
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.620
<v 1>Which is weird because they're not that big of a group. Like, it's not like.</v>

81
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.400
<v 0>But if they're on your side, they're all on your side.</v>

82
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.220
<v 1>You know what I'm saying? 10,000 people and.</v>

83
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.710
<v 0>Green. Yeah. A lot more than you think, man.</v>

84
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.110
It might be a lot of closet racists out there.

85
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.280
<v 1>I see so much similarities between like, you know,</v>

86
00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:02.610
white racist and then like the social justice racist or it's like, it's just,

87
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.790
it's usually like the white Nazis or like the loser is trying to get something

88
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:08.340
out of their skin and then social justice warriors.

89
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:11.100
A lot of times they're trying to get something out of an oppressed being an

90
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.710
unoppressed status in both of those groups. I'm like,

91
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.380
you're both trying to avoid merit merit. Like,

92
00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:18.960
you're both just trying to get something from your stupid group.

93
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.060
Cause you never see like a Nazi is like good looking or successful.

94
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:27.600
They're always just like, I deserve some cause I'm white. And you're like,

95
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.970
then that means you're weak as. I.

96
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.370
<v 0>Think it was.</v>

97
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.100
I just think it's just a massive failure from the beginning to now of

98
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.640
thinking. That's the only thing that makes sense to me.

99
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.760
<v 1>Yeah. And just like the agenda thing where it's like,</v>

100
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.650
you start ignoring basic reality to get clicks or you know,

101
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.903
outrage culture.

102
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.270
<v 0>Well, it's just the, it's just not the way to go.</v>

103
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.470
You just joined up with all white people like that. It's just insane.

104
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.680
It's completely insane. And.

105
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.650
<v 1>Even the concept of white is a new concept. But growing up it's like, oh,</v>

106
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:04.580
you're Irish or Italian or it's like, when did this Federation kickoff?

107
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.290
<v 0>Well, we've been forced in this position by a thing called white privilege.</v>

108
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.190
I don't know if you were aware of it.

109
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.600
I checked it on my way and check yourself before you wreck yourself. Yeah.

110
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.490
Well that's the thing is we're all human beings who migrated from

111
00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:21.820
Africa. That's a fact. Yeah. I go back far enough, but we don't,

112
00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:25.000
we're not willing to go back farther. We're like, we're stopping wherever the.

113
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.950
You know, we've got this accent from,

114
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.940
and this is my Homeland and all the defendant did in my death. That,

115
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.910
that guy's just that color because it never, it's always, it's always.

116
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.010
<v 2>Cloudy. You have vitamin ever stops raining.</v>

117
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.860
<v 0>Yeah. It's literally it exactly. That's why there's so pale.</v>

118
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:42.790
They're trying to suck as much of the vitamin D out of the sky as they can.

119
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.230
<v 1>Yeah. Cause like 2% couldn't get. Cause they died. They died and that's.</v>

120
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.270
<v 0>How it vitamin D and that's how evolution works.</v>

121
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.300
Pay for those people to just do a little solar panels, just walking around,

122
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.140
sucking in the vitamin D take it. They're all Africans,

123
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.760
Irish people are Africans that just stayed in Ireland. Yes.

124
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.623
That's what they are.

125
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.360
<v 1>It's just like a flash when we started separating and it really,</v>

126
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.510
it has nothing to do with who we are as people I.

127
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.750
<v 2>Could see the criticism. You're one of those bro. I don't see color.</v>

128
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.660
<v 0>People. Those people, I don't even see color bro.</v>

129
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.660
<v 1>And be like, no, I am racist. But.</v>

130
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.790
<v 2>If you lose that away in my store, but I know we're equal. Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.980
<v 0>I don't see color, man, except with gay rainbow. Yeah. I just,</v>

132
00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:34.970
I'm not into Raiders fans or you know, a Chinese food shopper. Yeah. Like I.

133
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.750
<v 1>I used to do a song where it was like black dudes with more than one pit bull</v>

134
00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:38.710
scare the out of me,

135
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:42.420
but a black guy with a cell phone on his belt I trust or it's hilarious.

136
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.570
I would do it. I would have the crowd.

137
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.240
<v 2>Verizon because it's all.</v>

138
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.990
<v 1>Cultural signifiers. And so I would have the crowd yell out anybody, you know,</v>

139
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:53.220
white people. I was like white dudes with teardrop tattoos in Idaho scare,

140
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.530
you know? And you just go through any race and you're like, look,

141
00:07:56.531 --> 00:08:01.060
it's always it's that Chris rock joke that I won't repeat because of my

142
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.400
privileged. But like there's this group.

143
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:07.240
And then there's this girl and everybody knows which one are the in which one?

144
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.080
Not even, but from a position of like desperation,

145
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.120
depending on where you are in history.

146
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.450
<v 0>Walked by too many dudes that have their pants sagging.</v>

147
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.680
Like more than two of them. I got all these guys Mike's make stupid decisions,

148
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.970
bad decision guys. If you got like your, your pants, like down,

149
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.290
like to like duck curve, the downward curve, your, right.

150
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.040
It's riding the curve and I could see like a giant percentage of your underwear.

151
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.270
Yeah. One.

152
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.570
<v 1>Guy may have forgot to belt. Two guys they're hiding guns.</v>

153
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.530
<v 0>It's not even, it's just, they're just making stupid decisions with their life.</v>

154
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.090
For sure. Like.

155
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.860
<v 1>Like, like, uh, my mom was teaching a class once. Uh, and she was like,</v>

156
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:52.570
they took N-word Jim out of huckleberry. Finn. Yeah. They did get that word out.

157
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.520
You can't know a time unless you know, the, from that time, you know,

158
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.200
and it's giving people a real disservice to just like emasculate and neuter our

159
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:04.710
history so that everybody can't see what real dangers are like,

160
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:08.070
what just happened in Charlottesville? Like all the people that called, uh,

161
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.210
Dave Rubin and Nazi now have to use the same word for these people. Right.

162
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.080
It's like now it has no meaning. Exactly. Yeah.

163
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.030
<v 0>Good. Very good point. Thank you. It's uh,</v>

164
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.320
it's really important to not overreact to the people that don't

165
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.450
have the exact same opinion as you now, when something like this happens,

166
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.770
you realize, okay, that's what you should react to. Exactly. This is real.

167
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.030
This is real. You got a bunch of bags with a, with torches,

168
00:09:35.031 --> 00:09:38.210
from home Depot or wherever the they got this. Those are those.

169
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.360
The citronella court people have been like the suburbs.

170
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.190
They have like a Tiki bar. I was good.

171
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.640
<v 1>Buy some. And now I can't come on was literally gonna look.</v>

172
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:49.820
I like those torches to, for killing mosquitoes. And I was thinking about it.

173
00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:50.450
I'm like,

174
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.750
I'm not going to buy those now because it's Charlottesville and all these.

175
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.590
<v 0>Guys. I mean, if, if any of those people that are into that are listening,</v>

176
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.050
I'm not even upset at you as a human,

177
00:10:03.051 --> 00:10:07.310
you get trapped into patterns that thinking I'm upset at that pattern.

178
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.500
I'm upset that this is a repeated repeating pattern that has happened through

179
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:13.334
human history,

180
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.530
where people decide that there's specific groups that somehow or another

181
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.260
deserve preferential treatment or are better or, or, or,

182
00:10:23.261 --> 00:10:26.870
or superior or should dominate over other groups.

183
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.560
It's stupid. And it's bad for business.

184
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.490
It's bad for the business of being human beings. It gets in the way you're,

185
00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:38.060
you're judging people on nonsense and you get to all be in the group just

186
00:10:38.061 --> 00:10:41.240
because you have similar skin color, that's stupid.

187
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.530
You're allowing a bunch of losers in your group then because you're only,

188
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.050
you're only differentiation is that they have to be white.

189
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.440
That is insanely stupid. It's so stupid.

190
00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:53.630
It's like I miss out on all the cool black people.

191
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.840
You're going to miss out on all the cool Cubans and all the cool Puerto Rican's,

192
00:10:56.841 --> 00:10:58.580
you're going to miss out on them. And you're going to,

193
00:10:58.581 --> 00:11:02.960
you're going to think that you have some family in this idea that you all have

194
00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:05.810
Nordic roots or something like that. It's so dumb.

195
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.490
It's I understand if you run into people that are black and they're racist

196
00:11:10.491 --> 00:11:12.890
against white people, and you feel like, you know,

197
00:11:12.891 --> 00:11:14.840
white people have to protect themselves.

198
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:18.110
If you get in one of those situations and those situations are real,

199
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.020
they can happen. Racism can occur on both sides.

200
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.560
And it's another disingenuous thing that the left is doing is accepting this

201
00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:27.890
idea that you can only be racist if you're white,

202
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.140
because the racist statement it's so racist. It's so,

203
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.650
but this is something that people were, I think they've kind of let it go for,

204
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:38.330
for most recently, like out there in the Twitter sphere,

205
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.460
but for a good long time,

206
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.390
it was a defensible argument that a black person couldn't be racist because

207
00:11:44.391 --> 00:11:47.900
racism is all about power and what black people don't have power over white

208
00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:50.870
people like what's that, that is you're changing the word,

209
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.430
you're changing the word. And you're going to empower actual racist.

210
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.400
<v 1>Chorus. And it's like, no one, you don't know Nazis till, you know,</v>

211
00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:01.030
a treaty of Versailles. And you don't know this until like, you know,

212
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:04.600
just over shaming always has a springboard effect. Like,

213
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.560
like after world war II, it's the same with like, you know, the shamed gay guys,

214
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.350
the one that like hates gay people, you know, where it's like,

215
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:15.070
shame is a horrible thing and people. And so world war one,

216
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.900
blood on all hands, you know,

217
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:19.720
that was started and executed for very bizarre reasons.

218
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.550
They blame Germany for all of it to the point where they destroyed Germany.

219
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:28.300
And then they were looking for a voice that gave them hope and that voice is

220
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:31.990
insane. And so that happens, that that happened in this where it's like,

221
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.230
dear white people being white, you should just say, sorry, all the time.

222
00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:37.240
Even though your people came in 19, oh, you know.

223
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.610
<v 0>Well, you can see it today.</v>

224
00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:43.440
And the people that never criticized Trump and have like exclamation points and

225
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.830
they write manga after all their tweets, no matter what Trump does,

226
00:12:46.831 --> 00:12:50.400
no matter what Trump says, it's always amazing. Everything's always perfect.

227
00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:53.730
Like, okay, well, I see what you're doing because you're not really thinking.

228
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.870
Right. Really thinking you're you, you are, you got to team your go Raiders.

229
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.650
Let's go Raiders. You're, let's go Trump like, well now this is not,

230
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.250
this is not healthy. This is not normal way to discuss super important issues.

231
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.680
This wouldn't Trump said today that like, what's next,

232
00:13:10.681 --> 00:13:12.990
they're going to take down a statue of George Washington was like,

233
00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:14.820
they took down the statue of Robert Ilene. Everybody's freaking out.

234
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.040
What's next. We're gonna take down a statue of George Washington.

235
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.510
<v 1>Yeah. That's like when the word normalizing actually fits, you know,</v>

236
00:13:21.511 --> 00:13:25.890
like all these things that have been so flooded that is normalizing something

237
00:13:25.891 --> 00:13:29.280
terrible, but it's like so crazy compared to work

238
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.060
with Robert E. Lee is actually a problem.

239
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.100
But the left is like over pointed out problems to the point where no one,

240
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.580
like you can't have your, you don't trust your instincts right now where you,

241
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.040
like, if I say this, does this make me racist? It's like what?

242
00:13:44.041 --> 00:13:46.920
That it's 80 degrees outside. How is that linked?

243
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:47.401
<v 0>You know?</v>

244
00:13:47.401 --> 00:13:52.290
And also I think anybody coming in and deciding to do something is a

245
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:55.560
problem. You know, like people coming in and try to take,

246
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.970
deciding to take down a statue. That statue is a symbol to a lot of people.

247
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.820
And a lot of people step in and say, Hey, this is it.

248
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.110
I think there should be some sort of real prolonged,

249
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:12.300
intelligent conversation about what that statue means and have it in a way

250
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.590
where a bunch of people can,

251
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.360
can see it and have it represented on both sides have been represented by the

252
00:14:18.361 --> 00:14:21.600
side of people that think it's a good idea to keep it up and have it represented

253
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.390
on the side of someone who thinks it's a good idea to move on.

254
00:14:24.391 --> 00:14:27.270
And maybe we should take this thing and put it in some sort of a war museum.

255
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:27.780
Right.

256
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.340
And not having it represent the Confederate soldiers in the middle of this

257
00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:36.270
town. That's not Confederate. Okay. We, that the war has gone. This you're,

258
00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:41.220
you're holding on to this idea that your team lost a battle

259
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.040
and that there's an invading army that's in with you. Right?

260
00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:48.330
I know we're all Americans. Okay. This is old, old, old. 1860.

261
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.860
Okay. Let it go. Stupid. Let's this down.

262
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.270
And let's put up a glorious kid rock tattoo style Eagle with a

263
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.280
flag behind it. Come on.

264
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.030
You really love America was take down the Robert E.

265
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.980
Lee and put up hulking American Eagle with a flag blown in

266
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:11.810
the wind, just cash. And then underneath it have a gigantic plaque of,

267
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.550
uh, everybody that lost their lives in the last two wars over the last 20 years.

268
00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:17.170
That.

269
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.840
<v 1>Yeah, I think a lot of it is how it's being represented too.</v>

270
00:15:19.841 --> 00:15:24.220
Is it like a glorious statue or is it just a Relic of history? Cause like,

271
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.060
I think the debate is, uh, have you seen it now? I haven't either.

272
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:28.923
Let's look at it.

273
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.170
<v 0>Find out what's the statue of Robert Lee that they were taken down.</v>

274
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.020
I'm curious me too. What if he was like, uh,

275
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.740
found out he was like banging a slave. Oh,

276
00:15:38.741 --> 00:15:43.300
that's it torch? Wielding protesters rally. A Confederate statute. Yeah.

277
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.280
Can we go a large on that buddy? Wow. That's beautiful. Piece of art. You know,

278
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:52.150
I mean much like when you look at Gingiss con it's a beautiful piece of art.

279
00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:56.440
You know, you look at some of the, uh, statues and things that they, uh,

280
00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:00.640
constructed from back in his day. You let you, you know, you think about it,

281
00:16:00.641 --> 00:16:04.840
you go, wow, this is a guy at war who killed like a FA like 5% of the earth.

282
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.160
Yeah. Something even crazier,

283
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.580
I think killed like 10% of the world's population while he was alive. Yeah.

284
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.070
<v 1>This is a tough one. Cause it's like, yeah, there's a rebel army loss.</v>

285
00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:15.860
So that should be taken down. But at the same time, it's like,

286
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.350
but what do you do with that? And then to the natives,

287
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.590
Americans tell people to take down Washington, you know, then you start,

288
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.700
then you start getting in a battle of like, well, this person wronged my people,

289
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.650
well, this person. And then, you know,

290
00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:31.820
like I see people with Che shirts from urban Outfitters and I'm like

291
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.200
that dude committed genocide to a lot of people, you know? And it's like,

292
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:39.440
at what point is it with this one?

293
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:43.590
I think that it's a valid argument to take it down because it was a rebel army

294
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.870
in a rebel army in the country that it's still in.

295
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.910
But at the same time, it's like, it's a slippery slope of a racing. Right.

296
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.773
You know?

297
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:53.971
<v 0>Well,</v>

298
00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:57.060
I don't think you should have it in your state Capitol or wherever the that is.

299
00:16:57.061 --> 00:17:01.620
Is that what it is? State Capitol building represents that state.

300
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.470
Is that what it is? But see if you could pull it up again,

301
00:17:04.471 --> 00:17:06.060
just so we know what the we're talking about.

302
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.790
Cause I think that was kind of like, I think it was like a state building.

303
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.160
Like it was a big deal. That's how I felt about Confederate.

304
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.520
<v 1>Flag. I'm like, obviously take it off state buildings. Justice.</v>

305
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:17.040
<v 0>Is still a part of a few different flags.</v>

306
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:20.670
<v 1>Right? That's that, to me crosses that line where you're like, oh,</v>

307
00:17:20.671 --> 00:17:23.820
well now you're incorporating it into the government that a lot of people

308
00:17:23.821 --> 00:17:25.350
associate with like valid.

309
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.990
<v 0>Social issues. Yeah. I mean to this day,</v>

310
00:17:27.991 --> 00:17:31.560
I think it's on Mississippi's that's very intense. Yeah.

311
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.130
<v 3>Emancipation park in front of their courthouse in front.</v>

312
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.610
<v 0>Of the courthouse. Wow, man. That's a bit of a tone.</v>

313
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.950
<v 2>You can't do that mean.</v>

314
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.210
<v 0>You gotta get that guy out of there. Like I think for sure we should keep it.</v>

315
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.130
I mean, I don't think they should destroy it. Just like,

316
00:17:47.131 --> 00:17:49.050
I don't think they should destroy, you know,

317
00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.680
if there's a statue of mouse somewhere, I don't think they should destroy it.

318
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.700
I think we should,

319
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.630
we should look at it and hold onto it so that future generations can look back

320
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:00.740
and go, wow, that's possible. Yeah. The Berlin wall. Yeah. Yeah.

321
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:01.310
Like there's little.

322
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:06.200
<v 1>Pieces to be like, yeah. That people split the world in two at one point.</v>

323
00:18:06.201 --> 00:18:09.560
And if we forget that we started doing this live action role play until someone

324
00:18:09.561 --> 00:18:10.460
gets hit by a car.

325
00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.720
<v 0>It's like, yeah, well we want better. Right. So we want better.</v>

326
00:18:13.721 --> 00:18:17.960
And so we pretend that better already exists or is, is, is, is, is possible.

327
00:18:17.961 --> 00:18:20.930
If we force people to behave the way we want. Right. You know,

328
00:18:20.931 --> 00:18:24.710
there's a bunch of different ways where people try to achieve better, you know?

329
00:18:24.711 --> 00:18:28.340
And they're not all smart this cause a lot of them are based on how you feel

330
00:18:28.341 --> 00:18:31.130
right now and what you want to change. So you try to be forceful,

331
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.710
but like the bounce back thing we're talking about,

332
00:18:33.711 --> 00:18:35.900
it doesn't really work like that when you,

333
00:18:35.901 --> 00:18:39.770
when you push too hard at people and you don't respect them. Um,

334
00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.080
even if they're is ridiculous as a white nationalist,

335
00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.250
when you push push at them. And why do I say it's ridiculous if you're asking?

336
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:50.300
Cause it's all ridiculous. I think being a black nationalist is ridiculous too.

337
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.320
I think it's all ridiculous.

338
00:18:51.321 --> 00:18:55.310
I think you should be a human being and it just because you enjoy black culture,

339
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.540
it doesn't mean you have to be racist.

340
00:18:56.541 --> 00:18:59.240
You can enjoy Chinese people just as much.

341
00:18:59.241 --> 00:19:00.590
We can all just be cool with each other.

342
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:05.450
But this idea that there's like one superior race is insane.

343
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.740
We are all interconnected in some very bizarre way and we help each other.

344
00:19:09.741 --> 00:19:11.330
And that's what culture is.

345
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:15.230
That's what civilization is the reason why it all works so well is that we're

346
00:19:15.231 --> 00:19:17.840
all intertwined with each other, learning from each other,

347
00:19:17.841 --> 00:19:20.150
trying to figure out how to navigate this thing together,

348
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.880
competing with each other, improving upon, uh,

349
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.350
whatever the it is we're working on because of the competition from all sorts of

350
00:19:27.351 --> 00:19:28.490
different parts of the world,

351
00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:32.120
different cultures and behavior patterns and levels of aggression,

352
00:19:32.121 --> 00:19:36.740
levels of intellect and all of us combined in some sort of a swarming soup of

353
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.460
innovation and ideas and communication and trying to figure this thing out

354
00:19:40.461 --> 00:19:44.060
together. And as soon as you just lump it all up to white people only like,

355
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:49.070
get the outta here with that old stupid idea. That's a stupid idea. Yeah.

356
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.280
And.

357
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.580
<v 1>That's why I'm so anti a PC and a cultural appropriation stuff.</v>

358
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.450
Cause those are the mechanisms to share where it's like there,

359
00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:01.310
it's not because I'm white and I don't want people to get credit for whatever

360
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.940
it's saying. How do we, you know, there's no quote that when goods,

361
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.900
when goods stop going across borders, armies go across borders where it's like,

362
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.370
if cultures coming together and sharing and developing and everything you just

363
00:20:13.371 --> 00:20:15.620
said is necessary for multiculturalism.

364
00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:19.490
And so if you say I can't wear some Barrow because I'm a white guy, even though,

365
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.750
even though I'm, you.

366
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.480
<v 0>Know, stupid, as long as you're not being an about it,</v>

367
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.970
you just having fun and what's the big deal. Yeah. And.

368
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.120
<v 1>Who needs that? Brim white guys pills. Right.</v>

369
00:20:29.121 --> 00:20:31.310
And weekends have a nice dark complexion. They can handle it.

370
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.690
I know Jews have no brim.

371
00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.030
<v 0>Dude. Very good. Very important point.</v>

372
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.620
<v 1>Mexicans and Jews to Twitter ads.</v>

373
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.270
<v 0>With some of the super Orthodox ones. They have the crazy brim.</v>

374
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.860
<v 1>Right? Yeah. They're like cheese heads with.</v>

375
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.710
<v 0>Oh, that's a different one. Right? That's a different one.</v>

376
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.430
That's a different kind of hat. They I've seen that one. Yeah.

377
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.323
That's a weird one.

378
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.430
<v 1>It's like part of west Hollywood has a bunch of those.</v>

379
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.310
<v 0>Hats. Yeah. That's an interesting thing about Hollywood. When you drive,</v>

380
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.700
there's certain neighborhoods you go down to that are all Orthodox Jews or at

381
00:20:57.701 --> 00:20:59.020
least a high volume of them.

382
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.530
So you see them with their strings that hang down from their belt.
