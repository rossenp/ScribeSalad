00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What's up? Jeremy, did you see what you know,</v>

2
00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:07.080
Colin O' Brady who was on the podcast a few months ago.

3
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:10.480
Now he's gonna row across Antarctica. Drake's passage,

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.360
I guess is what it's called in this little teeny row boat. Oh Jesus.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.120
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; he's.</v>

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.200
<v 0>Crazy. A couple other guys he's gonna do it with, but I guess they're gonna,</v>

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.760
he walked across Antarctica.

8
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.310
<v 1>How story? How do they, it really, it,</v>

9
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.630
I can't imagine it not being fraught at every other footstep.

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.950
<v 0>I bet you do that though.</v>

11
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.950
For like however long it takes him a summer rowing you come out ripped.

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.910
I bet you get developed serious back muscles. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

13
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.630
<v 1>I would say, yeah. Yeah. You know,</v>

14
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:43.020
that is the really positive way to look at it. Yeah. It's.

15
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.580
<v 0>A great workout. If you want to.</v>

16
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.700
<v 1>Do you want bigger back? &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

17
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.660
<v 0>We want your back to look beautiful. Okay. Crew must roll four hours a day.</v>

18
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.460
Rotating around the clock with little to no sleep. What? Yeah.

19
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.940
The live streaming, this whole thing with discovery. So my God, if they die,

20
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:01.180
we're gonna watch it, bro. I just,

21
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.450
I just swells can tower up to 50 feet high. What the man. Do you imagine?

22
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:08.690
It sounds so CRA. It sounds so crazy.

23
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.370
<v 1>Well, imagine it's two like 27 in the morning. Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.410
And everyone's asleep and you're in charge of rowing over 50 foot.

25
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.170
<v 0>Swells. And how much can you sleep? If everybody has to work 24 hours a day,</v>

26
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:22.400
what do you get? Like an hour sleep a day. Well, you.

27
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.200
<v 1>Get tons of fake sleep. There's the boat. It's.</v>

28
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.800
<v 0>Tired of rowing. You're in the zone. Look at this boat too. It's a.</v>

29
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960
<v 1>Little boat. Can you imagine being the cameraman?</v>

30
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:33.480
That's the most boring thing ever on that.

31
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:35.600
Did you see that cameraman on the back? Oh, that's.

32
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.160
<v 0>Ridiculous. He's got a row two though. There's no one. Who's just a camera man.</v>

33
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.480
Six athletes that says one, but.

34
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.110
<v 1>No chance. No motor.</v>

35
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.950
<v 0>They're. Yeah. Yeah. No sale. Oh God.</v>

36
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.910
Why do people have to do things like this? No. Turning back.

37
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.230
I love talking to them when they come back, but why do they have to do that?

38
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.540
It just seems so ridiculous. Good luck. The impossible. Follow.

39
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.860
<v 1>The expedition. I wonder how you sell that idea to,</v>

40
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.020
to like the other rower they have to be too. There you go. &lt;laugh&gt;.

41
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.980
<v 0>Bunch of crazy to get together. I was thinking about running a thousand miles.</v>

42
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.980
Well, Hey, before you do that, I got a project.

43
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.860
<v 1>Yeah. Does it start with like, hear me out, just hear me out.</v>

44
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.210
Let me finish the it's the pitch. And then like,

45
00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:29.410
do you have to preces that like that? Yeah. Or do you just gently try to.

46
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.370
<v 0>I think those kind of people, I don't know what you.</v>

47
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.170
<v 1>Up to. Yeah, certainly. They're they're near the or store or whatever.</v>

48
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.820
<v 0>The.</v>

49
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.690
There are some people out there that just can't push themselves hard enough,

50
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.010
you know? No matter what happens. They're like the,

51
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.680
like my friend David Goggins, he ran this, uh, Moab two 40,

52
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.000
it's a 240 mile race through the desert. &lt;laugh&gt; he, um,

53
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.400
developed pulmonary edema. Which, uh,

54
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.000
I guess you get at high altitudes when you're exerting yourself. Yeah.

55
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.840
That Everest like yeah. Crazy. Right. So he goes to the hospital,

56
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.560
they treat him, he gets back and finishes the race.

57
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.800
So he ran another 80 miles after he ran 180 plus with

58
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.240
pulmonary edema.

59
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.160
<v 1>Like what? Well,</v>

60
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:15.680
but does that mean that when you get done that you're like good. Whew.

61
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.710
<v 0>Okay. No, he didn't give a that. I mean, it's, there's no end with that.</v>

62
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.190
<v 1>Guy that, that, uh it's. There's no destination at all.</v>

63
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.230
<v 0>There's no finish line. Yeah, yeah.</v>

64
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.510
<v 1>Yeah. It's just like break to take a leak. I suppose the.</v>

65
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.510
<v 0>Thing is they know, they all know there's other people like them out there.</v>

66
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.350
So it's.

67
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.110
<v 1>Like, cause they're at the same race. Yeah. Not.</v>

68
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.660
<v 0>Even just that, it's just, they're all connected. But for, from the internet,</v>

69
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.780
you know, they're all connected through the circles that they travel in.

70
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:47.340
They're connected through just, but they follow other people like them online.

71
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.660
But do.

72
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.060
<v 1>You, but do you think that a drive like that is more an internal one?</v>

73
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:55.460
Or do you think that the competition of seeing what someone else did is, is a,

74
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.140
what kind of factor do you think that.

75
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.650
<v 0>I think they, they both a factor. It's,</v>

76
00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:04.570
it's other people that are pushing it. They make you realize that it's possible.

77
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.610
And then it's other it's you,

78
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.170
you also have to have some sort of insane internal furnace.

79
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.553
<v 1>Yeah. Well there,</v>

80
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.690
I believe when they did some brain testing on that climber fellow that did the,

81
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.410
um, Alex Honnold. Yeah, I, yeah. Yeah.

82
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.120
That he just didn't trip out as it took a lot more to freak him out. Oh yeah.

83
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.200
I'm sure that the, his brain waves are like, yeah, no, I'm cool.

84
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.960
Like when you're hanging by one toenail upside down.

85
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.800
<v 0>Dude, you even talking about him makes me nervous.</v>

86
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.680
I've had him on twice those shots. Yeah. Oh.

87
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.680
<v 1>My God. I, I, I shouldn't someone else's pants. I get so scared. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

88
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.733
<v 0>Bar you pants.</v>

89
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.030
<v 1>Those look great on you. Let me try them on. And then like, here you go.</v>

90
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.550
<v 0>Dude. Sometimes it's not even straight up and down.</v>

91
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:50.350
Sometimes it's an angle back. Yeah. Like, yeah.

92
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.830
Like 15 degrees back the wrong direction. Like what.

93
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.070
<v 1>I do. You just watch that and get vertigo where your balls are sort of like,</v>

94
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:58.630
right. Look at this. Look at.

95
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.100
<v 0>Don't I bro. That that's way than 15 degrees. How many degrees is that? Uh,</v>

96
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.420
if you had a guess 45, that's like 45 degrees, right? Yeah. Yeah.

97
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.940
<v 1>So that is definitely 45 degrees.</v>

98
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.700
<v 0>Thousand feet up in the sky. Oh.</v>

99
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.900
<v 1>But do you have to, my palms are sweaty. Yeah. My, do.</v>

100
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.820
<v 0>You sweat like crazy? Do you have to.</v>

101
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.010
<v 1>Feel that for, yeah, it's just, I couldn't tell if that's yours or mine, dude.</v>

102
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.530
<v 0>That's crazy. Like instantaneous.</v>

103
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.290
<v 1>Palm, sweat. We need to drink Purell now &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

104
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.090
<v 0>Slide our hands on fire.</v>

105
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.210
Put our hands in the same bucket of water use for this scorpion.

106
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.450
<v 1>You know? Right. And ride in motorcycle. Like I,</v>

107
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.760
I try to stay focused and be very no right in the moment. Yeah.

108
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:45.000
Because it's a requirement like when you're sort of like,

109
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:46.400
did I leave the iron on? Right.

110
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:49.800
That that's whenever I've gotten in like a little fender bender or right, right.

111
00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:54.480
Of course. You know? Um, and, but in that, there is no,

112
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.280
you do, do you have to stay so in it that there is no out or I think so. Yeah.

113
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.920
Can you let yourself drift in like,

114
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:04.360
almost like a meditative state and just be like hands? I don't.

115
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.240
<v 0>Think you can. I think if you drift, you're. I mean, I think first of all.</v>

116
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.160
<v 1>Well, so how do you stop requirements? Well then how do you stop things? Like,</v>

117
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.000
you know, guess who's hungry, hands up. Oh. You know? I mean, I think he.

118
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.870
<v 0>Does it so often that he knows how to get into that state, but you know,</v>

119
00:06:18.871 --> 00:06:21.430
there's also like, look at that little thing, go that back to state.

120
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.910
Just believe, look at that little thing he's holding on with his left hand.

121
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.630
What's this say that doesn't chip loose? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what's this say?

122
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.870
What's this say? I mean, some of those.

123
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.390
<v 1>Rock about manifesting that you do it talk about saying</v>

124
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.380
guess, you know, it's already done. You'd have to say it's already done.

125
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.620
<v 0>I don't know what I think you just gotta go left foot. Right. Foot, right hand,</v>

126
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:46.660
left hand. And then you also have done it many times with ropes.

127
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.220
<v 1>But also on when you're on the ground, you're like wanna hang out and he's like,</v>

128
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.500
no, bro, that.

129
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.340
<v 0>Looks like 60 degrees. This feels a little more that's insane.</v>

130
00:06:55.341 --> 00:07:00.010
He's like basically hanging upside down climbing was so far above the

131
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.110
trees.

132
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.770
<v 1>On purpose, on purpose, purpose. Like, like it's Tuesday there,</v>

133
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.690
you know what I mean? Most.

134
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.730
<v 0>People you and me included would be dead.</v>

135
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.250
We wouldn't be able to do what he's doing.

136
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.490
<v 1>Oh, I'd be dead of a heart attack on the, from realizing I was gonna try. And.</v>

137
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.320
<v 0>He's such a mellow guy too. That's what it's really interesting. Yeah.</v>

138
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.000
<v 1>Like, look at that smile. That's that's it's like.</v>

139
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.560
<v 0>He also just started recently getting injured.</v>

140
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.280
<v 1>Right. I saw that thing. Yeah. In the, the movie I tell you what though, I,</v>

141
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.200
I will read or watch anything about Everest or climbing or I don't mm-hmm

142
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.480
&lt;affirmative&gt; if there's something, cuz I'm always like, well I'm gonna go for,

143
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.230
for that metaphorically, you know, but metaphorically. Yeah.

144
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:43.630
Like I'm gonna take that.

145
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.190
<v 0>Metaphor, that energy and put it into.</v>

146
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.110
<v 1>The car and put it into something else. Like yeah. I don't know.</v>

147
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.950
Pass those chips over here. Like I, the way.

148
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.630
<v 0>I eat. Yeah. I eat the way those climbers risk their lives.</v>

149
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.710
<v 1>See that Sunday over there I'm gonna climb that.</v>

150
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.300
<v 0>Thing. It's just knowing that some one like that is out there though.</v>

151
00:08:00.301 --> 00:08:04.620
It changes what our, our expectations are. Like what, what we think of as the,

152
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.060
the boundaries of human performance and what someone's capable of doing.

153
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.820
<v 1>Well. It's cert it certainly, there's a weird, um,</v>

154
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.860
epiphany when you're watching someone do that. Yeah.

155
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.010
Cuz you're sort of like I'm doing the exact opposite of this person that

156
00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:21.690
I'm watching. Yeah. You're just sitting there.

157
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.650
<v 0>Yeah. You're like not risking anything. Uh.</v>

158
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.770
<v 1>Yeah. You're just sort of like, thank you for doing this for my pleasure.</v>

159
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.530
It's there's a, there's a moment of disconnect for me when I, when I'm like,

160
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.370
I'm going on a hike, I can't finish this movie anymore. Or you know, &lt;laugh&gt;,

161
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.010
I'm not supposed to finish this movie anymore.

162
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:38.371
<v 0>Well, it's,</v>

163
00:08:38.371 --> 00:08:41.920
it's interesting because what he's doing is essentially a spectator sport,

164
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.880
but there's no audience until after it's done.

165
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.600
<v 1>Right. So it, so it ultimately for the,</v>

166
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.120
for the climb must be singularly about you. I mean, it must be, uh,

167
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.480
the how, I don't know how you, how you include someone else during that.

168
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.613
No thing.

169
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.640
<v 0>I think it's just all about the moment. I think he's just, like I said,</v>

170
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.600
I think he's thinking left foot, right foot, right hand, left hand. And he just,

171
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.360
you just keep going and you know, the past, well.

172
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.600
<v 1>Then that would be akin to, to, you know,</v>

173
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.560
some of the greatest meditative minds that's I've ever existed. Yeah.

174
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.710
It's gotta be because it's one thing to meditate and position and, and,

175
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.950
and kind of go deeply within and keep going into the depths,

176
00:09:20.951 --> 00:09:25.590
which are vast. Right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but it's different if you said no,

177
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:27.830
you get up and climb this thing, please. Yeah. There,

178
00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:30.870
there would be a certain amount of, no, no, I'm still meditating.

179
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.950
&lt;laugh&gt; I'm not gonna do that. Right. Where you might be like, no I'm doing the,

180
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.940
this, so I don't have to do that.

181
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.300
<v 0>Right. To maintain that mindset through action.</v>

182
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.620
That's a different kind of meditation because the consequences are so grave.
