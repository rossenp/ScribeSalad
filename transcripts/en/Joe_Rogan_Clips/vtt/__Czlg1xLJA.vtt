00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.400
<v 3>And it's not just China, and this is the theory,</v>

3
00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:07.000
but the thing about the lab league and why I actually want to de culture,

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.800
you had Josh Rogan on and he, he did excellent job. He's really good.

5
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.400
That guy's amazing. What he, what he expertly shows is if this is true,

6
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:17.560
the lab league hypothesis is true. Yes. The Chinese covered up. Guess what?

7
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.400
The Chinese are liars and they covered up SARS and they've covered up based

8
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.710
everything. That's come outta their country for the last like 30 years.

9
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.150
That's not a shocker. The shocker is Dr. Anthony Fauci, 2017,

10
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.070
reverses the ban on gain of function.

11
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.630
Research directs this funding to EcoHealth Alliance, Dr. Peter Daza,

12
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.350
who then gives it to the Wuhan Institute of virology for the study of novel bat

13
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.700
coronaviruses. And then when the pandemic turns around,

14
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.980
we take Dr. Peter Daza as the only American to join the w world

15
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:51.060
health organization's investigation team into weather coronavirus leak from a

16
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:51.400
lab.

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.980
<v 1>And on 60 minutes, I, I forget who it was interviewing him. She goes, well,</v>

18
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:58.740
wait, so do, how did you verify it? Did you just ask them? And he goes, well,

19
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:02.570
what tells can we do? Cause he's also half British and that he goes, well, uh,

20
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.410
what else can we do? Oh, uh, we could read emails.

21
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.770
We could also see that D Peter Daza, as of two days ago has been caught lying.

22
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.970
He said there were no live bats. Yeah.

23
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.930
Inside of the Wuhan Institute of virology sky news,

24
00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:21.450
Australia just revealed 2017 video that bats were present

25
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.160
inside Wuhan virology. And the deputy director says before this,

26
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.440
China had no experience in BSL four lab.

27
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:33.840
That's the highest level safety for a laboratory, but we have been here and I,

28
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.400
I don't forget, I don't wanna MIS misquote him,

29
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.280
but he said something along the lines of creating new viruses,

30
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:44.110
synthesizing new viruses and what Fauci and Dr. She,

31
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.270
who was the head of the Wuhan Institute of virology. They're playing games,

32
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.510
Fauci and ran Paul when ran Paul was pressing him. He was like,

33
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.670
we did not fund gain of function research.

34
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.630
He's trying to define it as explicitly what he wa what is on the record of him

35
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:03.740
funding Dr. She is the same thing. We were not doing gain of function research.

36
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.763
This is actually.

37
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.420
<v 0>This is actually, this is amazing. I don't know if you caught,</v>

38
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.020
she did an email interview with the New York times. Yeah. Which was mostly,

39
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.980
I mean, it was just, you know, the standard like state party line from China,

40
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.020
but they asked her about gain of function research.

41
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.100
And I'm sure your listeners mostly know, know that gain of function.

42
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.290
Research is basically modifying these to see you. What,

43
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.650
how can we make these pathogens more dangerous? Right.

44
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.450
And it's very it's in and of itself,

45
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:33.850
very dangerous because these things do leak from labs, um, relatively routinely.

46
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:38.330
And she says we were not doing gain a function research because what we were

47
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:41.930
doing, wasn't making it more virent or dangerous.

48
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.680
It was seeing if it could jump for, from species to species. I'm sorry,

49
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.120
isn't that like the definition of making it more dangerous for us seeing if you

50
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.480
can make it jump into our species. Like that seems like that's pretty dangerous.

51
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.080
So they're trying to play these. It's not technically gain a,

52
00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.520
how does Fauci get away.

53
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.240
<v 1>With standing there under oath and saying media, right. A hundred percent.</v>

54
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:05.440
It's all media pressure, which is.

55
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.760
<v 0>He's the God, it's the, it's the anti-Trump arrangement syndrome, right?</v>

56
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.880
Fauci was put up as like the anti-Trump guy.

57
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.960
And he became this liberal icon. I mean, there are these signs in Washington,

58
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.590
DC of people's yards. I don't know if you have 'em here,

59
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.950
but it's literally his face on a sign. And like, thank you. Thank you,

60
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.870
Dr. Fauci.

61
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.590
<v 1>This is what we're dealing with, Joe. This is what we're dealing with.</v>

62
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.390
<v 0>Terrible worship, right? And again, no one is above reproach.</v>

63
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.390
Every human being is flawed.

64
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.510
And especially when you're in that kind of position of power,

65
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:38.670
and you have certain incentives,

66
00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:41.020
like you have to ask questions about these things,

67
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.900
but there was another element too. And this was frankly,

68
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.260
in an ingenious play by the media and the scientific community is not only was

69
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:49.781
it oh,

70
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:53.260
Trump and his band of whackos are the ones that are promoting this theory.

71
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.060
But also that this theory is somehow racist mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

72
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.770
And the moment that the lab leak theory was pegged as racist.

73
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.810
That's when it really became toxic for anyone in the mainstream to ask questions

74
00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:07.970
about, because you don't wanna be pegged as like, oh, well,

75
00:04:07.971 --> 00:04:10.090
you're just pursuing this racist conspiracy theory.

76
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.130
And my thought has always been from the beginning. Like, first of all,

77
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.690
we just need the answer, like neutrally to look at what actually happened here.

78
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.080
But second of all, if we're are playing them, which is more racists game,

79
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.760
it seemed way worse to me when people were like, Ooh,

80
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:27.880
Chinese people eat bets and that's disgusting. And they're so weird.

81
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.520
And that's how we all got this pandemic.

82
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.520
That seemed to me way more problematic than the idea that a lab,

83
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:35.440
that by the way, the USA is funding,

84
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.360
that something leaked accidentally from that lab.

85
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.390
So that was really the thing that put this all off the table was this strategic

86
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.990
weaponization of, you know, what is a very real problem of, of alleging racism?

87
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.990
<v 1>It's the scientific community teamed up with the, well,</v>

88
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:53.390
basically they got the luckiest break of their lives.

89
00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:56.870
That Trump was president because they teamed up with the media. That's true.

90
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.070
And they made it so that it was racist to question even recently,

91
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.420
then lead new Yorktown. I reporter on COVID tweeted and then deleted.

92
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.420
Are we ever going well,

93
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.580
someday we will acknowledge the racist origins of the lab league theory,

94
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.300
New York times reporter. Yeah, I saw the was in charge of COVID right?

95
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.580
This is still in their, in their brains. They have brain worms because of Trump.

96
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.140
And I was telling crystal because of Trump, 35% of this popul,

97
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.820
you could have smoking gun proof. Their lab league theory was true.

98
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.530
35% of the population, hardcore Democrats who watch MSNBC.

99
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.890
They'll never believe it. They'll always say that it's racist.

100
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.210
And here's the problem, which this is the same problem with all Trump stuff.

101
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.970
If gain, if this is true,

102
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.330
we should be having a national conversation around Gaina function research.

103
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.850
We should have a Wuhan commission around Gaina function research.

104
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.320
Instead they wanna do a January 6th commission in order to reconstruct of the

105
00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:45.040
events of a day where we all know what happened. Okay, it's over.

106
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.160
We know I'm not saying it wasn't terrible, but that is not what the driving con,

107
00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:50.800
what is it it's June 15th?

108
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.080
Why are we still talking about gain about January 6th?

109
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.760
We should be talking right now.

110
00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.440
Did us government funds explicitly directed towards novel coronavirus research,

111
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:04.120
which led to the worst pandemic in a century and cost of the global economy,

112
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.380
trillions of dollars.

113
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.760
And as Josh is the first one to point out the response from the scientific

114
00:06:08.761 --> 00:06:11.680
community has been, we need more gain of function research

115
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.000
$1.2 billion to the global viral project. And so once again,

116
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.430
the scientific community wanted all of this covered up.

117
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:23.150
They teamed up with the media to protect their funding resources,

118
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:26.230
because what people forget Fauci is actually the king of funding,

119
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.150
the national Institute of infectious disease. I believe that's N I a D.

120
00:06:30.151 --> 00:06:31.550
That's what he's in charge of.

121
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.990
They are the primary funding authority for huge amounts of the scientific

122
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.740
community. We Dr. Brett Weinstein on our show, and he was explaining this to us,

123
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.820
which is that if you're inside of that research system,

124
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.820
you need access to those dollars to keep your lab afloat.

125
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.300
Like for my dad is a professor at Texas a and M.

126
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.780
And so I know a little bit about funding and like the way that you keep your

127
00:06:52.781 --> 00:06:56.780
tenure positions in a lot of these universities is you have to like continually

128
00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:59.290
bring funding in. So both my parents are professors there.

129
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.450
And so like a lot of the professorial game is getting money from granting

130
00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:05.530
institutions. Now in the science community,

131
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.170
it's from the national science foundation,

132
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.570
it's from the national Institute or whatever Fauci is the head of the national

133
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.250
Institute of health. They have to keep the dollars flowing.

134
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.570
So if you admit this is gain of function, research, you start asking questions,

135
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.240
NIH in Fauci can cut you off. Like this is a whole business.

136
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.680
It's a multi-billion dollar. I mean,

137
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.960
it's an industry because it's about research. And look,

138
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:29.120
the core theme of our show is like, follow the money, right?

139
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.800
So follow the money. Where's the money lead at least Fauci Peter Daza.

140
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.520
And it's like, look, I don't wanna sound crazy,

141
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.680
but this is basically like a global conspiracy in terms of the Chinese

142
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:40.950
government. Uh, it's a total coverup of the Chinese government,

143
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.030
the us government, the guy who was on the TV.

144
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.110
And we were all supposed to trust this entire time. And it turns out like,

145
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.110
he's the guy who reversed the band in the first place in order to take advantage

146
00:07:52.111 --> 00:07:56.470
of the chaos under Trump. And I know it's so complicated and regular people,

147
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.950
this is what bothers me most about the mainstream media.

148
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.740
People wanna live their lives and they want answers.

149
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.820
And increasingly they know they are being lied to,

150
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.860
but they do not have the time cuz it's our job in order to, you know,

151
00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:10.900
explain all this about Peter Daza and the world health organization.

152
00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:13.860
What is gain a function research, how Washington actually works,

153
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.700
the global funding structures, et cetera, people are being lied to.

154
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.370
They have been completely to on the story.

155
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.890
I think I do think this is the biggest failure since Iraq WMD.

156
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.570
I think this is WMD 2.0.
