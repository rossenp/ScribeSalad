00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.840
<v 1>Experience. It's always hard for me at the airport. When I see like, uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.640
like a drug sniffing working dog, but it's like a yellow lab.

4
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.400
I'm like really pet, I can't pet the yellow lab. I don't, I don't.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.840
<v 0>You could ruin the dog.</v>

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.080
<v 1>I don't wanna ruin the dog and his chances at retirement, you could ruin.</v>

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.680
<v 0>It. I'm not going to, yeah. Those drugs,</v>

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.230
drug sniffing dogs make me nervous, cuz I'm like, what are they looking for?

9
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.310
Not weed that's truth, but you could only teach a dog to look for one thing,

10
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.790
you know, you can't say, Hey, I want the truth, the truth.

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.510
You can't teach a dog. Hey, I want you to look for guns and Coke. Right.

12
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.373
It's like residue.

13
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.623
<v 1>Right. Do smell.</v>

14
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.150
<v 0>Right, right. Do you smell gun powder? Do you smell marijuana?</v>

15
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.980
Like what do you smell? Like what do you, what do you train? You train.

16
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.540
<v 1>The dog to smell heroin. You find, uh, mushrooms. Bring them back. Right?</v>

17
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.893
<v 0>Find them find 'em you little.</v>

18
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.580
<v 1>Yeah, definitely the heroin. Cause I think you can make more things out of that.</v>

19
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.180
<v 0>Uh, well it's one that kills you.</v>

20
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.020
It's one of the reasons why they should look out for heroin. Fentanyl.

21
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.740
If they could smell fentanyl, that would be nice. They could smell anything.

22
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.540
But.

23
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.220
<v 1>I feel like fentanyls it's more local. Oh actually, no,</v>

24
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.610
I don't know what I'm talking about. I feel like with prescription drugs,

25
00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:05.250
like that's more like it ravages a community.

26
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.570
And I don't when I think of like airplanes,

27
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.650
I think like weight being pushed through from other countries. But I don't know.

28
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.810
<v 0>I think it's all things, meth. It's everything.</v>

29
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.250
It's the really up part about it is.

30
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.050
It's almost like what we were talking about with football.

31
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.480
That football be safer. If there was no helmets, it doesn't make sense.

32
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.200
And drugs would.

33
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.033
<v 1>Be safer if they.</v>

34
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.120
<v 0>Regulate it. We would safer if they.</v>

35
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.120
<v 1>Were legal. I feel that way about prostitution. Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.520
And I'm gonna actually broach this here. I was gonna write a joke about it.

37
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.360
I'm just gonna say it. I believe a state issued. If you apply for funding,

38
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.481
uh, for support,

39
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:39.400
if you're going to school like loan or the state's paying for you to go to

40
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:40.234
school, you get a scholarship.

41
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.510
You should also be able to apply for a state issued prostitute.

42
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.070
If you are a little socially awkward,

43
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.230
maybe you haven't had sex because men get weird.

44
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.150
If they haven't been made privy to the way a woman is,

45
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.750
or they haven't had sex and you're going to college, let's get you a prostitute.

46
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.110
Let's get you having sex twice a week. So you, you're not afraid of women.

47
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.750
Let's get you a little less weird. Let's fund a prostitute.

48
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.020
<v 0>Well, I think if it didn't have the social stigma behind it,</v>

49
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:08.420
there's a lot of people that would choose it overworking at Wendy's great.

50
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.180
Did a lot of people that choose it. But we long as an it's a choice.

51
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.980
The social stigma is that there's something wrong with it. Right's.

52
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.900
<v 1>Because it's a woman saying I wanna do this with my body.</v>

53
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.900
That's what's upsetting that. It's sort.

54
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.060
<v 0>Of that, but it's also, well in this country,</v>

55
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:25.810
it's also connected to sex slavery. We think of it as like,

56
00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:29.690
if someone is doing that, then maybe, maybe they're a sex slave.

57
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.490
Like maybe there's someone who's. I think.

58
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.690
<v 1>That's less on people's radars.</v>

59
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:35.970
And it more has to do with the puritanical idea of.

60
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.610
<v 0>There's a little bit of that. But I mean,</v>

61
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:41.130
that was one of the things that they were accusing Robert Craft of you remember

62
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.920
Robert Craft? Who's the guy who owns the craft or it's craft. Right?

63
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.600
He's the guy who owned the new England Patriots.

64
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.960
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he went to a

65
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:50.280
massage power in the game of happy ending. And then the next thing you know,

66
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.480
they, you know, they arrested him and told him that there's a video of it.

67
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.481
Right. And they were, you know,

68
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:56.480
they're trying to get him to plead guilty and all this,

69
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.000
all this different that was going on to a guy who's like insanely insanely

70
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.240
wealthy, who just was going there to get jerked off.

71
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.400
But one of the things they said was that it was, uh,

72
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.360
that he was participating somehow in sex trafficking.

73
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.320
And so they were accusing him of that. They were,

74
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:14.000
that was a big part of what the police were saying. Well,

75
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.520
it turned out that none of the girls that worked there were sex traffickers.

76
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:20.430
They're just prostitute. And the woman that did it to him,

77
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.790
she was like 40 years old. But none of.

78
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.630
<v 1>This would've happened. If it was legal, none of it would.</v>

79
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.310
<v 0>Regulated legal, but it's also, they, they were using that term to,</v>

80
00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:32.030
they were accusing him of this thing and using that term, like to, to brand him,

81
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.350
wait.

82
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.470
<v 1>Are you telling me that to shame him?</v>

83
00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:35.550
There was a news story where they used a buzzword.

84
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.260
<v 0>Yes. Yeah. It is a buzzword. Right. But it's a buzzword. That's,</v>

85
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.980
it's very specific in terms of like the difference in the consequences that you

86
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:48.420
would want someone to face,

87
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.780
whether they just went there to get jerked off or they participated in sex

88
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.500
slavery. Right. You're.

89
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.820
<v 1>Not a part of a ring. I mean, you are cuz the ring ends with you.</v>

90
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.740
So because there's a demand for it, there is a supply.

91
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.570
So that is by and large part, part of the issue. Um, and I say this,

92
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:03.010
not knowing a ton about sex slavery,

93
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.090
but I do know that if you take away the stigma and you can normalize things very

94
00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:08.810
quickly, weed is a great example. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right. Yeah.

95
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.651
You could do that.

96
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:12.650
And even we've done this with women and bodies and the way that we look at

97
00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:14.970
people who are overweight and we look at people with different things.

98
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:17.490
Like we are getting to a place where it's less of a thing.

99
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.760
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I think you could do that with prostitution. I so too. And,

100
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.880
and it's fine. And look at it as like, this is her choice. And if there,

101
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.960
if there wasn't an exceptional exorbitant demand for it, it wouldn't be a thing.

102
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.400
<v 0>Yeah. It's just, you,</v>

103
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.000
you can't tell people what to do with their bodies any other way,

104
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.800
except when money's involved. Yeah. That's why I have a problem with it. Except.

105
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.633
<v 1>When taxes are.</v>

106
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.550
<v 0>Involved. Yeah. But it's, it's, it's not even that it's, it's,</v>

107
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.950
it's a societal position, right? Like if we were gonna vote on it,

108
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.870
most people would vote on no prostitution cuz they don't want their daughter or

109
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:52.470
their sister, their mother to be a prostitute. That's how that's or, or them,

110
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.190
they don't wanna be a prostitute. That's why they would vote on it.

111
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.310
But it's the only thing that's completely legal to do.

112
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.060
Like not only that, but it's what sells everything.

113
00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:07.700
When Brandon hit is selling cologne, he's selling, I'm a hot man. If you,

114
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.260
if you get my cologne, you might get some pusy I'm looking right.

115
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.093
<v 1>At that mouth. Yes.</v>

116
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.820
<v 0>Look at him. It's beautiful. I, I agree. But that is the thing that is,</v>

117
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.060
is up about all this.

118
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:20.860
Like a woman can have sex with as many people as she wants for free

119
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.250
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; she charges then all sudden incr. But, but,

120
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.530
but you can charge for a back rub. Like what the? Like why.

121
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.210
<v 1>Is it you're like I'm getting off either way.</v>

122
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.050
<v 0>But it doesn't just doesn't make any sense. It's I agree with you. It's silly.</v>

123
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.010
<v 1>It's restrictive.</v>

124
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.290
Think when it comes to the idea of a woman taking control of her own body,

125
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.010
no taxes being paid, uh,

126
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.400
and the idea of someone and being a because of our puritanical roots in this

127
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:46.920
country, all those things combined make it a volatile topic.

128
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.080
But at the end of the day, if she's gonna make money,

129
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:53.080
that's gonna go back into your society. That's gonna be put to good use.

130
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.800
It's gonna be tax. It's gonna be in your community. What do you care?

131
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:58.040
What she's doing behind closed doors,

132
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.600
if it's safe and it's regulated just like weed,

133
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.280
all of a sudden there's standards. Now there's a way to, uh, sanitize.

134
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.640
<v 0>This. Yeah, I think so. And they did it in Australia. They did it in Nevada.</v>

135
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.640
Yeah. And parts of it, parts of it. Right. Um, but in Australia they have,

136
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.320
I mean, it's full on there. You can do whatever you want. They have,

137
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:16.320
they have brothels.

138
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.990
But I think it's also one of the things that we're conditioned to have a

139
00:06:19.991 --> 00:06:22.270
perspective on it, similar to the drug issue.

140
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.710
Like I don't want my friends or my daughters or my mother or

141
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.150
anyone I know to be a prostitute. Right. So we have this,

142
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.350
like this position on it. I also don't want them to do Coke,

143
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.950
but I don't think Coke should be illegal. I,

144
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.860
I don't think anybody should be able to lock you in a cage cuz you want to get

145
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.840
coked up. Imagine.

146
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.820
<v 1>If it were legal, how many less people would be dying just in a drug trade.</v>

147
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.360
<v 0>Yes.</v>

148
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.340
And how many more people would be aware of how much you can do because you'd get

149
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:53.220
actual Coke with a lot of the you're getting is being cut because you're getting

150
00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:55.940
it. You're buying it from people that aren't companies. Right.

151
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.290
If you're gonna buy something, Nabisco, Nabisco was selling Coke,

152
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.770
put the ingredients on it. It'd be a hundred percent Coke.

153
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.050
You'd be able to get real Coke.

154
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.650
<v 1>Real Coke, Nabisco flavored cocaine. Moreover I mean, look in Europe,</v>

155
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.570
the way that they are with alcohol. Like Italy, for example. Yes.

156
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:12.210
Kids have wine when they're little and sure there's alcoholics there,

157
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:12.920
but it's way less.

158
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.090
It's less of like a rum Springer freak out when you are able to do something.

159
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:17.490
That's.

160
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.960
<v 0>A great way to put it a rum Springer freak out that. Yeah.</v>

161
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.520
What she's talking about, if you don't know,

162
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:24.880
is the Amish have a thing it's when they turn like 18, right?

163
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.760
Something like that. They get to go ham. They get to do whatever they want.

164
00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:30.800
They could watch TV, they could drink smoke pot and.

165
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.840
And they go crazy for a short period of time. And then at the end of that time,

166
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.390
they can either leave the church forever or come back.

167
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.830
And most of them come back. Right. Because it's all, you know,

168
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.390
also you're probably so hung over. Like Jesus, someone.

169
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.180
<v 1>Make me some.</v>

170
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.710
<v 0>OCAS get me back. Cutting logs.</v>

171
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.190
<v 1>This is real workout.</v>
