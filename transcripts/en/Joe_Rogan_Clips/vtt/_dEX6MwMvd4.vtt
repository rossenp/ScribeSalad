00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Or that's what happened? I'm sorry.</v>

2
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:05.580
That's what happens by the way,

3
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:10.530
when there are presidential debates where the moderators are typically less

4
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:15.210
than ideal in terms of their express bias. And that's why I was very excited.

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:18.840
And I think I had even shared, uh, when, when, when the rumor was coming out,

6
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:21.300
that, you know, you'd be willing to, uh,

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.620
moderate a debate between Biden and Trump. I thought, God, that's a great idea.

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.950
Whatever happened with that, that either of their camps, uh,

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.990
reach out to you or did you connect with them?

10
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:32.190
What happened with that whole story?

11
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.880
<v 1>All in, he was all in. He wanted to do it. Yeah. He tweeted it. I mean, he,</v>

12
00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:41.000
he wanted to do it. He contacted people that contacted me to do it,

13
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.340
but I never reached out to the Biden people.

14
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:45.860
I felt like if they wanted to do it, they would reach out to me.

15
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.830
And if they did, I would have done it. Um,

16
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.350
but I just don't think that's a good forum for him. I mean,

17
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.320
as we've seen the debates themselves specifically,

18
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:58.340
the last debate was not good for him. But what I would have done is like,

19
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:01.160
when he was saying that I've never said I was going to ban fracking,

20
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.750
Jamie would have just pulled up video of him saying I'm going to ban fracking.

21
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.290
And that would have been horrible for him. It would have been much better. Um,

22
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.320
in terms of getting some clarity on what he's actually said and what he's

23
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:14.300
actually done. And you know,

24
00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:17.270
and then the other things about saying that his son never received any money

25
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:19.730
from Russia. And that that's, that's, that's a lie.

26
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.010
It's been disproven and it hasn't been disproven.

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.390
He knows it hasn't been disproven,

28
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:26.660
but he knows that he can say that on the air and no one's going to call him on

29
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:28.430
it. I would have stopped the moderation.

30
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.530
I would have stopped the thing where I go, sir,

31
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.880
we're going to pull up these articles and I want you to tell me what about these

32
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:38.720
articles is in factual? Like what is, what's a lie?

33
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.490
And are you sure that's would you be willing to say this in court?

34
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.010
Which would, would you be willing to risk perjury?

35
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.450
Would you say this in front of a judge? Like if you,

36
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.940
cause you could be in real trouble, if you did that,

37
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.180
but you could just lie in a debate and the moderators don't check you.

38
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.670
No one says anything about it. No one Googles it,

39
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.090
what can't they just pull up a story, pull up a video.

40
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.450
There's I mean the fracking thing was particularly egregious. Yeah.

41
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:08.210
Well there's only one Jamie he's right here. We're not giving them up,

42
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.820
but someone could have done that.

43
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.450
And it would have been much better for the American public to just stop

44
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.520
everybody in their tracks. And also like,

45
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.850
why do they have two minutes to answer that that's so antiquated.

46
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:22.250
This is so ridiculous. The idea that you're talking about,

47
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:24.440
something that literally can affect the free world,

48
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.900
the decision of who gets control of the United States of America, who,

49
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:34.580
what party is in control and that you're going to put some arbitrary two minute

50
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:38.570
time limit on these discussions is crazy. It's it's so ridiculous.

51
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:43.310
And also the format is confined by these time

52
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:45.860
blocks that they have this 90 minute time block,

53
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.480
you should have a 90 minute time block.

54
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.280
You should start it at like agreed upon time, 60 minutes or 6:00 PM or whatever,

55
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.390
whatever you want to do.

56
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.130
And then work it out like Abraham Lincoln and some of the speeches that he gave

57
00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:01.540
when he was running for president, there were hours and hours long,

58
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.400
and he was talking without a microphone in like a town square and discussing

59
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:09.160
these ideas that he had and they would last forever.

60
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.870
And that's how you find out what a person thinks and believes you have to. And,

61
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:15.820
but now with the tools that we have available,

62
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.940
the fact that they don't use those tools during a presidential debate,

63
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.570
fact-check Trump. When he lies about something, pull it up, show,

64
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.810
show that he's not telling the truth show what he actually said showed.

65
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:29.350
He actually did, as opposed to what he said, he's doing call him out on it,

66
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.520
call Biden out on it. Let's get to the bottom of this. But you know,

67
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.140
even though those tools are available,

68
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.830
mainstream media would have to give away control.

69
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.750
They would give away control of their ability to navigate and

70
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.140
steer this narrative, right? The narrative that they're trying to steer,

71
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.420
you know, the bias that they're trying to exert on our election process

72
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.560
is really offensive. It should be offensive to people.

73
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.310
It should be offensive that they have the ability to Google whether or not Joe

74
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:04.300
Biden really did say he would never ban fracking. And they didn't.

75
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.620
Why would you not pull up a video that's readily available online and say, sir,

76
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:09.880
we're going to pause here for a moment.

77
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.990
We're going to play this video and tell me what you meant when you said you were

78
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:14.920
going to ban fracking.

79
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.280
Tell me what you meant when you said you were going to embrace the green new

80
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:21.070
deal. Tell me what you said when you,

81
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.440
when you said that you were going to do whatever, the,

82
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.840
whatever the you lied about and pull it up.

83
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.330
<v 0>I think for me, what amazes me about when he says things like that and,</v>

84
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.480
and I suspect maybe we can say the same thing about Trump,

85
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.690
although I can't remember quite the same types of lies.

86
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.340
Trump usually lies about, you know,

87
00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:42.420
my penis is the biggest the women have told me I'm the greatest lover ever look

88
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:46.500
at the number of people and he's, it's, it's, it's, it's bombastic, boasting,

89
00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:48.660
right. Whereas the other guy, right.

90
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.960
And the other guy is basically saying things that are demonstrably false.

91
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.490
And the only thing I can think of that could explain sort of the chutzpah

92
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.740
of engaging in these types of lies it's as if Joe Biden's brain

93
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.960
still exists in the 1940s where he doesn't know

94
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.850
that there's this thing called Google and computers where we can quickly

95
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:13.950
have Jamie fact check you, right.

96
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.300
Because what the rates are in the same way that he does the corn pop story,

97
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.650
which, which is difficult to, to, to know if he's telling the truth or not.

98
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.820
Because again,

99
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.780
it happened in the sixties or seventies or whenever he could say something,

100
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.250
thinking that it can't be falsified because how else could you logically

101
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:35.100
explain that he would engage in such lies? Right?

102
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.060
<v 1>Well, not only that, like how was the democratic party not saying, Hey,</v>

103
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:40.020
this is a mistake.

104
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.640
Like the whole idea that there's a deadline to this process.

105
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.500
And it all has to be done in a certain amount of time.

106
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:50.580
And this is how we have to do it. It's like, boy, it's so weird.

107
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.140
It's so weird that such an important decision episodes of the Joe Rogan

108
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:58.700
experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.

109
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.850
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

110
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:02.990
they're going to be available everywhere.

111
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:06.560
But after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

112
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:10.610
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

113
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.960
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking you. Just go download Spotify,

114
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.800
Bubba. Okay.
