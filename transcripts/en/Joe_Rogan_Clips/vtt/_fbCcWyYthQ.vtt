WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.200
<v 0>Actually right. A hundred percent. I've read all of, uh, tatuin's uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.040
works almost all of them. He he's a brilliant trainer. I agree with that.

3
00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:09.200
A hundred percent outside of competition. Let's explain it to people. Yeah.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.440
Okay. So yeah, let me, uh, okay, so let's say for instance, let's say, you know,

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.280
I'm a big believer in never being sore.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.800
You should train and the next day you should wake up feeling good. Okay.

7
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.430
You know, why how's that possible? Well, because as look, if, if, okay,

8
00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:24.910
that's a great, that's a great example. Let's say, um,

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.150
let's say your energy levels. We're talking about fit people by the way. Right?

10
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:30.750
Every, every, every human being, every single, so guys' never worked out before,

11
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:32.470
even your first day, first day never changed.

12
00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:35.190
How is it possible to work out and not be sore? No problem. Beautiful.

13
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.990
Here we go.

14
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.870
&lt;laugh&gt; so let's say there's something called rate of perceived,

15
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.460
ER, okay.

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.100
So let's say I make you do pull ups and let's say the maximum amount of pullups

17
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:49.540
you can do the maximum amount of pull up is 10.

18
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.380
Let's keep a nice round number at 11. You couldn't do 11.

19
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:55.260
If I put a point at a gun at you, you couldn't do 11.

20
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.970
Should I make you do 10 pull ups on our workout? No, I'm gonna make you five.

21
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.450
Why? Because I'm setting you up to work the next day,

22
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.250
the next day we're gonna do five and the next day we're gonna do another five.

23
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:11.730
And then we're gonna do six. When six is really easy, we're gonna do seven. Why?

24
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.370
If you count, if the, if you did 10 pull ups on Monday,

25
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.450
you're gonna be sore through Thursday. Let's say it's really your max.

26
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.210
So on Thursday, you've only done 10 pull ups from Monday to Thursday,

27
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:23.560
you've only done 10 me. I've been doing five pull ups every day.

28
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.080
So I'm at 20 pull. Upups already 25 pull ups. Mm. I have more volume than you.

29
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.360
Ah. Now, if you add up at the end of the year, who trained more,

30
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.720
I've trained way more than you. So let's say I go to Jitsu practice.

31
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.680
I'm doing Jitsu every single day, three rounds, five days a week.

32
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:42.790
That's 15 rounds. You go in twice a week, but you kill your off.

33
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:44.710
You do five rounds each day. You kill you, push yourself.

34
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:48.110
Those last two rounds and you burn yourself out. I still did 15. You're at 10.

35
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.510
At the end of the year, I've done countless rounds. More like, I mean,

36
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.030
I've had so much more training than you.

37
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.990
So how much training can we pack in in the week?

38
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.430
That's the real question. How much volume can you expose your athlete to?

39
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.580
So I always tell people to look energy, sorry, exercise can produce energy.

40
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.340
So let's say I'm feeling like a seven outta 10,

41
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.380
10 being I'm really like energized.

42
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.940
One is like really lethargic feeling like I need to lay down and seven I'm

43
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:17.220
feeling good. Okay.

44
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.820
If I get up and I do a right amount of exercise, the right amount,

45
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.610
I can feel like an 8.5 exercise can give me a tonic effect,

46
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.530
like drinking this coffee. So let's say I just do some jumping jacks.

47
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:31.930
I hit the back for a couple rounds. I'm feeling good. Once you get that high,

48
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:36.170
shut it down. Don't go into the phase where your body's beat up tight,

49
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:38.050
broken up. Don't redline the body.

50
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.850
That's only for training camps for a P for a small period of time. Why?

51
00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:46.440
Cause you get a little bit more from the system, but in the long run,

52
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:49.560
you get less in the long run. You've taxed the system.

53
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.760
So if you do that regularly, by the time you actually get good,

54
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:55.920
you'll be broken up. Mm that's why I do a lot of flow training. Have you ever,

55
00:02:55.921 --> 00:03:00.880
have you ever heard of, uh, mihaic send miha's, uh, uh, flow? No. Okay.

56
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.680
So can you, can you, Jamie, can you look up a flow chart?

57
00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:07.080
It'll be so much simpler, like just put in flow, uh,

58
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.920
flow in the workplace or flow chart. This is such, this is pure genius.

59
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.640
This guy is pure genius. Basically he went and he, uh, he coined the term flow.

60
00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:16.080
So like when you're in a state of flow, we've all been in a state of flow.

61
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.720
The number one, um,

62
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.110
way to know that you're in a state of flow is time flies by I'm sure sometimes

63
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:24.790
you've done podcasts and you're like, whoa, is it three hours already? Yeah,

64
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.070
it was, it was a great podcast. You know,

65
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:28.950
the one where you have the worst guest or you're,

66
00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:31.550
you're having the worst workout. It feels like every minute is an hour. Yeah.

67
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.710
That's a, that's a bad, you're not in a state of flow.

68
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.830
A state of flow is you're having the right amount of difficulty,

69
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.300
but it's not so difficult that you to stress and it's not so easy that you're

70
00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:42.740
bored. It's the right amount of challenge.

71
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.140
So let's see as simple as playing a like Teris, if I put you on a,

72
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.300
if I put you on a level, that's too high, you're gonna be like,

73
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:50.900
you're gonna play for five minutes and you' be like, I'm done.

74
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.060
If I put you on a level too easy, you're gonna be like, this is boring.

75
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.420
If I put you at the right amount of level, you see that's just the flow channel.

76
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.930
So if the challenge is too high, you'll meet anxiety.

77
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.490
If it's too low, your boredom. When I go in the practice room,

78
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.850
I'm trying to create flow. I'm having fun training should be addictive.

79
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.090
Imagine training was addictive. Everybody would train. Everybody would be fit,

80
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.370
but people always go into anxiety. They go and they kill their slam their body.

81
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.720
Then I have to convince you to do it again. And three days later,

82
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.880
two days later, and you're like, dude,

83
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.800
the mental energy is gonna take me to get there. Like it shouldn't be,

84
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.360
it should be training should be a pulling force. It should be pulling you.

85
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.480
You wanna go training. If you don't wanna go training, it's not fun.

86
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.440
If it's not fun, you're not gonna do a lot of it. Mm.

87
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.840
And if you're not gonna do a lot of it, you're never gonna reach mastery.

88
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.920
So how do I make it pleasurable? How to make it fun.

89
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.590
I have to be in a flow state and you can get into a flow state in almost

90
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.070
anything. But when you're out of that flow state, cut it.

91
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.110
We're gonna get further.

92
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.950
We're gonna do more training if we cut it today and come back in tomorrow.

93
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:54.110
Cause I'm a big believer in consistency over intensity.

94
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.870
Intensity should be done. One in a once in a while because by nature,

95
00:04:57.871 --> 00:05:01.780
intensity can only be done once in a while. If you're gonna hard every day,

96
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:04.540
you're not really going hard every day. You can't go your max every day.

97
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:06.900
There's a, there's a, there's a cost to going to your max.

98
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.780
Can you sprint every single day? You cannot sprint every single day.

99
00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:12.980
It's ludicrous. You could sprint once or twice a week.

100
00:05:12.981 --> 00:05:14.820
The best sprinters in the world. They sprint once or twice a week.

101
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.300
Nobody sprints every day because intensity by nature entails

102
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.730
that you need to take a break. Cuz if you don't need to take a break,

103
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.770
you didn't really go to your maximum intensity. If you lift your maximum lift,

104
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.570
the maximum amount of reps, you can, the, the maximum weight you can lift.

105
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.890
If you do two reps that wasn't your max. Cuz if it was,

106
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:38.130
you wouldn't have have a second rep in you, you understand, right.

107
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:39.970
I would have to give you a break for you to have a second rep.

108
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.000
So we didn't find your true max, right? Intensity, maximum effort entails.

109
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.120
You have to stop because it's the maximum. There was no more reserves.

110
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:51.200
There are no more reserves. So what do you think about people that,

111
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.720
that say there's no such thing as over training. Here's the,

112
00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:59.800
the John denihar narrative and I don't and I, he, he coins it really,

113
00:05:59.801 --> 00:06:04.240
really well. He says, look, it's under rest. So he says, look,

114
00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:07.400
you couldn't overtrain. If you didn't give your body the rest later. Yeah.

115
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.160
But he says, look, no matter how hard I push in practice,

116
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.800
if I didn't kill myself, I can rest from it.

117
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:15.960
Then recover and have super compensation. I agree with that.

118
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.750
<v 1>Some guys have made great strides with just mental fortitude and mental strength</v>

119
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.430
over training the outta themselves.

120
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.550
<v 0>Okay. But can I ask you this? Yes. They were successful. Yeah.</v>

121
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.550
<v 1>Yeah. But their bodies break down. Right.</v>

122
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.550
<v 0>But they could, could they have been better possibly if they used flow. Exactly.</v>

123
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.410
Right.

124
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.070
<v 1>As good as they were Dan Gable, for example, for example,</v>

125
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.260
like Dan Gable essentially was done in his twenties. Right.

126
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.820
In terms of like his body's broken down. Exactly. Knee replacements,

127
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.660
hip replacements, th that kind of deal.

128
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.740
<v 0>Let me ask you this. Who wins more often Russians or American wrestlers.</v>

129
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.860
Russians. Every time an American wrestler wins. He's like some prod prodigy.

130
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:54.220
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, he's rare. It's rare. It does happen. But it's rarely,

131
00:06:54.221 --> 00:06:56.220
he's a technical master. Right? However,

132
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.570
you have these Russian guys that medals, you've never heard of them.

133
00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:01.010
And they're like Michael Jordan's of the, the sport. Yeah.

134
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:02.130
There's just so many of them.

135
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.770
They train long consistent practices. Whereas America, we do Monday, Wednesday,

136
00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:10.610
Friday, hard. We kill it. And then you rest Tuesday, a Thursday,

137
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.850
the Eastern block had a totally different understanding.

138
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:16.410
They're like it's volume, volume, volume near the fight,

139
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.360
short and intense only near the, the competition phase. But before that,

140
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:24.720
it's the maximum amount of volume you can imagine. Me and you are, are,

141
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.720
were two athletes,

142
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.960
a and B you're a and B you're training jujitsu three times a week. Really,

143
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:33.360
really hard. You're going all out. I'm training jujitsu every single day.

144
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.280
My average practice is two hours. Your average practice is two hours.

145
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:39.550
But when you go in, you kill it. Like you, you go,

146
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.350
you go with all the black belts and you kill it. At the end of the year,

147
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.150
I'm averaging three practices or two practices more than you.

148
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:49.790
So I've had a hundred practices more than you by the end of the year,

149
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.870
104 practices. Mm let's give two weeks for vacation.

150
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.030
A hundred practices more than you, 200 hours. More than you have been training.

151
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.140
When we roll your, that you put on the mat is gonna be irrelevant. Why?

152
00:08:01.141 --> 00:08:03.420
Cause I've also tasted that intensity periodically.

153
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.700
It's not that much of a factor. Now, when you go super aggressive on me,

154
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.380
when you attack me aggressively, I have felt that I know how to deal with it.

155
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.340
Plus I have an extra a hundred hours on you, 200 hours. So I'm gonna manle you,

156
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.340
you know what I'm saying? The volume is far more important than the intensity.

157
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.690
The intensity by nature is need, is, need to be done periodically.

158
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.650
If you do it every day, it's not intensity. So.

159
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.370
<v 1>How the Russians, how do they structure their training? They're.</v>

160
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.330
<v 0>More playful. You know, they kind of like, they kind of warm up,</v>

161
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:34.450
they kind of flow roll. They kind of like, they do a lot of technique,

162
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:36.650
high emphasis on technique. Now a lot of people hearing this are gonna be like,

163
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.890
well, the Russians also are funded by their government. You know, they,

164
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:42.440
their government supports the them a lot more than maybe an American, uh,

165
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.800
wrestler. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; okay. I agree with that. There are many factors.

166
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.280
However, we cannot deny that they're technically, uh,

167
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.200
I hate to say the word superior, but they're technically more advanced.

168
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:53.160
Technically when it comes to wrestling, they have a,

169
00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:56.040
more of a flow understanding. They play around and it, and it, and,

170
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.640
and the practice gets more and more intense,

171
00:08:57.641 --> 00:08:59.960
more and more intense until you see them going really, really hard.

172
00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:02.240
They're going live. You know, they're going really, really rough,

173
00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:04.080
but they were playing. They have a more playful attitude.

174
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.160
You look at the Cubans, you ever see Cubans sparring.

175
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.720
They're like 50 guys in the room. They're just touch sparring.

176
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:11.680
There's no headgear. There's no Matt on the floor.

177
00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:12.960
They're literally sparring on concrete.

178
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.310
You think they're really trying to drop each other. They're on concrete. I mean,

179
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.710
the Cubans are the top boxers they're consistently win gold medals,

180
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.710
but in practice room, they're playful. Nobody gets hurt.

181
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:24.750
Like you're seeing the ties. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the ties are just, if,

182
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.990
if you go in there and you, and you kick a tie really hard,

183
00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:29.790
he won't spar with you anymore. He'll be like this guy's too. It's too amateur.

184
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.070
Hmm. There's a time and place for intensity. I'm not antiintensity.

185
00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.620
I think there time in place like Angela Dundee was probably arguably the

186
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.700
greatest boxing trainer in history. He says, look,

187
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.060
fighting is for fight night in practice.

188
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.420
It's only practice George champi has that attitude.

189
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:49.260
And I think that's why he's so good and so healthy today, you know,

190
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:50.620
because he never hurts to sparring partners.

191
00:09:50.621 --> 00:09:53.180
People line up to wanna spar with him. It's a joy to spar with him.

192
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.170
<v 1>Yeah. I, I love this. I idea. And I love this approach. I think that, um,</v>

193
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.490
we, we have this attitude that you have to be tough.

194
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.570
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; we have this attitude that you have to work hard.

195
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:06.570
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and uh, I mean, I've fallen prey to that many,

196
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:09.050
many times in my life where you just gotta be tougher.

197
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:13.970
You gotta work out harder. You gotta push harder. But when I read Pavel stuff,

198
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.480
one of the first things that struck me, it's like, well, yeah, of course.

199
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.480
If you just do five reps every day mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then you won't be

200
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.960
sore. You could do it more often. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then your body,

201
00:10:23.961 --> 00:10:25.800
like you get farmer strength. Exactly.

202
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:29.120
Like where's farmer strength come from farmer' they're not going to exhaustion.

203
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.160
No, you know, they're not like throwing hail BA bales,

204
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.280
no hay bales to the point where, you know, they literally they're heaving.

205
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:38.230
They're put their hands and knees like, come on five more. He like.

206
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.110
<v 0>You should never be sore if you're sore, you overdi it. Whoa.</v>

207
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.190
Cuz I can't train the next day. If I'm sore, I opened the wound.

208
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.310
<v 1>Every time I work out, then what's that? I said I've overdone it.</v>

209
00:10:48.311 --> 00:10:49.950
Every time I worked out, you may.

210
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.030
<v 0>Have &lt;laugh&gt; you may have, you gotta.</v>

211
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.670
<v 1>There's a lot of people listening to this right now. Ball, wait a minute. What,</v>

212
00:10:54.671 --> 00:10:55.504
what.

213
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.380
<v 0>How the make your workouts at seven outta 10 and do them every day.</v>

214
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.380
You're gonna get far more training hours.

215
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.380
You're gonna spike your you're gonna spike your metabolism far more often.

216
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.140
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; your energy levels. Your mood is gonna be far more, uh, uh,

217
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.940
up and, and training is gonna be more addictive.

218
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.340
<v 1>Now, what kind of training do you do at this stage? Like you're not competing,</v>

219
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.010
but you're constant in there're sparring with guys who are professionals and

220
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:22.610
you're constantly training them. Like what kind of stuff do you do?

221
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.170
<v 0>Um, I do jujitsu wrestling,</v>

222
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.490
Moi and a small amount of conditioning after practice. I'll do I I'm too bored.

223
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.210
I find jumping hurdles and, and throwing, like doing weights and stuff.

224
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.690
Me personally. I don't find that as enjoy. I,

225
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.130
I don't have to take that much enjoyment of it.

226
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.840
I can do five to 20 minutes in a practice.

227
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.880
<v 1>Isn't that? Because barring is just so fun. So much fun. Yeah.</v>

228
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.800
<v 0>I'm in a flow state. We're having fun. You know we're wrestling. We, yeah. I,</v>

229
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.400
I think conditioning. You can't get away with it. You need it. You need it. And,

230
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:48.841
and I,

231
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:51.000
we gotta talk about what George was saying on your podcast that he doesn't do

232
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.680
strengthing conditioning. There's there's a language issue.

233
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:53.880
There there's a language issue. Okay.

234
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.200
And what we gotta talk about that because we've done tremendous amounts of

235
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.680
strength and conditioning. Me and George, like tremend, like barrels full. Okay.

236
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.400
And uh, but he has a different definition. He there's a misunderstanding. Okay.

237
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.120
So I really want clarify that, but me personally, like, look,

238
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.760
if we roll for an hour for me, it passes like this. Cuz it's so fun.

239
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.710
It's so fun. We're having good time. I'm fascinated. I'm fascinated. Like,

240
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:18.230
oh you grabbed like, like I'm always learning new things. Right? Um,

241
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.070
to do swing a ketlelell to do pushups, pull ups.

242
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.270
I can only do that for fine amount of time. So I'll put a timer, three rounds,

243
00:12:24.271 --> 00:12:26.950
two minutes and I'm doing it. And I bite the bullet and I do it.

244
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:29.870
It keeps me healthy, but I don't go and practice to just do that.

245
00:12:29.871 --> 00:12:34.140
That I never do. It's always after my workout, after I digjitsu after. So.

246
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.900
<v 1>You never have a day where you say today, I'm gonna do Olympic.</v>

247
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.220
<v 0>Lifting. No, I don't think Muhammad Ali ever did that. Momuhammad Ali never. He,</v>

248
00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:41.741
he boxed.

249
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:43.860
And then he did his conditioning may whetherther it does his conditioning.

250
00:12:43.861 --> 00:12:47.300
Then he boxes. It would always came together. Why? When I go to the gym,

251
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.380
I'm gonna go have fun. I'm gonna go wrestle. I'm gonna go box.

252
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.460
I'm gonna have a blast. Then I'm gonna grab the ketlebell. I'm gonna do a,

253
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.730
a few presses. I'm gonna do a few Turkish get ups and I'm done. Mm.

254
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.570
Because I need to have some general fitness. You have general fitness.

255
00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:00.730
Then you have specific fitness.

256
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.370
Specific fitness is to get better at my sport general fitness to keep me

257
00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:06.110
healthy,

258
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.810
strong and allow me to reach new levels of athleticism that later in the long

259
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:15.000
term can translate to my sport later. But if you, you just do your sport,

260
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.960
in my opinion, your system's gonna break down. Your back's gonna break down.

261
00:13:17.961 --> 00:13:19.880
Your knee's gonna break down. Your shoulder's gonna break down.

262
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.840
You need to stimulate certain muscles that are not, uh,

263
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:25.960
getting stimulation in your specific sport. Hmm.

264
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.240
You create atrophy in certain muscles cuz you're not using them really. Right.

265
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.720
I need to work my stabilizers. I need to swing the Ketle. I need to squat.

266
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.550
I need to do certain, like what are the.

267
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.150
<v 1>What are the standard cores kettlebells, uh, for.</v>

268
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.470
<v 0>Is that like triple extension is number one. So any type of squatting maneuver,</v>

269
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.030
I don't particularly use the squat. I like to use triple extension.

270
00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:47.270
Triple extension. So your knee, hip and ankle are bending. Okay.

271
00:13:47.271 --> 00:13:49.310
So like a squat. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; your knee, hip and ankle are bending.

272
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.550
I like to jump. I like to throw the medball a lot against the wall.

273
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.990
I like to do hurdles. I like to do box jump.

274
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.980
I like to very low impact TRICS I like sprinting. Sprinting is huge.

275
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.300
You ever do the beep test? What's that? Oh, you got,

276
00:14:02.301 --> 00:14:04.700
you got the space for the beep test here. You gotta implement it. What does it,

277
00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:06.500
it's the best way to do cardio. Really? You ever hear the,

278
00:14:06.501 --> 00:14:08.380
the soccer players use it a lot. It's a beep. Right? You run,

279
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.460
you beep and then it beeps back and the faster the beeps go,

280
00:14:11.461 --> 00:14:13.860
the faster you have to run. Ah, that's really amazing.

281
00:14:13.861 --> 00:14:17.210
Cause what I do is I set a timer for five. I put it on a high pace.

282
00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:20.930
Like I put it at 10 or 11 and it'll just shuttle back and forth and it keeps,

283
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.810
it tells you how fast to run the beat test.

284
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.530
And some days I'll I feel really good. I'll do 11.

285
00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.370
Cause I know how fast I have to run to keep up with the beats. And that just,

286
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.330
it's amazing for cardio. It's short, sweet, painless. And it's, it's very,

287
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.960
uh, it translates very well to do you.

288
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.160
<v 1>Do Tabatas do you ever dobosbas.</v>

289
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.280
<v 0>Are good? Yeah. I think Tabatas are good if they're done well, they're good.</v>

290
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:44.120
But again, you have to do it in a way. It doesn't create soreness.

291
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.320
Cuz Tabata can create soreness. You have to be very,

292
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.360
I wouldn't do Tabba ketball swing. That'll that'll cook my, my hamstrings.

293
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.960
I'll probably do like hurdle jump.

294
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.160
Like you take a small hurdle and you just hurdle over it for 20 seconds.

295
00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.880
Now what you're saying though,

296
00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.800
like there's gotta be a bunch of CrossFit people out there right now that are

297
00:14:59.801 --> 00:15:02.080
screaming into their phones. They're wrong. All due respect.

298
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.520
&lt;laugh&gt; they're wrong. I like, can you say all due respect with all the respect?

299
00:15:05.521 --> 00:15:07.560
They're wrong. Let me tell you why. Okay. And then, and, and look,

300
00:15:07.561 --> 00:15:10.160
if you like CrossFit, do it. Whatever motivates you do it. Okay.

301
00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.350
Rosst's problem is it's fatigue seeking. Yes. It says look,

302
00:15:14.351 --> 00:15:16.590
go out there and burn yourself out. Yeah, that's totally wrong.

303
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.030
They're not building any skill. Try to show me a guy.

304
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:21.510
Who's a champion at CrossFit champion.

305
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.670
Injisu that guy would need two lifetimes to re to reach mastery in both of

306
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:29.630
those. Why? Because my CrossFit workout is gonna tax me so much.

307
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.860
I cannot learn armbar week triangle choke, double egg take down.

308
00:15:32.861 --> 00:15:36.660
Underhook I'm I've taxed. My whole system. My system is in recovery.

309
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.820
When your system's in recovery, what can you do? But rest you understand?

310
00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:43.020
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; okay. Half Menez. Do you think half Menez?

311
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.740
One of the arguabl with the greatest pound for pound,

312
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.420
one of the greatest pound poundjiittsu guys in the world,

313
00:15:46.421 --> 00:15:48.780
do you think he's got a great, uh, uh,

314
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.140
CrossFit workout that he's really mastered? He's really good at.

315
00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:52.210
Do you think he great back squad?

316
00:15:52.211 --> 00:15:54.730
Do you think he's a great deadlifter doesn't look like it. No,

317
00:15:54.731 --> 00:15:58.250
he doesn't believe me. You think, you think, uh, uh, Gordon, Ryan,

318
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.290
he he's a great, uh, Olympic lifter. No, they, they they're.

319
00:16:01.291 --> 00:16:04.810
They're always gonna be at an amateur level in that, in the fitness world. Why?

320
00:16:04.811 --> 00:16:08.650
Because if they were experts, they would have taken so much from theirjijitsu.

321
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.810
Mm. Like look at George. He does gymnastics. Okay.

322
00:16:10.811 --> 00:16:14.200
And I'm the one who I tweet to his arm a little to put 'em in gymnastics. Why?

323
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.280
Uh, because I thought it would, it would give 'em tremendous benefit because,

324
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.360
uh, of, uh, the amount of, first of all, they use a lot of body weight.

325
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.920
So it doesn't cost us anything.

326
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.760
Neurologically body weight exercises are very easy to recover from

327
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.800
body. Weight exercises are very easy on the nervous system.

328
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.510
They use leverage instead of weights.

329
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.150
Plus the stabilizer strength is unbelievable. So,

330
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:39.710
and of course I want coordination.

331
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.270
I felt George was a little bit stiff mechanical.

332
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.830
And the tumbling makes you more, uh, fluid. I, I think I,

333
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.510
I thought I would create more efficiency this way.

334
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.150
So we get 'em there and there's there's difficulties. Okay.

335
00:16:51.151 --> 00:16:56.060
From a to F we're still at a and B and he'll always be at a and

336
00:16:56.061 --> 00:16:57.580
B. Maybe he'll touch C in his career,

337
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.780
but he'll never get to F you'd have to start really young and you'd have to do

338
00:17:01.781 --> 00:17:05.860
it full time. You know, imagine somebody trying to get good at jujitsu doing it.

339
00:17:05.861 --> 00:17:08.860
Part-time he'll never get good. He'll he'll be so, so he'll reach such a level.

340
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.130
CrossFit is too fatigue seeking for an MMA fighter. Now,

341
00:17:14.131 --> 00:17:18.490
if CrossFiters followed, uh, if they, if they just followed that 70% rule,

342
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.890
they C and periodically went to their max periodically,

343
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:26.290
as opposed to every single workout go totally out. I bet you their top top guys,

344
00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:29.050
don't go all out every day. I bet you, if you,

345
00:17:29.051 --> 00:17:31.810
if you watch what their top guys do, they taper off the workout.

346
00:17:31.811 --> 00:17:36.400
They make the workout between 70 and 85%, a true max and they work volume.

347
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.280
And then closer to competition, they go higher in intensity.

348
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.160
I guarantee you that's what the best CrossFiters do.

349
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.000
There's no way that the guy who goes balls out every day is gonna add up as much

350
00:17:45.001 --> 00:17:48.720
workout. And as much training time as the guy, who's going 70 to 85% of his max,

351
00:17:48.721 --> 00:17:49.600
there's just no way.

352
00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.480
<v 1>But when they do those classes,</v>

353
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.920
like say they do a CrossFit class and I'm speaking outta ignorance, honestly,

354
00:17:54.921 --> 00:17:57.840
because I only watch them on video. I've never done it a CrossFit class,

355
00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.320
but it seems to me they're competing against.

356
00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.160
<v 0>Each other. Yeah. They're going all out. Trying to set a PR. Yeah. Every class.</v>

357
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.720
Yeah. It's ridiculous. All due respect. I mean, it's just it't make any sense,

358
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.120
but why.

359
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:07.953
<v 1>Is it so popular?</v>

360
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.350
<v 0>Because people think that's right. Because why?</v>

361
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:13.910
Because when you watch a prime time or, or a fight, the guy's at the peak, he's,

362
00:18:13.911 --> 00:18:15.710
he's going at the he's at a point in his, in his,

363
00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.910
in his training camp where he's at the high end of intensity.

364
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.350
So people are always watching the last part of your camp. Mm-hmm,

365
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.910
&lt;affirmative&gt; the part where you're peaking and then you're gonna go taper off

366
00:18:24.911 --> 00:18:27.430
for 10, 15 days. They don't see that part.

367
00:18:27.431 --> 00:18:29.820
And they don't see the months before where you ramp up to that level.

368
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.780
They just see the last two,

369
00:18:31.781 --> 00:18:35.140
three weeks where it's the last few sparrings and we're mimicking fight speed to

370
00:18:35.141 --> 00:18:38.100
the maximum as we can. Yeah. We're flirting with danger here.

371
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:41.180
We're only doing it a little bit, but that's the part everybody's watching.

372
00:18:41.181 --> 00:18:43.540
So they think, oh, if you wanna become really good,

373
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.660
you have to flirt with danger every day you have.

374
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.300
That's what their workouts are. If you see George train throughout the year,

375
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.010
you'd be like, Hey, that wasn't so intense. That wasn't so intense.

376
00:18:51.011 --> 00:18:54.170
There was another really mellow practice. I remember when I was younger,

377
00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.890
I was training at the grand brothers gym and I would see oldest grant, you know,

378
00:18:56.891 --> 00:19:00.090
he's a world champion boxer. He, everybody knew him in Canada. Like he's a man.

379
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:02.730
And he was training really relaxed. I was like, dude,

380
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.010
I'm training harder than him, but he's, that's his millionth workout.

381
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.770
It was my 10th. You know-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; he's doing in the long run.

382
00:19:08.771 --> 00:19:10.480
He's added way more years of training.

383
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.200
So that's when I started to understand that the champion,

384
00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.640
the best guy he's training for the long run, it's far more intelligent.

385
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.880
He's getting far more workouts in than me. That's burned out.

386
00:19:19.881 --> 00:19:23.440
And the next day I need a rest, right? Yeah. So it's, it's consistency.

387
00:19:23.441 --> 00:19:26.160
Over intensity. Intensity entails.

388
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:27.640
You need to take a break cause there's no way.

389
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.180
<v 1>Around it.</v>

390
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.230
So if you're a young person listening to the us and you've got a coach,

391
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.470
that's trying to burn you out every day. What the do you do?

392
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.823
<v 0>Um.</v>

393
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.470
<v 1>I don't know the coach, if you go, go into the gym and go, you know what?</v>

394
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.110
I was listening to a hobby the other day and us saying, you're a retard.

395
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:46.303
&lt;laugh&gt;.

396
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.790
<v 0>Here's my, here's my, uh, you know, when I roll with the guys,</v>

397
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.300
I think they feel when have them I'm grabbing them gently and they realize it

398
00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:56.220
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I'll let them like, I'll let guys pass my guard. Like,

399
00:19:56.221 --> 00:20:00.260
I'll just go ahead, start second control. And I'll just get,

400
00:20:00.261 --> 00:20:02.620
they'll get the message that we're just kind of playing around. Right.

401
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.620
And then later when we're going more intense, you know, they'll feel,

402
00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:08.340
it they'll feel the intensity, but I don't always roll hard.
