1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. That's a bummer man,</v>

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:05.730
that Deontay Wilder stuff that's going on right now.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.030
He's he's released three different excuses.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.050
The first one was the weight vest. The, the thing that he was wearing,

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.620
the crazy costume weighed 40 pounds apparently wore his legs out.

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.570
The next one was that there was a bunch of people saying that Tyson Fury's

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.950
gloves, um, weren't attached correctly. So the gloves were extended.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.560
So he was hitting them with the knuckles and the,

9
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.830
the glove part was not really attached. It was like,

10
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.710
so he was catching them like with the part that's supposed to be over the wrist.

11
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.930
Not correct, not true and easily provable. The next one, he said egg weights.

12
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.540
He said he had egg weights in his hand. This is recent.

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.493
Like a couple of days ago.

14
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.430
Then yesterday there was an article that said that he believes that he was his

15
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:50.940
water was poisoned by his own trainer. And mark Braylin was a part of.

16
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.960
<v 1>That for folks who've been, I don't know who knew who mark Breland is former,</v>

17
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.710
uh, I think Olympic gold medalist world champion across two different weight

18
00:00:57.711 --> 00:00:58.820
divisions. If I'm not mistaken,

19
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:02.270
he is the voice of sanity or was until he was dismissed in that corner.

20
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:06.320
That was the guy that threw the towel for him. Who ha I mean,

21
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.300
Breland should be thanked by Wilder and his camp until the end of time.

22
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.190
His other trainer, um, uh,

23
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.100
I forget his last name starts with a D he was out there at the postcard press

24
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:18.320
conference being like, and I don't know if I would've thrown that towel.

25
00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:21.110
It's like you, yes, man. Are you kidding me?

26
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.600
Breland took it upon himself to, uh, I don't say the guy's life,

27
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.170
but certainly make the right call for holding the contest.

28
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.040
He was thanked by being dismissed and now essentially dragged through the mud

29
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:35.240
for the utterly.

30
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.600
What I'm guessing or utterly baseless accusations about poisoning his own

31
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:41.990
fighter. I mean, maybe Tyson Fury's awesome.

32
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.550
That seems like the simplest explanation.

33
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.010
<v 0>Tyson fury changed his strategy.</v>

34
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.880
And also you have to realize that Tyson fury in the first fight was coming off

35
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:53.120
of a multiple year battle with depression, mental illness,

36
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.430
drinking gut suicidal thoughts.

37
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.660
He talked to my podcast about driving his Ferrari and almost slamming into a

38
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.040
bridge. He's like I was,

39
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:05.360
I was pedal to the metal and I was thinking about slamming into this bridge and

40
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:09.530
they changed his mind and it just slowly worked his way into shape.

41
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.910
Got healthy again, got his mind right again, and pulled it back around.

42
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.160
But when he fought Deontay Wilder,

43
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:19.400
the first time his father didn't want him to take the fight. He's like,

44
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:23.060
you're not healthy enough yet. You're not ready yet. And he did his best.

45
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:23.751
He fought well,

46
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:27.800
but it was a draw by the time they fought the second time he was in tip-top

47
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:30.770
condition, he had gone through the camp for the first fight.

48
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.570
His body was completely recovered from all the abuse of alcohol and cocaine and

49
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:39.920
all the that he was doing. And then he took on, um, the crunk trainer,

50
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:43.370
sugar hill, and then his whole strategy changed.

51
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.550
He's like the guy does not fight well off the heel, off the back foot.

52
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.530
Let's let's move him back. And Tyson fury is enormous. He's huge.

53
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:54.380
Six, nine. Yeah. And he came into the fight at finger, like two 80.

54
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.830
And so he just pressed him and pressed him and just was strong bombs.

55
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.660
And I don't think Deontay Wilder that Deontay while they're expecting him to run

56
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:05.350
and move and jab and fight the same way he fought in the first fight. Instead,

57
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.310
Tyson fury just came right at him and just clipped him hard and often.

58
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.610
And I think if you go back to their first fight and you look at how,

59
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:17.260
when Tyson fury got dropped in the 12th Roseline Lazarus and then came back,

60
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.330
survived, and then started winning the round. Right.

61
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.060
And then I think he realized from that moment on, oh,

62
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:24.340
the way to beat this guys to back them up. Right.

63
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.360
And then he took that strategy sugar hill, of course, like Cronk,

64
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:32.890
legendary aggressive attack. I mean, they're like the people are MMA.

65
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:36.160
Fans love shoot the box. They like the shoot, the box of boxing. Right?

66
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.270
If you think about it like aggressive attacking multiple champions,

67
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:43.060
Gerald McClellan, Tommy Hearns, I mean, the list goes on and on.

68
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.920
And he employed that sort of attacking strategy and he's a

69
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.360
masterful boxer.

70
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.580
<v 1>Right? That's the other part about it? I mean,</v>

71
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:52.860
folks don't realize he can play the defensive game.

72
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:54.630
I think you saw it in the auto Valene fight.

73
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.080
He's so long and has such good trunk movement.

74
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.920
He could actually lean on the ropes and the punches go in front because he's so

75
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:06.090
tall and long he can, he can play that game. The Klitschko fight, right,

76
00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:06.924
exactly.

77
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.900
<v 0>Sandbox Vladimir Klitschko was one of the greatest ever, almost.</v>

78
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.840
<v 1>A thrilling fight. I mean the lot or fight was much better, but, um,</v>

79
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.600
I did a whole video on it. And two, I was like amazed. He,

80
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.360
from the stance he took, he had a little bit of an A-frame stance.

81
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.200
So you can say just the way he was always, um, a double jab away.

82
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.440
So he was long enough where he was outside of anything that Wilder could have

83
00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:28.080
put together. He was rule one, two kind of guy, or, you know,

84
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.620
water would just come lunging in with a punch and he was good enough to back him

85
00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:33.360
up and then steer him into punches.

86
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.280
And I always talk about this Eugene Behrman who who's the, you know,

87
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.540
and everyone gets on me cause I'm always promoting city kickboxing,

88
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.690
but it's like, he's a masterful train. It's like, well, not only that.

89
00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:46.830
I mean every once in a while you come around to a guy who not only can train

90
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:48.390
fighters to a high degree,

91
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.340
but has an idea about what the game is missing and how to fill that gap.

92
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.410
And they are big believers in fainting. They, they, they make a point.

93
00:04:58.411 --> 00:04:59.880
They basically say like, how is it possible?

94
00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:03.270
You can have people come from this little tiny island. And you know,

95
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.660
auto sign is the very best version of that. But like, they've got good fighter,

96
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:11.160
Brad, Brad Rodel, uh, Shane young and Dan, they got a lot of guys and Vulcan,

97
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.210
Husky has trained under Brad who trained under a Eugene who basically what they

98
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:18.260
believe is that what has been missing for a long time and MMA striking is

99
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.180
effective thinking, faking and fainting and that, uh,

100
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.960
they do shadow boxing drills for hours just on fainting,

101
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.460
no punches thrown,

102
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.220
just fainting just to set it all up because they basically say,

103
00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:29.911
if you look at the way,

104
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:33.060
which a lot of American and even European strikers throw,

105
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.560
it's a lot of sit down and throw combinations, uh, which you could do,

106
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:39.420
but they don't really believe that's the best way to do it.

107
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:43.560
The best gap to fill is that fury to circle the point here is

108
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.160
excellent. He is such a brilliant fainter.

109
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.140
And he had Deontay Wilder dead to rights over and over and over

110
00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:55.770
again, which he didn't really do the first time around. And so, you know,

111
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:59.360
all these excuses about my crane or a poison, it's like, it's like,

112
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.680
that's not what the tape shows.

113
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.830
<v 0>Bro. Well, he got it. He was making excuses.</v>

114
00:06:02.831 --> 00:06:04.990
When he got dropped with the first punch,

115
00:06:04.991 --> 00:06:07.540
he was like pointing to the back of his head and he was upset.

116
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:11.200
And you could see, it's like, it's really weird. It's really weird.

117
00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:15.280
When you see a guy who is so utterly dominant and who has what Teddy Atlas

118
00:06:15.281 --> 00:06:17.440
calls, the greater racer that right hand.

119
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.310
Cause it really is erases all your problems. You up a little bit,

120
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.210
watch this plant.

121
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.310
All your mistakes gone with his right hand is a force of nature.

122
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.020
<v 1>It's one of the best right? Hands on the history of the sport.</v>

123
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.340
<v 0>Ever. The Louis Ortiz fight. Like what the, man,</v>

124
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.570
what the hit him on the forehead and, or teases down,

125
00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:39.610
like with a look on his face? Like what the F.

126
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.440
<v 1>And Ortiz is not some chunk. He's huge. He's a Cuban boxer, you know,</v>

127
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.450
who has great pedigree, one shot set his down and he was winning.

128
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.920
<v 2>The fight. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.</v>

129
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.170
He was the one in the fight and all of a sudden black, if you.

130
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.220
<v 1>Look at the, my, my view on his power is that for straight rights,</v>

131
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.310
which is really what he basically throws or maybe a little bit over handy.

132
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.400
Cause it's a little bit looping. That's one of the best, if not the best. Right?

133
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.640
In all of boxing. If you're talking about full on power punchers though,

134
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.070
I don't know that he's got the full repertoire. Like his,

135
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:11.590
his upper cut was right-hand as good as, as straight.

136
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:15.820
I don't know that it is just so you got like Earnie, shavers, bro,

137
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.080
go look up Earnie,

138
00:07:17.081 --> 00:07:20.830
shavers highlights on YouTube and then it smoked some weed beforehand.

139
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.100
You will literally laugh at what he does to men, for sure.

140
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.340
Shocking to watch his power. And he has the full repertoire of it. You know.

141
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.930
<v 0>A lot of fighters who fought him,</v>

142
00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:30.730
said he was the most powerful punch they ever faced.

143
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.550
<v 1>Someone told me, I forget who it was, but they, uh,</v>

144
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.520
they got hit by shavers and then they felt it in the, um,

145
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.680
in the roof of their foot, the arch, the arch,

146
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.040
they floated in the arch of their like radiated into the arch of her foot.

147
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.480
What the is that? I never heard some like that. You know what I mean?

148
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.670
<v 0>Yeah. Well, this power's a weird thing, right?</v>

149
00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:54.480
Like you're the born with it or you're not, I mean, I've,

150
00:07:54.481 --> 00:07:58.210
I've seen so many guys who you you'd look at and they're their babies strong and

151
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.630
you would say, wow, but that guy hits hard and they can't crack an egg. No,

152
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.820
there was. There's like, there's a bunch of them.

153
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.070
There's always been a bunch of them in boxing. It has been a bunch of them.

154
00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:09.250
Like you see them in the gym and then you see guys like,

155
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.980
do you remember Michael McDonald when he was a kid? When he's coming up? Yes.

156
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.940
Skinny looks like a little boy, knocked people into another dimension.

157
00:08:15.941 --> 00:08:19.840
And you're like, whoa, this is crazy. Goes back to the Wilder fight.

158
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.490
Like while they're Deontay,

159
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:26.440
before Tyson fury beat him had only gotten to decision two times Tyson

160
00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:29.290
fury and a Dominic Brazil. Was that what was.

161
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.020
<v 1>Brazil? He knocked out in the first round, in the remaining bourbons to Vern.</v>

162
00:08:35.021 --> 00:08:35.854
Right.

163
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.710
<v 0>Vern's to Vern was in the first fight. He beat him by decision. Right.</v>

164
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.300
And so he had been used and he had gotten so confident and towards the end of

165
00:08:43.301 --> 00:08:47.200
his career, I remember there's a photo of him walking, um,

166
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.010
to the fight or walking through a casino in Vegas.

167
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.510
It's an amazing photo.

168
00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:55.800
He's wearing a fur coat with an open shirt holding wife's hand.

169
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.280
And he just looks like the ultimate heavyweight champion of the world. Yeah.

170
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.970
Like you, you seem like that is what I want from a heavyweight champion.

171
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.870
Just top of the game, just wearing these crazy sunglasses,

172
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.870
fully shredded for coat,

173
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.430
holding his wife hand I'm like that that's heavyweight champion Connor or has.

174
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.540
<v 1>That in his head. Yeah.</v>

175
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.520
Connor's the heavyweight champion of the world in his head, you know,

176
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.740
which I don't like, I'm not bashing them for it. Like I want,

177
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.180
I want that you should,

178
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.960
you should be resplendent and ignorant and amazing all at once. You can.

179
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.940
<v 0>Find that photo of Deontay Wilder holding his wife's hand wearing a fur coat.</v>

180
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.520
He's one of my favorite fighter photos.

181
00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:35.630
Like getting ready for a fight of all time because it's so just aggressively

182
00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:38.900
confident just, and on top of the world, how do.

183
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.740
<v 1>You do that? It's almost like a you to everybody. You know, he.</v>

184
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.400
<v 0>Was basically, he was being the baddest man on the planet. I don't.</v>

185
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.730
<v 1>Think I've ever had that kind of self-confidence ever, you know what I mean?</v>

186
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.360
Well, yeah.

187
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.820
<v 0>I mean, you have to have that to be that guy. Right. Right.</v>

188
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.990
Especially when you have.

189
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.350
<v 1>You know, he doesn't have the widest skillset. Yeah.</v>

190
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.540
<v 0>I mean, well literally came into the game. I mean,</v>

191
00:09:59.541 --> 00:10:02.870
I had the privilege of that's one of them. Is that the one I,

192
00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:05.630
this is one where he's got no shirt on. Oh, up in the,

193
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.260
is it for the first or second that he doesn't have a shirt on? It's just a oh,

194
00:10:09.261 --> 00:10:11.180
okay. Okay. That is, yeah, there.

195
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.850
<v 3>It is. That's it. There's a few of them.</v>

196
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.830
He looks like Mr. T with all the chains.

197
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.900
<v 0>Too. I mean, come on.</v>

198
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.000
<v 1>Man, you got a white guy getting your luggage even better.</v>

199
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.710
<v 0>He just, I mean, I'm a fan of his, I really am.</v>

200
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:27.380
And I'm a fan of his as a human being. I really enjoy talking to him.

201
00:10:27.381 --> 00:10:30.020
And then he told me a story. He's a great guy.

202
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.820
He got into boxing because his daughter was sick and he was a bifido. Right.

203
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.150
Yeah. He, and he's a delivery guy for like,

204
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.140
was it Budweiser or something like that? Or Coca-Cola some liquid.

205
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.510
And he was like, look, I got to make some money.

206
00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:47.450
And he knew he wasn't going to be able to play, uh,

207
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.870
in a college sport or in a professional sport without a college background.

208
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.960
She's like, well, I'm gonna get into boxing a year and a half in wins,

209
00:10:53.961 --> 00:10:56.480
a bronze medal in the Olympics. Like what the?

210
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.420
<v 1>Just dumb power.</v>

211
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.430
<v 0>Power, crazy. Like, like one in a billion human power. But.</v>

212
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.780
<v 1>If you've ever seen him interact with his kids,</v>

213
00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:10.040
like the nobility of trying to do that for your daughter is one thing he's got

214
00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:13.790
like a bunch of kids got like five or six of them. And I'm like, uh,

215
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.430
I didn't know. I just had a kid about 18 months ago.

216
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.010
I didn't understand it when I would watch. But like,

217
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.780
I don't think he's happier than when,

218
00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:22.580
when he's with his children and it's not even,

219
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.390
there's not even a close second doting family, man. It's really unfortunate.

220
00:11:26.391 --> 00:11:30.350
He's made these excuses because as a person, he seems like such a sweet guy.

221
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:30.830
It's.

222
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.790
<v 0>A bummer. And I, and I wish someone was there to advise him Breland. He was,</v>

223
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.250
well, I should bring, you know, I don't know.

224
00:11:37.251 --> 00:11:39.650
Maybe mark doesn't have the kind of relationship with them that he can.

225
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.020
<v 1>Call them. Right. Understanding his, uh, his, uh,</v>

226
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.790
his manager and his manager was the one who brought in Breland years ago.

227
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.940
I was like a, was like, we need somebody here. Who's like a high level trainer,

228
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.040
uh, and brought him in. And it worked for a time anyway, but.

229
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.700
<v 0>Here we are. I talked to Roy Jones about him. And Roy Jones was saying,</v>

230
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.810
if he trained him,

231
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.590
what he would train him is he would concentrate his left hand. He was like,

232
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.290
well, you know, you could put people to sleep with your right hand. He goes,

233
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:09.130
what about your left hand? He goes, I want to keep people distance, use the jab,

234
00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:12.280
use the hook. He goes, I would concentrate on just working that left hand.

235
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.320
He goes, that would fix so many of his problems.

236
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.620
Cause his left hand is just like, here comes the right. It comes the right.

237
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.850
Boom. I mean, he'll throw jabs, but you're not terrified of it.

238
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.230
The way you're terrified of Roy Jones.

239
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.350
Left-hand episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify.

240
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.550
That's right. They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

241
00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:33.720
they're going to be available everywhere.

242
00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:37.290
But after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

243
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:41.340
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

244
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.380
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much.

245
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.510
Buh-bye okay.
