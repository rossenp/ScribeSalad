00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.680
<v 1>Yeah, no, it's complicated. And it's getting well, that's the thing of like,</v>

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.280
it feels like the level of danger and difficulty in the world is just getting

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.560
steeper by the day. We're like, wait, what?

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.900
And then there's always global warming and you're like, oh.

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.990
<v 0>Did you see if a, the science guy, bill Nye going crazy screaming.</v>

7
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:26.670
And he was on elevator. The planet's on fire and yeah, let's get a little.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.740
<v 1>Silly. Yeah. I, no problem.</v>

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.370
<v 0>We're all right. Go to Antarctica plants on a fire.</v>

10
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.750
<v 1>Uh, no, I saw things that Antarctica was like 84 degrees. Oh my God.</v>

11
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:37.530
It's on fire.

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.570
<v 0>I mean, yeah. You really see something.</v>

13
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.070
<v 1>It was 84. Yeah. Something in the dark circles, 84 degrees, like three days ago,</v>

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.593
that.

15
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.170
<v 0>What.</v>

16
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.180
<v 1>It's going to be, uh, it's going to be,</v>

17
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.520
do you ever think about like global warming,

18
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.350
but really what it will look like? Like in 70 years,

19
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.890
what it will do to the art? Like,

20
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.690
and I'm not talking about just Miami's gone or any that's like

21
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:06.930
incredibly like, crazy to think about it. Like that.

22
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.830
<v 0>Fathomable, those Miami people. They're going to move other places.</v>

23
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.470
<v 1>And ruin. That's probably the biggest, that's my biggest worry.</v>

24
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.490
<v 0>He goes, could it be Lamborghinis dudes yelling at girls.</v>

25
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.090
<v 1>And Spanish eating outside. Everyone's eating outside, but like,</v>

26
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:25.920
would you get indoors? You maniac though. A lot of salsa. I love going salsa.

27
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.170
And like North Carolina, like the out of here.

28
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.760
Salsa dancing the out of here with a dead ain't bet. Dang. Um,

29
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.983
that's a good bit.

30
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.650
<v 0>They're like another country that's attached to Florida.</v>

31
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.810
<v 1>Yeah. It's like Europe. It's I always say it's like people,</v>

32
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.050
do you see like Italian people, like in Beverly Hills or Miami? And,

33
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.900
and I would say to my friend, those are people that were too for eight LA.

34
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.080
They're like, oh, we got to take it to the next level Miami.

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.120
And then that deep, deep, uh, yeah, that, but,

36
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.040
but you think about like Kenya, like not like 28 days later, but like,

37
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.170
you know, like huge, like scary, scary,

38
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.790
especially cause we're going to be near dead and no

39
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:19.860
disrespect. You're not going to be in the same shape you're in now.

40
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.930
And you're not you do. I mean, people may give you respect, but like,

41
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.610
it's going to be so sad.

42
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.350
<v 0>Gary, we're going to have to move to the mountains.</v>

43
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.440
Where would you move the hit the fan. Somebody.

44
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.570
<v 1>Sam. Uh who's what's Callan's friend. Sam ciders. Mine. Sam Cedar.</v>

45
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.200
No, Sam I'm the fighter's mind. He wrote him.

46
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.460
<v 0>And how can I not remember his name?</v>

47
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.100
<v 1>Yeah. Um, hold on a second.</v>

48
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.990
<v 0>I'll tell you real quick.</v>

49
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.760
<v 1>This is going to be worth it guys. Listeners. This is Sam, Sam, Sharon.</v>

50
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.370
That's right. Sam. Sam. Sure. Thank you. Told me 10 years ago.

51
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.270
It stuck with me go to the marina because I live in Venice.

52
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.720
He's like go to the marina and basically just get

53
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.600
basically you got to pay to get on a boat or just be like,

54
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.000
I will be the hard part is how do I qualify to like,

55
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.620
I can help you. Right? Cause I get seasick. Here's what I have going for me.

56
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.140
Seasick buoys. Cause you just get away. You get away from, from LA.

57
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.620
Anyone you get away from uh,

58
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.400
NLAs case millions and millions of people. And you can,

59
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.070
if there's a attacker, you can see them.

60
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.860
You assume that they're not going to be like, you know,

61
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:37.630
seal teams coming onto your boat tackers. Well, I know. That's what I mean.

62
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.880
Like how crazy could it get?

63
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.750
<v 0>Yeah, you got to go to Alaska. The, how do you get there?</v>

64
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.260
It's a good call on, do you, can you drive reports, closed.

65
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.820
<v 1>Airport or lights.</v>

66
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.320
<v 0>Connected. Right? You could drive.</v>

67
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.350
<v 1>Right? You could technically drive. Yeah. Technically.</v>

68
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.720
<v 2>Cut off that road all the time. And like the Napa valley.</v>

69
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.220
Cause the landslide or.

70
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.870
<v 0>Oh yeah, you going to go. And you're. Yeah.</v>

71
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.610
<v 1>It's like Burr's got the helicopter, but he he's got to go to get it.</v>

72
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.440
Yeah. That's his escape.

73
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.300
<v 0>Uh, you had a great bit about that. It's black and white. Special. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.170
I would move north. I'd probably move somewhere. That was a,

75
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.490
if I could just go to a place, if I knew, I just had to get to a place.

76
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.690
I would go to a place that is sustainable. Like a,

77
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.120
whether it's Alaska or Minnesota or Michigan somewhere,

78
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.870
there's a lot of animals and there's wildlife and you have, you have cold.

79
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.250
You have water. You have a lot like cold is better than heat because cold,

80
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:40.084
you can make a fire.

81
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.150
Like if you have shelter and you can make a fire in the cold, you can live.

82
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.120
<v 1>I have a counter-argument, which is I don't. I,</v>

83
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.010
the cold kills more people than he.

84
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.390
<v 0>Hypothermia. Yes. But that's just because you know,</v>

85
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.560
people are unprepared for it. You can prepare for cold with clothing.

86
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.800
You can't really prepare for heat with clothing, with heat,

87
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:04.300
you need air conditioning and you need water. Those are things that, yeah,

88
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.200
you need something.

89
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.100
If you live in like there's people that have lived in very cold climates,

90
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:11.560
as long as they have a good house and they have a good supply of wood,

91
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:15.580
they're fine. If you live in the desert, man, you kind of. You're kinda.

92
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.390
If the power goes out, you don't really have anything to keep you. Cool.

93
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.270
You have to stay in the shade and stay in doors, but it's not good enough.

94
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:24.640
And it's 110 degrees inside and it's 125.

95
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.420
<v 1>You're hydrated though. I don't think you will just die from IX,</v>

96
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.410
from heat exposure.

97
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.360
<v 0>And you won't, but you're not going to find a lot of water.</v>

98
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.890
One of the problems with global warming is going to be that things like lakes,

99
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.860
lakes, and streams are going to, there's going to be less.

100
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.280
There's gonna be less water. It's gonna be less dribbling down to the creeks.

101
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.700
Creeks are gonna dry up. Streams will dry up.

102
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.610
You're gonna have a hard time getting water. If you're in a desert environment.

103
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.470
<v 1>If you have by, by the same token, if you have enough water,</v>

104
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.680
you have as much water as you have would obviously the it's not a one-to-one

105
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:59.780
analogy. Cause you can go get more wood easily.

106
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.230
But if you had a shitload of water, right? If you just had like,

107
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.910
I hear your thought about getting cold,

108
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.170
but I don't know if I had shade. I guess you don't. I guess with cold,

109
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.000
you don't have to have electricity.

110
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.890
<v 0>You don't have to have electricity with cold.</v>

111
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:19.580
And also you have more of an opportunity to find animals.

112
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.450
You'll find more animals in cold climates and you're going to forge delicious

113
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:23.870
animals.

114
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.770
<v 1>For sure. Yeah.</v>

115
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.820
<v 0>More things to eat, but you might, you could still easily starved to death.</v>

116
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.080
Like the idea that it's easy to go out there and shoot a bunch of animals and

117
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:35.840
eat them all the time. Like not most places,

118
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.080
most places you don't have an abundant enough supply of wildlife.

119
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.170
<v 1>You're also a guy who does archery. Yeah.</v>

120
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.830
<v 0>I know.</v>

121
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.850
<v 1>You have skills.</v>

122
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.150
<v 0>For this. And I would still be panicked. I'd be like, this is not good.</v>

123
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:50.510
If I had to feed my family with a bow and arrow, first of all, I'd say, okay,

124
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:54.320
how many arrows do I have? I would have to make sure that I have enough arrows.

125
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.180
I mean, you'd have to practice to archery is not like a rifle.

126
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.830
If I have a hundred rounds, I can kill a hundred things.

127
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.220
I don't really need to practice that much of my rifles on off I can.

128
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.130
I have good trigger discipline. I'll pull through the shot.

129
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.710
I'll try not to flinch. And I'm not going to take.

130
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.500
<v 1>Any unwritten things. I have no idea what you're telling me.</v>

131
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.630
<v 0>Shooting. You don't want to anticipate.</v>

132
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.370
You want to anticipate you don't want to flinch when the trigger goes up.

133
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.230
So a lot of guys like Tim Kennedy, who's a friend of mine. Who's a,

134
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.610
one of the baddest in the world. He'll practice with dummy rounds.

135
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.300
So he has regular bullets and then four bullets. They're just not real bullets.

136
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.220
So it was like bang, bang, bang, click. And then the has to get rid of that,

137
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.930
that bullet. But he leaves,

138
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:45.020
he knows if he was flinching because if you're flinching,

139
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:48.680
you'll see this movement where there is no, no gun goes off.

140
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.640
The bullet doesn't go off.

141
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.060
But you make that weird moot because you're anticipating the shot.

142
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.650
<v 1>And that's the way to train yourself out of it.</v>

143
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.840
<v 0>Yeah. You have to do something like that.</v>

144
00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:59.180
You have to have what's called triggered discipline. Well, first of all,

145
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:01.160
trigger, discipline means don't put your finger on the trigger,

146
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.160
but also the way you squeeze, you got to just squeeze, squeeze, squeeze,

147
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:07.550
squeeze, and let the shot go out by surprise and not react to it.

148
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.820
It's the same thing with a bow and arrow. You have to have a surprise shot.

149
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.880
You want, you want it to just, do you want to concentrate on the target zone?

150
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.200
<v 1>Which feels like you kind of can't even be there.</v>

151
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.840
Meaning like you just have to be like, I'm doing a thing. You know?

152
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.490
Like you can't think about the release. You have to just think about the target.

153
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.580
<v 0>That's very astute of you. There's actually courses.</v>

154
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.630
There's a guy named Joel Turner who has this whole course called, uh,

155
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.320
shot IQ. He's a, he teaches 'em um,

156
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.820
first responders like SWAT teams and triggered discipline and about

157
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.810
how to, how to shoot properly under pressure. And uh,

158
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.660
he works with people with archery, for this, with the same thing. Cause it's,

159
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.820
it's a psychological thing to be able to. But my point is with a bow and arrow,

160
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:55.520
you're kind of. You, you need a lot of arrows.

161
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.470
You need to make sure that Bo's going to stay okay with animal to.

162
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.360
<v 1>Like, like a deer deer deer, a bear would be like the most edible thing. Yeah.</v>

163
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.890
<v 0>And you want a bear. If you have a bear,</v>

164
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:08.280
you can eat that for a long time and you can take that fat and you could render

165
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:11.520
the fat down, use it for cooking and use it for, you know,

166
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.640
you could do a lot of things with it. And that meat is a lot of meat.

167
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.390
Anything big, you want a big animal because you want to be able to dry it out,

168
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.224
make jerky.

169
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.710
You want to have something that's going to sustain you for a few days or weeks

170
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:23.970
until you find another animal.

171
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.270
You don't want to dig a hole in the ground to make some sort of cold storage.

172
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.340
You want to get below like the frost line. You.

173
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.350
<v 1>Got to protect it from.</v>

174
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.430
<v 0>Other bears. Yeah. You gotta,</v>

175
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:35.520
you're going to have to do a lot of things and you're probably not going to make

176
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:38.100
enough food. It sounds hard. It's the hardest.

177
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.360
Every time I go on a hunting trip, I always think like,

178
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:44.640
imagine if this is the only way I could get food,

179
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.830
it's so hard to get close to an animal. It's so hard. Yeah.

180
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.580
People see videos of it like on YouTube and there's the deer and you draw your

181
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:56.460
bow back and you hit it in the heart and the deer's down and everybody

182
00:09:56.461 --> 00:09:57.280
celebrates well,

183
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.190
you don't see as days and days of king all day long, just go.

184
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.600
If you could watch from a live stream of the moment of hunt,

185
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:10.110
start to the moment you're successful. And you just sat through the whole thing,

186
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.620
like as a games of Thrones marathon, then you would understand it.

187
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.280
But even then you wouldn't really cause you wouldn't be out there in the cold

188
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:22.500
exhausted hiking, uphill going thousands of feet up and down in elevation.

189
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.680
And then the wind shifts and the deer smells unit darts off. You're like,

190
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.560
it's hard, man. It's like tedious. And to survive off of that,

191
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:36.360
see I'm doing it for my own food. But if I don't get a deer, I'm going to live.

192
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:37.260
I'll go to a restaurant.

193
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.480
If your only option is deer that you catch and kill and find your

194
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:44.130
shot are sick. Oh my God.

195
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.770
<v 1>And he got to catch a deer.</v>

196
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.610
<v 0>Um, that's when you wonder, you know, you wonder, how am I going to,</v>

197
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.320
am I going to watch them starve to death?
