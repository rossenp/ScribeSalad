00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.800
<v 1>We should probably talk about your book. Let's do it. Yeah, let's do it. Um,</v>

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.200
the way it opens is very,

4
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:12.920
so we should tell people that you we're like really.

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.040
<v 0>Transitioning. Yes. Why not? No, I.</v>

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.200
<v 1>Love it. We, we should tell people you're from Pittsburgh. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.190
And you did your bat mitzvah. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; at the temple.

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.790
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; where the Pittsburgh shooter. Yeah. And so that was like,

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.150
just tell people. Sure.

10
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.910
<v 0>So I grew up in squirrel hill, um,</v>

11
00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:37.790
which is like pretty much down the street from Mr. Rogers.

12
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:42.060
Like it was quite literally Mr. Rogers neighborhood he's from there. And, uh,

13
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.820
it was an amazing place to grow up. I became a, but Mitzva 1997.

14
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.900
Uh, and it happened at tree of life.

15
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.380
I actually was a member of a different synagogue called Beth Shalom,

16
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:57.340
but there had been this fire. And so all of the kids who were becoming a bar,

17
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.180
but Mitzva that year did it at tree of life. Um, and you know,

18
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.490
and this same way that people think about nine 11 as a date, I think about also

19
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.640
October 27th, 2018,

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.650
because that morning I was in Arizona to give a speech to a group.

21
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.690
And I looked at my phone around 10 in the morning to like my family,

22
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.970
WhatsApp chat. And my youngest sister had just said,

23
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:19.370
there's a shooter at tree of life.

24
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.320
And my thought immediately went to my day ad because my dad is kind of what we

25
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:27.680
think of as like a promiscuous Jew. Like he goes to different synagogues. He,

26
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.200
you know, pays membership dues at various ones.

27
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:35.000
He likes the sermons at one and the, you know, the, the scotch at another.

28
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.000
And, uh, I thought that there was a good possibility that he was there. Um,

29
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.430
thank God he was not there. Um, but my mom and wrote back, you know,

30
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:46.430
we're gonna know people there and my dad knew most of the people,

31
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.310
11 people were killed. It was the most, um,

32
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.950
lethal antisemitic attack in all of American history. Um,

33
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.750
I knew several of the people that were killed. Um, and I ended up,

34
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.750
I was supposed to actually go to Israel the next day on a reporting trip to

35
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:04.060
report on this fascinating or archeological dig.

36
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.300
But I ended up putting that trip off,

37
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:09.100
doing that story later and just spending the week, um,

38
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.340
to see what happened, what happens to a community when,

39
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.140
when something like this goes down,

40
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:19.860
because like we read about mass shootings all the time, right.

41
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.010
So much so that they become kind of an abstraction. And I, you know,

42
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.170
I don't report on this stuff. So I had never born witness to what unfolds. Um,

43
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.570
and it was, it was a really transformative week and I write this in the book,

44
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.810
but I feel like in retrospect,

45
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.490
I had spent my life on a kind of holiday from history. Um,

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.080
both because I was, you know, I'm a Jew of postwar era,

47
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.160
which is to say the I'm part of the luckiest diaspora in all of Jewish

48
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.640
history. Like the Jews,

49
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.560
since the end of world war II in this country have had it better than we've ever

50
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.520
had it ever before. Um,

51
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.880
and all of the kind of mythology about what America could be,

52
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.520
the idea that it's a shining city on a hill, the idea that it's a new Jerusalem,

53
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.640
like I was raised on those ideas.

54
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.520
And even though antisemitic things happened to me,

55
00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:12.080
like speaking of Catholic school,

56
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.440
like I would wait for the school bus to my Jewish day school with my sister.

57
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.230
And there was this Catholic school bus that would drive by and they would

58
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:22.270
scream, you know, Chis and dirty Jews and wear your horns.

59
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.950
And I remember in high school people,

60
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.510
someone telling me to pick up pennies like things happened,

61
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.510
but it all kind of like didn't register.

62
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.270
It really rolled off my back because I saw those as like vestiges from an

63
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.910
earlier and uglier time.

64
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.580
Like something that those people should be embarrassed about thing that said

65
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.620
anything about me. And, you know, even after Pittsburgh though,

66
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.620
I was kind of like,

67
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.820
you could still delude yourself into thinking like this is a one off.

68
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.900
It shouldn't change, you know,

69
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.020
the fundamental Jewish American assessment of our experience here and our place

70
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.010
of belonging here. But then six months later to the,

71
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.210
to the day there's another white supremacist attack on a synagogue in paua

72
00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:09.050
California. Um, and then we've had, you know,

73
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.050
we've had this rash of violent anti-Semitic attacks happening in the New York

74
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.330
area, which I hope will talk about. Um, but you know,

75
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.040
it's weird because I grew up in very political family. Like my mom,

76
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.960
my dad's a cons political conservative. My mom's a liberal,

77
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.440
we're obsessed with politics. We were always talking about politics and,

78
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.640
and we're always talking about like, Jews, right?

79
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.600
Like we're really proudly Jewish family.

80
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.720
And so it wasn't that I thought antisemitism had died. Like I was,

81
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.200
you know,

82
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.110
I watched anti SEM as it was sort of resurging in countries

83
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:46.190
like France and England in Western Europe.

84
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.150
But I sort of looked at all of that with a,

85
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:53.030
with some level of distance and maybe even a little condescension,

86
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.070
like we are sort of inoculated from that disease in America, America,

87
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.740
singular America is sort of separate from the tragedy of so much of due history.

88
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.860
Um, and I have to say that, like, it sounds naive,

89
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.780
but I was sort of shocked to see it, um, that it's here too,

90
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.700
you know, and that we haven't escaped from it. Um, and I mean, that,

91
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:18.980
that awakening happened a little bit before Pittsburgh, which is it happened?

92
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.930
Um, I think it was April 20. You'll correct me.

93
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.850
When was the Charlottes film March? Remember the unite, the right March,

94
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.290
Jamie you'll find out, but I remember being shocked right?

95
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.130
When those people were marching and they were shouting blood and soil,

96
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.370
like Blaton Bowden,

97
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:38.770
which is a Nazi slogan and the Jew will not replace us exactly. Right.

98
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.920
And the Jew will not replace us. And when I heard the Jew,

99
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.720
yeah, sorry, August, 2017. When I heard Jew, like the Jews will not replace us.

100
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:52.680
Right. I heard it in like the plain meaning of that phrase.

101
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.680
Like the Jew is not gonna take my job.

102
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.760
The Jew is not gonna like take my job in the corner office or whatever. Um,

103
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.200
but in fact, it was like a reflection of this replacement theory ideology,

104
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.240
which is that brown people and black people and Muslims and immigrants are

105
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:14.160
coming to replace our white civilization. And the, the,

106
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.310
the Jews job is basically to pass as a white person. But in fact,

107
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.590
do the bidding of these people that we deem to be not pure. Where,

108
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:27.190
where does that come from? That is a deeply,

109
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.590
deeply ancient antisemitic conspiracy theory, right?

110
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.230
It's the idea of, let's go back to the new, the new Testament.

111
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:40.300
Let's go back to, to Jesus. Right. What happens in that story?

112
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.300
The story there is that the Jews go to

113
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.580
Pius pilot and say, you know, like this person's unacceptable to us.

114
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.820
And in the mythology of that story,

115
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.060
the Jews get what was then the most powerful empire in the world,

116
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.090
the empire to do their bidding. And you have this line in the book of Matthew.

117
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.450
That is so, so I mean, the,

118
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.210
the bloodiness of this line cannot be quantified where he says, you know,

119
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.770
his blood beyond us and on our children, which goes, you know,

120
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.650
down through the centuries to justify the killing of, of Jew of, you know,

121
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:19.040
untold numbers of Jews,

122
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.160
but the idea of the Jew as sort of like the wily manipulator as

123
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.920
the Jew, as having proximity to power, not being in power,

124
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.440
but being able to sort of be the puppet master, pulling the levers of power,

125
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.440
you see that play out in lots of different iterations through time. Right?

126
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.990
You see it. Um,

127
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.430
I'm trying to think about useful examples for your listeners, but,

128
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.790
but that is sort of the trope, right? And it is, uh,

129
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.310
an ancient one, but it's being utilized in really new ways. Um,

130
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.630
so it's not literally that the Jew is gonna replace us.

131
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.740
That is that the Jew who the Jew in a way is sort of like the greatest

132
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.580
trick the devil has ever played.

133
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.180
And this is the language of Eric Ward who wrote this amazing essay called skin

134
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:10.860
in the game. And he talks, he's an, he's a black anti-racist activist.

135
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.740
And he talks about figuring out how anti-Semitism is kind of the linchpin of

136
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:19.890
white supremacy, because the Jew appears to be what white,

137
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.970
but in fact, he's not white. I mean, this is all based on this lie.

138
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:26.770
That race is not a social con. That race is not a construct, right.

139
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.770
It's which it is. Um, but they're saying that the Jew is not white,

140
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.810
but he appears to be white. But in fact,

141
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.330
he's loyal to these people who are coming to SU America.

142
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.450
And so when you have someone like Congressman Steve king saying,

143
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.240
we replace our civilization with someone else's babies, like,

144
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:45.000
what does that mean? What is that idea?

145
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.720
It is so deeply anti-American because the idea of America, right,

146
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:53.000
is the idea that Americanness is not about bloodline.

147
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.240
Americanness is about a shared set of values and ideas and field to,

148
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.200
to those ideas. So the idea that someone else is, what does that mean?

149
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.001
<v 1>You know, well,</v>

150
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.320
it doesn't make any sense because this entire country is based on immigrants.

151
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.560
Of course. And, you know, as we talked about with the native Americans, I mean,

152
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.480
you wanna, we have replaced our country mean we we've,

153
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:15.110
we've taken over their country. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; theirs first.
