00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.960
<v 1>Experience. If I was a conspiracy nut,</v>

3
00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:08.760
or if I was a country that was conspiring to take over the world,

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.680
this is not a bad way to do it. I don't think that's happening right now.

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.720
I wanna be real clear,

6
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.520
but it's kind of the same result that we're experiencing right now,

7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.870
where everyone's being forced to down with, who knows what consequences,

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.230
but it's also the right thing to do. So we're all like, whoa, how do you,

9
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.860
you know,

10
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.790
it's another one of those things about being a person where the right thing to

11
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:37.630
do still feels crazy. Still feels like, all right, we're just gonna sit around.

12
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.260
Well, yeah, I guess that's what you have to do, you know?

13
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.300
And it's kind of in one way,

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.620
encouraging that so many people are willing to stay home and people aren't

15
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:50.340
rebelling. They're like, you. This is my country. I'm gonna go to work.

16
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.900
I'll take a chance. It's everybody's gonna get it anyway. you.

17
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:55.820
There's way less people doing that.

18
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.420
And when you consider that the government is controlling 320 million people,

19
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.930
you pretty crazy,

20
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.290
almost everyone's complying with staying home.

21
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:08.970
There's only a few essential businesses.

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.233
<v 0>Yeah. We're gonna have to,</v>

23
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.010
I think really have space suits to leave the house and work. God

24
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.410
&lt;laugh&gt; and they're gonna probably be like this,

25
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.930
this metal plastic thing that what could wash off really? Yeah. They're only.

26
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.280
<v 1>Pad and dudes are gonna put socks in their space suits. It's gonna be a mess.</v>

27
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.200
Are you worried, Jamie? Yeah. I'm,

28
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:32.200
I've never seen you this worried &lt;laugh&gt; because I've.

29
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.240
<v 2>Uh, everything. You're sort of saying, like, I,</v>

30
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.480
I look into the future and sort of see where we're headed and I don't see a,

31
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.840
I don't really see much out there cause I don't know where it is, but it,

32
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.750
it's not good because there's nothing there.

33
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:46.110
I don't see like going to the movies again.

34
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:49.270
Seems like that's probably close to out movies.

35
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.390
We're already dying anyway. Yeah. They might not survive this.

36
00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:55.310
They've already opened up the ability to like put those right into your house

37
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.350
for 20 bucks. Perfect. Way better. Sweet.

38
00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:00.110
So winter movie theaters gonna open again. All right. What's next? Yeah.

39
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.460
Concerts, sporting events. Yeah. I don't know.

40
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.620
That's just, those are all the fun things we used to do. So like.

41
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.620
<v 1>It's also once everything's in place where they can treat</v>

42
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:17.820
people effectively and they have the adequate number of ventilators,

43
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.060
then are we gonna go back to the way things were?

44
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.330
Or are we gonna have new standards in place? I don't know.

45
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.410
I don't know, man, that they look, they did an unprecedented thing.

46
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.570
They locked down the entire country to save people's lives.

47
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.170
Never happened before we're in new territory and you know,

48
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:39.850
it's dangerous when a moron like me is making sense.

49
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.170
And I'm when I'm one of the people who's talking about. Something like this,

50
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.280
give us a, your take on how we got here, because this is, uh,

51
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.680
it's been very strange, obviously, uh,

52
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.640
the president completely miscalculated what was gonna happen and the way he was

53
00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:56.720
explaining it to the news,

54
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.680
he was kind of saying that it was just a few cases and they'll be gone.

55
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.200
And now obviously New York city shut down.

56
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.280
The entire country is separated from each other.

57
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.400
Everybody is isolating at home. Give us your take on how we got here.

58
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.520
<v 3>Well, you know, the, the truth is, uh,</v>

59
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.240
we knew this was coming or something like it. We had a heads up and, and,

60
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.110
and even a, even a heads up before last year,

61
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.230
because this is now our third major coronavirus disaster of

62
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:26.670
the 21st century. We had, uh,

63
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:30.830
what's called SARS severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003,

64
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.310
that started in China and caused a terrible epidemic in Toronto.

65
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.350
It actually took the, uh, the rolling stones to do a concert,

66
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.620
to bring the economy back to Toronto in 2003.

67
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.420
And then it was mayor's coronavirus infection in, uh, 2012.

68
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.620
And this is the third one.

69
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.340
So we actually realized that coronaviruses were gonna become a new thing.

70
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:58.220
And we embarked on a big coronavirus vaccine program a decade ago. And,

71
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.530
um, and each time they've caused devastating hospital epidemics they've affected

72
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:04.570
healthcare workers. So, uh,

73
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:08.890
the point is this unfortunately has become a new normal for the globe is

74
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.250
terrible coronavirus, uh, epidemics. And, uh,

75
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.330
we saw this one coming up and at the end of 2019 in China. And,

76
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.280
uh, I knew we were in for 12 because that's what coronaviruses do.

77
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.120
<v 1>So you knew that we were gonna be in trouble because there was no way they could</v>

78
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:30.120
contain it and keep it in China. Well, the.

79
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.440
<v 3>The difference with this one, uh, compared to the other two,</v>

80
00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:38.000
was this the other two SARS and mayors. Now we call this new one, SARS two.

81
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.400
So there were SARS one then mayors, then SARS.

82
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.110
So both SARS one and mirrors made you so sick and had such

83
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.830
a high case fatality rate that anybody who got it was almost immediately

84
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.830
hospitalized. And basically out of the community, the,

85
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.510
the difference with this one, ironically, is it is it's pretty lethal.

86
00:04:59.511 --> 00:05:04.220
It's about five to 10 times more lethal than regular flu seasonal flu.

87
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.580
Uh, but also there's a big group of people who don't get very sick at all.

88
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.340
And so you have this sort of perfect mix where it's not the most

89
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.140
lethal infection we've ever seen.

90
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.700
It's not the most transmissible infection we've ever seen,

91
00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:24.250
but it's high enough in both categories that it combines in this very toxic way.

92
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.050
So what you have is you have a group of people who are getting very sick or in

93
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:31.090
the intensive care unit, like older people,

94
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.450
those with diabetes and hypertension,

95
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:36.850
even a group of younger people who are getting it very sick.

96
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.650
And then a larger group who are only getting mildly sick,

97
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.120
who could still walk around the community and be out in about in stores and

98
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.920
restaurants and infecting everybody. And so this is what's caused the problem.

99
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.633
Uh, it's a,

100
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.600
it's a highly transmissible and there's a lo big group of people walking around,

101
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:59.040
spreading it and a smaller subset, but a big subset.

102
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.120
We're getting very sick and even dying in intensive care units. So that's,

103
00:06:03.121 --> 00:06:05.400
what's playing out in New York city right now, for.

104
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.440
<v 1>Instance, what, whatever is stopping people from, uh, funding, medical research.</v>

105
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.680
I hope they open up the floodgate now. Yeah. Right. I hope they realize like,

106
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:13.180
Hey,

107
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.310
you need more of these guys and they need a lot more money and they be way ahead

108
00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:18.144
of this.

109
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.550
<v 4>Well, yeah, because this is one pandemic. There are a mult,</v>

110
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.630
multiple different scenarios of how this happens again. Sure.

111
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.911
<v 1>Well,</v>

112
00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:31.590
there was another guy that died recently on a bus that they identified as having

113
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.590
a completely different coronavirus in China,

114
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.700
but he got a virus that specifically hasn't jumped human to human.

115
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.700
It's only jumped from rats to humans.

116
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.300
And the way it jumps from rats to humans is by ingesting animal feces or animal

117
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.980
urine, or, you know, animal fluids. Right.

118
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.420
So this guy ate somehow or another, got some live bat fluid in his body,

119
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.460
um, and, and was dying on this bus. And they pulled the guy.

120
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.050
He tests positive for a totally different coronavirus. That's killing him.

121
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.090
What.

122
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.930
<v 4>Do you think would happen? Like imagine some guy gets Corona and he's got it.</v>

123
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.570
bad systems are shutting down. This is it he's gonna die.

124
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.730
And he wants to have sex again, but he doesn't wanna get anybody sick. Jesus.

125
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.680
Right. So he his dog. Oh my God.

126
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.880
And then like all the symptoms go away and he realizes like,

127
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.760
he's found the cure. And now he has this moral obligation. Like,

128
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.520
does he call the CDC and say, Hey,

129
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.000
I'm kind of embarrassed to tell you guys this, but I think I cracked it.

130
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.600
&lt;laugh&gt; and.

131
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.680
<v 1>What if it's only his dog,</v>

132
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.430
but if everybody has to come to his house and his dog,

133
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.990
we tried a bunch of different dogs.

134
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.710
There's there's no way to recreate this thing unless we Marty, Marty,

135
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.670
but I Marty. No, we're all gonna have to Marty.

136
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.950
&lt;laugh&gt; there's a train of people every day outside of Marty's.

137
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.870
<v 4>House. You're trying to, trying to breed Marty, the puppies.</v>

138
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.180
<v 1>You're trying to do calculations on how many pumps it takes to cure you.</v>

139
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.340
&lt;laugh&gt; you can't,

140
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.340
you can't let people pump too many times before Marty needs a break. Does.

141
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.940
<v 4>It help? If he blows you put peanut butter in my deck. See what happens?</v>

142
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.033
<v 1>No, no, no.</v>

143
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.140
<v 4>Everybody's like the pounds are empty. Everybody's everybody's adopting.</v>

144
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.490
<v 1>Do dogs. Oh my God. Look,</v>

145
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:24.130
biology is so weird, man. I wouldn't be that wouldn't even be that shocking.

146
00:08:24.131 --> 00:08:28.010
Right? That's the way a disease gets cured. You have to an animal. Yeah.

147
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.170
How's not any weirder than some of the that that's real. So.

148
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.210
<v 5>You have to realize that freedom is itself an export.</v>

149
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:36.570
And one of the great dangers is,

150
00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:41.360
is that China has been exporting the benefits of freedom them from the United

151
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.680
States into an authoritarian system so that they get the benefits of both

152
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.200
worlds. They get the benefits of our middle finger,

153
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:50.360
which I think is the secret of American innovation.

154
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.400
And they get the benefits of authoritarianism where they can do things that we

155
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:57.440
can't because they can order people to do the unconscionable mm-hmm

156
00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.320
&lt;affirmative&gt;. So my feeling is I'm on team,

157
00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:03.440
civil liberties and team civil liberties has to be

158
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.920
somewhat nationalistic, more militaristic, more command and control.

159
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.000
Like who would you take orders from? So in a lot of fields,

160
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.950
I'd orders from you. You're the big dog in this space, you know,

161
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.270
and to the extent that you wanted to coordinate something,

162
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.430
I would use my channel. I would subordinate to you.

163
00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:24.870
And I would want sometimes people to subordinate to me if I have,

164
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.830
if I was taking a lead on something important when we have this fear of

165
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:29.391
leadership,

166
00:09:29.391 --> 00:09:32.870
because we're all so individualistic that we never want to take an order,

167
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.100
like whenever I'm training into new assistant or something,

168
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.980
one of my always best practices is, uh, can I get you coffee?

169
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.540
You know, it's very important to show that the ability to ask

170
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.780
to serve somebody else, and the ability to lead are tied.

171
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.420
You have to be a follower to be a leader and a leader to be a follower.

172
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.170
You can't, you shouldn't be one or the other we need right now,

173
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:03.530
a more war. We need more of a war footing. We need a war president.

174
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.370
We need, we need war senators.

175
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:10.010
We need people of this mentality because the nap is coming to an end.

176
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.290
And I do think Nancy Pelosi needs to resign and build de Blasio needs to resign.

177
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.840
I think, think that this administration, uh, you know,

178
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.240
made some good moves and fumbled the ball.

179
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.520
And I believe that past administrations made some good moves and fumbled the

180
00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:26.360
ball and the, the,

181
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.960
the imperative is to stop back propagating what you want to have,

182
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.120
what you want us to do,

183
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.400
like defeat a prisoner's dilemma and come up with the lie

184
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.750
that would cause us to act selfishly rationally.

185
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:42.830
Like if you tell me that a mask is actually more dangerous in my hands,

186
00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:46.230
because it becomes germ filled, then the idea is like, oh, okay.

187
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.590
So I guess I won't use the mask. Well, yeah, because you lied to me.

188
00:10:50.591 --> 00:10:52.230
And the idea is that that's what you're trying to do.

189
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.070
You're F you're trying to say what would need to be true to get you to do what I

190
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:55.230
want
