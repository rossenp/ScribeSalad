1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>Well, talk a little bit about.</v>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.563
<v 1>Cyber.</v>

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.810
<v 2>Oh, cyborg is battle of the greatest woman fighter of all time.</v>

4
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:10.770
I think whoever wins that.

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.230
<v 0>But is, but is that the case? Right?</v>

6
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:16.500
Because Misha beats CyBorD or Misha beat,

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.180
Holly never fought CyBorD but the way she beat Holly was so spectacular.

8
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.270
How do you not always rank Meesha above Holly?

9
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.070
I know Misha retired and Holly is still super active and likely should have been

10
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:33.060
145 pound champion. Especially if you take away the deductions for the enemy,

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.650
she should've gotten some for too late shots. And then even on top of that,

12
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:41.640
you still see like Holly dropped her with a head kick and then dropped her with

13
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:42.990
a left hand as well. How.

14
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.930
<v 1>He was also beating Misha in that fight.</v>

15
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.390
<v 0>If she was, but there was two rounds where she got dominated.</v>

16
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:51.420
She got one round and mounted and couldn't do about it.

17
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:55.230
And then the last 15 seconds is a fight. Misha pulls out the ultimate,

18
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:57.330
takes her down and takes her back and then chokes her to sleep.

19
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.910
<v 2>Which just one the best for sure. But if we're going to play that game,</v>

20
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:02.730
then Holly Merck,

21
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:05.970
the girl who Meesha could never even hold a candle, Ronda Rousey.

22
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.481
<v 0>That's true.</v>

23
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:09.270
But don't you think that Misha kept getting better and that the Meesha who

24
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:10.080
fought?

25
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.460
I think the Meesha that fought against Holly Holm was very

26
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.640
much an improved version of the Meesha that fought against Rhonda.

27
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.070
<v 2>But that Meesha right. She, her whole thing is grappling. Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.120
So try implementing that game plan against Rhonda grappling. Enjoy that.

29
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.040
<v 0>Yeah, but if she's got that over there, stand up.</v>

30
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.870
That's one of the reasons why she was loud.

31
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.900
She got better than she did in the early round. Rhonda though. She.

32
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.720
<v 2>Did. So did Rhonda. Yeah. She might, you know that she might to take a.</v>

33
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.680
<v 0>Step back, but then, but here's my problem. You got to look at Amanda Nunez,</v>

34
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.970
Amanda Nunez beat the out of the, both of them. And the way she did it was like,

35
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.793
yeah.

36
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.070
<v 1>The way she throws, like those warm of bang, bang. I mean, come.</v>

37
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.650
<v 0>On. She's yak. She's Amanda Nunez is yikes.</v>

38
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.590
<v 2>And I wish you got more promotional push.</v>

39
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.683
<v 0>Hammers.</v>

40
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.950
<v 2>If Holly home were able to pull off this upset she's number one for me beating</v>

41
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.080
Rhonda and her prime beaten cyborg enterprise cyber is scary, man.

42
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.640
<v 1>I realize that cyborgs always be lined everybody's she just comes straight in</v>

43
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.110
and put so much pressure on you.

44
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.080
<v 2>Not the last fight, Tanya. She went, you know what?</v>

45
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.680
I'm not just going to murder this girl, watch them stick behind a jab.

46
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.780
I'm gonna figure something she doesn't know, put on a show.

47
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.020
<v 1>How he has a way better chance. Because if she does that with Holly,</v>

48
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:29.820
where she says I'm, cause I think she's got she's she's been training. You know,

49
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.010
I think it's almost like she's been training with somebody different.

50
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.020
So take your time, step back.

51
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.330
<v 2>But a sparkling coach that's actually that.</v>

52
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.900
<v 1>Actually favors Holly, I think then her old style,</v>

53
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:41.970
which is to come in close that.

54
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.270
<v 2>Favorite Tali that if she booked comes at Holly pool,</v>

55
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.790
like Rhonda did get kicked in the face.

56
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.033
<v 1>With cyborg.</v>

57
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.873
<v 0>Is, oh, she's up?</v>

58
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.540
<v 2>She's so.</v>

59
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.550
<v 1>Strong. You know, she's.</v>

60
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.210
<v 2>Calculate here's the other X-Factor. If cyber goes, uh,</v>

61
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.340
Holly kind of sucks on the ground. I'm a black belt on the ground.

62
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.120
I also can grapple like a. I'm not just going to stand in a strike with you.

63
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.870
I'm gonna take.

64
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.910
<v 0>Then she's a naturally larger woman. She's way bigger.</v>

65
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:10.660
So she gets against the [inaudible] issues and I'm trying on pick Tito Ortiz up.

66
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.250
Yeah. Is she a black belt now?

67
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.290
She's a black girl and she's competed as a brown belt. I know she did very well.

68
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:21.310
And did some high-level competition. She's a big woman.

69
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.470
<v 2>Her and Debbie Garcia go add at.</v>

70
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.260
<v 0>Grappling. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. As she decides, she decides to go.</v>

71
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.310
He should tape footage. Yes. And see how easy Meesha choked. Holly. Pardon? Me.

72
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.490
<v 2>And her back pocket. She goes, all right. I'm the feet.</v>

73
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.960
Let's get a little tricky. I'm going to.

74
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.010
<v 0>She has a hard time making 45, right? Yes she does. Yes.</v>

75
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.400
She would be better off. If there was a 155 pound woman's weight class,

76
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:48.880
you shouldn't have to cut so much weight. Yeah. I mean, she's leaned out.

77
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:51.820
She looks leaner now than she did when she was fighting in strike force.

78
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.360
You know, I think when she fought like Gina Carano, she was gigantic.

79
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.870
She's much smaller. Now. It's such a good fight though, but she's still,

80
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.320
she's still a destroyer. Yeah. You know, it's like,

81
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.900
I think for a lot of fighters.

82
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.700
<v 2>Oh man. I, I feel like she's filing got to it where she, she deserves this.</v>

83
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.230
<v 0>Well, she definitely deserves this big high profile fight, but sodas Holly,</v>

84
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.400
you know, they both do,

85
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.930
this is a really interesting fight because like clearly Holly's dangerous.

86
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.230
Right? She head kicks. Rhonda knocks her out. She had kicks, betcha,

87
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.590
Kohala knocked her out. She had kicked germane to random.

88
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.130
He was a multiple time world. Moya Thai champion head kicks,

89
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.880
her drops her. And a lot of people thought she should've got that decision.

90
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:35.770
At very least it was super close.

91
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:38.320
And Jermaine's is one of the best strikers in the world. She's a,

92
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.420
she's a nasty strike. So then if Holly and cyber just strike,

93
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.450
who gets the edge. Well it, see, here's the thing.

94
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:48.310
Like you can't sleep on Holly.

95
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.780
Like she's probably got a disadvantage when it comes to punching power and

96
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.440
probably a significant not probably. Yes she does. Yeah. I mean, we won't,

97
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.320
we really know cause Holly has dropped people and she does have sharp punches

98
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:02.410
and she's an 18 time world. Women's boxing champion. I mean, she's,

99
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.800
there's a lot of craziness to what Holly was able to do as a,

100
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:08.440
as a striker with her hands. Holly's more decorated.

101
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.220
<v 2>As far as straight.</v>

102
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.660
<v 0>Striking cyber hits, she hits so hard.</v>

103
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:15.910
And she's so aggressive. Did you, did you see.

104
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.320
<v 2>Cyborg, uh, going against the gold medalist and the number one? Uh,</v>

105
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.420
female box in the world. I think Clarissa shields.

106
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.780
<v 0>Yes. That is her name. Yeah. Did you see him? You sent me this footage.</v>

107
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.080
It's amazing. I mean,

108
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.270
Claressa shields is no joke. She's up to the.

109
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.363
<v 2>Best.</v>

110
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.540
<v 0>Bosses. So to bring that up, it's crazy. It's crazy. It's fun to watch too,</v>

111
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.670
because you realize, okay, well she can hang in the pocket.

112
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:43.030
She takes a tremendous shot. If you really want to be impressed by cyborg.

113
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.110
I say, you look at her one more time. I lost to Georgina bar.

114
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.920
I didn't see bars. Yeah. She's in Beltour kickboxing.

115
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:53.320
Now Zorina Bart is a monster.

116
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.560
She's this really tall woman from Holland.

117
00:05:56.561 --> 00:06:00.680
Who's got outstanding technique. And she was haunted. Nobody was with her.

118
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:04.850
She couldn't get a fight for years. So she's given her some coaching here.

119
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.560
<v 2>So cyborg decided to fight that more time monster. And it went to a decision.</v>

120
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.780
<v 0>Some good shots. Yeah.</v>

121
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.630
And not only did it go to a decision decide where I have new tattoos on her

122
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:15.740
legs. No that's.

123
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.920
<v 2>Tape. That's like a, uh, uh.</v>

124
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.740
<v 0>Performance tape on the top and that oh wow. How weird it's all crisscrossing.</v>

125
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.340
Yeah. It's a video. Huh? Um, awful video.

126
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.990
But cyborg got dropped. A bunch of times kept getting up, you know,

127
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:34.120
came after her and was there for the final bell. Still swinging,

128
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.180
trying to take her. And Thai.

129
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.160
<v 2>Girl had, had her hands full with a walk.</v>

130
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.640
<v 0>In the park.</v>

131
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.900
It was not a walk and she's a specialist and she's so good during the

132
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.970
watch her fight. She's so good.

133
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.020
So here's a Cyborg's barn with look how good this girl is.

134
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.240
<v 2>But look sideboard in that.</v>

135
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.740
<v 0>She's hanging in there. Yeah. She goes to the, to the house.</v>

136
00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:57.740
She goes to the body into doing work. She is, she's so good man.

137
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.850
But these girls are going at it. This is not like a light sparring session.

138
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.920
This is almost like a fight, you know?

139
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:07.490
And she's got to be careful because cyborg has big power.

140
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.580
So she's treating this, like, this is a dangerous fight for her. Look,

141
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.900
she's landing these shots,

142
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:14.480
but she's realizing like the stuff that's coming her way,

143
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.870
she can't take one of those on the point of the chin. She's getting tagged.

144
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.240
Look at this sidewalk tighter a couple of times,

145
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.040
but she's clearly like the more polished professional boxer sideboards doing

146
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:28.550
work though, is she is doing, you're not like beautiful left hook to the body.

147
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.920
Ooh. That step in left hook to the body. Oh, that's pretty. She's so good.

148
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.930
It's so important for a girl like her to get that kind of sparring into,

149
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.180
I mean, who the wants to spar with cyborg?

150
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.900
<v 2>That's how it came about. Cyber-stalking not knowing what spar with her.</v>

151
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.160
So this girl was like, I'll do it.

152
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.350
<v 0>Wow. Let her kick ya. I gotta say that.</v>

153
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.900
I gotta take a elbow tie fight with, uh, was it close? It was a,

154
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:57.980
it was a clear, unanimous decision, but it was dangerous at every turn. Yeah.

155
00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.180
And also that woman.

156
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.890
<v 2>You have more respect for cyber. You have to watch it. She wasn't gonna win,</v>

157
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:04.490
but she.

158
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.160
<v 0>I can do at work. She got head kicked with a stomp.</v>

159
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.200
She got like front push kick to the face,

160
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:13.100
like right on the chin or next snap back, she fall down. She gets up,

161
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.990
is still chasing after she's a warrior man. She's a warrior,

162
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.790
but so's Holly, Holly just comes off like cleaner. And like, you know,

163
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:26.930
she comes off like more polished and she's very pretty. And it's very,

164
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:31.010
she's very calm and very kind and nice. Still hear her talk.

165
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.870
<v 2>We're a female fighting's at that. You know,</v>

166
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.810
it's such a high level now with these two that whoever wins,

167
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:36.920
this is the best of all time.

168
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.910
<v 0>I think it's the forefront of the feminist movement. Boom, boom, boom.</v>

169
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.930
<v 2>No pressure.</v>

170
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.400
<v 0>Ladies. No worries. Um, it's, it's a very important fight for the sport.</v>

171
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:47.570
That's for sure. You know,

172
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:51.350
because no one really out there who in my mind is compelling,

173
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.100
is willing to step in and challenge cyborg other than Holly in a fight,

174
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.500
Andre Laski, Frank mayor, back in the day. There's no one there, Tim Sylvia

175
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.400
who would, who would do work.

176
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.780
And that's a good point because I don't think they're at the same level yet in

177
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:09.000
the female division, but there's some real good talent. There.

178
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.480
There's some good female talent in MMA period. Right?

179
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.880
[inaudible] that, that, that rematch is going to be sick. Yeah.

180
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:21.930
That's an interesting rematch. You got throw up. Um, I'm getting close really?

181
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.740
I didn't eat all day and I drink all this caffeine really swallowing spit and he

182
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.630
brought a garbage can. He really wants to be sick. I just go throw it.

183
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.950
[inaudible] dear stick. Yeah, no it doesn't help. Right?

184
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.200
Don't you want pork chops in the cigar? I'm feeling I'm feeling nauseous.

185
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:45.210
Have a couple of pour shops, smoke a cigar. You'll be fine.

186
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.800
How about sausage sub what extra mustard? Gas. I got the smell,

187
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:53.760
my breath. Hmm. Um, this fight is important, man.

188
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.730
It's important for the sport, right? It's important to figure out what,

189
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.660
what style you need to beat cyborg. Like Tonya Evenger injured,

190
00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:03.750
just fought a wild sort of brawling style and that like very limited success,

191
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:06.630
but it was like one of those things where cyborg just keeps advancing.

192
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:09.900
And in every exchange, every time it's just so much more firepower,

193
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.280
but Evan jurors, you know,

194
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.560
she was trying to win that fight as tough as they come. Yeah.

195
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.580
She was trying to win that fight.

196
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.240
This is a different fight because Holly is very dangerous and she has a weird.
