00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.580
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Let's just let everybody know what this is about.</v>

2
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:09.090
You were a game warden or you are a game warden, right.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.230
And what that normally entails is like, you know,

4
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:16.950
you find a guy and he's got three trout when he's only supposed to have two it's

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.860
normal stuff like catching, catching people,

6
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:21.420
doing something they're not supposed to it.

7
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:26.190
Just making sure people follow the rules right along the way

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.500
you guys started discovering these illegal grow ops where cartels

9
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:36.000
were growing marijuana and you turn from being a regular game

10
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:40.800
warden to essentially, well, why don't you let us know how it worked out?

11
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.970
<v 1>Yeah, Joe, it was,</v>

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.110
it was a crazy journey because you don't think of game wardens doing the type of

13
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:49.440
work we were doing when it come to the, the trespass groups in the cartel issue,

14
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:50.990
you know? And what do everybody thinks?

15
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:53.130
They think game Morin's check fishing licenses. Yeah.

16
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.580
Check your deer tag or elk tag. Look for too many, you know, animals, poaching,

17
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:01.140
spotlighting. And honestly, when I started the job, I got hired back in 1992,

18
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.450
that's what I dreamed of doing. You know,

19
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.230
I grew up hunting and fishing and I got my hunter safety certificate with,

20
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.220
with dad's help at nine years old. So I was all in the woods. You know,

21
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.780
the woods there, my church, I just loved it. It,

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.160
because three generations of family, my grandfather's career Navy, my dad,

23
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.880
you know, as an army guy and, you know, we just had conservation in our family,

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.450
you know, um, for generations. So I got the job, did it,

25
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.980
and I did all the traditional stuff to start.

26
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.400
I came down here to Southern California to start my career in Riverside county.

27
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.650
So it was just over the hill, you know, from,

28
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:35.610
from LA here and working all the traditional stuff, fishing regulations,

29
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.200
night hunting, you know,

30
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:40.290
working deer openers is really cool to be a deer hunter for all those years.

31
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.430
And then actually go, you know,

32
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.850
talk to guys on the other side and see all the good guys out there and some

33
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:49.290
problems. Um, and then in, uh, 1995,

34
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.300
I got to go back home toward the Silicon valley.

35
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.420
That's where I'm originally from born and raised. So live in the suburbs,

36
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.840
kind of the Foothill areas of the Silicon valley, south of San Jose there.

37
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.660
And in 2004, I I've stumbled into my first, uh,

38
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.860
you know, cartel, what we call a trespass marijuana growth site. And, you know,

39
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.770
to specify this stuff. Now, now that we're regulating, you know,

40
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:12.390
the last couple of years here in California,

41
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.080
these are not sanctioned marijuana sites. This isn't the legitimate industry.

42
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:20.880
That's doing it by the numbers and trying to, this is always illegal. Uh,

43
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:23.310
these are always here, you know, on public lands,

44
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.450
destroying our environmental waterways and our wildlife and on private land as

45
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:31.590
well. And on that situation, I had a good friend of mine that I grew up with,

46
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.800
um, that was doing his master's thesis at San Jose state university,

47
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:39.420
both of our Alma mater on steelhead, trout, endangered species, red legged,

48
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:41.940
yellow legged frog, and all the aquatics and these two creeks.

49
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.730
And this was right below Henry COE state park,

50
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.510
where I really met my first game or, and it was an inspiration to get the job.

51
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.550
So these waterways are really sensitive.

52
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.730
Headwaters coming down through this stretch for like three miles,

53
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.730
all these endangered species in it, Blacktail deer, you know,

54
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:59.740
all these other great animals. We like as conservationists.

55
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:04.330
They're thriving on this Creek. And he called me one day in April and said, Hey,

56
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:05.620
John, this is weird.

57
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:09.370
One of my two creeks is bone dry and all the fish,

58
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.900
the steelhead fryer dead, you know, everything living on this Creek is dead.

59
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.110
There's a bunch of like debris and plastic lining.

60
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:18.970
And it looks like camping stuff.

61
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.220
That's down at the bottom of where this Creek feeds out.

62
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.180
So I get them in the truck and I figured I'm thinking, okay,

63
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.550
someone's diverting water up there. It's probably a rancher,

64
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.250
Nina for cattle operation, whatever we go to the top of the hill job.

65
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.290
Then we start the hike down and I'm by myself. You know, I got my,

66
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.440
I got my rifle, got my gear. Don't have any radio coverage,

67
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.870
don't have any cell phone coverage. I have an unarmed civilian,

68
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.430
my partner biologists with me.

69
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.880
And we're expecting to find something very predictable that I'd seen up to that

70
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:49.060
point. And that would have been a normal water diversion.

71
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.780
And when we found the water source in a beautiful canyon, I mean,

72
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.890
crystal clear water trout Creek, the whole nine start hiking down it,

73
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:58.690
following this. Uh, we see the dam,

74
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.600
we see the water line go about a hundred yards down,

75
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:03.460
this beautiful little grand canyon lake Creek.

76
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.100
And there's much marijuana plants. And they're,

77
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:07.690
they're short because it's early in the season.

78
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.800
They're only about two feet tall and we see two growers and they're not the

79
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:14.770
growers I'm typically, you know, that I would have suspected these guys are,

80
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.170
you know, they got rifles, they got handguns,

81
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:20.770
they got knives and they're kind of cruising work in their plants coming toward

82
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:24.040
us. And that was that, oh, moment. You know,

83
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.460
if something crazy goes down right now and I got no backup,

84
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.100
I got a civilian with me. These guys are armed.

85
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:33.580
They're not your typical poacher that I've ever encountered. And, um,

86
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.810
we didn't get seen. We kind of hit out, you know, he's a hunter, I'm a hunter.

87
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:42.340
We stayed, you know, using our stocking and stand to the Creek bank and just,

88
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.850
just watch as these guys work their plantation and went on up the hill.

89
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.080
And I looked at this and went, what did we just walk into? This is crazy. Um,

90
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.920
we got out safely and that's when I started to bring in other agencies,

91
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:58.420
narcotic groups, task forces, the Sheriff's office, um, ma you know,

92
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:02.500
started to learn other agencies in my area. This is really on in the game.

93
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.010
What did you guys do about that one grow up? Like when you found it, like,

94
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:08.230
how did, how do they resolve that? Well,

95
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.960
we got a team together as fast as we could safely.

96
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:12.490
And usually it takes a couple of weeks.

97
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:14.680
And I want to say within a month we were back there.

98
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.860
Now the interesting part was game warns.

99
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:20.440
Aren't known for doing this type of work, just like you said at the start,

100
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:24.280
right? So they're like, well, you guys know the area you went in there,

101
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.950
help us find it, get us into the area,

102
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.500
but we're going to lead the raid and was said, of course,

103
00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:32.470
this is your jurisdiction. We don't normally do this type of stuff. So, uh,

104
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.760
so go for it. So we were the bird dogs, we kind of guided them into the area.

105
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.240
We, uh, had like 20, 30 officers. We, uh,

106
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.690
kind of let them down to the canyon, got them in there safely. Um,

107
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:46.720
we found the two growers. We spooked them. They didn't get caught that day.

108
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.290
They, they ran down the canyon. Nobody pursued. Some of us wanted to,

109
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.660
obviously because of the environmental damages.

110
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:56.980
But the biggest thing that changed the game for me that day was seeing the

111
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.290
environmental damage. So that was a 7,000 plant garden.

112
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.920
And at the time we didn't know about these banned toxic substances,

113
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:08.670
these insecticides carbo fear end that they're bringing up from Tiawana and

114
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.710
transporting actually smuggling from cross the border to put on these plants,

115
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.680
to keep everything living off of it, not to impact their cash crop.

116
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.170
And that was out there in some extent,

117
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:21.830
but it was so early when we were really aware of the level of toxicity to this

118
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:25.990
stuff and how damaging it is. Um, so it was all new, but we,

119
00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:30.140
we eradicated that, that garden. And then when we were done eradicating it,

120
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.270
we had all this mess in the Creek, right. We had camp trash,

121
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.840
we had fertilizers pollutants, propane tanks, um,

122
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.270
all over in this beautiful channel. That's now dry.

123
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.580
Cause it's been diverted unbeknownst to us,

124
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:46.730
all that water was totally poisoned that they were diverting to water the

125
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:50.330
plants. That's why that Creek was so dry. Um, and we, we, uh,

126
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:53.150
we eradicated everything and then it was like, okay, we're out of here.

127
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.550
And I looked around and went, wait a minute, man. I know we got the,

128
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.170
I know we got the illegal marijuana out,

129
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:02.420
but what are we going to do about all this environmental damage?

130
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.250
And nobody was recommending the damage or, or, or cleaning up any of this mess.

131
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.290
So I, the first thing I thought was we have a resource issue. That's crazy.

132
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:15.080
I mean, I've, you know, spent my whole career up to this point,

133
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.310
protecting wildlife, preserving waterways for all of us to enjoy, you know,

134
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.560
conservationist, enthusiastic, whatever side of the fence you're on. And, uh,

135
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.820
nothing was getting done on that.

136
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:29.750
So kind of the light bulb went off a little bit that we need to do more to this

137
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:32.150
if we're going to get involved and we need to get involved in these types of

138
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:36.530
grow operations, because it was the biggest environmental, uh, you know,

139
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:39.770
train wreck I'd ever seen. And I'd worked a lot of traditional game or,

140
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.300
and stuff to, to protect those resources. So once they.

141
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.550
<v 0>I had gotten another one out and get chopped all the plants up or did what they</v>

142
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:49.790
did, did they try to reclaim the Creek?

143
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.540
Did they try to remove the dam and get the water to run back again.

144
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.870
<v 1>At that time? No, no one was doing it right. And that's,</v>

145
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.770
that was exactly rather what, what really, really kind of upset me. And again,

146
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:02.900
we were new at the game. We were the game wardens.

147
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.100
Nobody really thought of us as mainline law enforcement or, you know,

148
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:09.590
narcotics task force guys or anything like that at the time.

149
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:13.010
So I wasn't going to make waves. We just wanted to integrate and work together.

150
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:14.480
We wanted to unify these teams.

151
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.920
And what I really wanted to do at this point is get back with my command staff

152
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.620
and, you know, my bosses and go, Hey, we got a big, big problem out there, man.

153
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.960
And there's more of this going on and we need to be involved even though it's

154
00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:30.140
not traditional because we're sworn to protect our resources.

155
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:34.340
And we'll besides everything game wardens do that you think of from the wildlife

156
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:38.150
standpoint where mainline law enforcement, just like every police officer,

157
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:39.620
right? We go through the same training.

158
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.710
And then what people don't realize is we go through two more months of

159
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:44.780
additional training in a really long academy.

160
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:49.160
That's all wildlife specific wildlife forensics, wildlife ID, weapons,

161
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:50.090
identification,

162
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.500
all the things you really need to do the game or inside of it with wildlife,

163
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:57.240
you know, in the back country, so to speak. Um,

164
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.300
but we needed to integrate with other agencies and kind of bring them into our

165
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:01.920
world if we were going to participate.

166
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:06.660
So that one case started the change in me to try to

167
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:11.160
build those relationships and get into tactics and tactical circles with some of

168
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:11.994
these, you know,

169
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.700
SWAT and special operations units that would go in and do this job.

170
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.200
<v 0>Under normal circumstances, if that was just being diverted by a rancher.</v>

171
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.650
So if a rancher had done that and the Creek was dry, how would you,

172
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.240
how would you fix that?

173
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.730
<v 1>We would have got with him. And it it's,</v>

174
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:30.570
what's called a stream at alteration violation and it's 1602 in our fish and

175
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:33.390
game code is the section. But, and it's a very common section.

176
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.720
Cause water is diverted for a lot of reasons and you can divert water with a

177
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:38.460
permit in certain circumstances,

178
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:42.000
but you can't completely denude a Creek that has wildlife thriving.

179
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:45.360
That's a waterway of the state for everybody to enjoy which this one was.

180
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.800
<v 0>And if normally the case would be that they would have to re just have the</v>

181
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.480
flow, come back to exactly how it was before the dam.

182
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:57.090
And yup. Yeah, that would be up to the rancher.

183
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.150
<v 1>That would be up to the ranch would be part of a penalty. You know,</v>

184
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:03.180
it could be a civil, it could be a criminal, it could be a probationary fix it.

185
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:04.740
And you're okay. So there was no.

186
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:05.663
<v 0>Real,</v>

187
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.980
there's no law involved or nothing in place rather to when you found

188
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:14.340
these grow ops, like there was no previous precedent, right?

189
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.300
<v 1>Exactly. It was, it was completely brand new. And this was, you know,</v>

190
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.590
one of the first grows,

191
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.890
I think that any of us had found throughout the state of California's game or,

192
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:25.170
and so me and the other guys finding some things and working,

193
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.190
but being from the Silicon valley and being inspired by those Wildlands to

194
00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:33.180
everything I became later and what I stand for, it was home, you know, and it,

195
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:33.721
it hit home.

196
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:38.250
But seeing that and getting to meet certain guys in the Sheriff's department in

197
00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:42.660
my first book goes into this whole learning experience of, you know, ad hoc,

198
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:45.510
jumping in with other agencies and doing it is this the hidden war.

199
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.120
This was the first book more than the woods war in the woods.

200
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.090
<v 0>So you wrote war in the woods and then hidden wars, the new one.</v>

201
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.440
<v 1>Yeah. Hidden wars, the brand new.</v>

202
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:54.570
And that just came out and they're basically 10 years apart.

203
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.900
And the cool part about that, Joe is when you look at the differences,

204
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:02.220
we do some major comparisons and what war in the woods covers is that chapter

205
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.930
ones, that first mission I'm telling you about right now,

206
00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:06.510
because that was like being like, here it is, you know,

207
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:07.650
we're not in Kansas anymore.

208
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.500
<v 0>Did the people at the higher ups yeah.</v>

209
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.330
That were in charge of trying to eradicate the grow up

210
00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:18.870
and take the cartel, the guys down. What, so there,

211
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.730
that was their job was just handling that it was just handling the,

212
00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:26.850
the marijuana aspect of it. Right. And the armed cartel guys.

213
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.110
So there was no one in place that was supposed to take care of the waterway.

214
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.090
There wasn't, that seems so crazy.

215
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.910
<v 1>It does. It was one of those things that it was,</v>

216
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.300
it was based on the fact that a conservation group,

217
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.180
like from an agency like fish and wildlife, like us,

218
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.180
we just weren't involved where we would be looking at those environmental

219
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:48.660
damages. Right. Right. But from a narcotics officer standpoint,

220
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.290
you may see the damages, but it may not register. There might not be a,

221
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:56.710
you know, a mandate, even objective to clean that stuff up and back at the time,

222
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.110
DEA was funding all of our states and all of our county teams based on the

223
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:03.940
number of marijuana plants we eradicated.

224
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.040
So there wasn't any recognition of the environmental damages

225
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.030
and any type of funding based on how much reclamation and cleanup you did now,

226
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.350
that would change. Fortunately.

227
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.190
And we were that we were a big part of making that change, fortunately, but,

228
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.220
and there wasn't a lot of, um, funding or, or, you know,

229
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:25.000
point kickback or value to catching bad guys to catching some of these guys that

230
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:25.900
were doing the damages.

231
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:29.680
So a lot of teams then were dropping it on helicopter lines,

232
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.390
cut and plants getting a big plant count, getting funded for it, taking,

233
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.640
taking the weed out. And that was it.

234
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.810
<v 0>That's so crazy. Like, yeah, I would imagine. I mean, obviously I'm not,</v>

235
00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:41.890
I don't work in law enforcement,

236
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:46.840
but I would imagine there would be one person who would like detailed plan.

237
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.540
Right. And I would think that, well, what happened? Well,

238
00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:51.760
we found out that this Creek was dry. Yeah. Okay. Well,

239
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:55.540
we've got to re resume the Creek. Yeah. Wouldn't that be like part of the plan?

240
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:56.350
It.

241
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.200
<v 1>Would, you would think it should be right.</v>

242
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.080
<v 0>But so this is all basically new territory, completely.</v>

243
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.890
<v 1>New. And so.</v>

244
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.380
<v 0>We're only talking about 15 years ago as well.</v>

245
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.390
<v 1>Was crazy. Yeah, it was,</v>

246
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.890
it was the start of a big shift in my career because I saw this as a big

247
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.900
problem. I also, um, up until in 2005, we were on, you know,

248
00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:20.920
one of our first, second, third, since third operations. Since this one,

249
00:13:20.921 --> 00:13:25.000
we just mentioned in 2004 and August 5th, 2005,

250
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:27.820
the game completely changed because that's when we were involved in our first

251
00:13:27.821 --> 00:13:30.430
gunfight. And that's when my partner warden,

252
00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:34.150
who I trained in the academy, we were partners in the squad.

253
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.300
I had promoted to be the Lieutenant for two and a half counties,

254
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:41.440
the Silicon valley, Santa Clara county Monterey part of, uh, um, San Benito,

255
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.990
20 days before this incident happened.

256
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.890
And I had young wardens that wanted to participate and do some of the stuff I

257
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:51.580
was doing with the other agencies on the marijuana, you know, operational front.

258
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.560
And this was, you know,

259
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:56.290
right above the tech capital of the world right there in Silicon valley and Los

260
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:58.840
Gatos, we were in really steep arid country. Now,

261
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.290
August right before the zone Deere opener, we were all gearing up for that.

262
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.430
And was three game wardens, three Sheriff's officers. Um,

263
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.490
good Sheriff's officers that we met on that first operation in 2004,

264
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:14.080
I just gave you the story on. And, um, they were in harvest time,

265
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:15.610
they were fortified.

266
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.320
They had heavy weapons like SKS as the AK 47 derivative sawed-off shotguns.

267
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.770
And they had the grow setup where they were basically defending it.

268
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.090
And when we came in, there was an ambush shot from one of the growers.

269
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.730
And that was the one shot. The bad guys got off.

270
00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:33.790
And unfortunately that's the shot that hit my partner, um,

271
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.160
through both legs in that bullet,

272
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:38.950
went through the right thigh and tumbled through his right leg,

273
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.210
then kept going through his left.

274
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:45.010
So he's down and we're trying to keep him from bleeding out of four

275
00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:47.620
holes for the better part of three hours waiting for an air rescue.

276
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.240
And we had an, you know,

277
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.910
nobody in the country from the standpoint of a law enforcement team had ever

278
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:56.690
been counter attacked by these growers. We, you know, we chased them around.

279
00:14:56.691 --> 00:15:00.080
They'd run away. Sometimes we'd find weapons. Oftentimes we wouldn't.

280
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.430
But so this was just a real, eye-opener like, what the did we just walk into?

281
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.850
And plus my partner was real close to not making it.

282
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:09.500
And fortunately he did survive,

283
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:12.230
or I don't know that we'd be sitting here telling this story and talking about

284
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:12.920
it.

285
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.360
But that day when I saw how well they were equipped the type of weaponry they

286
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:21.920
had, um, and the fact that I almost didn't come home that day, I went, okay,

287
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.390
this is super dangerous. We can't do this as standard patrol game,

288
00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:28.820
or we can't do this doing just the traditional stuff.

289
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:33.440
We should stay involved in it because aside from being so violent,

290
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:36.110
the environmental damages Joe are the worst I still ever seen.

291
00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:37.430
And they just kept getting worse and worse.

292
00:15:37.431 --> 00:15:40.940
The more operations I'd work in my home county. Right. Um,

293
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:43.520
so we learned a lot from that. There were a lot of tactical lessons.

294
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:47.150
There are a lot of teen lessons, a lot of things we could have done different.

295
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.330
And that kind of changed the game where we eventually got to what we're going to

296
00:15:50.331 --> 00:15:50.990
talk about a little bit.
