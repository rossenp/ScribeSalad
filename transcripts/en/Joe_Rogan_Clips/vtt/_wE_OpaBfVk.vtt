00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I mean,</v>

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:06.030
that's one of the things that the Romans always knew. So it make people,

3
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:09.180
a family families, you can control them if they have families. Oh,

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.750
that's powerful. Yeah. You can control you.

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.690
Can't control young dudes, right.

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.750
Deals with swords or single.

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.380
Like you want them to get shacked up and have kids, right. That they stopped.

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.611
Yeah.

9
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:26.700
And then you got to kill somebody kids every now and then keep them in line.

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.270
Jesus. They did brown. I mean, that's what they did.

11
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.140
They did that from time honored tradition.

12
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.990
You kill somebody kid to keep them in line for, they did it with,

13
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.660
they've done it in the mafia. They've done it with a lot of people. I mean,

14
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:42.510
it's, it's always been something that people do to put fear in people.

15
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.170
You get people to, when you have a lot more to lose, when you have a family,

16
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.900
they look at it that way. There's certain people that, I mean,

17
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.480
when you study how to get people,

18
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:55.470
to listen to you and to behave and how to strike fear in the populace,

19
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.190
that's one. That's why they don't want abortion laws. Hm.

20
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.500
Wow. That's deep. Right? There's if,

21
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.220
if there is someone that is really thinking,

22
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.230
we need,

23
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.430
we need to make sure that people have families.

24
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:16.050
So that there'll be more vulnerable.

25
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.040
If there is someone that is following that philosophy, which is not my thought.

26
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.950
Yeah, exactly. You said the Romans said it is, it's been around forever.

27
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.600
This is like a commonly human humans born. They think that like, oh,

28
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.260
we have to keep families to get them in line. Well,

29
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.180
it's when you talk about authoritarian, authoritarian figures,

30
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.110
like people that want to have an iron fist control the population,

31
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.370
the last thing you want is a bunch of young single guys riding around with no

32
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:44.100
attachments. Cause that's how coups get successfully completed.

33
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.600
Like watching young mercenaries decide to take over your building,

34
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.060
like expendable style and shoot everybody.

35
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.250
You don't want that because they have nothing to lose. Right?

36
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.150
You want a guy who loves his wife and he's got somebody else's kids and he,

37
00:01:57.151 --> 00:02:00.720
you know, he's got, yeah, he's got something to lose. And that's,

38
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.090
that's how you keep a society in order.

39
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.060
And that's why you shouldn't be getting rid of babies. No condoms, no babies,

40
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:07.260
no birth control, no babies.

41
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.700
If someone really was plotting out a culture that way,

42
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:14.100
like really masterminding it and really saying that,

43
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.820
not just knowing that if that is the case that people do change when you have

44
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:18.330
children,

45
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.690
but then doing this and promoting this on purpose specifically to control

46
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:26.370
people. If that was the case. Yeah. They would do that. They would do that too.

47
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.090
They would, they would,

48
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.120
they would work against abortion because they would want more people to have

49
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:33.720
more kids so that they can control them. That makes sense. Well, good.

50
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.460
That's crazy. So crazy to think that way. But it would only be like one factor.

51
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.170
I think the major factor is religion. Because if you are, um,

52
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.180
if you are pro-life and a candidate is

53
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:51.090
a pro choice in your mind,

54
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.950
a lot of times people decide that that person is against like God's

55
00:02:55.951 --> 00:03:00.040
law. That person wants to kill children. Right? It's on,

56
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.060
they almost feel like compelled devote, you know,

57
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.370
to vote against you. If you're pro choice.

58
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.610
<v 1>I know, but like, are they thinking about, well, you know,</v>

59
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:12.010
what did this mother doesn't raise this child? And now you have this, you know,

60
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:13.870
this mother who's resentful of this child that she had,

61
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:17.140
that you guys made her have, and this child who's, you know,

62
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.620
this Loveless child now. And they both, you know, she's got mental illness,

63
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:23.020
he's got mental illness because you know, he's looking for his mother's love.

64
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.360
She's like this kid wrote my dreams. You know,

65
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.240
this husband didn't stay that kind of thing. And you're just, you're,

66
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.450
you're making these communities, you know, depressed and sad, you know?

67
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:33.550
And then you guys, you said, no, you have to have that.

68
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.100
You're not raising this kid. You know, you're not putting the money in that.

69
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.900
You know, and this, this family's pocket.

70
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.880
<v 0>All these things you're saying are true. Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.990
It's one of those things where you could see two, two,

72
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:45.970
like distinct patterns,

73
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:50.470
but infinite different varieties of completely the world sucks because the baby

74
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:53.470
was born or the world is amazing. Right. The baby's born. Right.

75
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.420
<v 1>Tim Tebow says that, you know, he's, that's.</v>

76
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.590
<v 0>The thing, man. It's true.</v>

77
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.113
<v 1>It's true.</v>

78
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.240
<v 0>I mean, it's, you never know. You never know,</v>

79
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:05.080
but it's whose decision should it be and what is it? That's the real question?

80
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.100
Like, what is abortion, right? Like what is it? Is it killing a baby?

81
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.460
Or is it a medical procedure? Like which one is it? Ooh.

82
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.350
And it's a slippery slope. That's where the debate falls in pro chores.

83
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.670
Pro-choice or pro-life,

84
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.830
it's not that these pro-choice people are evil people. No,

85
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.710
they just don't want anybody dictating, I mean,

86
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.950
sound like an evil organization that's created by Satan. It's not,

87
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.040
it's not it's women that don't want you to tell them what to do with the

88
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:35.500
reproductive system. Right. That's what it is.

89
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.360
They want to be able to make the choice themselves.

90
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.760
But then there's other people that are pro-life and specifically the

91
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:46.840
more militant ones, which, you know, have assassinated abortion doctors. I mean,

92
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:47.081
there are,

93
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:50.650
there are people that firmly believe that even if it's just a couple of days

94
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:51.484
old,

95
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.830
it's a baby and that any sort of procedure to stop that in its place is murder.

96
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.070
You're murdering a baby and there's no if ands or buts about it.

97
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:03.670
And it's like the way they look at the loony left and that they,

98
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.430
they buy into this. And you know, that,

99
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:10.210
that that's a narrative that, you know,

100
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.150
that's how they, that's how they really believe.

101
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.290
And people demonize people on both sides of it as if they're so different.

102
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.230
And there's no way you could ever think any differently the way than the way

103
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:21.220
you're thinking it right now.

104
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.020
<v 1>I think you, you broke it down just like,</v>

105
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:26.320
is it a medical procedure or is it the other way? And I think that's a,

106
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.580
that's that's hard to get into. And you can't there's no, I mean,

107
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.290
that's that we'll be debating that till the end of time.

108
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.210
<v 0>Well, it's one of the most human subjects because it shows how</v>

109
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:40.690
complicated really is. And if you try to pretend, it's not,

110
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.950
then you get into late term abortions and I'm like, well, what's up there.

111
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.860
When does it get weird for you? Six months? Does it get weird? Then look,

112
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:53.240
it's weird. Like, I'm not saying you should be able,

113
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.300
shouldn't be able to have an abortion or should be.

114
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.950
I'm not saying either of those things,

115
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.180
I'm just saying to deny the weirdness at the very nicest term

116
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:04.370
that I could come up was weirdness. Right. It is weird.

117
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.630
<v 1>I had a, uh, I got a girl pregnant. I was a teenager. And, uh,</v>

118
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.940
she had an abortion. I'm sorry. She had a miscarriage. Nature's abortion.

119
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.740
And then, uh, she, uh, she would,

120
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:20.570
I was eight weeks or nine weeks and she was flushing out chunks of who she was

121
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.360
calling the baby. So, I mean, that's at like eight to nine weeks, everybody.

122
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.650
Jesus. So, wow. Yeah. And she shouldn't have had a baby.

123
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:29.720
She was on crystal meth. I mean, that, that shouldn't have happened.

124
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:34.010
So think whatever higher power did that for us. But um, yeah,

125
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:36.530
that's what I'm saying like that. I mean, that's when you say,

126
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.190
that's why it's so messy and it really is messy because you don't know what is

127
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:44.150
what right. You know, she's like, it, it, it traumatized her. Yeah. You know,

128
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.043
makes sense.

129
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.550
<v 0>I mean,</v>

130
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.170
it's a crazy process that the human body goes through that men will

131
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:55.730
never really understand because there's never going to been going to be an

132
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:59.930
opportunity where a body grows inside your body and then comes out of your body

133
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.120
the way a woman experiences. And that's.

134
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.840
<v 1>Mainly, and.</v>

135
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.670
<v 0>Dude, women experience something that is so alien to anything that the</v>

136
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.280
males experience, they grow a body inside of them. Yeah. It's very,

137
00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:15.770
it's so different. We're so deep. It's so different.

138
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:17.930
Like in terms of how they interface with the world, they,

139
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:21.590
they have to nurturing. They want to protect the Nast and keep everybody safe.

140
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:24.080
And they're going to have a baby inside. Boom.

141
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.230
And now they have to take care of this baby and care for it.

142
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:30.380
And then the baby will become more people and they'll start mating and they get

143
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:31.430
become adults. And then.

144
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.550
<v 1>Earthlings, Y.</v>

145
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.570
<v 0>Comes out of their body. And for us, man, we just,</v>

146
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.590
we just shoot loads so easy. We just like with the art,

147
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.960
what we do when we don't have a baby.

148
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.150
And what we do when we have a baby is the exact same thing. Like you,

149
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:50.150
you too,

150
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.170
when you have sex with a woman and she gets impregnated,

151
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.660
it's it feels like regular sex to us.

152
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.300
And we have sex all the time and you don't get pregnant.

153
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.310
And then all of a sudden you are so it's like weird.

154
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.000
Like we didn't even do anything. We just had sex. Like we normally have sex,

155
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.350
you had sex. And now there's an extra person like, whoa, like whites,

156
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.500
but there's a lot of times it was, you say you associate sex with pleasure,

157
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.300
right? Like it is obviously, but when you have a baby, you're like,

158
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.760
oh it does. That does that? Yes.

159
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.740
<v 1>It does. Yeah. Sex does that.</v>

160
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.840
<v 0>So for a man, there's no, there's no difference in what happens to his body.</v>

161
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.590
Right?

162
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.340
Like whether when he's having sex and a baby's conceived versus when he's having

163
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:34.880
sex and nothing, it's just fun. There's no difference to him.

164
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:39.320
He doesn't feel a difference. Whereas a woman, literally her body will grow.

165
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.670
<v 1>Uh, person, a person with a brain that she, Sarah she's sharing.</v>

166
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.700
<v 0>And this thing's kicking inside of her.</v>

167
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.650
Like that experience it'll you up for a man. It's just, I mean,

168
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.430
I would eat like I do not like if there was an, a way that you could,

169
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.890
uh, record what it's like to be someone,

170
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.440
and then they give you like a little chip and he would slip it in there.

171
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:05.610
And I could, I could see you, like you would allow people,

172
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.930
all of your feelings, the way your skin feels, the way your emotions are,

173
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:11.460
the way your psychology is set up,

174
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.600
you would allow people to literally be you for a couple of days.

175
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.280
And the chip would do that. Yeah.

176
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.630
This chip would just sit in your head and you be that person. I would,

177
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.650
I would like to feel what it's like to be pregnant. Really. Yeah.

178
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.810
You to feel that, that like, that rip,

179
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:31.450
that pay or just like not the birth party. that. No, I don't want the

180
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:33.850
[inaudible]. I don't want to get. I don't want to get. I don't want to match it

181
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:33.850
. That was the only way you could

182
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:33.850
 feel it. But I would, I would wonder what it would like to, first of all, be a maternal woman. 

183
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:33.850
I w I mean, I'm really curious as to what the hormones feel like, would

184
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:33.850
 it feel like.
