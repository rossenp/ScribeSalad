00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.200
<v 0>You know, just you're having your brussel sprouts with your,</v>

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.600
with your elk meat or whatever, you know, I, I don't think it's a problem. Um,

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.280
so you know, it, I do get a little, I see, I see,

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.200
like you mentioned Dr. Sean Baker, he's like he put out a video about, like,

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.400
he mentioned me, my names talking about how I only talk about in vitro data.

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.760
And I'm like, dude,

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.350
go watch my video or my interview with the expert at John's Hopkins.

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.150
We're talking about human studies, right?

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.710
The in vitro data is coming from what the opposite that it, that you know,

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.430
that the damaging effects it's in vitro, Don, we get.

11
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.670
<v 1>On a culture set. There's, there's two things going on. There's one,</v>

12
00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:36.670
there's a real cursory examination of data where they,

13
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.430
and then this confirmation bias and this,

14
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.910
the combination of the two of those things,

15
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.860
they find one thing that sort of kind of vaguely supports what they want it to

16
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:45.520
support.

17
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.580
And then they run with it and they talk about it as if they're experts very

18
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:49.400
dangerous. Yes.

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.900
And this is one of the reasons why I'm so happy that you are talking about this,

20
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.220
cuz you can give people a real comprehensive understanding of all the different

21
00:00:58.221 --> 00:00:58.960
things at play.

22
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.050
And one of the things that I get from you when I talk to you about nutrition is

23
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.713
it's,

24
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.890
mindboggling how many different factors are going on

25
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.850
simultaneously in the human body when it comes to nutrition, absorption,

26
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.050
when it, you know, in the various stages of the body and,

27
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.650
and how it can vary with, with different people. I mean,

28
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:23.400
there's so much going on. Yeah.

29
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:27.560
So when someone just sorts talking about vegetables or toxic like,

30
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:29.920
oh Jesus Christ. &lt;laugh&gt; have you.

31
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.640
<v 0>Read any of the study? Have you just go look at the scientific data? Like.</v>

32
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.040
<v 1>You know, but they want it to be toxic. This is what's crazy.</v>

33
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.120
It's this is an ideology that's akin to veganism. It's really, it's a, it's a,

34
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.350
just another of the same mindset.

35
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.630
It's almost like a religious mindset. &lt;laugh&gt; they?

36
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:51.150
They there's this hashtag you said it. Not me. I did say it. Look,

37
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.590
I'm a meat eater. Yeah. I know you are like, you can't,

38
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:57.110
you can't accuse me of being anti meat, but I,

39
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.630
I side I eat more vegetables

40
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.700
I think, than eat meat.

41
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.940
I certainly it's certainly like right up there and I'm not giving them up.

42
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.900
I think that's stupid. Yeah. I just,

43
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:13.420
it doesn't make any sense to me and I like them, but there's this,

44
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:16.700
there's this weird push. And the, you know,

45
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.820
if you look under hashtag meat heels, there's all these people, you know,

46
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:23.420
telling these stories about how they lost all this weight and they did all this,

47
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.890
this blah, blah, blah, and their health benefits. And,

48
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.170
but they only want it to be because of the consumption of meat only.

49
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.890
They think that it's because of the singular aspect of their diet and the fact

50
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.130
that they've eliminated everything else, but they're not,

51
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.610
they don't do any studying of elimination diets.

52
00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:47.120
They don't do any study of the along benefits of fasting and all these different

53
00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:50.000
things that you're talking about, which I think are they're,

54
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.960
these are all factors in this really complicated thing that's going on

55
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.120
that most likely has something to do with their gut biome and their immune

56
00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.570
system.

57
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.480
<v 0>Right? Absolutely. I mean,</v>

58
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.000
those are two major confounding factors, like so major,

59
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.400
you know, it's, um, it's important. It's just important to,

60
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.480
to approach this like a science, you know, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and,

61
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.280
and not like a religion, like you said, where you wanna believe something.

62
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.390
And so you just find, you know, this,

63
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:23.550
this study that I also see circulating around that why plants are really bad to

64
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:26.430
eat. It's like, they're, they're they're they're mean insect,

65
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.750
the insect antinutrients are pesticides. Right, right.

66
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:30.350
It's from my former mentor. Okay.

67
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.350
Dr. Bruce Sims who spent his entire career like advocating micronutrients

68
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.910
from vegetables and from me and from fish. Okay. It's like so ironic.

69
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.180
But if you actually read the paper, not only does it say it doesn't, you know,

70
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.940
these, these insect anti feedin, like sulfur Reine don't cause cancer, but it,

71
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.700
it also goes,

72
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.060
it has a whole section on heterocyclic aiming from cooked meat.

73
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.940
So if you really wanna use that paper as an argument, why to not eat plants,

74
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.140
then maybe read the paper and realize, oh,

75
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.090
it's all also talking about heterocyclic aimings as well.

76
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.370
The point of the paper was like, I'm getting a little motion here. I'm sorry.

77
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:06.970
It's I'm sorry. Good. I like it. Um.

78
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.490
<v 1>Getting outta your robot itself. Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.410
<v 0>The point of the paper was, um,</v>

80
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.290
basically not to worry about like some of the amounts that you're being exposed

81
00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:17.090
to with some of these natural, you know,

82
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.930
insect antied mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that are found in plants, um,

83
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.560
in some of the cook things and meat, and as well as some of the,

84
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.080
the pesticides that are found in synthetic passive sides,

85
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.200
basically that they're in such small amounts.

86
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.360
So that was kind of the point of the paper was back in the nineties. Um, and,

87
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.560
but I just think that it's a little, I don't know, hypocritical to use a paper,

88
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.640
you know, as a, as like, and literally it's like, I mean,

89
00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:42.630
it's like proliferated every that's I see this paper all the time. Yes.

90
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.070
It's like, well, did you read the paper? Cuz it has a whole section on, um,

91
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.070
on the insect anti feeds from coffee,

92
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:51.070
which a lot of people drink mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and also from meat.

93
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.190
<v 1>What, what there's that thing that people do where they do have a,</v>

94
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.870
I have a joke about it in my act about, um, I read a sta a study that,

95
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.900
that, um, sperm can cure depression in women.

96
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.700
And I slammed my laptop shut and I didn't read another word. I'm like,

97
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.460
I found the cure &lt;laugh&gt; but this is,

98
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.700
this is what you read the title. Yeah. Yeah.

99
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.220
This is essentially what these people are doing. They, they,

100
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.010
they will read or oftentimes not don't even read,

101
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.930
but recite from someone else's reciting it in a video

102
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.890
who didn't read. Right. Which is what's going on with a lot of this stuff.

103
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.090
And this is what I'm concerned with. I keep seeing all these people like, Hey,

104
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.250
I'm gonna try the carnivore die. Hey, try the carnivore died. I'm telling you,

105
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.090
it's amazing. And I'm just sitting here shaking my head.

106
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.280
I'm like this isn't making any sense. Like I don't,

107
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.360
why would you want to eliminate a,

108
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.240
a massive source of bio available nutrients? Like, and,

109
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.400
and then when they're talking about the negative consequences of consuming

110
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:59.280
vegetables, that there's, you know, different sort of, um, toxic elements.

111
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.200
I do remember you talking about how these stressors can actually have a positive

112
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.160
and beneficial result when your body reacts to these stressors.

113
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.280
<v 0>Yeah. That's exactly how exercise works. It's exactly how fasting works.</v>

114
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:14.240
Exactly how heat stress from the so works. And it's how these phytochemicals,

115
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.790
um, I'm calling 'em phytochemical was just as like a generic, you know,

116
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.310
category mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, but there there're,

117
00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:25.070
these they're compounds that are made by plants to ward off insects. Um, and,

118
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.010
and, uh,

119
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.230
and we evolved eating them and they activate amazing stress response pathways

120
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:34.230
in, in humans, in our brain, you know, in multiple in blood cells. I mean,

121
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.740
it's just human intervention trials showing this it, you know, you're,

122
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:41.220
you're gonna miss out. Like you're we evolved with,

123
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.780
we're supposed to be stressed by exercise, by fasting, doing the time,

124
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:46.740
restricted eating, like that's, we're supposed to do that.

125
00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:48.540
And we're supposed to eat some plants.

126
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.860
<v 1>I think they're trying to comp they're, they're trying to simplify something.</v>

127
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:55.820
That's incredibly complicated and they're doing it with this sort of religious

128
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.290
fervor. This is, it's very strange. And I,

129
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.370
I can feel it when I talk about it, where people get upset,

130
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.210
they're getting upset at me. Like I'm criticizing Jesus or something.

131
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.490
It's I know it's very weird. And again, I'm not a vegan.

132
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.010
<v 0>Right. I'm not a vegan either. I eat lots of meat. Yeah. You know,</v>

133
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.930
I think you and I have had conversations about the importance of meat. Yeah.

134
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.680
<v 1>So it's, well, it's, it's, it's a religious thing. It really is.</v>

135
00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:26.560
It's the same sort of mindset that allows people to get

136
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.600
just rapidly Republican or anything else,

137
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.880
like fill in the blanks, whatever it is, you know, look, there's a, there's a,

138
00:07:35.881 --> 00:07:37.560
it's just a thing that people do.

139
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.990
There's for the long there's two different camps in jujitsu.

140
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.270
Wanna hear something crazy? Yeah. There's GE and Nogi a GE is the,

141
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.070
it's a kimono, this white, or, you know, multi,

142
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.350
you could wear different colors now, but it they'll start out with white. And,

143
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.870
um, a lot of people learn their jujitsu grabbing onto the GE you know,

144
00:07:55.871 --> 00:07:58.910
like sort of a judo GE or, uh, you know,

145
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.660
karate gear and utilizing it as part of the grappling technique.

146
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.420
And then Nogi came along and what Nogi is, they use rash guards.

147
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:11.820
They don't grab the clothes and they concentrate on control of the body with

148
00:08:11.821 --> 00:08:14.420
underhooks and over hooks and Gable grips and things along those lines.

149
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.340
And it became a religious battle between gee and Nogi.

150
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.330
And I remember sitting of watching this and it was a problem because like people

151
00:08:22.331 --> 00:08:25.130
would get angry. Like, what camp are you in, bro? And I trained both.

152
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.650
I have a black belt in the GE. I have a black belt,

153
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.810
no GE I trained both of them. I think there's benefits to both of them.

154
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.810
But there was this weird thing where you were supposed to choose sides.

155
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.610
It's since alleviated and people realize how preposterous it is.

156
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.640
But for a time, like four years,

157
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.040
the jujitsu community was split where people were angry at people who were the

158
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:49.920
GE or angry at people who wore no GE like my friend, Eddie, Eddie, Bravo,

159
00:08:49.921 --> 00:08:54.560
who teaches no GE people were angry at him for teaching a system of

160
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.840
jujitsu that didn't involve a certain type of clothing. It's the same mindset.

161
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.960
People just want you to believe what they believe only.

162
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.280
And they get RA about it. They get crazy.

163
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.760
And I'm seeing this with this carnivore diet.

164
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.560
And I think there's a psychological aspect of it to it that you were talking

165
00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:15.790
about when, in terms of this placebo effect, then I think they,

166
00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:19.110
they feel like I've never felt better. I'm on this carnivore diet,

167
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.630
I'm doing chin-ups and I'm running around the block. Like, especially.

168
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.390
<v 0>When you read about everyone feeling better, it's.</v>

169
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.470
<v 1>It makes I want in, I want in, I want in, on this carnivore diet,</v>

170
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.350
and then there's also, well,

171
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.590
if you are doing this as a opposed to the standard American diet,

172
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.500
I think you have the same sort of response that you have when people are talking

173
00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:40.420
about the positive benefits of the vegan diet. I think if you have a PO,

174
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.780
if you have a vegan diet in comparison to eating chips and fries and soda, yeah.

175
00:09:44.781 --> 00:09:46.540
You're gonna feel amazing. And.

176
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.460
<v 0>People talk about it too. Just like they do the carni.</v>

177
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.540
<v 1>Vegans and they get, and they want you to do, I mean, there's,</v>

178
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.290
I'm seeing the same patterns that I see with vegans where these carnivore people

179
00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.290
are putting meat and their screen name, you know, um, meat eat, or Mike,

180
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.970
you know, carnivore Carl. They are crazy people.

181
00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:07.050
They're doing the same thing the vegans do with like, I'm the vegan warrior.

182
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.210
I'm carnivore Carl, you know, you, you plant eating, poison, eating.

183
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.090
You don't even understand what you're doing to your body.

184
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.480
<v 0>And then I'm getting there too, because I like plants. They're like, right.</v>

185
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.720
<v 1>Yeah. It's like, you get thrown in. Yeah. You can't, you have to pick a camp.</v>

186
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.040
I'm not picking a.

187
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.120
<v 0>Camp. I'm an omnivore.</v>
