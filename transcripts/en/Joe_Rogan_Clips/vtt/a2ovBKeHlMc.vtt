00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.691
<v 0>And people like,</v>

2
00:00:00.691 --> 00:00:03.540
that's what people are gonna think of you as whatever he posts it's like,

3
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:08.010
and then like realizing, because like I was broke last year.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.710
This time I was probably broke and now I have a good amount of money and it's,

5
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.920
I'm realizing money. Doesn't make you happy, materialistic things.

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.790
Don't make you happy. And I know everyone says that, um, who was it?

7
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:20.520
What's Jim Carey's quote. Like I wish everyone could be rich,

8
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.860
wants to realize that they don't want to rich and famous, rich and.

9
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.780
<v 1>Famous to realize it doesn't make you happy because.</v>

10
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.600
<v 0>I have a lot of people, like my little brother, I was telling him,</v>

11
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.600
trying to like, get him. I want to pay him to help run my YouTube channel.

12
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:33.180
I'm like, you can make $60,000 a year, blah, blah, blah. He was like, oh,

13
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:35.640
that's not a lot. That's not enough. I'm like, dude,

14
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:40.230
you could literally not have to work and be like, help me with my YouTube.

15
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.030
<v 1>Yeah. Do, but I'm trying to get millionaires.</v>

16
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.740
<v 0>And it's just like, that's not what makes you happy?</v>

17
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:46.740
And I'm re I'm finding that out. Like at a young age,

18
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.120
like I understand like my ego is motivated by money. I love money.

19
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:54.930
And I love just this whole fight game is just all about just,

20
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.320
I feel like I'm learning so much. It's hard to hard to explain my brain.

21
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:03.720
And I'm still trying to figure out all this, everything I'm learning.

22
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.990
I'm listening to so many podcasts every day, reading so many books every day.

23
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.230
And I can't really explain what my brain.

24
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.650
<v 1>I try to explain what you were your original thoughts. So like,</v>

25
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:17.880
you feel like what you're putting out on social media is the ego and what you

26
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:20.280
really are like who you really are is something.

27
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.880
<v 0>Well, yeah. I think just humans in general, we're all at the core.</v>

28
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:27.270
We're all just want love and compassion. Um, and so you.

29
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.300
<v 1>Want that from fighting fight?</v>

30
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.410
<v 0>Like what makes me truly happy is training to Jitsu or chaining in general,</v>

31
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.090
eating healthy and being around people. I love being around my dogs. Um,

32
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.320
watering my flowers. Like that's what makes me happy. That's what makes, um.

33
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.210
<v 1>What kind of satisfaction do you get from fighting to show your hard work?</v>

34
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.850
<v 0>I love performing ever since I was a little kid,</v>

35
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:53.520
I always trying to perform in front of whoever was around me.

36
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.220
If we had to get together a family that I was always being loud, obnoxious,

37
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.340
trying to perform and do something. I love performing like that.

38
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.630
Performing in front of huge Scouts. Like he was saying the bigger the crowd,

39
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:07.230
the more people watching them, the better I feel like I perform. Um,

40
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.200
yeah. Um, when you start learning about that stuff and take mushrooms,

41
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:16.230
it really opens your brain and other different pathways.

42
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.120
<v 1>And it changes how you look.</v>

43
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.223
<v 0>I think, yeah.</v>

44
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.640
Mushrooms are one of my favorite things I've ever done.

45
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.940
I've done mushrooms probably five times. And it's, it's weird. Right, right.

46
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:29.670
After right after a mushroom trip, you feel you're so much more,

47
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:31.110
you realize everyone's going through.

48
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.040
Like everyone is going through something and makes you want to be nicer to

49
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:39.210
people makes you want to be kinder. And then I get four or five months later,

50
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:41.100
you start getting deer and with ways, and you're like, oh,

51
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.350
I need to do mushrooms again. I need to reset.

52
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.880
<v 1>Have you done DMT?</v>

53
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.640
<v 0>I have not. I'm actually kind of scared to do DMT. Cause I know like that,</v>

54
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:51.930
that's what I talk about. My ego, like, like even mushrooms,

55
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.770
like they attack your ego almost kinda, you know what I mean? Yeah.

56
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.670
And we need that and I need that ego to keep don't know it's you need.

57
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.660
<v 1>Your ego right now. So what we.</v>

58
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.040
<v 0>Said, yeah. We got know like Connor's ego is huge Connor.</v>

59
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.180
You need to have a big ego. You need to have an ego just to do anything we are.

60
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.673
Um.

61
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.570
<v 1>But is it the ego or do you need to have the desire to achieve</v>

62
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:21.040
excellence? It is that always the ego. Can you do that without the self?

63
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.870
Can you do that just as a task,

64
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.430
as a goal and be completely committed and single-minded in your approach to try

65
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.460
to achieve excellence. Can you do that without the ego?

66
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:34.090
Can you do it as a project? Can you do it as a task?

67
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.811
<v 0>I think so.</v>

68
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:38.320
I think you can tend to think you build this character that I'm want to build

69
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:39.760
this person, this persona.

70
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.970
<v 1>But why do you want to build a persona? Because you see Connor do it.</v>

71
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.470
<v 0>No, no. It's, it's it's fun. Right? This is the whole fight game is like that.</v>

72
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:52.090
It's just fun. Right? Like I don't plus you know, if we build the persona,

73
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:55.120
the bigger checks are going to come bright. Yeah.

74
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.710
Like I'm not trying to not be me. Like everything I do is me. Like I just,

75
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.580
I don't know. I enjoy trying to find a happy medium,

76
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:04.870
like a happy medium.

77
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.200
I'm going to come on this podcast later in life and I'll explain more in my

78
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:10.630
brain. I'm just learning so much right now.

79
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.400
And I just feel like it's overwhelming.

80
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.360
<v 1>Dude. When I was your age, I was a idiot. You know,</v>

81
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:20.170
you're way ahead of the game. It's just a part of life is, is, you know,

82
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:23.350
five years from now, you're building like God back then. I didn't know.

83
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.860
And then five years later you'd be like, ah, back then. I didn't know.

84
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.620
<v 0>The more you learn, the more you realize you don't know.</v>

85
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.470
And then we get mad at our parents and stuff like, come on, please listen to me,

86
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:34.030
eat healthy, like read books.

87
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:36.190
I'm like her parents didn't grow up with the internet.

88
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.890
Like we're so lucky to be a learn from you guys.

89
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.180
<v 1>It's just impossible to change. People's ways they have to want change.</v>

90
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.050
They have to be motivated. They have to it's it's so hard to change people.

91
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.740
It's like,

92
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.100
if you've ever had a friend that's been into drugs and it's been all up and you

93
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:52.780
can't get them to quit or an alcoholic,

94
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.830
it is almost impossible to talk someone into changing.

95
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.010
They have to have some motivation. That's internal. Yeah.

96
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.220
And that's the same thing with eating. Good.

97
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.340
The best example you could set is by living your life in a healthy way. Yeah.

98
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.533
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

99
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.940
<v 1>That's one of the best things about the internet.</v>

100
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:13.570
You get to see all these people that are doing things in a healthy way and doing

101
00:05:13.571 --> 00:05:15.580
things that are exciting and inspirational,

102
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:19.870
and then it makes you want to do stuff that's good and makes you want to take

103
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:23.200
care of your body and makes you really want to concentrate on your mind and

104
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.570
meditate and just really get everything in order.

105
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.920
<v 0>Yeah. Meditation so awesome. It's really helping me every morning.</v>

106
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:33.190
I meditate for 10 minutes and I feel like it's helping me throughout the day.

107
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.010
Understand why certain thoughts are coming up,

108
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.930
whether it's from my childhood dramas or just anything, just certain,

109
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.980
um, patterns. My, um, cultural conditioning patterns, cultural conditioning,

110
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:49.090
just meditating has helped me almost kind of slow my brain down and redirect my

111
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:50.650
thoughts if I get angry or something,

112
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.350
or if something Cummins will understanding why I'm getting angry. And I think I,

113
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.680
and I'm, so I've been meditating.

114
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.660
I did it for the Terry on where if I did it for the Andre fight and I would do

115
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:03.080
it randomly or in camp, I wouldn't do it all. Then now I'm doing it.

116
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.300
I want it to be a part of my life every morning.

117
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.300
I've been doing it for the last mile long. You do it for 10 minutes, 10 minutes.

118
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.040
<v 1>Every morning. And then how do you do it?</v>

119
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.160
<v 0>Oh, I w I've been listening to Sam Harris, um,</v>

120
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.000
guided meditation on there's an app called Headspace that has a bunch of

121
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:21.020
packages that whether it's stress, anxiety, sleep,

122
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.120
um, positive thinking. Uh, I just, I just do the guided meditations.

123
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.670
I have this little meditation room. I go down there.

124
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.690
I first thing in the morning I get up, I put the lemon in the Seesaw. I hydrate,

125
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.160
I go into my meditation room, push play, sit there,

126
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:40.670
10 minutes meditate. Then I go outside water my fire in the morning routines.

127
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:44.060
My favorite thing I need to, I wish everyone would have a morning routine.

128
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.770
Cause it's really like it sets you up for a good day.

129
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.790
It does. I just don't have,

130
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.030
I don't remember the last time I had a bad day and just morning routine sets me

131
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:53.864
up for a good day.

132
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.640
<v 1>Yeah, I agree. I agree. In routine, John Donna,</v>

133
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.740
her wa wrote some really fascinating piece on his Instagram about

134
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:07.940
routine, about how important it is. If you're a great athlete,

135
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:10.160
you say you find me a great athlete.

136
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:13.220
I'll find you someone whose life is governed by routine.

137
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.190
And that this is the way to check progress.

138
00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:20.780
And this is the way to constantly be moving towards your goal. And uh,

139
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.480
I remember reading that and I said to myself,

140
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.380
this is something that I've always known, but never verbalized.

141
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:30.260
I've never said it, but it's something that I've always known. Like, yeah,

142
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.000
like everybody who's really good.

143
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:36.920
I remember I were at a sports illustrated article a long time ago

144
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.210
about who's that

145
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.740
track and field guy who won the Olympics. A bunch of times,

146
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:47.150
his name was something Moses, I forget his name. See,

147
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.340
you could find this guy's name. It was something,

148
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.690
but he was like an elite track and field guy. And uh,

149
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.460
I re what's that Edwin Edward Moses. He was a beast and just super,

150
00:07:58.461 --> 00:07:59.660
super disciplined.

151
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.490
And I remember he had like this routine where he had his notebook and he would

152
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:07.190
lay his notebook out and write down all of his different routes.

153
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.550
And he had this like map that he would lay down.

154
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.510
He would do his stretching routines and all this stuff.

155
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.570
And I remember thinking like, oh, this guy, this is his thing.

156
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:18.320
He does this all the time. He just gets there. He locks in and he does this.

157
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.960
And this was many, many years ago.

158
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:24.080
I might've even still been fighting when this was going on.

159
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:27.590
So I remember thinking about it going, okay, like this kind of,

160
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.220
this is like what elite performers do when they,

161
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.150
when they w when they're at the Olympics, you know, track and field,

162
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:38.810
it's so boring. You're doing the same. You're just running. Like,

163
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:41.960
you have to have a mind that's made out of steel to be able to do that same

164
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:45.560
stupid every day to try to get an extra 10th of a second here,

165
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.290
or an eighth of a second there, all that. Right.

166
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.910
But I remember thinking like it was it too. It was at the same time,

167
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:57.060
horrifying to me that someone would ever to do the same stupid over and over

168
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:59.400
again until they won a gold medal. But at the same time,

169
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:03.960
massively impressive that this guy had this kind of iron will.

170
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.063
There it is.

171
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.330
Every time Edward Moses placed his feet on the blocks from 1977 to 1987,

172
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:13.530
he won Moses, arguably the best hurdler ever won 122 races,

173
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.570
including 107 consecutive finals and set world records in the 400 meter

174
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:23.520
hurdles, four times within that 10 year span his journey to the

175
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.090
untouchable, to this untouchable level was marked by personal innovation,

176
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.953
determination,

177
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.880
proving that elite coaching and state-of-the-art facilities are not required for

178
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:36.100
Supreme athletic success. And there was a,

179
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.790
I believe it was sports illustrated that had an article about this guy.

180
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:43.020
And I remember just seeing how motivated I was seeing him

181
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.190
stretching and working out and going over his routine.

182
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.340
And I was thinking to myself like, oh,

183
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.440
think about it every time I worked out that, like, what would Moses do?

184
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:57.090
How would, yeah. How would Moses, like I got, I gotta start writing down.

185
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:59.490
I got to start really thinking about everything I do.

186
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.750
And I got to start putting it together on a daily basis. Like he does.

187
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.160
<v 2>That's what Robert falls.</v>

188
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:09.630
His favorite formula you'd always say is consistency over time equals result was

189
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:12.090
favorite form on, I got it tattooed on there. And it's funny. Cause like,

190
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:15.950
once you get good at one thing you realize like, I could get good at anything.

191
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.150
I know what it takes is consistency.

192
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.950
<v 1>Dude. That's Miyamoto Musashi he wrote that in the book of five rings.</v>

193
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.860
Once you understand the way broadly, you will see it in all things.

194
00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:30.300
Sweet and sweet. Yeah. And that's a dude who fought people with a sword.

195
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.140
Oh God, that's this guy. I think that's him.

196
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.200
That's who Savage. Yeah. Well,

197
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:40.650
I read that book when I was like 15 or 16 or something like that.

198
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:44.070
And he wrote it in the 16 hundreds. Matt Haley. Yeah.

199
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.190
Maybe it was the 14 hundreds. I think it was the 14 hundreds.

200
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:48.120
Now that I think about it.
