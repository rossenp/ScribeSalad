00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You don't have any problem at all with porn,</v>

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.240
you think porn is fine and porn is recreational.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.730
A lot of people would push back against that.

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.840
And a lot of people would push back and they would say that it's damaging to

5
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:20.640
young women, that it objectifies women in a harmful way. And,

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.160
and that it changes the way young people in particularly look at sex and

7
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:30.600
that they mirror and model themselves after these very

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.310
unrealistic scenarios that are depicted in these, in these films.

9
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.660
What do you think about that?

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.190
<v 1>Right. I didn't, I've never said that I have no issue with porn.</v>

11
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.560
I would just say I'm not anti-porn and that,

12
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.260
I think that pornography has a time and place.

13
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.410
I think if you're an adult and in terms of sex more broadly,

14
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.720
whatever's consensual, that's your business. But I do think, yeah,

15
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.170
for especially young children, I don't think that's good for their development.

16
00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:01.250
I don't think that that's a way that people should learn about what sex is going

17
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:06.200
to be like because that's pornography is not indicative of what real life sex

18
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.483
is.

19
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.990
And I think for people who are concerned that pornography is,

20
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.360
uh, that it say, uh, I mean,

21
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:16.910
there's so many different angles in terms of the criticisms of porn,

22
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:21.740
but say one common criticism is that pornography makes men interested in things

23
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:24.290
that are potentially degrading to women.

24
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.700
I do think there is some pornography that is not very nice in the way it depicts

25
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:29.600
women, for sure.

26
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.920
But I don't think viewing that as what makes men

27
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.460
misogynistic or disrespectful of their partners.

28
00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:39.740
I think that's something that is inherent in them. And again,

29
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:41.740
as someone who has worked with sex offenders, you know,

30
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.910
[inaudible] is more predictive of someone's behavior and their views of women.

31
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.140
It's not about being exposed to porn because I think most pro-social men.

32
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:54.320
If they see something that's very degrading and awful to women,

33
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.020
they're going to say that's horrible. And I don't want to look at that.

34
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.220
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.200
I think the issue is not really with porn as much as the issue is with

36
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:04.220
human beings.

37
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.720
I think that porn is in a lot of ways,

38
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.570
like many things like, like alcohol, for instance,

39
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.960
you can have a drink every now and then,

40
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.860
or you can drink all day long and ruin your life. What is the problem?

41
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:22.220
Is the problem, the alcohol, or is it your behavior? Is it the human being?

42
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.650
I think it's a human being and human beings,

43
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:28.370
obsessive compulsive behavior,

44
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:30.680
and people's addiction to things the,

45
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.700
the addiction to pornography seems to be an issue. And so some people's ideas,

46
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.590
well, you should ban pornography. Well,

47
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:39.200
that's sort of the same argument for banning alcohol,

48
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:42.740
but it doesn't really work. Like you can't really tell people what to do.

49
00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:44.480
If some people don't have a problem with it.

50
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.080
Like there's some people that enjoy porn every now and then they watch porn.

51
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.170
They'd rather than have a relationship or whatever.

52
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.800
Maybe they just don't want to deal with people, but they're horny.

53
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.570
I don't know what, what, for whatever reason,

54
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.150
but there's nothing wrong with that,

55
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.770
but there is something wrong for them with,

56
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.000
with the action of watching porn all day and

57
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.530
disassociating and being weird. But again, I don't think it's a porn problem.

58
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.920
I think it's a human problem. It's the same thing as gambling.

59
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.820
There's a lot of things that people get really obsessed with and they get

60
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.390
addicted to, I don't think the problem is the individual thing.

61
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.310
This has always been my take on porn or really on a lot of what we call

62
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.570
vices. I don't think the problem is the things themselves. And I,

63
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.730
I re not just respect,

64
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.140
I support individual choices.

65
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.680
I love the fact that we have freedom. You can do whatever you want.

66
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.830
I think you should be able to do anything you should,

67
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.870
as long as people aren't getting hurt by it.

68
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.420
I wonder why we have this perspective on

69
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:54.180
porn though, that we don't have on other things.

70
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.230
Cause like porn in many ways should be just people

71
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:02.380
having sex people and filming it. Right?

72
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.690
People obviously like sex.

73
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.020
So why is it such a big deal to film it?

74
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.200
Why is it such a big deal to show it to other people?

75
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.740
It's a very strange aspect of being a human being.

76
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.120
That is one thing that so many people are obsessed with and literally go out of

77
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:23.110
their way to be successful so they can get more sex. Like that is like,

78
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:26.920
if you ask men like how many, if men could not have sex,

79
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.800
how many men would be driving Ferrari's and, and,

80
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.460
and taking selfies in front of private jets. How about zero? Right?

81
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:35.830
If this is why they're doing it, they're,

82
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.470
they're signaling that they have wealth.

83
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.540
They're trying to make themselves attractive.

84
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:43.450
Why are they trying to do that for status? For what? Well,

85
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:45.130
maybe to show off to other men,

86
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:48.880
but more likely to show off to whoever they're attracted to whether it's the

87
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:51.700
opposite sex or the same sex they're trying to get sex.

88
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.770
So why is it that filming sex is so taboo?

89
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.480
<v 1>Well, okay. To go back to your point about porn addiction, number one,</v>

90
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:04.060
there's no evidence for pornography addiction in that.

91
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.180
<v 0>You see some of my friends.</v>

92
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.750
<v 2>You don't know what you're talking about. The evidence.</v>

93
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.950
<v 1>I don't doubt that for some people, that porn is a problem. For sure.</v>

94
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:15.930
And like you were saying, there's some people who watch for hours, you know,

95
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.430
and the research I was doing before,

96
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.640
there's some people I would talk to who literally sit and watch pornography

97
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.000
eight, 12 hours a day, and it's affecting work. They're up super late. You know,

98
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:26.430
they can't get up in the morning. It's affecting their relationships.

99
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.850
That is not, that's not healthy. That's definitely excessive.

100
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:33.120
I don't deny that that exists, but that's not, that's not addiction.

101
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.660
That's usually procrastination. It's procrastination. Oh.

102
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.350
<v 0>Wow. That's a weird point of view. I think they're addicted to it.</v>

103
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.200
They're obsessed with it. If you're obsessed with something,

104
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.910
don't you think that that's an addiction? I mean, are we splitting hairs here?

105
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.430
<v 1>I guess it depends on what if you're meaning addiction as in like a colloquial</v>

106
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.460
use of the word, maybe, but in terms of,

107
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.520
if you're about drug and alcohol addiction,

108
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.210
it's not because drug and alcohol addiction is characterized by tolerance and

109
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:06.590
withdrawal. So people who, people, some people will argue, like I said, with,

110
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:07.730
with pornography, that there,

111
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.850
if they watch it and they start watching more extreme versions of it,

112
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:13.160
they're saying that this is, you know, my tolerance,

113
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.460
but if you actually sit and have a conversation with those people, they'll say,

114
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:18.740
actually, this is what I've liked all along. It's just,

115
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.320
it took me a while to accept that. So it's not,

116
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:24.650
there's no tolerance and you don't see people having withdrawal when they stop.

117
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.693
Well, they might.

118
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.720
<v 0>Physical withdraw, but they do get obsessed with it.</v>

119
00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.760
And they do have a compulsion to look at it. I know,

120
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.090
I know people that if they take, you know, a day from porn, they,

121
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.970
they think about it all the time and they can't wait to get alone to watch it.

122
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.780
I think it is an addiction. And I think it is similar to a drug addiction.

123
00:06:40.781 --> 00:06:44.620
The same way gambling is similar to a drug addiction. There is an internal drug.

124
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.580
There's something that's going on in your mind that you are getting addicted to

125
00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:52.180
the excitement, the endorphins that you get from gambling.

126
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.140
I think there's many people that get those same excitement and that same

127
00:06:56.141 --> 00:07:00.220
excitement or a similar in endorphins from watching pornography and

128
00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:01.054
masturbating.

129
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.410
<v 1>Well, I mean, yeah, it is rewarding, but I think for a lot of people,</v>

130
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:08.710
it's a coping strategy. And if you give them different coping strategies,

131
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.390
suddenly they're not reliant on pornography to feel better, to deal with stress.

132
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.560
<v 0>It's not a strategy for getting over addiction. Like there are like,</v>

133
00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:19.990
you would admit there's an addiction to gambling.

134
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.750
<v 1>I think it is recognized now I believe. But don't.</v>

135
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.531
<v 0>You think that,</v>

136
00:07:25.531 --> 00:07:29.970
that that's a similar situation because there is no withdrawal and there is the,

137
00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:33.150
it's not like you reach a certain point where you,

138
00:07:33.151 --> 00:07:36.240
you need more to get you off because I mean,

139
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.250
or I guess it is really right. Cause they gamble bigger and bigger numbers,

140
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.150
but you don't,

141
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.900
what I'm saying is you don't really develop a tolerance to gambling, right.

142
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.610
But it is a gambling addiction.

143
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.610
<v 1>But the thing is with people with so-called pornography addiction,</v>

144
00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:55.510
if you in research has shown is if you give them other coping skills and ways to

145
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:56.770
deal with stress in their life,

146
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.520
or you teach them say they give them assertiveness training so that they are

147
00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:03.940
able to speak up about what's bothering them instead of turning to pornography

148
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:07.780
as a way to feel better, it actually cuts down on how much they, their,

149
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.550
their viewing time and how much they.

150
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.860
<v 0>Like. That's interesting.</v>

151
00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:13.140
And I want them to wonder if you get healthy user bias,

152
00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:17.790
because if you're getting someone that is willing to admit and accept the fact

153
00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:21.570
that they do have some sort of a sex or a pornography addiction,

154
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.750
that's not the average person. Like there's,

155
00:08:24.751 --> 00:08:28.260
I think there's a lot of people out there that are addicted to porn,

156
00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:30.720
but you never hear from them. Cause there's so much shame attached to it.

157
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.550
<v 1>Right. But I think someone who is spending eight to 12 hours a day,</v>

158
00:08:35.551 --> 00:08:39.330
that's a lot of time that's pretty far in terms of severity.

159
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.250
So yeah, I'd like,

160
00:08:41.251 --> 00:08:44.970
I don't think that for everyone who uses porn as a coping strategy is

161
00:08:44.971 --> 00:08:47.490
necessarily going to be that extreme. But I just,

162
00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:52.350
my issue is that this has been portrayed as something that is definitive

163
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.020
and that we should treat it like a, I think it was maybe two years ago,

164
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.170
everyone was talking about porn addiction and within the field,

165
00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.730
people who work with people,

166
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:04.140
with problems with pornography in a therapeutic context will say, you know,

167
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.400
it's not an addiction,

168
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.440
it's there other things usually going on in someone's life.

169
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:09.780
And those are the things that you need to talk about when you sit down with a

170
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:10.614
therapist.

171
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.910
<v 0>That's interesting. Um, yeah. I mean,</v>

172
00:09:13.911 --> 00:09:16.720
I guess I would agree that for a lot of people,

173
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.690
it probably is procrastination and there's probably a lot of other factors as

174
00:09:20.691 --> 00:09:23.330
well, but then again, people get horny. So like,

175
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.900
even if you like find all these other coping mechanisms where you get horny,

176
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.870
you're probably gonna watch porn again.

177
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.680
<v 3>So you'll slide right back into it. Well, I don't know.</v>

178
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:37.640
I mean.

179
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.740
<v 0>It's a weird thing as opposed to gambling, right?</v>

180
00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:42.020
Like you're not going to get horny for gambling, right.

181
00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:44.720
There's not like an equivalent thing where you like, you, you,

182
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.400
you build up this thing inside your body, it needs to take a risk. Right.

183
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.390
But whereas with pornography, like it's particularly with men,

184
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.650
you do sort of build up this need to release.

185
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.050
<v 1>Right. And then, then it becomes a question of,</v>

186
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.380
can they integrate this back into their life in a healthy way without it

187
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:06.820
becoming destructive again? Yeah. Yeah.

188
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.100
<v 0>Um, so why do you think it is that we have this,</v>

189
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.120
this weird take on sex because it is,

190
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:21.280
it's a weird thing that it seems to be, there's no problem with sex,

191
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.270
but filming sex and showing sex is where things get strange.

192
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.620
<v 1>Because sex is still considered stigmatized and it's taboo.</v>

193
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.520
And even when you're a sex scientist, there's so much stigma around that.

194
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.530
You know, you would think that as a scientist,

195
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.540
that there would be some sort of removal of that perception, but no.

196
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.580
So I think, you know, I, I write a lot about sex positivity also.

197
00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:50.330
I think if we were to decrease all the stigma around human sexuality,

198
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.160
that would help in so many ways.
