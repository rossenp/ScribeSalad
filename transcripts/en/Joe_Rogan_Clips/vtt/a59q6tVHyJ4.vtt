00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.680
Have you seen these bricks that people have been finding at all these different

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.640
sites where people are protesting? Uh-huh these organized stacks of bricks?

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.000
No. Yeah, man. Look, this is, I'm gonna send Jamie,

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm gonna send you one that Eddie sent me that's who do you think is.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.320
<v 1>Putting that? That's.</v>

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.990
<v 0>The question, right? It's like, who is, who is putting that? Is it Antifa?</v>

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.003
Is it the cops?

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.590
It's is it someone who wants someone to throw a brick so that they can impart

10
00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:32.510
martial law? Like what is it? Yeah, I.

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.510
<v 1>I, you know, my, my brain always goes to conspiratorial here.</v>

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.460
<v 0>It is mysterious. Brick piles appear throughout major protest cities. I mean,</v>

13
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:43.900
these are, wow. These are bricks that are appearing.

14
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.860
That don't have a reason to be there. Jamie,

15
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.100
I'm gonna send you this video that, uh, Eddie sent me because this is a, uh,

16
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.660
airdro to you, buddy. God, man.

17
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.660
<v 1>It's. The car too.</v>

18
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.820
<v 0>And the big car they said in, uh, long ditch yesterday,</v>

19
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.740
they left a car out there. Yeah.

20
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:02.690
They lift a car who leaves a free car off for people or just take to a free

21
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:05.650
police car. Yeah. So they left an old police car out there.

22
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.090
And then on top of that, this, uh, this old, why is this not,

23
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.370
would you look at this? Okay. Jamie I'm air dropping it to you right now.

24
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.090
So this old police car, and then these three,

25
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.570
you have all these protestors and then these three people move in a very

26
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.280
organized fashion. And there's a, a guy who made a video about it.

27
00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:27.200
Have you seen the video, Jamie, where the guy breaks down? Wow.

28
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.720
These the Antifa, have you seen that? I'll send you the video. This,

29
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.920
this is weird. What's that? I never saw this. Yeah. Okay.

30
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.840
Put it up on the screen too. I' I gotta figure out how to do it. I send photos.

31
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.200
Oh, I see. That's so crazy. So there's these, there it is.

32
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.670
So these random pallets of bricks, this is very organized.

33
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:49.190
This is on Ventura Boulevard out here in LA, or I think it's in north Hollywood.

34
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.510
So these pallets of bricks are just sitting there, like, look at this.

35
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.070
What? Yes.

36
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.150
<v 1>They're just like, like riot supplies.</v>

37
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.630
<v 0>Exactly. Riot supplies and what exactly.</v>

38
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.220
So who's doing this. This is very organized. I mean,

39
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:06.580
there's many stacks of these.

40
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.740
<v 1>Bricks. It's very anti-Anarchist well, is it? Cause it's organized, but I mean,</v>

41
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.500
why?

42
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.260
<v 0>I mean, well, it's fuel for anarchy, right? Yeah. But.</v>

43
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.340
<v 1>I just, I wonder look, look at this. Or do you think, do you think, I mean,</v>

44
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.380
here's another theory.

45
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.370
It could be possibly performance art &lt;laugh&gt; I mean, I mean,

46
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.250
and I'm, I'm not saying that like as a joke,

47
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.090
but like some performance artists like go to that length, but that's very,

48
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.810
very organized and very ominous and very weird. I mean,

49
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.370
I hope that those were reported and that the police like picked.

50
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.330
<v 0>Them up. Well, one thing that is happening that's promising is that these, uh,</v>

51
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.810
provocateurs yeah.

52
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.040
Are getting caught by actual of black lives matter protestors. Yes.

53
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.240
And grabbing them and these that are breaking windows and spray painting things

54
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.720
like they're grabbing these people and saying, Hey, you.

55
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.280
And they they're turning these people in. Like these people are smashing things.

56
00:02:56.281 --> 00:03:00.440
Thank the Lords. But they're recognizing that this is damaging to this look.

57
00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:04.680
There's a great moment in time right now where we can enact real change. Yeah.

58
00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:06.640
Where you can, this is like you get this.

59
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.880
And it's really the perfect storm in terms of, uh, it's horrific nature.

60
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.520
You see this guy who's,

61
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.120
nonchantly got his knee on this man's neck for eight minutes.

62
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.430
Eight seconds. Just, just there's. No, there's, there's no justification.

63
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.910
It's very clear. Yes. It's horrific. There's no blurriness.

64
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:32.510
There's no gray area. Yep. It's just dirty. It's awful. It's evil.

65
00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:36.670
And then the man dies and everybody is for the,

66
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.950
a fantastic reason mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; of,

67
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.940
and they want change and they're marching through the streets.

68
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.460
But then when you see these bricks and then we see the chaos and there's,

69
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:50.220
they've caught cops, cops that people knew were cops wearing police,

70
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.660
office police, uh, police dis distributed gas masks,

71
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.700
like official gas masks. Like the ones that the cops use. Yeah. Yeah.

72
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.770
Like the same wardrobe that cops wear. Everything's black, all military issue.

73
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.890
Yeah. And then these people would chase them. Are you a cop?

74
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:09.370
Like this guy's breaking windows at target. And,

75
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.410
and then someone and the comics was like, I know who that is. That guy is a cop.

76
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.330
And they were, they were calling out the guy's name.

77
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.850
So this cop is going around, oh my all these peace for protestor going.

78
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.160
And he's smashing windows with a gas mask on fully dressed in military issue,

79
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.280
garb. And people are like, well, that's an agent pro provocateur,

80
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.840
but is he acting on his own? Yes. Is he a rogue cop? He's like,

81
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.360
is he like one of those crazy firefighters that lights buildings on fire so that

82
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:39.560
they can save him? Right. Is he inciting this? What, what is going on here? Uh.

83
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.393
<v 1>It's a,</v>

84
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.950
I think some people just wish they want it to turn into something. Oh yeah.

85
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.350
Massive. And they want it to be like a civil war. And,

86
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.150
and there's also like the, the whole race war thing that, you know,

87
00:04:53.151 --> 00:04:56.430
you hear about in a white supremacist and stuff like that. Talk about, you know,

88
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.870
and there's, then there's like the right way.

89
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:03.340
The thing is like your mind can swim all kinds of like conspiratorial ways.

90
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.260
And it's probably, it's a mixture of all kinds of things, you know? Yeah.

91
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.940
It's definitely like, it's probably like, Hey, I'm gonna do this. Or like, Hey,

92
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:12.860
we should do that. Or someone kind of kids around and someone's listening,

93
00:05:12.861 --> 00:05:15.540
you know, in the police police department or whatever. And they're like, yeah,

94
00:05:15.541 --> 00:05:17.620
well, what if we were doing that? Whatever. And they hear that.

95
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.460
And they're like, I am gonna do that. Who knows? But that's some.

96
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.090
And I think that that's amazing that the, that,

97
00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:27.450
that protestors who are seeing this are detaining these people. Yeah.

98
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.730
Because those people,

99
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.250
they're just not helping in any way. And.

100
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.770
<v 0>I'm yeah. Here's a good one. See,</v>

101
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.530
this is smashing things and this guy comes over and grabs him and body

102
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.770
slams him. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

103
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.600
And then everybody holds a guy to down they're screaming and yelling at him.

104
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.000
Yeah. And they, they hold this guy. Yeah. They passed him over the police too.

105
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.640
Yeah. These, these are Antifa. Yeah. Okay.

106
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.280
He is trying really hard to cover his face.

107
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.520
<v 1>Yeah. It's like, no, no, no, no. Okay. you.</v>

108
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.480
<v 0>What is he hitting with a hammer? What was he hitting?</v>

109
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.600
He was making bricks off the sidewalk. Oh.

110
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.520
<v 1>Oh. And that's so, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. Um, it's my.</v>

111
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.760
<v 0>All gray hair. How old is that, dude? I don't know. It's very frail.</v>

112
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:06.320
Shittyjudicial I mean, I think, look how easy they.

113
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.120
<v 1>Took him down. There's definitely some anarchists that are like, you know,</v>

114
00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:13.640
they're basically, they're like, we're doing this. This is our time.

115
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.750
And you know, that there's like a whole wave of those people because I mean,

116
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.630
I remember going to, uh, brandonenburg Germany, uh,

117
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.390
a friend of mine out there has like a bunch of, uh,

118
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.950
kind of antiiffa slash a anarchiss, but like kind of mellow version,

119
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.510
German mellow version of that &lt;laugh&gt; um,

120
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.270
bought a bunch of land that was actually, uh, kinda like a weird shaky history,

121
00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:40.340
but it was like go, uh, training camp for the Nazi youth at one point.

122
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.220
And then it was, uh, before that it was like a Polish, I don't know,

123
00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:48.540
like air force, uh, place or something like that. Uh, anyways,

124
00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:51.780
it has like this military weird shaky history,

125
00:06:51.781 --> 00:06:53.820
but they bought it and they've converted it.

126
00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:57.260
And now it's like very accepting of all people, like all kinds of people live.

127
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.730
And, uh, then they are people who work on the, uh,

128
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:04.410
what's it called the fusion festival,

129
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.370
which is one of the biggest festivals in the world in Germany.

130
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.410
That's in Brandenburg and it's an amazing festival. It's all just love-based,

131
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.090
uh, techno you know, but it's got that hard edge of like anti- corporate. Um,

132
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:21.040
it's all DIY, but it's massive. It's like 70,000 people. Um,

133
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.160
the festival it's like burning man in the woods. Hmm. Um,

134
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.240
and very interesting conversations that you hear from them. But do,

135
00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:33.160
do you speak German? I don't, I don't, I mean a tiny bit ambition, but not, not,

136
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.440
not a lot. I actually was trying to learn German. I love the German language.

137
00:07:36.441 --> 00:07:37.280
Do they speak English?

138
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.670
<v 0>Yeah. They speak English when you're having these conversations.</v>

139
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.270
<v 1>Yes. Yeah. We're speaking in English. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember once,</v>

140
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.990
cause I was renting an, uh, an Audi R eight V 10 plus. Ooh.

141
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.910
And I drove it onto the grounds when they were tearing down and this young

142
00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:54.990
woman came up with this spray paint can and was like shaking the can and going,

143
00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:57.150
like, what are you doing here with this kind of a vehicle?

144
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.220
And it was this weird tense standoff,

145
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:02.460
but I was with one of the people who's like one of the heavy.

146
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.420
<v 0>Like she was gonna spray paint your car. Oh yeah.</v>

147
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.460
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and what a bold lady. I know. And in a way, like,</v>

148
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.620
I was like, you know what, if she would've done it, that's fine.

149
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.860
I was in her territory, you know? Um, that. You know? I mean, I mean, I'm,

150
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.701
I'm okay with like,

151
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:20.010
when it comes to like people who are that passionate about like anti for it and

152
00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:24.090
stuff like that. I'm like, I get it. Yeah. But that's your property? I, no,

153
00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:25.810
I mean, I'm renting, anticorporat I'm renting it. Yeah.

154
00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:28.410
But she doesn't know that she doesn't know that, but that, but I did.

155
00:08:28.411 --> 00:08:31.730
And I had a feeling she wasn't, but there, but inside my head, I was like,

156
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:34.610
what if she did? And I'd be like, well, I guess I'd just have to drive this,

157
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.170
this Audi with like this fascist anti fascist, whatever symbol on the,

158
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:43.800
on the side of the car, which I don't, you know, it's like, it's a funny thing.

159
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.320
<v 0>Like no good ever comes out of that. That's the problem. No,</v>

160
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.120
no good ever comes outta defacing property. There's no, no,

161
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.480
no compromise gets reached. No conversation gets.

162
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.080
<v 1>Breached. No, no. And not, not when you're destroying,</v>

163
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.760
not when you're destroying history and you're destroying, um,

164
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.200
it's just destruction again, as an initial response,

165
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.840
understandable. If something happens and people go out and they're young,

166
00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:10.800
especially in this, in this climate, uh, you know, being cooped up, no jobs, uh,

167
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.960
what do you wanna do? Let let's rally behind this. This is ridiculous.

168
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.430
Whatever boom, initial, like, ah, who knows what's gonna happen in that chaos?

169
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.270
When everybody goes outside, I get that. The continuation of it. The,

170
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.990
as the standard behavior, that's, that's a problem that any leader,

171
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.390
any civil leader is going to, uh, condemn and,

172
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.270
and frowned upon because at the, at the end of the day,

173
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.540
I'm a pragmatist and it's just in efficient. It's just very inefficient.

174
00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:37.980
And that's.

175
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.860
<v 0>A funny way to look at it, inefficient.</v>

176
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.740
<v 1>It's like, how, how are you gonna use that energy?</v>

177
00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:45.820
Like harness the energy for real. If you want real change, you gotta, like,

178
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.180
you gotta figure, you have to strategize. And for me, I'm about hacking.

179
00:09:49.181 --> 00:09:50.620
Like we gotta hack this system.

180
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.220
<v 0>Yeah. But you're this guy who's like really into engineering.</v>

181
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.330
You're very thoughtful. That's not what you're dealing with with these,

182
00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:57.164
burn it to the ground.

183
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.410
These people don't have a plan B and they don't have a forward strategy.

184
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.170
They just wanna, we had to tear down capitalism, man. Yeah. Yeah.

185
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.850
And then what, how are you gonna get your food? You.

186
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.450
Where are you gonna get your shoes? Who's making your shoes.

187
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.010
Where did you get your car? Are you idiot?

188
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.720
I know where where'd your phone come from. I'll give you a hint and not America.

189
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.240
Yes. I know. Things have to get made dumb, dumb. It's it's you'd have to.

190
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.360
<v 1>Engineer 'em it is really like it is. And I, I,</v>

191
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.040
I agree with that a hundred percent.

192
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.880
<v 0>They're using capitalism to fight capitalism. Yes.</v>

193
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.560
They're using the internet and social media sites on cell phones that they

194
00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:34.680
bought. Yes.

195
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.670
<v 1>Yes. Of, I mean, without a doubt, I mean, here's the thing it's this is,</v>

196
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:42.230
what's so weird about it. It's that it it's such a paradox. Right? I mean,

197
00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:44.870
essentially is what you're describing. Yeah. So like,

198
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.510
if you want to affect change, you're either going to fit into the feedback loop.

199
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:50.390
You're gonna feed back into the feedback loop,

200
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.350
or you're gonna figure out a way to shift it so that you're able to spiral a

201
00:10:53.351 --> 00:10:55.590
away from it. And that's really what we need.

202
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:01.340
And I like people taking responsibility for getting rid of the fuckwits that

203
00:11:01.341 --> 00:11:04.540
are &lt;laugh&gt; that are like it up for everybody. Because guaranteed,

204
00:11:04.541 --> 00:11:07.780
whether it's the police or whether it's protestors, it's always a very,

205
00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:12.780
very small percentage of those people are going to it up because

206
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.860
also the news love sensationalism. So we're gonna focus.

207
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.180
<v 0>On that. It's also, I think, well, this,</v>

208
00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:20.290
what we're we're dealing with right now is really the perfect storm. Okay.

209
00:11:20.291 --> 00:11:22.250
You have a bunch of pieces in place. First of all,

210
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.730
there's a lot of people that never really recovered from the 2008 crisis, right?

211
00:11:25.731 --> 00:11:29.610
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, as people are very upset that the bankers and the, the,

212
00:11:29.611 --> 00:11:33.970
these subprime mortgage loans and the housing crisis and everything went

213
00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:36.770
chaotic, people lost, tons of money.

214
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.360
And then all of a sudden you have this pandemic and the pandemic comes along and

215
00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:46.680
people cannot work. So for the first time ever through no fault of your own,

216
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:49.880
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you literally can't work for months and months at a time.

217
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.480
There's a staggering number of people right now that are in desperate states.

218
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.760
Yeah. They they're in a terrible position financially.

219
00:11:56.761 --> 00:11:58.880
They're about to lose their home. They're about to lose their car.

220
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.360
They're about, they don't know what the they're gonna do to feed themselves.

221
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.960
Yep. And then you get this murder. Yep.

222
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.520
And the murder just lights, all this dry wood. Yep.

223
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.110
And then everybody says, look, these people are all full of.

224
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:20.230
Donald Trump's full of, Nancy Pelosi's full of. They're all monsters.

225
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:23.990
It's all bull Gavin. Newsom's full of. Let's burn it down.

226
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.910
Let steal let's smash.

227
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.510
And that's taking a part that's that's that's happening.

228
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.500
While these peaceful protests are ha happening. All the wow.

229
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.740
People just got done watching the joker. So the joker, yes.

230
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.660
I know which is this billion dollar movie where this guy kills

231
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:45.980
everybody and burns it to the ground, shoots people on TV.

232
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.580
And here's the problem. You kind of cheer for him. You kind of cheer for him.

233
00:12:49.581 --> 00:12:52.500
Of course, if this is a movie and a bunch of people are like, look,

234
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.130
we're gonna end. This corrupt system of capitalism starts smashing windows,

235
00:12:57.131 --> 00:13:01.090
burning things. Part of you would be going, Hmm, let's see how this turns out.

236
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.730
Yeah. How is this gonna turn out? This is kind of an interesting choice.

237
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.530
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, wow, these guys are getting radical.

238
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.490
Do they have a plan? But then if the movie in the movie,

239
00:13:08.491 --> 00:13:10.250
like if you saw these pallets of bricks,

240
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.360
just mysteriously appearing at these areas where people are scheduled a protest

241
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.120
and where these, uh, these marches are supposed to go by, you're like, Hey,

242
00:13:18.121 --> 00:13:20.120
what is the is going on here?

243
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.280
<v 1>Yeah. It's, it's, there's something else at play.</v>

244
00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:27.200
That's like trying to like push it over into that fantasy to move it from the

245
00:13:27.201 --> 00:13:28.760
fantasy into the reality. And my.

246
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.400
<v 0>Left wing friends think it's right- wing people.</v>

247
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.950
Uh-huh &lt;affirmative&gt; that are Asian provocateurs that are trying to start this

248
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.670
sort of chaotic scene so that the military can be called in,

249
00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:42.190
which is what essentially Trump apparently did today. Oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah.

250
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.790
Apparently. Jamie, what, what, why is everybody saying that it's martial law?

251
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.470
Is that something that happened after his speech? Well,

252
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.311
he was during his speech.

253
00:13:50.311 --> 00:13:54.150
He was essentially saying that if they didn't call in the national guard yeah.

254
00:13:54.151 --> 00:13:56.180
He was gonna call him. He was military. Yeah. Which is.

255
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.420
<v 1>I don't think thats I' don't know if he can do that.</v>

256
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.900
I don't think he can do that. That's.

257
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.700
<v 0>That statement I think, is what they're taking as martial law. Yeah.</v>

258
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.340
Or essentially yeah. Mm-hmm.

259
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.460
<v 1>Which, which in a weird way, it goes against, I mean like you were, you,</v>

260
00:14:09.461 --> 00:14:12.180
you know, you're talking about left wing people saying like it's the right wing.

261
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:14.460
And I'm sure that there are right wing people that are like saying, oh,

262
00:14:14.461 --> 00:14:17.650
it' the left wing, because want anti to make it? Yeah. They think it's Antifa.

263
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.850
So it's like all this finger pointing whoever's doing it is definitely winning

264
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.930
for their point of view because they're like, well, we're doing it.

265
00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:27.410
No one knows who it is. And we're just doing it. Well, Asian.

266
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.850
<v 0>Profacateurs have been used from the beginning of time. I mean,</v>

267
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:33.170
they've always done that. Hitler burned the riceag.

268
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.010
He did that to incite the people of Germany to,

269
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.720
to get behind him and that he was going to take control of the situ Nero burned

270
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.960
Rome, same way. I mean,

271
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:45.920
it was all done in order to get people excited about this idea of this one

272
00:14:45.921 --> 00:14:50.600
person saving them from this attack. And that, that has been done forever.

273
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:55.480
Yeah. Alex Jones had a great video called nine 11, the road de teriorate.

274
00:14:55.481 --> 00:14:58.920
It was the first time I really understood that agent provocateurs or a

275
00:14:58.921 --> 00:15:02.880
government strategy. And he detailed like very, this is like,

276
00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:09.790
I guess it was like 2001 or 2002 that he put this video out and he detailed how

277
00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:14.540
the world trade organ is when those people were protesting against the WTO.

278
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.260
Yeah. And this was in Seattle? Yeah, I was there. Oh, okay. So when you were,

279
00:15:19.261 --> 00:15:21.540
this was, you were there in 2000. What? I.

280
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.980
<v 1>Was there just before it, uh, it blew up, uh, it was, uh, I actually don't know.</v>

281
00:15:25.981 --> 00:15:29.180
It was 2000. It was early two thousands, early, two thousands, maybe 2000,

282
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.140
2001 or something.

283
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.010
<v 0>So these people were protest testing against the WTO and then these guys dressed</v>

284
00:15:35.011 --> 00:15:37.090
exactly like that guy I was talking about earlier. Yeah.

285
00:15:37.091 --> 00:15:40.690
All black face covered military issue, outfits, military issue,

286
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.850
Vibram sold shoes,

287
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.170
all dressed uniformly started smashing windows,

288
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.850
smashing cars, pushing over, uh, like, uh,

289
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.600
post office by boxes, lighting things on fire.

290
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.480
And then they wound up shutting down all the protests and even had,

291
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:03.240
they had a no protest zone where people were showing up at work where they had a

292
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.120
WTO stick or like a WTO pin with a red line through it.

293
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:11.720
They made them take that pin off of their jacket before they went through the

294
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:15.790
line because you couldn't have anything that was anythinginterest anyinterest

295
00:16:15.791 --> 00:16:17.750
any sort of a protestinterest. Yeah, it was crazy.

296
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.870
Like this is all documented in this film. Then they,

297
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:25.670
they eventually all these guys who were the agent provocateurs hold up into

298
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.750
building and then the police negotiated with them and then released them.

299
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.100
So there was some sort of an order order from higher up and they were all

300
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:34.934
released.

301
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.540
<v 1>Interesting. They used these.</v>

302
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.860
<v 0>Guys, they used military people,</v>

303
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.460
some branch of the government who knows what the they were, who they were.

304
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.900
They used them to turn a peaceful protest about a,

305
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.900
a legitimate concern.

306
00:16:48.901 --> 00:16:51.900
These people have about the doings of the world trade organization.

307
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.380
And they turned it into a,

308
00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:58.370
a violent encounter that they could then justifiably bring in the police and

309
00:16:58.371 --> 00:16:59.204
shut everything down.

310
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.410
<v 1>Makes sense. That's.</v>

311
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.730
<v 0>What people are worried about with these bricks.</v>

312
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.050
They're worried about these bricks, these bricks, this is horse that this is,

313
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.210
this is done to shut down the peaceful protests where people are

314
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.920
legitimately and righteously concerned about end police

315
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.320
brutality. Cuz it's been going on forever. It's been going on too long.

316
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:23.240
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, I just, at this point it's like, I don't,</v>

317
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.320
I don't put past any measure done by people that want to maintain their bottom

318
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:32.440
line. Like they'll do whatever it takes. And it's like, again, you know,

319
00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:36.190
when it, when it comes to stuff like that, I, I wanna stay informed.

320
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.350
I wanna in turn those, I wanna keep those ideas in, in mind,

321
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.270
in the most simplistic way, which is if you've got a lot of,

322
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.190
you're gonna do whatever it takes to keep your right. And,

323
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:49.480
and you'll do all kinds of crazy to try to maintain power and control

324
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.120
and, and what, and vice versa.

325
00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.360
And what really sucks is that if you did the opposite,

326
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.520
if you did what that sheriff did, you,

327
00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.440
you actually get not only get what you want, but you get more. Yeah.

328
00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:02.900
And,

329
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.680
and that's what I don't understand the virus of doing evil badly.

330
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.871
What I,

331
00:18:08.871 --> 00:18:12.590
that's what I think of it as being very inefficient and terrible at being

332
00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:16.150
selfish and greedy, if you were really selfish and if you were really grey,

333
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.003
greedy,

334
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.390
you would make sure that the wellbeing of your population was met so that there

335
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:24.590
was reverence for your position. And if there's reverence for your position,

336
00:18:24.591 --> 00:18:27.550
then you have the good will of people and it's easier to make things happen.

337
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.580
However, boy, don't get that. That's 5d chess. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah, man. I mean,

338
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.940
I mean, come on. It's like I know, but even people don't think like that. Right.

339
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.220
I know they don't. They just want control and power.
