WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And that we just,</v>

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.880
we live our lives in the most ordinary meascale phenomena where, you know,

3
00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:11.840
we don't see, um,

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.400
we don't see the quantum because we're not, you know,

5
00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:20.240
playing with polarized lenses in ways that show us what light actually is. Um,

6
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.110
you know, we're not playing with super fluid helium. We're not, uh,

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.990
understanding, um,

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.310
just how bizarre faction is, or, you know,

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.110
whether there's some sort of quantum aspect of biology and what you see people

10
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:39.430
doing is that they're, they, they start grasping for everything. Like,

11
00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:43.740
I'm not saying that there's nothing ancient aliens or UFOs or whatever,

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.100
but a lot of that is just,

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.620
people want something richer and more, more amazing for their lives.

14
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.420
And I'm not gonna pass too much judgment on that.

15
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.260
But I am gonna say if we just restricted the,

16
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.170
the rest of our days to the provable stuff that we is out there,

17
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.410
it could be amazing. People need more meaning with all of the rationality,

18
00:01:08.411 --> 00:01:10.450
with all of the mystery we've taken out of the world.

19
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.290
It's time to put a ton of it back in.

20
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.890
<v 1>When you say, put, put a ton of it back in. Yeah. Like how,</v>

21
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.810
how you gonna put it back in.

22
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.640
<v 0>Well, um, you know, if I were to start talking about the,</v>

23
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.040
octonians an eightdimensional number system that no one understands

24
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.080
I can do that totally rigorously.

25
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:35.080
I can show you all sorts of bizarre stuff involving the octonians.

26
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.800
What is the octonians? Well, that's my point.

27
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.760
You don't even know that there are four types of numbers whose

28
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.430
dance, uh,

29
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.510
it's called the real numbers that we know complex numbers that you were tortured

30
00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:49.950
once with in high school, maybe during some kind of a trip,

31
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.350
a friend of you mentioned the qu mentioned the quians to you,

32
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.430
and then there's this one system of numbers, uh,

33
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.230
which is like the crazy relative, nobody discusses.

34
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.950
And that's called the octonians and the octonians are so weird that math and

35
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.940
IANS don't even really understand why they're there.

36
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.540
<v 1>That's an octoian.</v>

37
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.740
<v 0>That thing. Well,</v>

38
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.660
my guess is that that's probably back to the Ru root laice of E eight. Yeah.

39
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:17.540
Which we discussed last time, which has this kind of Mandela pattern to it. But,

40
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.540
um, I could show you, there are multiplication table.

41
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.010
I could describe their ceies there's symmetry group called G two,

42
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.890
which involves these strange numbers, but it's a mystery. Like if I got to, I,

43
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.370
I, I probably know more about the tonians than most mathematicians.

44
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.610
If I got to the end of all of my knowledge of the octonians,

45
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.730
I still wouldn't know what to tell you about why they're there and what they

46
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:44.360
mean. Nobody knows. I, I promise you that. Yeah.

47
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.440
That's a real mystery. Now we could talk about like, you know,

48
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.880
my friend said that that event that happened in Siberia in the early, you know,

49
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:56.320
20th century was actually an alien visitation. Well maybe yes. Maybe no,

50
00:02:56.321 --> 00:03:00.920
I don't know anything about it. If I just focused us on, like,

51
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.120
what we know is out there that we don't grasp,

52
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.960
which is a hundred percent rock solid,

53
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.920
it provides so much mystery and meaning and invitation to adventure.

54
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.120
Like if you, if you're looking for a hero's journey,

55
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.960
I I'll show you a ton of these things and it's empowering.

56
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:20.830
It's just you incredibly, um,

57
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.350
it's incredibly empowering to know that you're a hair's breath away from

58
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.830
superpowers. So I wanna help people explore that.

59
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.350
<v 1>So what is that like when you're explaining this,</v>

60
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.710
when you're saying this is bizarre series of numbers, right? What is it doing?

61
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.180
Like what, how do, how do we interface.

62
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.380
<v 0>With it? Well, um, so for example, let's,</v>

63
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.380
let's take an easier system that we feel a little bit more confident with.

64
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:51.980
There's this thing called the quadians, which are based on the number one,

65
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.140
the complex number. I,

66
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.500
if you remember that from some distant math class,

67
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.930
and then there's some thing called J and K.

68
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.330
So I times J equals K J times K equals.

69
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.130
I J times I is equal to the negative of I times J

70
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.290
so negative K there's a multiplication table for these,

71
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.810
these objects and these objects help with, um,

72
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.560
computer vision, you know, uh, simulation, 3d, uh,

73
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:27.240
projections they're used all the time in, um, probably video games.

74
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.880
They may come up in nature. I mean, we know that nature uses complex numbers,

75
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.160
and most people never found out why they were being told about complex numbers

76
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.200
or imaginary numbers,

77
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:39.280
because they never got to the point where you're actually looking at wave

78
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.190
functions, uh, that describe photons and electrons and all of,

79
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.430
all of that good stuff that you read about in physics. So in essence,

80
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.550
um, the,

81
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.230
the octonians are a system where IJK keeps going effectively through elemental P

82
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.871
QR, you know,

83
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:59.670
till you've got eight different objects and they're not even associative,

84
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.460
which is one of these rule that you learn about like, you know,

85
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.300
multiplication is associative and you think, well, what isn't associative,

86
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.700
right? So if I, you know, if you, if you talk about commutivity, for example,

87
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.140
I can't tell whether you put on your shirt, uh, first or your shoes first,

88
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:16.620
because it's, it's commutative as to which order you did it.

89
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:18.180
But if you put on your underwear in a different order,

90
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.950
then you put on your pants,

91
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.090
it'll become immediately obvious which order you did it and right. &lt;laugh&gt; okay.

92
00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:23.480
Well,

93
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.170
there's another thing called a associaivity and almost everything that we deal

94
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:30.330
with in, you know, elementary mathematics is associatetives here. Like,

95
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:32.530
why do I learn about associateivity I've never met anything that is an

96
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.170
associate. Well, the Octonian vein associate,

97
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.330
they're a number system that is responsible for most

98
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.320
of the Platy pie of mathematics, if you, well,

99
00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:47.040
things that just occur anomalously so that's an

100
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:51.680
example of an invitation out of this planet. You know,

101
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.920
if you start to think about the octonians and care about them and say,

102
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.720
are they a message? Do they have meaning we can prove that they're there.

103
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.080
I can construct them for you,

104
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.040
but they generate so much bizarreness in some sort of abstract space.

105
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.560
<v 1>How are they recognized? Like how, how was it,</v>

106
00:06:07.561 --> 00:06:09.240
how did it come to be that this was a point.

107
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.760
<v 0>Of discussion? Well, there's a, there's a process. In fact,</v>

108
00:06:11.761 --> 00:06:15.360
there are two processes where you can build these number systems up from each

109
00:06:15.361 --> 00:06:16.360
other. So you,

110
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.270
the complex from the real you build thequaterians from the complex,

111
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.190
you build the octonians from the cuterians and then you can't build anything

112
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:27.110
beyond that, because each time you're giving up a,

113
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.110
a magical power to get to the next stage.

114
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:32.870
And by the time you get to the octonians, you're exhausted the system.

115
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:36.070
When you say giving up a magical power. Well, like for example, um,

116
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.180
it's very hard to think about the square root of negative one. So like,

117
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.300
what does it mean for something squared to be negative one? Right?

118
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.100
So that's like the complex numbers gave up that kind of sensibility.

119
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.220
And then the complex numbers are at least commutative,

120
00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:51.740
eight times B equals B times a,

121
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:53.900
but the quadterians don't have that pro property.

122
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.860
So then you have a further property called associaivity.

123
00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:59.490
So you're sort of to eat, to build the next system.

124
00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:02.410
You're giving up properties that sort of make sense to us.

125
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.410
And by the time you've got into the octonians, you've given everything away.

126
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:09.330
There's no way you're gonna build the next system, but yet it's real. Yes.

127
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.610
Yet it's real in a, in a, in a, in a very real mathematical sense. So does.

128
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.290
<v 1>It just highlight our lack of understanding?</v>

129
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.650
<v 0>Yeah. And it, and it is a call to adventure.</v>

130
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:20.240
It's like a message from something that isn't human.

131
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.200
I'm not gonna say that it's God, I'm not gonna say that it's logic or designed,

132
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.053
but it's a more.

133
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.240
<v 1>Complex, it's.</v>

134
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.760
<v 0>Something system of the universe. That's right.</v>

135
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.320
And you have to uncover that these things are there. Or for example, you know,

136
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.480
sea elegance. I don't know if you've like played with, uh,

137
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.160
do you know about sea elegigans? No. All right. Sea,

138
00:07:38.161 --> 00:07:42.150
elegigan say elegance C a letter Uh-huh elegance.

139
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.990
And ELGAN like, ELGAN I think it's okay.

140
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.830
So it's this worm that was chosen by this guy, Sidney brennaner, who just died.

141
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.470
And it's a shame because he would've been a great podcast guest,

142
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.670
just like one of the most brilliant biologists that we didn't focus on.

143
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.310
And he said, you know what?

144
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.620
We're missing a species that we can completely describe

145
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.973
soup to nuts.

146
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.350
Here's the one that's about the simplest thing with a brain it's only got a

147
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.430
thousand cells and 300 of those cells make up a very primitive neural system.

148
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.670
And we're gonna track where every cell, like, bring up Jamie, if you,

149
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.780
I could ask you so to bring up the cell lineage diagram for sea

150
00:08:24.781 --> 00:08:25.614
elegance.

151
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.380
So this will be the first of two images. Whoa, Jesus.

152
00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:36.660
That is a complete map of how one fertilized egg

153
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:38.763
becomes

154
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.770
a tiny microscopic worm for every possible division. What in.

155
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.290
<v 1>The am I looking at? &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

156
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.330
<v 0>I love when you say that, that is so wild. Yeah.</v>

157
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.290
Right now here's the thing.

158
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.240
Everyone in biology knows how cool this thing is.

159
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.120
And very few people,

160
00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:05.200
not enough people outside of biology know that we have completely mapped

161
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.600
how one cell, like if you're 30 trillion cells around,

162
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.920
it's too big to write a diagram it's only possible because there are only a

163
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.470
thousand cells and this thing has locomotion. It has sexual reproduction,

164
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.190
you know, it eats.

165
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.390
So you're looking at the architectural plans for an actual

166
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.950
organism. And Jamie, when we're done with that,

167
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.990
if I could trouble you for the.

168
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.310
<v 1>For the folks that are just falling,</v>

169
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.380
gonna pause for you for a moment for the sort are following at home, listening,

170
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.580
just listening, not watching, but we're looking at, um, Jamie,

171
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.740
explain how someone could see this image. If they want go with themselves.

172
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.940
<v 2>Um, the letter C it's not the, not C like the ocean C elegance.</v>

173
00:09:46.941 --> 00:09:50.900
And then that cell lineage, it looks like a, a really long basketball bracket.

174
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.620
Yes. Kind of pushed out forever.

175
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.730
<v 1>Now that's a good way to describe it. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. So it's wild.</v>

176
00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.473
Yeah. Wow.

177
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.490
<v 0>Talk about March madness. Yeah.</v>

178
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.250
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; a madness. June madness. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

179
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:10.010
<v 0>February. It just doesn't stop. If we could bring up the, um,</v>

180
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.770
wiring diagram or djacency matrix. Yeah.

181
00:10:14.771 --> 00:10:17.800
The C iswearing right. Yeah. Perfect. Whoa.

182
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:22.680
That is a complete map of the 300 neurons

183
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.640
in the sea elgan's worm. How they're wired to each other.

184
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.640
Like that is a map of the mind of the worm.

185
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.853
<v 1>Wow.</v>

186
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:38.390
<v 0>Okay. So that's the portal. That's another portal. Here's an organism,</v>

187
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.230
which is completely mapped and has complex behaviors. It has,

188
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.910
I think about half the number of adult cell types that you and I have.

189
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:52.030
So maybe we have like 250, like only 250 different kinds of adult cells,

190
00:10:52.031 --> 00:10:54.470
more or less. I don't wanna get too precise about that.

191
00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.460
And yet we are like 10 trillion or 30 trillion copies of those

192
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.300
tiny number of different types of cells. Well,

193
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.940
I think the sealegigans has about 125 or something like that,

194
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.260
different cell types.

195
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.020
And it only has a thousand cells and it's able to do most of what we're able to

196
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:16.140
do. We move around, we eat, we have sex.

197
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.450
Great. Pretty simple life.

198
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.810
<v 1>Do you think it's ever possible? Well, it's, I'm sure it's probably possible.</v>

199
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.530
But do you think in our lifetime we'll ever see a map like that,

200
00:11:26.531 --> 00:11:27.410
of a human organism?

201
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.331
<v 0>I don't think so.</v>

202
00:11:28.331 --> 00:11:31.250
But the cool thing is we have this map and we still don't understand it.

203
00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:34.490
Like we've got this thing dead to rights. Mm we've got it. Boxed in it.

204
00:11:34.491 --> 00:11:37.970
Can't we know every single cell, what it does. We have all,

205
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.280
all the wirings between the neurons and we still don't get it.

206
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.680
Right. Right. So like, imagine that you're what eight years,

207
00:11:47.681 --> 00:11:51.560
how old is that? Well, what did, what a genius? This sky,

208
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:55.000
Sidney Brener was for choosing this organism. Mm-hmm right.

209
00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.560
Because this organism is the simplest place to look at

210
00:12:00.561 --> 00:12:03.240
complex life. Mm.

211
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.120
This image, the reconstructed biological neural. Network's like what?

212
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.000
I think you're looking okay.

213
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:17.510
&lt;affirmative&gt; now we could have a discussion about some weird Peruvian structure

214
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.390
and whether we've been visited mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I'm be up for that.

215
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.510
Look &lt;laugh&gt;, I'm not, not gonna pretend that I'm too good for it,

216
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.710
but I know that this is real, right. I, I don't have any doubt.

217
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.590
I'm not gonna sit around asking. Well, do you believe that, you know,

218
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.220
aliens talk to this federal government in the forties, right? Um,

219
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.820
that might as well be an alien. Yeah. And it's an invitation to adventure.
