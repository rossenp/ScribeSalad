00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.570
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I've been reading about this.</v>

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.690
I've been watching and reading this woman, Esther Hicks. Oh yeah. Okay. This,

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.460
that lady, that channels. But, um,

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.410
putting that aside to not, um, preconditioned anyone,

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.670
her,

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.140
her discussions on manifestation and her

7
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:25.670
explanation of that, that the physical body that you have,

8
00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:30.320
thoughts and thoughts are bigger than your body is simply a bag that holds your

9
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.200
protects your thoughts so they can occur. Yeah.

10
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.520
And that when you think something, you, you begin to bring it into idea,

11
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.340
which is on the process to bring it into the world.

12
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.750
And so when you say I can't, um,

13
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.210
certainly cannot. Right. And,

14
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.130
and that it's okay when coming from a position of I can

15
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.050
and it's already happened and I'm just meeting up with what's already occurred.

16
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.330
Yeah. That there's something beautiful there, especially when it's not, um,

17
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.570
really being wrapped in a selfish thing,

18
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.800
but manifesting happiness and things you love and that,

19
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:14.300
that attracts other that's what's contagious, you know?

20
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.740
And, um, so I wonder when I see a photo like that, about the connection of her,

21
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:23.000
her point point being is that she's like all day long,

22
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:27.890
you're thinking thoughts and acting on them because that mind and body are one

23
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.610
they're executing the same process together, you know,

24
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.590
dependently and like that is the embodiment of thought and

25
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.320
body and action together.

26
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.180
And being ultimately in that vortex of being aware

27
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.900
that.

28
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.730
<v 1>Esther Hicks lady is very strange.</v>

29
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.320
I'm very torn on that because I listened to the actual words and the things that

30
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:55.770
she says when she's channeling that, what is it like Abraham? Is he like a,

31
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:59.060
a dead guy or an alien? What does he, I forget what he is. I see.

32
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.490
I just channels an alien. Right. But I think.

33
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.490
<v 0>There's multiple people. Yeah. But see, the thing is, is I've,</v>

34
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.260
I've kind of like was listening stumbled on that while I was driving and,

35
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:12.350
and investigating or reconnecting with the law,

36
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.880
like the law of attraction and, and how to, like, it's like,

37
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.100
when you get your motorcycle lesson,

38
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:21.680
they tell you to look through the turn because you,

39
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:24.440
you tend to go where you're looking, you know,

40
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:27.350
not a lot of people are walking backwards and talking to you as they go forward.

41
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.720
Of course. And, and so, uh, that it sort of Dawn on me,

42
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.680
the connection between just looking for something you love and not bonding or

43
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:41.060
focusing on all the you don't like as a, as a manner of, um,

44
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.280
walking towards what, what you desire, you know, and,

45
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.090
and this kind of a reawakening with that concept

46
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.340
is very, it's just mere w you know, three, four weeks old for me, really, um,

47
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.750
well, returning to that idea, because I had this idea of this,

48
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:03.340
this concept before of like, um, someone's got to make it,

49
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.930
why shouldn't it be? Why it's,

50
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.190
why couldn't it be you let's let's let's, uh,

51
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.500
let's go for it and really go for it.

52
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.170
The only way to make it as to really honestly go, let's say, you're.

53
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.810
<v 1>Talking about like your band before you guys made it. No.</v>

54
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.230
<v 0>I'm talking about a way of acting regarding anything. Okay.</v>

55
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.090
I love music and, and music has always been my way of,

56
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.490
of, um,

57
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.620
being the utmost honest I can be. Um,

58
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.550
and I think because of that, it's, that's,

59
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:41.050
what's helped gravitate people that have stayed so long in that. However,

60
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.970
also I've realized that I put so much of who I really am and

61
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:50.710
total into the music, that there are times that I should have done that and,

62
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.600
and relationships with friends or, or people it's like, and family, and,

63
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.430
and that it's really, it's important to do that in life, to,

64
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.601
you know,

65
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:06.520
to be engaged and also show your real self that kind of

66
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.480
where the vulnerability of all that is really powerful instead of weakness,

67
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:14.170
it's the opposite of weakness, you know? And, and so I think,

68
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.160
I think pursuing music that way is great,

69
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.530
but not if it's keeping you from doing that in life.

70
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.130
And so it's not just that I would think that way.

71
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:27.520
So my band would do well it's that I would think that way so that I could,

72
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.320
I could do well, I could be well, you know? Right. And, uh, um,

73
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.600
and so that's why I started listening to her and not seeing any of the opening

74
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:42.190
gambit of, of her transforming into, um,

75
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.520
Abraham, Abraham, and not caring and not understanding what that means,

76
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.340
just going, like, I'm just listening to what you're saying while I'm driving.

77
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.440
Right. And I'm hearing that, and the way she's speaks, uh,

78
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.550
regarding those things is really fascinating. I,

79
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.300
I choose to detach myself from judgment. Yeah. Because,

80
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.550
cause I know one thing, nothing, well, it's, it's, it's.

81
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.670
<v 1>It's weird because she's saying very wise things.</v>

82
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.980
<v 0>But it'd be a shame to get the just cause I don't, uh, that's not the rapper.</v>

83
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:17.880
I would pick that. I don't like the candy inside. Right? Yeah.

84
00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:21.330
The channeling part of it. Well, yeah, so it's not, oh you mean,

85
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:24.630
it's not exactly how I would do it. Well, this though.

86
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.170
<v 1>Well, it's not just that it's like, you're listening to wisdom,</v>

87
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.260
but are you listening to wisdom from someone who's made up a fairytale?

88
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.980
That's where it gets confusing as well. She's channeling. Well,

89
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.060
but she channeling.

90
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.100
<v 0>I also think that to be able to learn something, this, this, again,</v>

91
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.240
this awakening in me is so new. Um,

92
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.680
like it's in all honesty, it's, it's like a month and a half old,

93
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.600
but it feels really good what happened. Uh, it's just that, um, you know,

94
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.270
um, I think, yeah,

95
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.040
that engagement in life, you know, um, and also, you know,

96
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:07.040
feeling a bit lost and not knowing how to ask for

97
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.230
how to ask for help sometimes, you know what I mean? And,

98
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:16.940
and not really knowing something exists at all, you have feelings, uh,

99
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.200
that's a little too vague, but my point being that like, um,

100
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.010
all of a sudden engaging in something, engaging in something that you're,

101
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.700
that you really love not focusing on the negative part of it,

102
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.660
but really chasing after that thing, that, which makes you feel good. So you've.

103
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.130
<v 1>Changed your perspective the way you focus on it. Absolutely.</v>

104
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.340
<v 0>And in fact, uh, an in fact that I realized like, um, what sort of, uh,</v>

105
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.840
you know, it's fine, it's fine to be afraid of, you know? Yeah.

106
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.250
It's fine. It's not fine to go like, Nope, that's not, uh, not,

107
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.240
that's not over there. Right, right. To deny it. Yeah. Uh,

108
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.440
how can you get stronger unless you've turned them really, really look into it,

109
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.180
you know? Right. You don't want to be paralyzed.

110
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.630
<v 1>By fear, but there's nothing wrong with being aware that something scares you.</v>

111
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.710
Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.040
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I really, um, nine times out of 10,</v>

113
00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:11.680
you didn't need to be afraid of it. And that one time you do, you know,

114
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.150
it's true and you know what it is. Right. And, and that seems like a successful.

115
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.460
And in dealing with that too, you get the chance to say, um,

116
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.680
I can do this.

117
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.520
<v 2>Is that lady still alive? Is Esther hook still alive? I have no idea.</v>

118
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.640
<v 1>Maybe how you get her in go wonky.</v>

119
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.593
<v 0>I think,</v>

120
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.140
I think it would be interesting because you'd have to separate the things that

121
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.530
don't fit. Right. Right.

122
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.830
<v 1>Well, one is the husband has to be there with everything to Jerry. He.</v>

123
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.830
<v 0>Died as I listened, see,</v>

124
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.850
without having no preconceived notion and just hearing this as I drive though,

125
00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:48.460
when the next YouTube things started to play and I was like, who is this?

126
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.600
Who is Abraham? There's no, there was no context for me.

127
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.640
I was just listening to the words. And I was like, wow, that's great. Yeah.

128
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.900
You know, this is great. And, um, and kept listening.

129
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:03.730
I was driving to the desert and doing all this other stuff.

130
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.970
<v 1>And yeah. You know, what's interesting about it. It's remarkably consistent.</v>

131
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.840
Like it, she doesn't say anything that's really foolish.

132
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.880
<v 0>And she never changes her tune right. About look. Um,</v>

133
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.700
and I, and I started to dig that she was saying,

134
00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:22.780
we cause until I understood that she was like channeling something.

135
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.170
I thought it was just a really beautiful way of saying we,

136
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.830
what we want to tell you is like, as if you were already there. Right. And,

137
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:33.880
and really what she was talking about is already being there anyways.

138
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.740
Like you will have an idea, you will form a habit of one type or another,

139
00:08:38.741 --> 00:08:43.690
which one would you like it to be? And, um, and know this,

140
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.980
if all you can focus is on what sucks, but as yet to be,

141
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.230
just wait a sec, it's common. And what, where conversely,

142
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:54.064
if you were like,

143
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.360
I ain't going to worry about because I lack as much time without it as possible.

144
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:59.880
Let's focus on something I do. Like until she gets here,

145
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.790
that you naturally look through the turn.

146
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.860
And as long as you're not trying to turn into a wall or a cavalcade of. Right.

147
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.900
But if you're trying to turn into something you love,

148
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.520
you actually will turn into something you love case.

149
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.250
<v 1>You should probably embrace challenges. Right.</v>

150
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.510
And you should probably welcome them because when they happen,

151
00:09:20.511 --> 00:09:25.130
they will test you and then you can figure out whether or not this philosophy is

152
00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.110
actually, well.

153
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.470
<v 0>I mean, I have been, I have been, I have been testing because, you know,</v>

154
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.010
I I've always like dealt with difficulty by

155
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.840
shielding it,

156
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.070
putting it into the music or putting it into some dark closet somewhere.

157
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.270
You know what I mean? Right. Cause that's just, you're taught to do that. Right?

158
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.540
Like, like Nash your teeth and, and grin and bear it,

159
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.100
ignore it, ignore it. Yeah.

160
00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:53.330
Like that's what the rug is for sweeping stuff under, right. Where you're like,

161
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.650
oh really? And,

162
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.540
but that's feels like building a dam or something to when really you're

163
00:09:59.541 --> 00:10:03.350
supposed to let that river of, of fear or whatever, go with it,

164
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.860
go downstream with it. Stop fighting it. Cause he all that up.

165
00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:09.200
Put it in the corner, bury it behind.

166
00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:13.280
And really one day it just like gives you a massive bath of you're.

167
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.050
That breaks. The whole law.

168
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.020
<v 1>Of attraction thing is very strange to me because I feel like everybody's trying</v>

169
00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:21.620
to describe something that there's some element of truth to,

170
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.510
but that it's really complicated and it's not as simple as think it and

171
00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:30.710
manifest it. There's a lot of discipline involved in that.

172
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.690
There's a lot of hard work and concentration and thought and doubts and

173
00:10:35.691 --> 00:10:38.720
hopes and dreams. And there's a lot of other things. And then also fortune,

174
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.150
well, I feel.

175
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.630
<v 0>Like when those, when I could never drink,</v>

176
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.440
I would never use that for fortune. For me, the fortune would be like,

177
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.380
um, that your relationships and emotional connections get deeper.

178
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.790
<v 1>Yeah. I don't mean fortune. I mean being fortunate. Yeah. I mean being lucky,</v>

179
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.560
like we're, we're lucky we're here.

180
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.410
<v 0>While we're we're here, but it's not really lucky.</v>

181
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.120
And I think that's one of the main things,

182
00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:08.090
right there is understanding the difference in thought,

183
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.920
because ultimately what you're saying,

184
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.360
what one is that hard work that you're talking about and all those things are,

185
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:19.010
are sort of getting out of your own way and unlearning how to say,

186
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.970
how to be so doubtful about it all. And just say, I'll take,

187
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.710
I'll take something I like.

188
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:30.080
And I'll just think about that for Beth and let that be the first step

189
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.610
and then go, what do I keep going down that river downstream of that idea,

190
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.230
getting closer and closer to something you really love because saying,

191
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.630
you know, saying, I don't like this water bottle sucks,

192
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.710
but, but saying, um, but at least I don't have to drink.

193
00:11:48.711 --> 00:11:50.210
It is one step away from that.

194
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.070
And if you just keep taking those steps away and going down that river,

195
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:57.610
that's the right direction to be going. Because focusing on this, it's like,

196
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.590
how's that going to help you? God, it's got this blue binding and stuff. Well,

197
00:12:01.591 --> 00:12:02.190
it's certainly not going.

198
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:07.050
<v 1>To help you to, to think about how fortunate you are. Yeah. Is it,</v>

199
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.670
I mean, I guess it kinda is.

200
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.850
<v 0>It's blocking you. Well, it's blocking you from feeling fortunate,</v>

201
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.580
but saying at least I don't have to drink them every day is turning the right

202
00:12:14.581 --> 00:12:17.190
direction and heading towards how fortunate you are.

203
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.670
And if you keep taking those little direct, that those steps,

204
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.590
then soon you get to, like, I feel fortunate to be here. I feel fortunate.

205
00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.660
I don't have to think about this bottle of water all the time.

206
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.093
That's quite nice.

207
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.370
<v 1>When you and gratitude also it clears your mind. You do have,</v>

208
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.370
if you're thinking about positive things and working towards those things,

209
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.470
it clears your mind, uh, of a lot of the, just the,

210
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.630
the natural traps that we set for you.

211
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.160
<v 0>Yeah. Dumb, nuts, baggage.</v>

212
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.300
Those hurdles we make are tailor made because they're made by you for you

213
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.310
not work.

214
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.820
<v 1>Yeah. The highlight, your actual, real insecurities and fears that, you know,</v>

215
00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:54.654
you have for them.

216
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.230
<v 0>Absolutely. And, and you go, this is short to trap Selman,</v>

217
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.650
cause look up and then you're in it because you made it for you. It's like,

218
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.500
yeah, to me, it's trapped me. And uh,

219
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.760
and I think what I like about what I heard her saying is that because it came

220
00:13:08.761 --> 00:13:12.930
from no context whatsoever and I just heard the words, it said,

221
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.910
can you get out of your own way? Yeah.

222
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.130
That's what I'm would like you to think about first?

223
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.670
<v 1>What is that? There's an ancient tale, a tale of two wolves,</v>

224
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.780
meaning how to live your life. Um, that like, yeah,

225
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.710
one Wolf is filled with fear and how does that go?

226
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.690
<v 0>My mother just gave, just gave it to my kids real there.</v>

227
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.730
How's it go? Um, uh, paraphrasing, you know, she bought this frame thing,

228
00:13:38.731 --> 00:13:42.300
like, you know, um, there are two wolves and uh,

229
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:47.320
one is anger and one is like love and, uh, and, and,

230
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.770
um, they both exist, but ultimately it's like, which one are you going to feed?

231
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.900
Yeah. It's, it's really the, I, I think I'm correct in saying that.

232
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.960
<v 1>But yeah, you paraphrasing, but it's something that's like, that's the one,</v>

233
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.090
the one that survives and succeeds is the one you feed.

234
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:08.490
<v 0>I think the younger, um, you know, native American says, well,</v>

235
00:14:08.491 --> 00:14:13.110
how do I, how do I know which one, how do I not let one take over? It's like,

236
00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:16.640
well, which one are you gonna feed ultimately, right. Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:18.360
<v 1>Well,</v>

238
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.930
the more you concentrate on positive things and the less you concentrate on

239
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:25.020
negative things, for sure. You're freeing your mind up. And you're, you,

240
00:14:25.021 --> 00:14:28.920
you gain the momentum of positive thought and the momentum of,

241
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.110
of living your life with positive thought, it becomes easier.

242
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.210
<v 0>Right. In the reward, I think. But I think it's also necessary to say,</v>

243
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.540
I'm not talking about walking around in collapsed, elect going. Ha.

244
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.060
It's just a, um, like smile,

245
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.120
smile. Yeah. You know what I mean?

246
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.310
<v 1>The nice and inaction you're talking about this. You're not talking about this.</v>

247
00:14:50.311 --> 00:14:53.390
Like in some sort a random, well.

248
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.950
<v 0>It starts with a thought it works into an idea and then manifest itself into</v>

249
00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:01.190
like a smile or just, it's nice to,

250
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.500
to do something nice.

251
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:07.520
And also understand that I'm not talking about walking around, like, hi. Yeah.

252
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.060
You know, like I'm not talking about being some goof, dumb, nuts.

253
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.450
That's what I'm saying is, um, do something,

254
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.290
do something nice and start that way and leave it at that.

255
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:21.620
And I think there's something too, when you're,

256
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.960
when your thoughts are filled with this, there's just frankly,

257
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:27.320
less room for me to think about this water, which I disliked. Right.

258
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.070
There's just frankly is less real estate, right.

259
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.640
Because that's when your real estate and positive things and because of the

260
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:39.470
contagion of enjoying it of cause things that are positive are essentially what

261
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:44.090
things I like. Yeah. I'm enjoying being here. So this water doesn't really,

262
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.380
I don't have real estate for that. I've got too much, uh,

263
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.700
enjoyment and to be here, you know, and, uh,

264
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.860
and, uh, that'll do.

265
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.550
<v 1>Now this Esther Hicks thing, how did you get into this.</v>

266
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.310
<v 0>Completely by accident or not meaning, meaning,</v>

267
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.700
um, you know, I, uh.

268
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.210
<v 3>The just sometimes.</v>

269
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.850
<v 0>Things just slammed down on the table and say, you gotta be engaged.</v>

270
00:16:12.851 --> 00:16:15.370
This is the moment to do, do it or not. Right.

271
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.780
And nothing incites a change like that.

272
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.100
That's sort of a gift actually. It's saying, it's struggle now,

273
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.360
but if you struggle through this, it's going to get better. You know? And,

274
00:16:28.361 --> 00:16:30.010
and I love I,

275
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:34.420
and I'm actually really thankful and appreciative of that sort of moment.

276
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.990
I don't mind the risk of all that. That's what it's all about.

277
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.470
How'd you stumble upon it though. I just was like looking for like

278
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.700
looking for through the law of attraction and, and,

279
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.440
and finding a way to change my thoughts to two things I loved.

280
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.370
And I listened to a couple of was driving and it just clicked onto hers.

281
00:16:54.371 --> 00:16:57.970
It autoplayed, and there it was. And as I said,

282
00:16:57.971 --> 00:16:59.680
without any sort of judgment,

283
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.700
and I'm the last person that's kind of a joiner or would be accused of being

284
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.780
hippy dippy fees or whatever, like kind of like

285
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.380
someone who's scared with keynote. I me, so it just made sense to me,

286
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.440
almost the calculus of it all. It's a complex problem,

287
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:22.390
but get out of your own way, keep it simple, listen. But she.

288
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.350
<v 1>Goes further than that. Right? She, she actually talks about your,</v>

289
00:17:25.351 --> 00:17:29.950
your thoughts manifesting reality. And she talks about how,

290
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.160
what you're doing with your thoughts and the way you think,

291
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:38.110
and the way you sort of interface with reality is you're creating

292
00:17:38.111 --> 00:17:39.670
reality with your mind.

293
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.870
<v 0>Right. Um, right. And, and I'm choosing,</v>

294
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.820
um, how I want to take that and have that mean something to me.

295
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.720
<v 1>So finding an application for that in.</v>

296
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.290
<v 0>Your life, and also I'm, um, within the,</v>

297
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.960
within the spectrum of all the things she's talking about,

298
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.040
I simply am looking for ways to, um,

299
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.890
in my immediate life with the people that are close to me,

300
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:09.410
how to be more engaged and how to be more engaging myself.

301
00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.490
Um, uh, because, um, I, as I said,

302
00:18:13.491 --> 00:18:17.750
I've had a lot of troubled times in the last few years because of just feeling

303
00:18:17.751 --> 00:18:19.580
lost and not knowing how to deal with that.

304
00:18:19.581 --> 00:18:22.130
And yet you always put that in your music. Um,

305
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.220
but maybe I should be putting it into more than just that too.

306
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.730
It doesn't negate wanting to your music to be truth. Right.

307
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:29.660
That's what it's for.

308
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:35.120
But also it should be inspiring to do point that in other directions,

309
00:18:35.121 --> 00:18:36.020
too, you bringing.

310
00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.860
<v 1>This to the band, like if you said, Hey guys, listen, this channel here, lady.</v>

311
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.150
<v 0>No, no, no, because I mean, I'm surprised I'm sort of revealing it here.</v>

312
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.050
I'd say it's, um, because I'm not a disciple of anything.

313
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.720
<v 1>I don't think there's anything wrong with it, honestly, because I mean,</v>

314
00:18:50.721 --> 00:18:51.560
I've listened to it too.

315
00:18:51.561 --> 00:18:54.500
I've let a buddy of mine was really into it and he turned me onto it and I

316
00:18:54.501 --> 00:18:57.140
listened to him. I said, okay, there's a lot of wacky going on here.

317
00:18:57.141 --> 00:18:59.600
There's like, I think she's channeling a thousand year old person,

318
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.400
something like that, Carrie, but whatever Abraham, right. Isn't that like,

319
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.250
I think she's supposedly channeling some ancient person,

320
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.350
but forget all that, the words she's saying resonate.

321
00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.790
<v 0>And they're also sort of like consistent across the state. And as I said before,</v>

322
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.440
I'm, I'm mining in a specific vein of like, okay,

323
00:19:21.441 --> 00:19:24.410
the people I care about most, how do we,

324
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:29.420
how do we all grow right at each other? And, and how do we do that?

325
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.600
Right? Because that is the goal, the goal isn't to, to be like.

326
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.160
<v 1>And it's also whether it's wacky or not looking,</v>

327
00:19:37.161 --> 00:19:38.540
there's a lot of wacky in religion,

328
00:19:38.541 --> 00:19:42.110
but obviously a lot of people find some great meaning in it. You can this,

329
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:47.150
I don't know how much the world is weird and complicated. Yeah, absolutely.

330
00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:50.180
You can get real wisdom from. That sounds like nonsense. Well.

331
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.130
<v 0>Uh, if you reserve the right to be surprised by life, if you really, if you, um,</v>

332
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.370
to have an open mind, you certainly have to unlock the door and open that.

333
00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.150
That's a.

334
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:03.020
<v 1>Great way of looking at it, reserve the right to be surprised by life. That.</v>

335
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.970
<v 0>Is my goal in general in life. And also now it's my,</v>

336
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.140
it's my mission,

337
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:14.240
because it's a bit like when I said like mess around

338
00:20:14.241 --> 00:20:18.560
with, you know, illegals, like the legal sub things that like that you,

339
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.770
oh, I suppose those are in there too. Yeah. What'd you mean though? I meant,

340
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:29.210
I meant that wrapped and other stuff, so I didn't have to just say that. Oh.

341
00:20:29.211 --> 00:20:33.260
But then I think I just gave that away. Okay. Now, um, those things,

342
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.940
those things are sort of like,

343
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.290
I tried all that for too long and that didn't really go anywhere.

344
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.290
So what else is there, what else is going on?

345
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.590
<v 1>Right. So you tried drugs and then you're like, well,</v>

346
00:20:45.591 --> 00:20:48.790
there's gotta be something else that's gonna fill this void or give me some

347
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:49.510
peace or.

348
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.180
<v 0>Oh, yeah. Or like, um, I certainly can't stand here.</v>

349
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:55.660
You're either growing or dying. Right. And since I'm less interested in dying,

350
00:20:55.661 --> 00:21:00.400
I'm like, what else, what else do we got? I mean, I think for awhile it was,

351
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.910
uh, you know, my next thing is, is.

352
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:05.920
<v 3>Um.</v>

353
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.250
<v 0>Well, it doesn't matter. I think what's important is when you said,</v>

354
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:13.060
are you bringing this to the guys in the band? I was just about to say yes,

355
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:16.390
until you said, are you telling her about this lady? Because to me,

356
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.730
your breeze, lesson lessons that you learned, I'm like, oh my God,

357
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.120
because I think I've always looked at music this way,

358
00:21:25.121 --> 00:21:28.210
where it's like locks there have these concentric circles.

359
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:31.990
And at one point they all line up and you can see through the door to the other

360
00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:35.260
side. And once you've seen it, you can't unsee that if,

361
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:40.480
if I have a song and we have to those concentric circles

362
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:44.620
lineup, it almost feels painful or criminal not to go to the other side when,

363
00:21:44.621 --> 00:21:47.590
you know, it gets so much better there. And, and, uh,

364
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.570
I feel like what I've been kind of learning is I also should apply the

365
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:57.490
same understanding to the people I care about. You know, like, um,

366
00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.910
if there's a way for us to have something more meaningful,

367
00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:04.780
that's all that being meaningful is like,

368
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.060
money is green paper. You know, these are like, it's fun to have collect things,

369
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:15.010
but who cares? It's the, it's the relationships you have. And you know,

370
00:22:15.011 --> 00:22:18.400
when you have kids and stuff, it's like having enjoying that,

371
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.960
even when it's rough, that's w that's the thing to get good at it.

372
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.580
You know what I mean? Uh, you'll have plenty of time to dial alone as you were,

373
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:31.600
you know, later, you know what I mean? And, uh, so I feel like,

374
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.450
um, that's what I'm kind of getting from that, from what she's saying.

375
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:42.670
And so it's, that works just fine. Yeah. Well, if it works, if it works,

376
00:22:42.671 --> 00:22:45.790
use it, right. It's not, it's not exclusively that either, you know,

377
00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:48.490
it's just like, uh, it's a tool. Yeah.

378
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:52.810
It's one of the tools that I would use in every situation is situational.

379
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:58.090
And so I feel like what's great is to have a bunch of tools and not pretend to

380
00:22:58.091 --> 00:22:58.330
know.
