00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And I say this many times,</v>

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:08.700
and I'll say it some more. Give me that lighter. You got a friend, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.310
He's, he's made some mistakes and some big ones,

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.930
but he's also actually exposed some real in.

5
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.660
He owns up to the mistakes he's made. They're not good.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.800
He doesn't think they're good.

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.260
There's a thing about finding conspiracies everywhere.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.570
That's not good for your brain. I really believe this.

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.440
I think that if you go looking for those things and that's all you look for and

10
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:33.990
you look from all the time, you can get real paranoid and real crazy.

11
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.570
And then there's also a bunch of people that are trying to stop you from doing

12
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.300
that because you do expose some crazy. You know,

13
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.750
he was talking about Epstein a long time ago, a long time ago,

14
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.550
he was saying there was a island in the,

15
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:48.870
and they take all these rich politicians and some celebrities and they bang

16
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:53.310
these kids. And I was like, come on. He was telling me this a long time ago.

17
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.210
So he's also the one who told me about Bohemian Grove. Well,

18
00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:59.190
I actually watched it for, I think this tape was actually made before I met him.

19
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.960
So he went and snuck in to this place where like former presidents go,

20
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:08.220
there's a photograph of Ronald Reagan with Herbert Walker, Bush,

21
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:10.800
and a couple other people all standing around. And it's like,

22
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:13.170
these are the people that used to hang out at this place.

23
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:17.340
And they would put on robes and they would worship an hour ago, owl God.

24
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:19.800
And they would burn an effigy and they're playing.

25
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.760
And then Alex snuck in and made video footage of this. And then no,

26
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:26.760
one's denying that it's real. This is really did happen there.

27
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.500
So they're in with these bankers and former presidents and they're dressed like

28
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.430
Druids. And some guy brings over something that it's an effigy.

29
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.280
That's supposed to be a body, a wrapped up effigy.

30
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.320
It's also a bunch of sticks in blood, in a blanket,

31
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.500
but it's like shaped like a body and then they drop it on the fire and they're

32
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:45.150
all worshiping an owl.

33
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.220
<v 1>God, why is that bad? But.</v>

34
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.440
<v 0>Imagine if you saw those, if that's what your business is,</v>

35
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.590
just finding those things. How crazy you think you get, first of all, wait,

36
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.300
then you add in vodka and head wounds.

37
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.710
<v 1>Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, go to the headwinds part.</v>

38
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.660
<v 0>What do you mean Jones? Okay. I got you.</v>

39
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.770
<v 1>It, man. When I was in liberal arts school, man,</v>

40
00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:07.720
there's this great teacher who changed my life, Sam Scovel. And he,

41
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.550
one of the things he taught was so beautiful. He still teaches there.

42
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.780
Whether the things he taught was figure out a way to take in all information and

43
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:18.590
then filter out the. That's not real and keep the real stuff. And like,

44
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.440
you know, Alex Jones is like let's yeah.

45
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.720
<v 0>Some of the stuff is real take what's real. There's a good chunk of it.</v>

46
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:27.554
That's real.

47
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.630
Like I remember he was telling me that there's governments using chemicals that

48
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.670
turn frogs gay. I was like, what, what are you talking about? He goes, yes.

49
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:38.870
He goes, pesticides are turning frogs gay. And I'm like, that can't be real. No,

50
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:40.400
there really is. Is that true? Yes.

51
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:43.580
There's pesticides that change frogs genders. What?

52
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.550
<v 1>Yes. Yes. But she, some.</v>

53
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.680
<v 0>Pesticide with frogs genders that sucks.</v>

54
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.910
Maybe it doesn't pens on the Friday is awesome for the frog Fox.

55
00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:58.850
I don't give a cause they've never been taught homophobia. Why would they care?

56
00:02:58.851 --> 00:03:03.520
Who. Yeah. But there's a real thing that you find that it's,

57
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.510
it's a pesticide that has some sort of an effect,

58
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.060
an unintended effect on frogs genders, dude.

59
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:11.530
That's another thing that people don't talk about.

60
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.780
Pesticides that have been used in like golf courses and like there's people live

61
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:19.840
around those. That's a chemical dump. Yeah.

62
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.400
Golf courses or pesticide atrazine can turn male frogs into females. Cool.

63
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.220
So this is pesticide. Berkeley changes the gender or should I say the sex?

64
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.310
Is it the same thing? Sex and gender.

65
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.590
<v 1>Getting sucked into that black hole Rogan. You can keep that to yourself,</v>

66
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.210
but Hey, I'll get sucked into another black hole. Isn't that crazy though? Yeah.

67
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.200
Before we get into that stuff, I want to say this real quick. Okay.

68
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.480
Is that camera on me, friends at the Bohemian Grove future friends.

69
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.510
I should say. I just want you to know, I don't know much about you.

70
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.920
I know Alex Jones, you know, probably on vodka drinks.

71
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.640
<v 0>I think he was then I think he was sober. He started drinking after all this,</v>

72
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.150
please don't.

73
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.320
<v 1>This up. Sorry. Siggy had an infiltrator look. I went to a summer camp.</v>

74
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.940
We have bonfires. We wore robes. I mean, not like maybe what you do.

75
00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:16.410
I just want to say, Hey, come on, invite me, please.

76
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.680
I won't tell anybody anything I've heard. You guys are pretty awesome. Actually,

77
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:24.510
what I've heard is the idea was to get a bunch of hardcore neo-cons together and

78
00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:25.830
then mix some artists in,

79
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.180
in the hopes that like having like brushing shoulders with artists would in some

80
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:32.550
way, shape or form loosened some people up a little bit.

81
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.810
And I've also already have a tram that connects campsites there to other

82
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.740
campsites,

83
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.350
meaning you just get in the tram and suddenly you're hanging out with Dick

84
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.940
Cheney. Listen, I won't tell anybody I got a podcast.

85
00:04:44.941 --> 00:04:47.520
I want you to tell Joe, let me and I worship molec.

86
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.690
I want to worship Moloch if it means hurting people.

87
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.050
But I don't understand why people are upset about by the way. That's.

88
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.460
<v 2>Like that you'd have video, right? Why is what's wrong with nothing?</v>

89
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.600
This is the thing. So excited.

90
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.460
<v 1>This is the thing that I get confused about here. It's like in our country,</v>

91
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.020
we've got people who are Christian and that's beautiful thing.

92
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.160
And I do love Jesus.

93
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:13.980
I was reading the book of mark today regarding the parable of the sower.

94
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.390
But that being said,

95
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.240
I don't think it's fair necessarily to tell people they can't worship an owl or

96
00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:22.620
burned in effigy in front of an owl,

97
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.390
some kind of symbolic magical ritual that represents the disintegration of your

98
00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:31.170
negative energy or whatever it may be. I really don't know, but that'd be,

99
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.741
you know, to me,

100
00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:34.980
that's the other problem that's happening right now is like superstition is

101
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.740
running rampant. I'm friends with lots of witches.

102
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:41.280
I know a few Satanist and I know a few people are under the occult and I don't

103
00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:44.490
know a single one of them that would tolerate child abuse.

104
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.340
I don't know a single one that wouldn't kill somebody.

105
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.310
Some of them would kill people if they thought they were hurting kids, not in,

106
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.600
in make it so that nobody found the body. Some of the Satanists,

107
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:58.910
I know they would kill some. They would kill probably. I don't know for sure.

108
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.500
I'm not trying to throw any Satanists under the bus,

109
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:04.880
but I'm just saying like this idea that we can't have alternate,

110
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.710
alternate pagan religions in our country without immediately being associated

111
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:11.930
with human sacrifice or child abuse.

112
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.780
I think that goes against the American spirit. It's like, look,

113
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.250
cause people don't want to subscribe to your particular like very popular global

114
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:23.540
religion doesn't necessarily implicate them in like something that is

115
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.740
truly a horror, which is human trafficking. Right? So to me,

116
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.210
this is the problem. It's like, man,

117
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.930
we gotta be a little bit more nuanced in our apprehend or not in our

118
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.850
conceptualization of these people. Again,

119
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.180
I don't know what's going on at the Bohemian Grove, but from what I've heard,

120
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.070
it's basically a summer camp for billionaires where they try to get artists in

121
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:45.710
there to like loosen them up a little bit. That's what I've heard.

122
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:50.620
I could be wrong. Who told you this? Is this I honestly can't say. Hm.

123
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.780
Hm. Interesting. Well, look man. I don't know. And I know,

124
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.823
have you seen the video.

125
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.560
<v 0>Bahamian growth? Have you seen it?</v>

126
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.490
<v 1>The ritual in front of the Al guy? You've seen it. Yeah. Go,</v>

127
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.080
come with me to burning man. And you will see that. Oh, I'm sure. Every 50 feet,

128
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.560
I don't.

129
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.680
<v 0>Think it's that big of a deal. I really don't.</v>

130
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.470
<v 1>If it involves hurting kids, it's a big deal.</v>

131
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:17.980
And if these are doing anything that involves human sacrifice,

132
00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:18.880
hurting human beings.

133
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.210
<v 3>In, in, in, uh, in, in.</v>

134
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.970
<v 1>Any application of that. But of course, then it's the worst thing on earth.</v>

135
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.640
And I'm so sorry that I said anything about it, but.

136
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.310
<v 0>I don't think that's what this is. I mean,</v>

137
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.290
obviously what we're seeing is not that we don't know what else happens,

138
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.550
but what you're seeing is them burning sticks in front of this, uh, owl God.

139
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.550
And it's like these crazy, um, crazy, uh,

140
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.850
speech they're given while it's going on. It's it's really weird. Hey,

141
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.290
can we hear some of it? The speech?

142
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.530
<v 4>I don't know where the speeches and the video,</v>

143
00:07:50.531 --> 00:07:54.160
I found out another video where they stabilize the footage. Oh, it's like,

144
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.483
but I mean before.

145
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.290
<v 0>Before this, nobody really believed that listening.</v>

146
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.190
<v 5>Once again,</v>

147
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:19.780
[inaudible].

148
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.450
<v 0>The lighting, the fog on fire and everybody's cheering.</v>

149
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.870
It looks fine. Stanley Kubrick had this,

150
00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:33.310
a quote once to a Nicole Kidman. I think it was,

151
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.990
they were working on eyes wide shut.

152
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:40.120
See if you can find what she said about the elites

153
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.570
that he hit, that he had said, I know I saved it.

154
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:45.880
I can find it if I have chance to look at my laptop,

155
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.930
but it was something about him. You know,

156
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.080
talking about the,

157
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:54.340
the powers that run the world and that they all have something on each other.

158
00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:57.810
And that's how they all can say together. They'll compromise each other.

159
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.990
That's what skull and bones is about. Like that's what all that stuff is about.

160
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:03.990
So he had a much more concise quote on that.

161
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:06.360
But when you see something like that, you go, well,

162
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.600
maybe it's like fun that they do it. That nobody knows they do it.

163
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.463
You know what I'm saying?

164
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.900
Like maybe it's like one of those rituals where you get together,

165
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:15.510
your dad thinks it's hilarious and you both put your hoods on,

166
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.150
you go out there and you burn the owl or you burn the sticks in front of the

167
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:22.980
owl. And what's fun is that you're not supposed to be doing it.

168
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:26.670
And it's a secret, but nothing really is happening. That's also on the table.

169
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.530
<v 1>Yeah, it's possible.</v>

170
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.970
<v 0>But it's weird, man. That was weird.</v>

171
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.360
Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.

172
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.510
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

173
00:09:41.511 --> 00:09:42.680
they're going to be available everywhere.

174
00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:46.250
But after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

175
00:09:46.251 --> 00:09:50.270
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

176
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.340
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking you just go download Spotify much.

177
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:56.510
Buh-bye.
