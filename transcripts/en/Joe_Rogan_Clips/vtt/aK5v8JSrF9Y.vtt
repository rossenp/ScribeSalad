00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.090
<v 3>I, yeah, no, it was really weird. Cause I was in the area that I lived.</v>

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.440
<v 1>Um, that's.</v>

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.480
<v 0>Where Tony lived. They burned. Yeah. They burned cop cars,</v>

5
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:13.860
like in very near my house. He used to love that area. It was so beautiful.

6
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:14.040
It was.

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.050
<v 1>So nice. Now it's all full tents. It.</v>

8
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.030
<v 0>Was really, it was really.</v>

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.450
<v 1>Do you know that they're spending, oh, you ready for this? Jamie?</v>

10
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.710
How about this? I'm going to send you this Jamie. Cause this is crazy. And.

11
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.630
<v 0>As we're talking on Los Angeles, they're still at homeless.</v>

12
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.410
<v 1>People. Well, there's a fee. There's nothing in comparison.</v>

13
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.360
What is the town? What's the.

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.020
<v 2>On Instagram account. Yeah. Oh, is this Los Angeles?</v>

15
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.690
<v 1>Let's treat people as Los Angeles as good gutter.</v>

16
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.180
People of Los Angeles is better. That's my favorite.

17
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.860
<v 0>My God, you guys, this is sad.</v>

18
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.680
<v 2>Well, this was the video. I was looking at that when you're talking about this,</v>

19
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:49.740
like activist lady is trying to, I guess, help,

20
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.570
but there's also a guy with a machete just general.

21
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.330
<v 0>And when you watched this the first time, what part did you come?</v>

22
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.020
<v 1>He comes all the time. It just comes multiple times.</v>

23
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.420
<v 2>Cigarette.</v>

24
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.680
<v 1>But not like Tom, I'm going to send you something, Jamie. Um, this is,</v>

25
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.960
uh, you remember how coli on the war was on? And he was talking about how, uh,

26
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.100
the reason why the homeless situation never gets fixed is because so many

27
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:15.480
people, um,

28
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.110
are working on the homeless situation and they spend hundreds of millions of

29
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:23.010
dollars. LA spit. I thought it was, there was no money. That's not the case.

30
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.220
Hundreds of millions of dollars get spent in the homeless. And.

31
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.080
<v 0>Thank you for your contribution to that.</v>

32
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.090
<v 1>But you know where it goes to, but you know where it goes to,</v>

33
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.210
it goes to the salaries of people, work on the homes. So this, uh,

34
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.440
someone posted all the salaries of all these people look at,

35
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:41.850
they're all like six figures and more look at it. 254,

36
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.500
260 $3,000, $198,000, $264,000.

37
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.000
Like they make a shitload of money. You would think.

38
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.350
<v 0>It is a job. You would want to pay people a lot. Cause you want them.</v>

39
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.220
You want like great, man, this is a, is a puzzle. Like this is a puzzle.

40
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.720
Somebody needs to solve. You want.

41
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.700
<v 1>Results when you get no results, it shouldn't get that.</v>

42
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.410
<v 0>Much. And there's too many people.</v>

43
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:05.460
There should be like a committee of five people that are experts.

44
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.850
<v 1>You need a lot of people to deal with the homeless situation in LA.</v>

45
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.820
It's a hundred thousand homeless people. You have, you have Boulder,

46
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:14.880
Colorado in LA, in homeless,

47
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.800
like take the entire population of Boulder and make it homeless and then put it

48
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:20.634
in LA.

49
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.560
<v 0>The opposite of that, Boulder, just these gorgeous fit hikers, hikers.</v>

50
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.300
They're like, they're hot,

51
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:30.270
but they're wearing those like toe shoes and like Tivas so you wouldn't bang

52
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:31.770
them. But you're like, I understand.

53
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.360
<v 1>The taking like a yoga mat to the top.</v>

54
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.060
<v 0>They got a yoga mat. They're wearing Jordan.</v>

55
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.410
<v 2>This is a story I heard in, uh, on the LA news that, uh, they had these,</v>

56
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.940
they bought these things for the homeless shelter situation and they were just

57
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:46.350
hanging out and you're at Dodger stadium,

58
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:49.200
unused until someone found them with like a drone one day.

59
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.433
<v 1>Either.</v>

60
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.520
<v 2>Spend a bunch of money on it.</v>

61
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.353
<v 1>Right. But here.</v>

62
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.970
So then you're going to get homeless people and they're going to live in these

63
00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:00.700
things. They're going to make it however, the way they want to this,

64
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.680
guy's talking about they're going to live. However,

65
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:06.370
the way they want to on in those things up there,

66
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:09.010
just doing drugs and lightened things on fire. And.

67
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.670
<v 0>And it's like nice living in LA. Like it's like the weather's beautiful.</v>

68
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.510
It's nice.

69
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.190
<v 1>Well, that's why they like to go down to the beach. It's very,</v>

70
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.330
you it's very maintained. Ocean air comes off.

71
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.100
<v 0>I know they have beach fund property. They're putting decks on.</v>

72
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.360
I'm like you guys, this is crazy.

73
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:29.770
You guys are living a better life than bananas, but Venice is, um,

74
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.670
I think they did something where they're you can't loiter or litter or

75
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:37.300
something. So now the homeless people are like cleaning. It's like cleaner.

76
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.940
What the? Or they can arrest them. So now the.

77
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.880
<v 1>Next camp, how about that? Get the out of here. And you know.</v>

78
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.630
<v 0>We got weird.</v>

79
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.890
I noticed the other day there's people that are not quite homeless yet.

80
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.600
That's how, you know, it's like, these are drug addicts.

81
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:53.530
Like it's like people that are not, you see them like leaning into that life.

82
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.370
Or you're like, if they weren't allowed to camp, they would probably.

83
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.430
<v 1>It's just their. The whole thing is dumb.</v>

84
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.780
You can't allow bond streets in the middle of nowhere. You just can't,

85
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.080
you just can't in the middle of the streets, put tents up.

86
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.030
You just can't allow that. You know,

87
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.770
they passed a ban on it here and the today supposed to be the day that the

88
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:15.940
second phase goes.

89
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.560
<v 0>Gonna say, cause I've been,</v>

90
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.260
I can't allow my king to tell me there's no homeless.

91
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.140
<v 1>No there's homeless people. That's just not a lot. Yes,</v>

92
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:26.080
there are no there's 2002.

93
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.060
<v 0>To 3000 small places. You see them.</v>

94
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.430
<v 1>Everywhere. Well, there's a lot. I mean, in terms of.</v>

95
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.690
<v 0>I saw this obese homeless woman bottomless running across,</v>

96
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.570
I mean the amount of vaginas I see in this business,

97
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.480
but she was wearing glasses, wearing a mask. I was like,

98
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.730
I was promised no mass and no homeless people.

99
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:44.290
And I'm getting a mixture of both.
