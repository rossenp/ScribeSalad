WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Girl was filming him 17 year old girl,</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.560
filming him with her camera. 17 year old girl got the George Fuller video. Yeah.

3
00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:11.210
There's a lot of people out there when they're,

4
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.020
there was a 17 year old girls video that we all saw. Interesting. Yeah.

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.350
17 year old girl. And a lot of people had given her a hard time.

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.970
So why didn't you do something a cop, a 70 year old girl, girl,

7
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:27.380
man is killing another grown. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You want her to step in really?

8
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.240
Yeah. It's it is deep state. It's all one long game.

9
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.520
It's four D chess. What are your thoughts.

10
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.170
<v 1>On what has transpired since.</v>

11
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.860
<v 0>That gives me hope. When I see 50,000 people walking through downtown LA all,</v>

12
00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:45.770
all peacefully protesting, that gives me hope.

13
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.520
There's a real chance for a real shift, a real shift,

14
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.380
but it's also,

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.240
here's the thing that bugs me all that money they came with to bail

16
00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:59.420
out all these corporations from the Corona virus pandemic.

17
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.050
Why couldn't they have used that money already to bail out these inner cities?

18
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.110
Why couldn't they have find the money to,

19
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.690
they have all these cities that have this systemic crime and violence and racism

20
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:14.000
has been gone for forever, forever.

21
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.370
Places like Baltimore that are directly up as a result of racist

22
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.090
practices and selling houses. And they don't do anything to fix that.

23
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.170
They never, they never try to stop where the crime is coming from.

24
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.840
They never try to make the, those cities better.

25
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.550
They never try to add community centers and figure out a way to

26
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.240
yeah. To do something. Whether there's no nothing on the table,

27
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.260
it's just crime-ridden neighborhoods. Just how they are like forever.

28
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.810
<v 2>Yeah. Crime doesn't matter until it affects the pockets.</v>

29
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.690
Like if the crime is happening in a poor neighborhood and it's not affecting

30
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.780
somebody money, then nobody cares the second that crime second,

31
00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:52.700
they started breaking windows on fifth avenue.

32
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.040
Now all of a sudden it's more analysis was filed about the Blasio just says,

33
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.670
stand down, let them do it. Yeah. I mean, let me burn themselves out.

34
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.220
We did this in, in the video, but it was really interesting. Cause we had to,

35
00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:05.054
like,

36
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.450
I had to like really process how I felt about it because the looting obviously

37
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:10.010
was wrong and we did that clip on it,

38
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:14.600
but like the writing I understood and I think I can justify,

39
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.790
I was talking to this. I don't,

40
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.900
I won't say his name cause he's a college professor.

41
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:20.990
I don't want to get him in trouble for talking to us and helping us out.

42
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.660
You know, it distinguished gentlemen, where did these rough ends?

43
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:25.700
But he was like, he's like, you know,

44
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:27.860
really savvy with constitutional law and stuff. And he said,

45
00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:30.470
this argument I thought was really interesting when it comes to riots,

46
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:33.260
not looting destruction of property is wrong and you're doing it to benefit

47
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:36.470
yourself when you loot, right. You're taking advantage of the tragedy.

48
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.910
The tragedy is a smoke screen so that you can benefit. Right. And um,

49
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.280
we made an interesting distinction, like any Instagram model.

50
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.010
That's also taking a picture like at the thing,

51
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.600
but not really actually doing anything.

52
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.700
It was like you're alluding to you're enriching yourself.

53
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.960
<v 0>Check the ball. The guys drill, take a bachelor one that we did.</v>

54
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.460
And it was like, that is that's that's losing.

55
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 1>Mill. You're enriching yourself off the tragedy. That's looting. So</v>

56
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.500
peaceful protests, obviously great looting, wrong riding in the middle,

57
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.560
which is destruction of property, right? To like send this message.

58
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.000
And as mark and I were putting together the peace we're talking to this dude and

59
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.940
he made this interesting point. He goes as a citizen,

60
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.720
you have the right to life, Liberty pursuit of happiness, but also property.

61
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.643
Right?

62
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.760
And if the state is destroying the most valuable piece of property that you

63
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.220
have, which is your body, right?

64
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.900
You have to take some sort of recourse in order to protect that, right.

65
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:34.630
You've broken. They broke the social construct, the contract,

66
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.700
they broke it right? When they.

67
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.670
<v 2>Maybe are shooting you or shooting your neighbors, et cetera, you.</v>

68
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.510
<v 1>Priestly protest. If that goes on deaf ears for decades,</v>

69
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.180
what the else are you supposed to do?

70
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.200
Like what you can keep saying peacefully protest. But if it keeps on happening,

71
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.980
there really isn't anything else available to you.

72
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.960
So the next thing is destruction of property. I, I,

73
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.760
I think the best way to do it would probably be destroy public property,

74
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.580
not private property, but if you destroy public property,

75
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.950
you'd actually be taking the high road because that's a response to having life

76
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:12.580
destroyed. You destroy my life. I just up your park.

77
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.063
Who's reasonable here.

78
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.150
<v 0>Well, if it was all coordinated and thought that way. Yes.</v>

79
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.520
And I think what happened in Minnesota in particular,

80
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.070
what happened with the priests, the police precinct,

81
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.850
where they burnt that thing down to the ground. Like that was fascinating,

82
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.920
right? It's when it spreads across the country.

83
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:32.190
And then it just becomes two things. It becomes peaceful protests.

84
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.540
People mad at the cops and then looting. And the looting is different.

85
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:40.530
Unacceptable, unacceptable. What's crazy is along the way,

86
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.540
we get more evidence of police brutality instead of the

87
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.700
cop saying, Hey, this guy killed this guy. It makes us all look terrible.

88
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.950
We are not like that. We're better than that.

89
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.870
Most of them probably did do that. But a lot of them,

90
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.610
they fell back to their cop ways.

91
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.020
They fell back to their ways of smashing shields into people,

92
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.730
running over pedestrians,

93
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.800
all the crazy that we saw shooting a guy in the face with a tear gas canister.

94
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.750
You see that they pepper sprayed him.

95
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.010
And then they shot him with a flash bang right in the face. Really? Oh my God.

96
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.110
It's crazy. He stayed alive. He's getting,

97
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.890
I think Joe Schilling has that on his Instagram page. There's a,

98
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.400
my friend, Joe Schilling was a kickboxer has,

99
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.270
he's been saying for the last six, seven days,

100
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.410
it's not one bad apple. He goes, look at all these cops that are doing.

101
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.740
So he's putting video after video, after video, after video,

102
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:41.310
after video of cops grabbing a woman by the neck,

103
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.070
thrown into the ground slammed. But she's just, just what,

104
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:46.920
what are you saying to me? Why, why do I have to listen to you? He was like, it.

105
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:49.590
Get on the ground. Just grab her may macing.

106
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:53.760
People may see young girls may see people for no reason. Yeah.

107
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.000
This one guy was, was talking to the cops.

108
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.320
So the cops just walk right up to him, pepper spray him, drag him,

109
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:03.320
throw him to the ground. You're taking away his freedom of speech.

110
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.100
The guy's not committing a crime. You're violating the first amendment.

111
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.050
You're violating his constitutional.

112
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.390
<v 1>Rights. Breaking the social club. My friend Joe has.</v>

113
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.420
<v 0>Video after video, after video of this. And I think one of them,</v>

114
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:15.710
I don't know if he has that in there,

115
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.320
but one of them is this dude gets pepper sprayed in the face.

116
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.820
And then they flash bang, bang. I mean, it hits him right off the dome.

117
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.360
It's crazy. So many people got up. Yeah.

118
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.220
<v 1>My, uh, my buddy is a, uh, the captain in the Marines. Right. And, uh,</v>

119
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.980
or he was, and he was in Iraq and uh, he goes,

120
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.400
here's why I have no tolerance whatsoever for police brutality.

121
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.833
When we were in Iraq,

122
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.970
the mission changed and it went from going there and up.

123
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.730
That's how it is when you're trying to win a war to win minds and hearts.

124
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.380
And they explained to us while we're there, we're winning minds and hearts.

125
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.050
And that means you guys are gonna have to take on more risk.

126
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.540
That means you don't just kick in the door and then light it up.

127
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.240
You have to make sure that you're not taken out innocence.

128
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.100
At least try you are taking on more risks. You are risking your life.

129
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.110
So he goes, when I see police brutality, I'm like,

130
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.220
if we can afford that luxury to a country that we're at war with,

131
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.840
how the can we not afford that luxury, Toro and citizens. He goes,

132
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.090
if I'm told to take on more risk than maybe these cops have to take on

133
00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:22.570
more risk and pay them for it, increased payment, increased training,

134
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.100
don't defund, right.

135
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.420
But increase and increase the requirements and really make them heroes.

136
00:07:28.421 --> 00:07:32.230
But he said this. He was like, it seemed to me that the culture at,

137
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.250
of policing in America and I could be wrong. We are talking to cops about it,

138
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:37.570
but this is what he said.

139
00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:41.830
It seems to me is that the idea is no cop ever gets left behind.

140
00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:45.820
No cop ever goes down instead of protecting people at all costs. Right?

141
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.440
You know what I'm saying? I don't know. I mean, poke holes if you do,

142
00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:51.274
if you can.

143
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.200
<v 0>It makes sense. Well, I'm fully in agreement that they need better funding.</v>

144
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.900
It needs to be a higher paying job. That's much more difficult to get.

145
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.290
But when you see cops throw that old man to the ground,

146
00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:03.760
he bounces his head off the ground.

147
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.370
He see the blood come out of his head and no one does anything. Yep.

148
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.660
No one stops him. No one, no one picks the guy up. No one calls an ambulance,

149
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.370
no one checks on them that you can't do that. That's not serving.

150
00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:18.850
That's not protecting you. Just a guy sets up that you didn't like.

151
00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:21.610
So you threw him to the ground. You knew he was old and feeble. You.

152
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.443
<v 1>Knew who he was.</v>

153
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:27.310
And you did it with potentially a confidence of

154
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:30.250
knowing that nothing would happen to you. There wouldn't be any recourse.

155
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.580
And that's that's when people go like, uh, a bad apple ruins a bunch.

156
00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:35.590
And it's like, no, it doesn't. You just remove the bad apple.

157
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.020
But if you can't remove the bad apple, right?

158
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.330
If there's systems in play that don't allow it, then it ruins the bunch.

159
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.640
So if there's one systemic change we make,

160
00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:50.590
maybe it's people get prosecuted or cops will get prosecuted for violating

161
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:55.410
the law because I really would allow not allow. I'd really love.

162
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.090
If we had this relationship with the cost, we were like, you guys are brave,

163
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:01.350
man. Thank you. Like.

164
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.660
Because it is a dangerous job and thankless in a lot of ways, a lot of ways.

165
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:10.230
So it's like, why, how do we shift this? And how much risk do they have to take?

166
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:12.390
Or what change we make so that we can look at them and go,

167
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.030
thank God we got these guys around. Cause football could scary.

168
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.760
<v 0>Systems. She said about your friend being in the Marines.</v>

169
00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:20.870
It's hard to get through bootcamp, man. Yeah. It's hard. It's right. There's a,

170
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.660
there's a, there's a long road that you have to travel to be a Navy seal. Right?

171
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.920
That's how it should be to be a cop man. It should be hard to make it.

172
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.150
And they should weed out the people that are and the people that are sociopaths,

173
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.950
the people that just would be willing to lean their shin on a man's net for

174
00:09:39.951 --> 00:09:42.170
eight and a half minutes. Those people are sick.

175
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.260
You gotta to find those people before they get to the position where they could

176
00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:45.650
do that.

177
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.660
<v 1>To a person. How do you do that? How do you train?</v>

178
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.170
<v 0>You gotta train them. You gotta train, train them.</v>

179
00:09:51.171 --> 00:09:55.970
Like they are the type of people that potentially could kill somebody for the

180
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:59.180
wrong reason. You got to train them. Like you're weeding them out.

181
00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:02.270
Like this is a great honor. And we, you know, we can ship that,

182
00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:06.260
but we have to think about it in terms of allocation of resources,

183
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.410
cops don't get paid enough. Teachers don't get paid enough either though,

184
00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:10.490
and they're not killing their kids.
