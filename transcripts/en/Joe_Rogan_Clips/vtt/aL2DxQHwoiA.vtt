00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. That's always been an, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.110
a motivational thing for me, um,

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.780
to try to be honest with the things that

4
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:16.800
I deal with, the ups and the downs, and, and to, to show my losses,

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.600
to show my injuries, to show,

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.160
to be vocal about the doubts that I have, that, that I still have,

7
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:24.600
that I still deal with it. You know, it's,

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.450
it's easy to look at these people in the spotlight and be like,

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.210
they don't deal with fear. They don't deal with pain.

10
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.350
They don't deal with doubts.

11
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:35.850
They don't deal with feeling like they're inadequate. Um, yeah,

12
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.780
I think I, I think there was a clip or something you were talking, um, about,

13
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.340
uh, the imposter syndrome and I'm like, yeah,

14
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.020
like it doesn't matter how amazing you seemingly are on the

15
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:51.930
outside to all of these people. Like we're all just human beings.

16
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.550
We are all just individuals that have made choices and have steered our lives in

17
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:57.720
certain directions. But,

18
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:00.390
but it's almost like when you make it to a point it's like, oh,

19
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:05.370
they don't deal with this anymore. I deal with the exact same fears,

20
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.560
doubts in all of these things that I dealt with day one to this day,

21
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:12.660
I still deal with them, those same questions.

22
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.720
They've never gone away ever gone away. You know,

23
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.720
you learn how to handle them better and you learn,

24
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.400
you should get strengthened by them, but, but they don't necessarily disappear.

25
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.210
And, and in a lot of times they, they can get worse, um, over the years,

26
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:30.510
because now you're now you're in a position where you're expected to be a

27
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:35.350
certain way. People have people have expectations of you, you know, you're,

28
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:37.440
you're supposed to be this super human being.

29
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.010
Are you supposed to be extremely confident?

30
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.940
Are you supposed to only put on eight plus performances?

31
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:46.470
And you're not allowed to fail? You're not allowed to be human anymore. And, um,

32
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.650
the, when we can, um,

33
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.220
humanized these things and in,

34
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.730
then it lets people realize that they can do it too. You know,

35
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.660
we're not,

36
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.840
we're not necessarily made up of anything different than anybody else. You know,

37
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:05.760
we've just gone through a process of learning and developing and diving off of

38
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:08.880
cliffs that we didn't know where they were going. And that's,

39
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.450
that's what we all have to do. You know, like the people in these spotlights,

40
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.300
they're, they're just human beings. And the more you that you,

41
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.870
you meet them and read about their stories. And, um, you know,

42
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.390
that's why I love with reading autobiographies. Like jeez,

43
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.330
like the things these people have had to overcome, they weren't handed anything.

44
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.620
If more than anything,

45
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:29.880
it was more devastating and detrimental and they've had overcome more than you

46
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:31.890
could possibly imagine.

47
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.160
And it wasn't just given to them.

48
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.220
They had to work and strive and struggle and fail,

49
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.750
fail over and over and over and over and over and over and over again

50
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.390
until they got to where they got to instill.

51
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:49.380
Do they still do they still fail constantly? We all feel constantly.

52
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.480
<v 1>Well, failure is a.</v>

53
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.950
<v 0>Gift. Yeah. Once you make that switch, once you understand it,</v>

54
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.850
and like you can view these losses or these things that happen,

55
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:04.990
or these struggles, as you know, I, I always viewed them as challenges.

56
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.500
I'd be like, are you going to quit? Are you going to give up? I always view,

57
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:12.130
like when I'm tired in the ring or in, on a, on a workout and be like,

58
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.120
you won't quit. I'm like, you, man. You know, I view that, that, that, that,

59
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.780
that voice in your head, you know, that the, that,

60
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.480
that devil that's looming over your shoulders, like, you're,

61
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:26.260
you're gonna quit your failure. I'm like, you know what, you. I'm not quitting.

62
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:28.330
I'm never going to quit. I'm never going to stop.

63
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.810
And there's nothing you can do. So keep talking, but I'm going forward.

64
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.800
<v 2>Is there a time, will you ever get past that?</v>

65
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.150
And you understand that you're never going to quit and instead just concentrate

66
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:44.200
on the task at hand, or do you think that, that, that voice,

67
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.610
that you're duking it out with, that you take that to the grave?

68
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.610
<v 0>You definitely take it to the grave. You,</v>

69
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.460
I think we feel like we get farther away from it and we get stronger and we get

70
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:02.410
more confident, but it never gets far. You never get farther away from it.

71
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.890
You know, like, like I compare to my alcoholism. It's like,

72
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.980
I could go 10 years without ever drinking again.

73
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.160
But all it takes is one bad day. Yeah.

74
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.320
We are all one bad day of being in the worst situations ever.

75
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:19.630
And that's why it's so important to, you know,

76
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:22.260
you look at people on the streets and things like that, but like, you know,

77
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.590
how easy that can happen?

78
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.450
Like how many bad days or bad situations would it take to turn a

79
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.690
successful person into that? Not a lot. Like,

80
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:36.190
we're all just balancing on this very delicate thing that,

81
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.720
uh, you know, it seems like we're all strong and safe and all this, but like,

82
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.830
well,

83
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.690
when the power goes out and you know that the world's going to go to hell like

84
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:50.680
that, we just pretend like it's not because that's how we get through the day.

85
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.370
So, but yeah,

86
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.170
like to your point is I don't think we're ever any farther away

87
00:04:56.171 --> 00:05:00.700
from those things that held us back before we get stronger and we learn how to

88
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:02.240
process them. And we, we,

89
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.550
we understand it more and we understand that the series of things that we need

90
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.930
that will take us down that road or get us farther away from it, but it,

91
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:14.470
but it's just right there, you know? And, um,

92
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.690
no matter how much we learn and develop,

93
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.000
I think sometimes that makes it even more scarier.

94
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.530
It's like the higher you get the farther you have to fall. Um, and,

95
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.960
and it's the more you can be aware of that, that,

96
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:33.010
that you're never going to get farther away from it.

97
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:37.360
You always need to be diligent that you always need to do things that are going

98
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:40.330
to steer you in a more positive way. Um,

99
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.960
I think that that is like the goal to, to not falling back on that.

100
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.930
I think the worst thing that we can do is have this belief that we're

101
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:53.040
past it. That's never going to happen again. I'm,

102
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:56.650
I'm not an alcoholic anymore. I'm not a drug addict anymore.

103
00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:01.070
I'm not depressed anymore. Um, that's, what's, that's,

104
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:04.760
what's helped me is, is I, I did think I,

105
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.750
one day I would be so far away from it that it would never be a thought anymore,

106
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.050
but, but by knowing that it's always right there,

107
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.710
that keeps me sharp. You know, it's like that, that,

108
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.600
that you need that thing to keep you at your best or else. We start to get lazy.

109
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.341
It's that, that,

110
00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:25.130
that same concept of having people that push you in the gym or in life, or,

111
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:27.890
or et cetera, if you don't have somebody pushing you,

112
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:30.080
you can only ever push yourself so hard.

113
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.480
You might think you're pushing yourself really hard,

114
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.220
but you don't really have a basis for where that is. Um, so like for myself,

115
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.580
I always run my sprints on a treadmill because the treadmill doesn't lie.

116
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.790
This is how fast you're going. And this is how long you're doing it.

117
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.680
Now you can go out on the street and say, oh,

118
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:47.570
I was going as fast as humanly possible.

119
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.960
You're always going to hold yourself back a little bit. You know,

120
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:53.630
that's just the way we are as human beings, you know, that,

121
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:58.250
that safety net that we have ingrained in us to not go over that

122
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:02.150
edge. But if you're not pushing that edge, you're not developing in.

123
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.050
You're always holding yourself back a little bit, a little bit.

124
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.970
And no matter how hard you think you're going,

125
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.160
or how honest do you think you're being,

126
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:12.500
unless you have somebody that's society,

127
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.880
it's so important to have people in your lives that, that,

128
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.250
that keep you in that sharpened state, you know, that, that, that,

129
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.230
that, uh, that question you, that, uh, that pushed you and, um, you know, like,

130
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:27.830
like for me, Jean has always been that way for me, that person that, like,

131
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.270
she's not gonna look, look at my, let me. You know, keep me honest, you know,

132
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:36.320
sometimes to an extreme extent and like, give me a little bit of a break here,

133
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:40.160
but, you know, it's like that person that, um,

134
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.350
that pushes you and it's uncomfortable to be pushed and you don't want to be

135
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:46.520
pushed. I want to relax.

136
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.970
I don't want to like sit on the beach and drink beers and do all these things,

137
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:54.620
but is that going to help me get to a better place in my

138
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:55.454
life,

139
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.540
a better place that my mind and my heart now that's going to allow me to just

140
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.020
like,

141
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.020
be a lazy piece of and just drift off and die and be no benefit to

142
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.070
myself or anyone else for that matter.

143
00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:11.780
So as uncomfortable as it is to be pushed and as uncomfortable as it is to be

144
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.710
pressured into, to do want to Excel, um,

145
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.270
we all need those things. You either improving your, or you're declining.

146
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.830
And I think that's such an important thing to keep in mind.

147
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.390
Like it's only one of the other, there is no in the middle,

148
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.370
it's like the concept of balance.

149
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.270
You never find a balance because once you find it, you lose it.

150
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.560
You're always jumping on both sides of this line too much,

151
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.440
or too little. You're either going too fast or too slow.

152
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.980
And we're trying to find that perfect balance of everything.

153
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:50.120
And you never can find it, but knowing that you never can find,

154
00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:54.890
it forces you to be diligent about all these things and to constantly

155
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.530
be trying to find it in the more you try to find that the more you're going to

156
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:02.850
develop and learn ways that that aren't the right way.

157
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.280
And then finding what, uh, what does work.
