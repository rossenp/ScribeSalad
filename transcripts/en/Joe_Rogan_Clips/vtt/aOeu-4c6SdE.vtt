00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 1>Experience. This book right here. I had this author the other day. Um,</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.400
his name's Sam, Sam, Gwen, uh, S se Gwen. He wrote this book, uh, empire,

4
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:14.000
the summer moon. It's amazing, man. It's about the, uh,

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.160
Manches and, uh, it's about, uh, the, the war they had with,

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.190
uh, like Texas and Oklahoma and went on forever.

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.550
Like Manches were the last holdout against the American settlers and events

8
00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:31.270
against the soldiers. The Manches were the last holdouts. They were the last,

9
00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:32.670
like truly wild tribe.

10
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.030
And they were running the planes for like hundreds and hundreds of years of

11
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:38.550
horses and. But here's the thing, man, this,

12
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.620
this book it's taken place in the mid 18 hundreds to the late 18 hundreds,

13
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.940
which is like that's. So recently it's so recent.

14
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.380
<v 0>Yeah. The, the, the, the giant rock from Egypt came over in 1888.</v>

15
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.100
<v 1>Yes. Came over in 1888. Right? It was probably older than that,</v>

16
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.930
but these people were essentially living

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.650
a nomadic stone, age, life,

18
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.610
everything was leather and sin and Buffalo tendons.

19
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:13.290
They used to make their bows and their bow strings.

20
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.810
They made their own bows and arrows outta wood,

21
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.290
and the arrow heads were made outta Flint.

22
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:24.080
They would chip away expertly and they would run around following

23
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:27.600
Buffalo and just shoot 'em with bows and arrows and SP 'em or run 'em off

24
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.960
cliffs. They would run 'em off cliffs that stamp peeds they'd get to the bottom.

25
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.760
And there were sometimes so many bodies down in the bottom of these Buffalo

26
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.120
jumps that the rotting would cause combustion and they would blow

27
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:40.390
up.

28
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.350
They would explode and catch fire just because there's hundreds and hundreds

29
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:49.630
of dead rotting, Buffalo on top of each other, cuz they can't eat that many.

30
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.190
Like say if you have a tribe, you know,

31
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:54.910
a tribe of hundred 50 people and you kill a thousand Buffalo,

32
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.670
like how many of those are you gonna eat? You can't really eat all of 'em.

33
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.460
So they would just let them sit there and they would literally start save

34
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.020
wildfires cuz they would burst into flames.

35
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.860
<v 0>I saw bison when I was driving from salt lake city to uh,</v>

36
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.763
some other gig.

37
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.660
<v 1>I should be clear. I don't think they started massive wildfires.</v>

38
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.420
I think they started a massive Buffalo fire. You know the,

39
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.060
the fires of the dead bodies.

40
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.370
I don't know if there was like to burn outside there. There must be though.

41
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:28.490
Right? Wait, it's probably grass and stuff on the ground.

42
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.090
Oh that's where the Buffalo were eating. But it's at the bottom of a cliff.

43
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.250
I don't know what was down there. But the uh, you know,

44
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.730
they had these areas that they would call Buffalo jumps where they would just

45
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:41.890
circle 'em on this hot and circle 'em on this high. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.480
Yell at 'em these Buffalo. Ooh where? And they just off the cliff, everybody.

47
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.840
And, and by the time you're running to the cliff and you realize like,

48
00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:52.440
oh my God, this is a cliff. You try to hit the brakes.

49
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.280
There's a thousand fat behind you. Pushed you off the cliff.

50
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.573
Wow.

51
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.680
Imagine being the first Buffalo to get like really close he's like rot up to the

52
00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:06.960
cliff. He's like, oh, oh, oh. Oh. He turns.

53
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.913
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

54
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.200
<v 1>The dumbest giant beast on earth.</v>

55
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.390
The dumbest elephants are smart. Right? Buffalos are so dumb.

56
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.653
They just run it.

57
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.430
Buffalos are like no disrespect to the Buffalo.

58
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.150
But they talk in the book about how they would shoot Buffalo.

59
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.510
And that like everybody had like disdain for how dumb the Buffalo were.

60
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.350
I think it probably made it easy for them to almost wipe 'em out to the point of

61
00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:39.380
extinction. But if you shoot Buffalo below,

62
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.060
one goes down and the other ones look and they go right back to eating and then

63
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:45.580
another one goes down and the other look and they go back to eating.

64
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.300
Like you have to literally go out.

65
00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:51.220
They were saying and yell at them to get them to move. Yeah.

66
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.660
That was the only way you got 'em away from the ones that you shot.

67
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.500
Cuz you wanted to eat the ones you shot. So when the ones went down,

68
00:03:57.501 --> 00:03:59.420
they were like, get outta here, get the.

69
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.090
<v 3>Right. I was gonna hang around and eat while my friends died.</v>

70
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.010
Bunch of.

71
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.210
<v 1>Dumies. But meanwhile, it's amazing animal, you know, it's like the,</v>

72
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.170
if like you had a, you were gonna say that, um,

73
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.530
God had a plan to provide people with the perfect

74
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.280
for hunting. So what wants you to be eating healthy?

75
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.480
So I'm gonna give you millions of this enormous animal

76
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.160
that doesn't move. When you shoot its friends, &lt;laugh&gt;

77
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.360
literally fill the planes with these things. It just,

78
00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:44.310
people were just such cuts that they killed. 'em all people were so gross.

79
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.310
Cuz the buffalos are so easy to kill that they just killed. 'em all they killed.

80
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.790
They would have mountains of bones, man. There's a Buffalo jump.

81
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.670
This was had the bone.

82
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.230
<v 4>Bonfire shelter is what it's called.</v>

83
00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:56.830
It had two big events in history where it happened.

84
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.150
<v 1>Here. Right? So they called the bonfire because uh,</v>

85
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.540
all that black and apparently was because of the fires from the buffalos hitting

86
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.500
and bursting the flames. And some of those Buffalo jumps, they say to this day,

87
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.100
you can find, uh, arrowheads, if you go wandering around the area, cuz you know,

88
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.620
it's so populated by uh, native Americans at the time.

89
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.500
But the Manche dude, I think this is, uh, is this Buffalo jump in,

90
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.210
in um, Montana? This one's in Texas. Oh in Texas. Yeah. Yeah.

91
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:30.210
So Texas with the Comanches. There's other native American tribes there too.

92
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:32.490
But a lot of it was the Comanches, which is in this book.

93
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.330
A lot of this book takes place in Texas. It's amazing dude.

94
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.210
And so scary. There's these buffalos falling down, hitting a rock.

95
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.960
Look that a large rock shelter was a scene of a series of prehistoric

96
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.200
Buffalo jumps, native American hunting hunters, ingeniously, stampeded,

97
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.960
herds of bison over the edge of a cliff,

98
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.800
overhanging the shelter in a narrow box canyon that empties into the Rio

99
00:05:57.801 --> 00:05:59.480
Grande near Lang tree, Texas,

100
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.560
the Bisons plunged to their deaths on a rock pile at the opening of the shelter

101
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.760
and their are historically documented accounts of Northern Plains,

102
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:12.440
Indian groups using this effective if indiscriminate technique of killing

103
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.520
bison. But you also have to remember back then,

104
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.750
there was so many that if they thought they killed a couple extra thousand,

105
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.790
they didn't give a. They were everywhere.

106
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.950
There were so many of them and here's why that happened.

107
00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:24.990
Here's what gets even weirder.

108
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.630
They think that that happened because people got smallpox

109
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.230
and it killed like 90% of the native American population.

110
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.300
So when the Europeans came over in the 15 hundreds and the,

111
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.540
whatever it was when Cortez came over here, what was that?

112
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:43.820
Was that the 15 hundreds. Anyway,

113
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.700
when those guys came over and brought smallpox,

114
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.820
it just wiped out like most of the population.

115
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.780
So the Buffalo who really their major predator was people,

116
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.660
especially native Americans,

117
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.530
especially once they figured out how to ride horses, but now those dudes died.

118
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.970
And so the Buffalo went ham just up a storm.

119
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.210
And then there was millions of them, man, this an author, Dan Flores.

120
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.290
It has this whole, uh, paper that he wrote on it. Was it called bison, ecology,

121
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.490
bison diplomacy. I think it's called that's right. Something along those lines.

122
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.680
But it's crazy. There's you hear about the fate of the bison in,

123
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.400
in north America? I mean it's like the most iconic animal.

124
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.240
When you really think about the old west.

125
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.280
If there was one animal you think about the old west, maybe it'd be horses,

126
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.880
but more likely it'd be a bison. Yeah.

127
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.640
<v 0>Why did they call Buffalo? Buffalo? The city of Buffalo. Good.</v>

128
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.640
<v 1>Question.</v>

129
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.430
Cause a bison is not technically the same as a Buffalo because.

130
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.870
<v 0>Those people don't move when they should too. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

131
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.870
<v 1>He set up a. He snuck that in. Good &lt;laugh&gt; it's good timing too.</v>

132
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:52.870
You had a good pause there. I.

133
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.310
<v 0>I genuinely curious. It's good. Good pause. It seems like I.</v>

134
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.660
<v 1>I don't know. May maybe there was a lot of Buffalo back then. There's Buffalo.</v>

135
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:04.620
Everywhere. They were like elk elk were in literally every state.

136
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.220
Pretty much. We, we, people were gross, man. We killed everything.

137
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.373
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

138
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.980
<v 4>The, the quick question of what's the difference is, uh, contrary to the song.</v>

139
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:18.860
Buffalo did not roam in American west.

140
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.490
They're indigenous to south Asia and Africa. Buffalo, Buffalo. Well,

141
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.850
bison are found in north America.

142
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.490
<v 1>Part. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

143
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.650
They call it American Buffalo, but it's a bison. It's a different animal.

144
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.490
The Buffalo that you get in, um, like Asia and Asian water, Buffalo.

145
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.050
Those are the ones they get that are in Australia.

146
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.800
They brought those over to a and dude, they got a mess over there.

147
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.360
There's nothing that kills them.

148
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.840
So they're just all over the place and they destroy the land. They're so big.

149
00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:52.040
There's so many of them and they're wild.

150
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.360
They even have wild domestic cows that grow outta control and the males

151
00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:00.640
become like super ferocious. Like, you know, like a bull, like a bull.

152
00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:01.840
Doesn't want you riding them. Yeah.

153
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.960
Well they have a thing in Australia called scrub bowls.

154
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.520
And what it is is a domestic cattle like domestic cattle,

155
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.720
but that went wild like generations ago, many, many generations ago.

156
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.440
So now they're just wild animals. The,

157
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:19.230
that happened to have enormous horns and weigh 2000 pounds and

158
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:22.710
freak out if they see people. So they see people, if you you're too close,

159
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.350
they think you're closing and try to kill 'em they just you up. Oh.

160
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.710
That is this uh, it's crocodile CRO bun.

161
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.430
I think that's a water Buffalo though though.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.580

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.980

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:44.940
this is crazy. He's gonna walk up to the thing. Yeah. Like he, he knows voodoo.

165
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.780
He put his hand on it and it just dropped. Yeah. In the real world,

166
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.900
he would be dead as. That thing would just smash him.

167
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:59.050
He's just touch your head. Hi. I just touch your head. Hi.

168
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.770
And then the bull just gave in and went down. Wow.

169
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.530
Yeah. So that dude, you know,

170
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:14.130

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.360

172
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:22.440

173
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:27.120
Those big, giant poles and then big scrub bulls, wild domestic cup.
