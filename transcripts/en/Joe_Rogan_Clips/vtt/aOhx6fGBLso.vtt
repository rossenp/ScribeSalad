00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 2>So this is another, uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.560
thing that I point out in the book is that we're never bored anymore. Ah,

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.600
so as we evolved boredom is this evolutionary discomfort that basically told us

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.880
whatever you're spending your time on right now.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.280
It's not an efficient use of your time. So go find something else.

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.310
Now in the path, this would be like,

8
00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:23.110
let's say you're picking berries from a Bush.

9
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.950
You've picked the easiest to pick ones. Well,

10
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.310
if we didn't have this cube of boredom,

11
00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:30.710
we'd be like reaching into the very back for the berries that are hard to pick,

12
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:30.991
but it,

13
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:33.950
they become successively harder to pick because we've picked all these different

14
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:37.030
ones, right. Boredom would kick on and be like, Hey, your,

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.940
your return on your time invested has worn thin move on to Bush. Right.

16
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.020
But nowadays with this influx of media,

17
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.020
we have people spend 11 hours a day engaging with digital media.

18
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.860
<v 0>Is that real? Yeah. 11. And that's the average.</v>

19
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.860
So what you want to hear an even crazier thing. Yeah. Okay. So I'm a,

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.340
I'm a professor at university of Nevada,

21
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.130
Las Vegas into one of the classes I teach is an intro class.

22
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.410
So it's got about 150 students and some media class I teach in the journalism

23
00:01:08.411 --> 00:01:11.650
department first day of class. I'll talk about how,

24
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.090
just how things have changed with media. You know,

25
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:17.690
it's like we live 2.5 million years with no media in our lives and now it's

26
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:20.130
become our lives. And then I will ask, all right,

27
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.930
I want everyone to pull out your phone, right?

28
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.920
I want you to look at your screen time, tell me how much you have,

29
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.440
who thinks they have the highest and we'll start to go through people.

30
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.200
I've had people, you know, seven hours, 45 minutes, eight hours, 50 minutes,

31
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.440
nine hours, 16 minutes. It's like,

32
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.840
that's your entire day all on that cell phone. Right?

33
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.750
So days when we have this discomfort of boredom kick in,

34
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.070
we have a super easy escape from it. Right, right. We're not forced to be like,

35
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:54.710
okay, what am I doing with my time? Is there something better I could be doing?

36
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.150
We just pull out our phone and you see this, right.

37
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.750
Anytime people have one moment of solitude or inactivity, it's like, oh,

38
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.340
might as well just check my phone. It's brutal when you see people on dates.

39
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.340
Oh yeah. You're not even talking to each other.

40
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:10.940
They're just looking at each other's phones. Yeah. Go, wow. People at dinner.

41
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.700
It's like, yeah. It's like, you're in front of an actual person. Yeah.

42
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.700
And you prefer to communicate in digital with someone who's not even there.

43
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.380
Totally. And, um, what's interesting.

44
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.890
And about boredom is when, oftentimes when boredom would kick on, we would go,

45
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.690
uh, inward sort of mind wander and mind wandering.

46
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.570
It gives you your brain some time to like reset and revive.

47
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.050
Whereas anytime you're focused on the outside world,

48
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.290
your brain is actively processing information.

49
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.400
So this is kind of like in the book, I compare it to lifting a weight.

50
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.400
When you're having a conversation, looking at your phone, watching a screen,

51
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.840
whatever you're doing. If you're focusing on the outside world,

52
00:02:52.841 --> 00:02:55.840
your brain is working and its lifting. When you go inward,

53
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.920
your brain goes into this default mode network, which is like a rest period.

54
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.360
Right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So now, because every time we're bored,

55
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.560
we just pull out that screen and focus more.

56
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.360
Our brains are just constantly being worked and overworked and overworked.

57
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.480
And this is, uh, associated with just burnout, uh, anxiety, cetera.

58
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.623
<v 1>Yeah. It's,</v>

59
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.910
there's some real benefits to boredom in terms of creativity as well. Like oh,

60
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.590
totally. Boredom is really good for coming up with new ideas. Yeah.

61
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.190
<v 0>And there's actually research behind this.</v>

62
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:29.030
They've done studies where they'll have,

63
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.590
they'll have people watch something really boring, like a video of people,

64
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.790
folding laundry, just like they bore the out of these participants.

65
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.180
And then they have them, uh, come up with, uh,

66
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:43.780
take these different creativity tests that scientists use and the people who are

67
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:46.820
bored come up with more better, uh,

68
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.500
solutions and responses than the people who had been stimulated the whole time.

69
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.380
And you think about this, I mean, just in terms of anecdotes from creators,

70
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.283
it's like,

71
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.890
you need time to just sit and be with yourself and have these weird

72
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.810
ideas bubble to the surface. If you never have that,

73
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.570
you're not letting that the weird stuff come out, you know? I mean,

74
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.611
I'm have like,

75
00:04:07.611 --> 00:04:11.570
do you experience this when you're trying to think of stuff in your own work?

76
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.410
<v 1>Yeah. You have to have discomfort. The worst thing that could ever happen to me,</v>

77
00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:18.610
if I'm writing is to just open the browser and start,

78
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.960
let me just Google this for real quick and see, oh, it's like,

79
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:24.880
I'll play little games with myself. Like, I'll be in the middle of writing.

80
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.240
I'm like, what does that mean? Really?

81
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.640
And then I'll Google it and like shut the up and get, get back to work. Yeah.

82
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:32.960
Because like, I'm just being distracted. I'm just distracting myself.

83
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.480
And sometimes I'm allow myself a couple of minutes of distraction before I get

84
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.150
mad, but really I shouldn't allow myself and I should just working if,

85
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.470
and sometimes people say, I can't write,

86
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.790
I just stare at the screen and nothing comes down. I'm like, yeah,

87
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:48.190
that's what's supposed to happen. Yeah. That's how it works, man.

88
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.550
You supposed to stare at the screen. Yeah.

89
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.550
And then you just write some nonsense and eventually something good will come

90
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.311
out of that. Yeah.

91
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:58.390
But if you just bail because you don't like the staring at the screen part and

92
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:01.420
nothing's coming out, guess what? You're never gonna write anything.

93
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.340
Congratulations. So then you'll be at the whim of whatever, random,

94
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.380
spontaneous creativity just pops into your head throughout the day. Yeah.

95
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.420
And sometimes you'll get some and sometimes you won't. Yeah.

96
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.900
But Pressfield talks about that in the war of art. Have you read that book?

97
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.940
<v 0>Uh, I haven't read.</v>

98
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.380
<v 1>That book. It's I've heard about it. Very small book, but it's really good.</v>

99
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.330
It's great for writers. And it he's basically says he,

100
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.650
he talks about the muse as if the muse is a real thing and he's like,

101
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.050
treat it like it's a real thing,

102
00:05:30.051 --> 00:05:33.250
treat it like you're a professional and you're there to summon the muse.

103
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.570
And if you just show up every day and do that work, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

104
00:05:35.571 --> 00:05:36.404
it will come,

105
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.890
it will come to you and it will bestow upon you these creative ideas.

106
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.600
But if you don't do that, if you don't sit down and be discomfort, uh,

107
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.240
to be uncomfortable, rather, rather it won't happen. And in this day and age,

108
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.560
like you said, we're so accustomed to having our,

109
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.920
any boredom alleviated by our phone. Yeah.

110
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.760
<v 0>So in the book too, I talk about, you hear all this stuff,</v>

111
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.560
that's like break up with your phone. Less time on your phone.

112
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.280
Here are a thousand different ways to use your phone less. Yes.

113
00:06:08.281 --> 00:06:12.480
That is important. But the problem is, is a lot of times when people go, okay,

114
00:06:12.481 --> 00:06:15.160
I'm gonna use my phone less. So they put their phone in, you know,

115
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.550
a safe or whatever, weird habit they've developed,

116
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.790
but then they go watch Netflix.

117
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.670
It's like your brain doesn't know the difference between the screen on your

118
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:24.230
phone and the screen on your TV. Right.

119
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:28.030
The point is that you need to remove yourself from this outside media.

120
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.550
That's totally just weaved its way into your life. Like.

121
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.270
<v 1>Stimulating you with nothing. Yeah.</v>

122
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.540
<v 0>It's yeah. The switch from phone to Netflix is like going,</v>

123
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.540
I'm quitting smoking,

124
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.060
but I'm gonna go buy some red man and just pack that in real hard, you know?

125
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.380
Yeah. Same thing.

126
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.460
<v 1>We're all aware that there's this immense gravity that comes from the digital</v>

127
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.500
world. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's, it's immense.

128
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.780
It's just constantly pulling you in with new content and new distractions.

129
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.330
And this is one of 'em this thing that you and I are on. That's it's ironic.

130
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.970
This is one of &lt;laugh&gt; we're talking about what we actually are doing right now,

131
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.930
but they, you know, they pull you,

132
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.890
they pull you and we all know that it's probably not the best way to

133
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:16.370
live, but it's so hard to break. Yeah. The addiction.

134
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.880
<v 0>I mean, it's, it's, it's amazing. Right?</v>

135
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.600
It's amazing that I can pull up the podcast and listen to almost

136
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:26.680
whoever I want their thoughts and get these new ideas. But at the same time,

137
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:29.160
it's like, if that's all you're spending your time doing, yeah.

138
00:07:29.161 --> 00:07:31.520
There's some downsides we need to offset it. That I, you know,

139
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.880
I don't necessarily think the answer is to go live in the woods in Alaska for

140
00:07:35.881 --> 00:07:36.714
the rest of your life.

141
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.510
Although that'd be pretty cool if you did more power to you,

142
00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:40.990
but figuring out like, how do we,

143
00:07:40.991 --> 00:07:44.630
how do we balance this all and have these moments where we have, you know,

144
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.870
solitude go more inward and aren't as stimulated. So one thing that, you know,

145
00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:53.710
after I am standing out there in solitude, when I get home,

146
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.430
I start researching, you know, what are the benefits of solitude?

147
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.540
Because we know that the data should owes that being, uh, lonely.

148
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.460
Isn't good for us, but there's the difference between loneliness and solitude,

149
00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:10.140
like solitude is electing to be by yourself and using that time for sort of

150
00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:14.180
introspection and the scientists that I talked to, they said, yeah,

151
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:14.981
you really need this.

152
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:18.940
Because a lot of times people are more conductor circuits and they,

153
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.450
they don't do well when they're alone at all.

154
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.810
This is part of the reason we have such a loneliness problem.

155
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.410
But if you can like build this, build this capacity, be alone,

156
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.210
they call it like that can serve you well in a long time.

157
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.130
And it also breeds deeper thinking creativity. I mean, it's like,

158
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:36.890
there's a reason that thousands of years of religious tradition,

159
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.440
they have people who go and spend this time alone out in nature. I mean,

160
00:08:41.441 --> 00:08:46.240
Jesus was in the desert for 40 days. The Buddha exited the palace gates,

161
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.120
you know, and spent a bunch of time alone and in solitude, um,

162
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.120
even Abraham Lincoln used solitude and for all his,

163
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.760
a lot of his writing and stuff like that.

164
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.800
