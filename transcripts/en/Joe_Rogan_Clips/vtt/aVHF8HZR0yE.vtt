00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What you are, the Lance Armstrong of skating.</v>

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.040
And th this is what I mean, I don't mean that you got caught doing drugs.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.450
What I mean is that you're the guy like when people talk about professional

4
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:15.390
skaters, Tony Hawk, like, I don't know,

5
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:19.140
a single bike rider other than Lance Armstrong. I mean, Greg,

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.300
there was another guy Greg Lamond. Yeah. See,

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.650
but I can't remember him real quick, but for you it's,

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.550
that's gotta be strange because like you were the first and you are for sure.

9
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:31.920
The most prominent, like, how did you pull that off?

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.960
<v 1>Uh, I th well,</v>

11
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.570
mostly longevity by surviving the first wave of skating in

12
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:40.404
the eighties.

13
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.560
It was actually kind of the second wave of skating in the eighties where I had a

14
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:47.490
pretty good career. Um, I was doing really well in competition,

15
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.470
especially in the, in the mid to late eighties.

16
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.780
And then as skating kind of went underground,

17
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:55.830
I never quit and started my own skate company in 1992.

18
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.610
And then when the X games came into play,

19
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:02.580
I was still kind of on top of my game. I did really well there.

20
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:04.830
And I think a lot of people carried over my name from that,

21
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.580
that first round where they were skaters in the eighties and now maybe their

22
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.980
kids skate. And they're like, oh, I remember that guy. You know, and,

23
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:13.620
and their kids are watching me on the X games.

24
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.250
And then when our video game came out in 1999, that's when everything changed.

25
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.040
<v 0>Well, you were famous for skating when you were like 17 or something. Right?</v>

26
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.330
<v 1>Uh, I turned pro when I was 14. Yeah. And then, but I mean that,</v>

27
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.160
when I say that, it seems it might seem magical,

28
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.630
but at the time skating was this little tiny scene. So when I first,

29
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.770
when I literally went,

30
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:41.520
pro I filled was filling out an entry form to a competition.

31
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.460
And I had already reached the top of the amateur ranks.

32
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.460
And there was a little box that said pro and a little boxes that am.

33
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.030
So I clicked, I checked the pro box and that was it.

34
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.620
That was pro no one was offering me a contract, no one had champagne.

35
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:58.620
You know what I mean? And, and like, my coach was, I'll never forget,

36
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.790
Stacy Peralta was looking over my shoulder and I checked it and he's like, okay.

37
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.440
<v 0>That's it. That was it. Yeah. Wow. But you had a coach, a.</v>

38
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.740
<v 1>We had it, we had a team manager. Um, he,</v>

39
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:14.190
he's the one who put me on what is now considered the bones brigade,

40
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.870
but the company was pal Peralta.

41
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.830
And that was sort of the elite crew of skaters in the, in the early eighties.

42
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.290
Um, and I was the super young newbie on the team,

43
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.930
like super skinny dorky kid.

44
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:31.740
And a lot of the guys that were established were like this guy, really?

45
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.150
<v 0>What do you, what is that Jamie? Oh, is that you that's.</v>

46
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.560
<v 1>Me at age 17.</v>

47
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.490
<v 0>Wow. Time flies</v>

48
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.220
freak you out. Look at it. Then.

49
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.320
<v 1>I think it's, I mean, I see that photo making the rounds, so, uh, it's cool.</v>

50
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:54.180
I'm actually, so by the time I turned 17,

51
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.330
I was kind of doing well in competition and, and making money.

52
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.500
So I'm literally sitting of my house that I bought while I was a senior in high

53
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:03.550
school, in that photo,

54
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.520
which was a challenge, trying to stay focused on schoolwork.

55
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.820
When you have the party house, that's.

56
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.340
<v 0>Crazy. You own a house.</v>

57
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.900
<v 1>Yeah. Wow. A duplex. But yeah, it was my own place, but you know,</v>

58
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:22.150
like when you're a senior, oh,

59
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.030
this so-and-so's parents are out of town parties at his house.

60
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:29.380
Like my parents were never home, so everyone's going to my house.

61
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.360
<v 0>But what did your parents think about you buying a house? Was.</v>

62
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.790
<v 1>My dad's idea really?</v>

63
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.980
Because he saw me really not understanding finances

64
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:42.790
or, or how lucky I was. And I was just throwing money away, you know,

65
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:47.200
and cars and trips and sharper image and just the most ridiculous

66
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.550
things. And then he's like, I really think you should invest your money. Did.

67
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.590
<v 0>You get a massage chair, sharper image, massage chair out of those?</v>

68
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.000
<v 1>No, but I bought between, okay, this is a long story,</v>

69
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.000
but my sister and I went in on a tanning bed together.

70
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.490
It was like, I used it once she is. Cause she,

71
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.480
it was helpful to her skin. Am I going to say why? But you know,

72
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:13.090
she had a legitimate reason for it, but I was like, yeah, tanning bed.

73
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.210
Like never going to go tan, but you know, you've got to have it.

74
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.840
Where did you live at the time in, uh, north county, San Diego Carlsbad.

75
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.330
<v 0>You don't need a tanning bed. Exactly.</v>

76
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.220
<v 1>Yeah. And that was it. The first time I went, I was like,</v>

77
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:25.630
why am I laying in that? I can just go to the.

78
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.870
<v 0>350 Days a year. Yeah, that's.</v>

79
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.410
<v 1>Hilarious. But, um, I mean, it's it almost, you know,</v>

80
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:36.280
when you're that age and you're, you're doing well. You think that some other,

81
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.560
some like a status symbol, did.

82
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.390
<v 0>You sleep in that house by yourself when you were.</v>

83
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.950
<v 1>17? No. I had three roommates.</v>

84
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.270
<v 0>Oh God.</v>

85
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.010
<v 1>That's all crazy. Man. One was a little bit older. He was a good friend of mine,</v>

86
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:50.920
pro skater. And he was the only guy that actually had a job.

87
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.970
And he was tortured for like two years.

88
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.770
Cause we were up super late all the time making noise and you'd have to get up

89
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:04.660
at 7:00 AM, go to work. He was doing, he was doing, uh, line stripping, like,

90
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.420
um, back when you'd have to, uh,

91
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.470
color separate for magazines and stuff like that. Um,

92
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.670
bummer for him. Such a bummer. Yeah. And still like,

93
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:17.380
he's still trying to make it as a pro skater,

94
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.900
but clearly he had to get a job and.

95
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.760
<v 0>It must be in an exhausted too. He would.</v>

96
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.010
<v 1>Leave these kind of nasty notes for us in the morning.</v>

97
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.410
<v 0>So when you in high school look to your senior year in high school,</v>

98
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:33.430
you had your own place. Did you do any schoolwork at all? I did.

99
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.263
<v 1>Yeah. Um.</v>

100
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.180
<v 0>He must've been like, well, this. I can already buy a house.</v>

101
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.280
<v 1>I don't know. I think it was more because my parents valued education.</v>

102
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:46.990
My mom was an educator. She was actually like taught in a, um,

103
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.530
college. Oh, wow. So I,

104
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:54.670
I felt that I was going to be a disappointment if I didn't at least graduate

105
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:58.340
high school. And I was always pretty advanced,

106
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:00.440
like I was in the gifted program and you know,

107
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:03.860
I was a grade ahead and a lot of the subjects. So by the time I was a senior,

108
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.060
I only needed four classes to graduate. Um,

109
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.830
so I went to school until lunchtime every day and then I was out. Oh, wow. Um,

110
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.090
and then I got my diploma and my dad not

111
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.100
strongly suggested I go look at colleges. And so just to humor him,

112
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.350
I went and looking at like a, you know,

113
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:27.710
a city college in our area and looked around the campus. I was like, oh,

114
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.450
that's cool. I guess. Sure.

115
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.790
And I just knew that it was my opportunity to really chase this and to

116
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:37.010
embrace all these opportunities I was getting. I mean, I was,

117
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.170
I was literally out of high school,

118
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.600
onto a Hollywood movie set gleaming the cube. Oh, that's right.

119
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.250
So I was out just graduated high school and then moved to north Hollywood

120
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.690
for two months.

121
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.420
<v 0>I was like, what? 86.</v>

122
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.980
<v 1>It was, it was shot in 88, I think. 87.</v>

123
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.800
<v 0>Wow. God, I'm remembering that now. Wow.</v>

124
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.400
What a,

125
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.350
what a crazy way to go from being a young kid to like right

126
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:11.600
into your manhood. It's.

127
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.220
<v 1>It's deceiving though. I mean, we,</v>

128
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:15.740
especially when you have that much success at a young age, you think,

129
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.410
you think it's never going to end. You think you're invincible.

130
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.540
And I definitely sometimes treated as such where I was just like, whew,

131
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.240
you know, just throwing money away. And, and like I said,

132
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:27.770
my dad was encouraging me to save it.

133
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:31.280
And then it all came crashing down in about like

134
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:33.650
19 90, 1 92, where my,

135
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.120
my paycheck was all based on warranties of skate products.

136
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.100
And it started getting cut in half every month. Whoa,

137
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.250
just from lack of interest, lack of sales. Why.

138
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.260
<v 0>Did it drop it? Was it just the liability.</v>

139
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.620
<v 1>Thing? It was that, and just skating was considered a fad. And it was just like,</v>

140
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.120
and also my style of skating. I was, I skated the ramps, right?

141
00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:57.200
So I'm a vert skater.

142
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.190
Vert skating was just instantly not cool because street skating had taken over.

143
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.570
So I was considered this dinosaur and it was just like, you're out.

144
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.790
Skating's not cool. And you're not cool in skating. Wow. So, uh, it was,

145
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.260
it was rough. That was like,

146
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.480
I would say sort of 92 to 95 ish where

147
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.710
we're very lean.

148
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.320
<v 0>So you were trying to figure out like, Hey, what am I doing?</v>

149
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:22.790
I got really good at this. What are you thinking?

150
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.170
I gotta find something else to do.

151
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.940
<v 1>Yes and no. I knew I wouldn't quit skating because I just loved it. Like I,</v>

152
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.700
I never did it for the money. You know, when I started, there were no,

153
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.940
no one could be rich or famous from skating. So that was never the objective.

154
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.400
It was just because I loved what it brought to me.

155
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:40.550
I love the self-confidence abroad to me. I love the creativity. I love the,

156
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.120
the misfit crew, the, the community of it.

157
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:49.160
And so when things started to go south financially,

158
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.180
I know when quit, I just had to figure out how to make ends meet. And, uh,

159
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.730
I actually had a video editing system and I learned how to do that very early,

160
00:08:56.731 --> 00:09:00.720
like right when nonlinear video started happening, I had a system.

161
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:04.350
So I started doing freelance work for companies doing video editing,

162
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.640
super random, some skate companies. And then, um,

163
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.470
I did exhibitions. Like we were doing, uh,

164
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.220
exhibitions in a amusement park, parking lots.

165
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.690
We weren't even in the museum park.

166
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.280
We're like in the parking lot as people walk in as entertainment, you know,

167
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.750
and doing that for like a hundred bucks a day. Wow. Um, but it,

168
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.050
but it allowed me to skate and allowed me to pay the rent. And it was like,

169
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.150
that was good enough for me. But were you.

170
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.940
<v 0>Thinking that this is going to stop? Totally.</v>

171
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.290
<v 1>Well, it was definitely felt like it was heading that way. Um, but I,</v>

172
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.280
like I said, I was trying to, I was just trying to do whatever I could.

173
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:48.090
So I was trying to learn different skills. Um, and you know,

174
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:50.130
maybe skating wasn't going to pay the bills,

175
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.500
but I couldn't let it go from my life.

176
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.230
<v 0>Wow. That's a great story. It was in there. And you brought it back.</v>

177
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.650
Yeah, I guess. I mean a lot of ways, right.
