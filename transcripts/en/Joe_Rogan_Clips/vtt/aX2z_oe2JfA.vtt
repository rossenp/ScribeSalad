00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. Well, this is why you're here. Um.</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.190
<v 1>We're here to talk about that. Um, and well,</v>

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.100
I guess you should probably just explain what's going on.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.550
<v 2>Well, um, I guess I'll, I'll just kind of take you through the,</v>

5
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.660
the order of events here. Um, you know, uh,

6
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.250
that was my 10th fight fighting for the belt tour title and,

7
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.310
uh, and all my other nine fights previously,

8
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.930
it was never required for me to get a brain scan done.

9
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.120
Um, just due to the, to the different states that I was fighting in at the time,

10
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.380
the commissions there didn't require it, um, in the U S it's, California,

11
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.730
New York, and then Europe, um, you know, requires a brain scan.

12
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.790
We were originally scheduled to fight, um,

13
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:53.480
in January at the forum in California, um,

14
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.770
the same event that just happened this past Saturday night. Um, and, uh,

15
00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:01.730
so we were going to fight 2019 at the forum in January,

16
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.210
and that fight got postponed. Um,

17
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.260
saucy was injured and we eventually got rescheduled to fight

18
00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:11.840
in June in London. Um,

19
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.070
so I already had a brain scan scheduled, um,

20
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.630
for December, um, to get approved for that fight in January,

21
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.190
but I got the news about the fight getting canceled, um,

22
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.270
like the week of that scan a couple of days before. So I canceled it and I said,

23
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:33.980
I don't need to go get that done now. Um, and so fast forward, you know,

24
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.810
I basically stayed in camp the whole year, uh, training, you know,

25
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.550
with that fight on my mind all the way from November when I started the first

26
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:48.200
camp for the fight in January, you know, into the new year,

27
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.760
uh, waiting for the, the new date. Um,

28
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.240
and it was March that, uh,

29
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.040
that I got the word that we were going to fight in June in London. Um,

30
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.600
and so, you know,

31
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.350
I was basically training all year and I just picked right back up into camp

32
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.220
and, um, fast forward, um, on,

33
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:14.270
into the very beginning of may, um,

34
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.160
I was, you know,

35
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.900
already a good month into like the serious camp.

36
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.390
Um, and I was just getting ready to fly to Brazil, could achieve, uh, uh,

37
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:30.140
to get into the, you know, the hardest phase of camp. Uh,

38
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:34.910
I was going to be there for three weeks and I had to get my

39
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:38.330
MRI done, you know, and I wanted to get it done before I went to Brazil, uh,

40
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.500
just to check it off the list. Um, so this was actually, uh,

41
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.010
the week I had, um, I had two good buddies of mine. Um,

42
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.510
Jake Mapes and Sam Alvey, uh, were in Oklahoma, uh, training with me.

43
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.830
And, uh, we had a great week of training. Everything's going really,

44
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:58.340
really well. And, um, and it's Thursday.

45
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.980
And so I go get my brain scan done to get that done. Um,

46
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.570
before I went to Brazil and I'm in there and, you know,

47
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.010
we're, we get through the whole process and, uh, the machine is done.

48
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.710
It's not, you know, operating anymore,

49
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.830
but they haven't called me out of the room yet.

50
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.320
And I could kind of just sense something was going on. Um,

51
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.690
so finally they said, okay, come on out.

52
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.610
And the radiologists with really no like no,

53
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.010
uh, candor or, or like, like an easy, soft way of saying it was like,

54
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.420
dude, uh, have you seen your brain before? Um,

55
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.970
there's some stuff in here you need to see.

56
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.900
And he pulls me into the room and shows me on the, on the screen.

57
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:51.310
He's like pointing out these, um, you know, look like little balls.

58
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.850
Um, uh, obviously it looked like something was wrong.

59
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.340
It didn't look like a normal scan, but I'm not, I don't know, you know,

60
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.290
balls like, like shades of, of,

61
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.330
um, you know, discoloration, like according to the, the scan itself.

62
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:11.740
Like you could see that, you know, it wasn't normal. Um,

63
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.510
and he didn't even know what it was at the time. And he was like, ah, let me,

64
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:20.110
let me look this over tonight. And I had my paper and, you know,

65
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.910
to get signed off that everything looks clear and normal and, you know,

66
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:28.960
and he was just like, you know, he asked me if I had any concussions and,

67
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.780
um, if I've had any issues and I said, no, no. And he's like, well,

68
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:38.620
this doesn't look right. And you shouldn't be doing what you're doing. I'm like,

69
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.210
okay. So are you going to sign this paper? And he's like, no. And he's like,

70
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:46.090
come back tomorrow and I'm going to give you some more information. I said,

71
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:49.930
okay. So I go back Friday. Um,

72
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.180
and he tells me that, you know,

73
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:55.990
he did some research and he believes that I have a disease called cavernoma.

74
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.000
Um, and you know, he kind of hits me with that. Um,

75
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.650
I had no idea what cavernoma was. Um, and you know,

76
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.220
he says, look, I'm not signing this paper. Um,

77
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.690
you need to go see a specialist and get this looked at. But,

78
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.840
uh, as far as I know, you should not fight, you know,

79
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:21.130
you should not be fighting. And then the next morning I fly to Brazil,

80
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.260
um, for my camp, you know, to,

81
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.340
to go down there for the hard sparring and everything that I like to do,

82
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.900
you know, stuff we talked about last time.

83
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.940
And so I'm like going, um, you know,

84
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.900
in the airport getting ready to go to Brazil for this portion of my camp,

85
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:41.020
for this fight. That is like the biggest fight of my life. You know,

86
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.110
I've already waited an extra six months for it.

87
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:45.640
I've been training for it all year.

88
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.210
And at this point I'm like,

89
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.830
just in shock of what is going on my health.

90
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.450
And, you know,

91
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.810
I saw I'm like Googling everything that I can about cavernoma and trying to,

92
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.790
to understand what it is. And basically it's a disease where probably her, like,

93
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.950
I probably got it from one of my parents. It's a,

94
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.870
it's normally a hereditary disease and your brain, um,

95
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.280
forms these extra blood vessels and these blood vessels

96
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.080
grow and they can accumulate and sort of bundle up together

97
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.010
into balls. Um, almost like, like,

98
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.590
like weeds or vines, you know, they, they,

99
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.860
they wrap up together and, um,

100
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.400
these blood vessels are very prone to bleeding. Um,

101
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.230
now they don't bleed so much in, in, uh, in an instance where,

102
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.120
you know, it could cause a hemorrhage it's more like a slow, they,

103
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:45.560
they use the term oozing effect.

104
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.750
So to ooze oozes blood out over time, um, very little,

105
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.070
uh, little by little and as they accumulate, you know,

106
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:58.430
those balls, um, are very, you know,

107
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:02.960
much more susceptible to bleeding and, you know,

108
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:06.560
reading about it while I'm getting ready to go, you know,

109
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.970
I'm flying to Brazil, I'm in the airport, I'm taking off. Um,

110
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.650
you know,

111
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.630
there's so many like extreme cases of this disease

112
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:21.770
where people have to have multiple surgeries to get them

113
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:25.400
removed. Um, you know, seizures,

114
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.380
vision issues, uh, co people go into comas and then of course,

115
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.850
worse, worst case is even death. And, you know,

116
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.130
obviously Googling and, you know,

117
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:40.550
not talking to a specialist and just kind of doing my own thing is not the best

118
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:43.070
way to, to get in for information.

119
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:47.180
And so I just have all these thoughts running in my head about, you know,

120
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:51.980
what I'm dealing with in my health and like, okay, uh, now I'm going to,

121
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.610
you know, uh, Brazil to, you know, train and spar and,

122
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.070
and I have this fight and I'm, uh,

123
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.770
right now I don't have anyone signing off on this paper, you know,

124
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.510
is this going to happen? What's going on, like all these questions. And, um,

125
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.550
so I get there and, you know, at this point,

126
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:14.270
the only one that knows is, um, my girl, you know,

127
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:17.720
and I'm confiding in her and I'm just like talking to her and she's shocked.

128
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.360
I've never had any issues. I don't even really get headaches.

129
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.810
I've never been knocked out. Um, you know,

130
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.440
there's never been a time in my life where I thought, man,

131
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:30.260
I should get my head looked at, you know, I think something could be wrong,

132
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.430
you know? And so, um, you know,

133
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:38.990
talking with her and then I had my coach Mauricio, uh, he's my head, um,

134
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.920
MMA coach and my [inaudible] teacher. Um, and he goes with me down to,

135
00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:46.640
to could Achieva and we train there at his brothers academy,

136
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:51.440
Andre DDA at Adidas academy. Evolut sounds high. And,

137
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.160
you know, we fly Saturday, arrive Sunday, start training Monday.

138
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.690
And I'm just like, I'm trying to train this first day. And I'm just like,

139
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:00.510
what am I doing? You know, and I'm getting hit in the head and I'm like, man,

140
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:04.890
am I slowly killing myself right here? Like, you know,

141
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:08.790
what am I training for at this point? I'm not gonna, I'm not approved.

142
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:13.440
Like what, what am I going to do? You know? And, um, and so we,

143
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.390
we talk it over and we're like, okay, obviously we need to get more opinions,

144
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.380
you know? Um, and I'm down in Brazil for three weeks. Um,

145
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.190
basically all of may, um, the fight was June 21st,

146
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.690
um, or 23rd, something like that. And, um,

147
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.200
and so I'm spending all of may there. Um,

148
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.290
so I need to see some Brazilian doctors,

149
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.790
some doctors down here and could achieve them.

150
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.250
And so we've just begin the process. Um, let's get a prescription.

151
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.820
Did he speak Portuguese? Um, I'm not a hundred percent fluent,

152
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:51.750
but I can get around. I can do pretty well on my own down there,

153
00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:56.640
just from all the trips that I've done over the years. Um, so,

154
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.570
you know, thankfully Mauricio, his brother Dita, um,

155
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.920
they have so many connections down there. Um, you know, uh,

156
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.330
being who they are and the history that they have, um, you know,

157
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.080
teaching martial arts, you know, you get to know everybody, right.

158
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.340
And so they were able to make things happen quick for me. Um,

159
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.290
uh, we saw a doctor, got a prescription for another MRI,

160
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:28.350
get scheduled to get that MRI done, which happens on Friday,

161
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.370
the end of the, my first week there. So I'm going that whole week training,

162
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.590
you know, trying to stay positive. Um,

163
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.180
but I'm wondering, you know, what, uh, you know, what am I doing?

164
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:44.880
What's going on? You know what I mean? Like, yeah, I can't,

165
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.930
I can't begin to describe the,

166
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.090
the thoughts and emotions that.

167
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.140
<v 1>Imagine that it'd be so distracting during sparring as well.</v>

168
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.760
<v 2>Okay. Oh yes, yes. And you know, they go harder down there. Um.</v>

169
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.430
<v 1>Put it mildly. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

170
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.880
That place is known for like some of the most ruthless killers to ever come out

171
00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:08.840
of Brazil. 100%. I mean, a hundred percent. That's a shoot the box.

172
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:13.880
<v 2>Exactly. Yeah. Um, I'm not sleeping well. Um,</v>

173
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.010
you know, um, um, emotional wreck, basically, I'm calling my girl, uh,

174
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.790
over FaceTime, um, you know, multiple times a day,

175
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.580
we're looking at each other on the screen, I'm crying,

176
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.950
I'm confiding in Mauricio and Shaundra who Beto was also there with me. Um,

177
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.470
I had an Airbnb with Sean G. Um,

178
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.090
so thankfully I wasn't on my own 24 7, uh, outside of the academy.

179
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.460
Um, I used to always stays with his family and, um, you know, I'm just like,

180
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.330
man, when Sean, Sean G arrived, um, that Monday or Tuesday,

181
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.350
and I tell him what's going on, I'm just like, dude, I'm a mess right now. Like,

182
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:57.130
uh, I don't, you know, I'm just so uncertain of,

183
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.140
of my health and what's going on. And, and, uh, you know,

184
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.000
like I, man, I just can't put into words right now,

185
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.320
but I'm trying to stay positive. I'm trying to stay positive.

186
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.270
And we get through that first week, get the MRI,

187
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.370
the new MRI down there in Brazil. Um, so then we have, you know,

188
00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:22.660
the Brazilian MRI to take to Brazilian doctors.

189
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.070
And so then the second week we start seeing

190
00:12:27.071 --> 00:12:30.130
neurologists and, um, you know,

191
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.720
specialists to get their opinion and, um,

192
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.800
and see what they have to say.

193
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.680
And that was the hardest week

194
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.500
ever because, um,

195
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.530
multiple doctors were all saying, no, um, you know,

196
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.540
when you look at the scan right off the bat, it just like, it doesn't look good,

197
00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.340
you know? And when a picture of it, uh, man,

198
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:03.790
actually, I don't have, sorry,

199
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:07.990
I don't have one with me right now. Um, but, um,

200
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.390
you know, you just see these gray,

201
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.380
like little shades of circles, like in the,

202
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.870
well I have multiple and most of them are very small,

203
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.760
um, like popcorn size and you know,

204
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.820
those aren't that dangerous at least yet,

205
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.470
but there is one accumulation on the backside of my,

206
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.110
the right side of my head, um, you know,

207
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:39.490
back here and that has built up and, uh,

208
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:44.020
and it looks, it looks big. Um, like how big? Um,

209
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.370
probably most probably, uh, like somewhere between a,

210
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:54.010
like a baseball size, like golf, golf ball to baseball, um, in between there,

211
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:59.050
Jesus, um, it's, it's pretty big. Um, but it's on the very outer rim.

212
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:05.020
Um, so it's not like in the middle of my

213
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:06.880
brain, it's on the outside, you know,

214
00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:11.050
so if you were to go right through my head, it could be right there. You know,

215
00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:14.680
you could essentially pull it out without having to go through too much stuff.

216
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.510
Um.

217
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.970
<v 1>Is that something that might actually have to happen?</v>

218
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:25.840
<v 2>No, not, not now, not now. Um, I'll fast forward, you know,</v>

219
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.790
uh, to the doctors I end up seeing here in the states who clarify a lot of this,

220
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:32.170
but, um.

221
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.230
<v 1>That, so the doctors in Brazil all say the same thing. Well, they're kind.</v>

222
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.220
<v 2>Of just, I mean, you know, fighting already,</v>

223
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.310
isn't good for your brain, you know what I mean? Getting hit in the head,

224
00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:46.330
isn't good for your brain. And I think just looking at it when you see it,

225
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.320
and then you know that I'm going to get hit in the head. And when I do you're,

226
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.330
you're automatically going to be like, uh, Hey, you know,

227
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.060
there's already this extra bit of,

228
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.620
of danger that we're putting in to a dangerous situation.

229
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.970
Let's not, let's not play, let's not roll the dice. Let's not play that game.

230
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:11.090
Um, and so we were getting multiple doctors, um,

231
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.270
saying no, you know, and, um,

232
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.600
even one was like, you know,

233
00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:22.580
they said that jujitsu could be dangerous that me getting my blood cut off,

234
00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:26.420
like in a choke, um, you know, cutting off the circulation to my brain,

235
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.800
that could be dangerous.

236
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.900
And so this week I am literally not sleeping at all.

237
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.490
I am crying multiple times a day and I'm just like, man, what am I doing?

238
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:40.190
I'm going into the sparring, you know,

239
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.910
and I'm training and I'm not, I'm not going to get approved.

240
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.540
I'm not going to fight. You know, and this has already been like a six,

241
00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:51.440
seven month training camp at this point, you know? Um,

242
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.940
and it's for the belt. It's my life's work. It's everything for me, you know?

243
00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.520
So I was just crushed day in, day out, trying to get through.

244
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.420
And on Thursday of that week,

245
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.150
I'm doing MMA sparring. And, you know, I kind of had it coming.

246
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.750
I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have been going as hard as what I've been going,

247
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:19.730
but I was like trying to, you know, stay positive and stay ready. Like,

248
00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:23.180
what if I need to, I need to be ready for this fight. You know, it's some saucy,

249
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:26.600
like I gotta be at my best. And in reality,

250
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:31.370
I was just training like garbage. I was,

251
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.600
I was having my worst training camp, uh, my worst fight camp, um, you know,

252
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.420
because of everything. And on this day,

253
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.100
I'm in my third round of a may sparring. And I,

254
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.100
I strained my hamstring bad. Um,

255
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.580
I go for like a double leg and the guy has a judo background.

256
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.270
He overlooked like wizards me and goes for like a

257
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.850
[inaudible] type of throw I'm wearing wrestling shoes. I try to drop my hips,

258
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.630
you know, so he doesn't elevate me and my legs,

259
00:17:02.631 --> 00:17:06.470
my knees go straight and my foot gets stuck in the floor with the wrestling

260
00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:10.430
shoe. And my hamstring just snapped,

261
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:16.070
you know, like allowed, like pop, pop up and I just scream and I let it go.

262
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:20.120
And I, you know, I get thrown down and I'm just like, ah, and I, you know, he,

263
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:25.340
he knew something was wrong. We stopped right there and my leg is just throbbing

264
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.860
and I tried to get up. I couldn't get up. So I had to like walk on my hands,

265
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.030
scoot off the mat.

266
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.500
I got carried out of the academy that day could not walk.

267
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.120
And I'm sitting down on the edge of the mat and I I've just like, um,

268
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.600
I burst into tears and I looked to, I look up to Mount ISA and I'm like, man,

269
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:50.490
it's not going to happen. Like, there's no way, you know, all this is going on.

270
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.690
I'm not approved. I'm training, horrible. I can't walk now, you know?

271
00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.420
And so, you know, that was the end of week two, all knows.

272
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.100
We have one more doctor to see. Um,

273
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:10.200
who's like the professor of many of the doctors that I

274
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:12.630
already saw. He's very highly regarded.

275
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.480
One of the best doctors in the south of Brazil, uh,

276
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.390
neuro specialist neurosurgeon. Um,

277
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.910
we were so lucky to get in, to see him and, you know,

278
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:26.190
cause he's booked up, booked up, booked up,

279
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.990
but we managed an appointment time for Monday of the third week,

280
00:18:30.991 --> 00:18:35.220
Monday night. So, you know, I'm like,

281
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.970
I basically given up, I can't walk, uh,

282
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.990
I'm at home that whole weekend and Sean Jean, he, um,

283
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.610
he had seminars on the weekend. You know,

284
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:46.230
he came down there to support me in camp,

285
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.740
but on the weekends he was going off to teach seminars in different areas of

286
00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:50.574
Brazil.

287
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.800
And so I'm laid up in this Airbnb all

288
00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:59.760
weekend and I'm like just FaceTiming my girl. And I'm like, you know, behaving,

289
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:03.030
like, I don't think this is happening.

290
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.940
I can't believe come this far, you know,

291
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.340
to the title shot this much training, you know, for the camp,

292
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.290
like going from November of 2018 into the end of may of

293
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:18.670
2019. That was my, that was it.

294
00:19:18.671 --> 00:19:23.250
It was just this fight with massage and, uh, uh, you know,

295
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.690
it took everything for me. Like this sounds funny, but the,

296
00:19:28.691 --> 00:19:33.630
the house, the Airbnb, the host, you know, she's like a great host.

297
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.820
She left so many chocolates and all this food in the house like sweets.

298
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.830
And I just wanted to pig out and eat all these chocolates, you know?

299
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.220
Uh, I kept telling Shaundra, bro, you got to eat these things. Like, I,

300
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:51.180
I can't look at these I'm so I'm such an emotional wreck right now, you know,

301
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:51.840
and I'm in,

302
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:56.670
I'm in the spot all weekend by myself and I'm ready to give up.

303
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.160
I'm like, I'm going to go eat [inaudible]

304
00:19:59.160 --> 00:19:59.160
, you know what I mean? And eat all these chocolates and just like, you know, cause I have to diet very strict to make 180 5. 

305
00:19:59.160 --> 00:19:59.993
What do you walk around at around two, 10 to two 15 is my normal weight.

306
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.070
You know, so I mean that weight is kind of normal.

307
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.480
Like most guys at 180 5 or around two 10, but I'm already tall.

308
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:22.680
I'm already naturally pretty lean. So I have to be very strict on my diet, um,

309
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.270
to, to get that low.

310
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:30.210
And it took everything for me to not just take out and

311
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:34.740
just like totally given, but, you know, uh,

312
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.520
Mauricio was just like, Hey, we have one more doctor, one more doctor.

313
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.530
The whole weekend, all I did was just put CBD cream on my leg,

314
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.710
a resilience CBD and shout out to them and my sponsor. Um,

315
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.460
and I use using the Marc pro on my, on my leg. Um,

316
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:55.660
so to mark pro it's like a, somewhere to like a tens unit,

317
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.840
but it has different frequencies and you can go really deep in there.

318
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:00.820
And so I'm just like, okay,

319
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.390
let me just try to recover this thing as much as I can. I couldn't train,

320
00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:08.800
couldn't do anything. I was basically stuck at home. Um, and that's all I did.

321
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:13.330
And I just said, okay, Monday night, that's it. If he says, no it's done.

322
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.840
And at this point I hadn't told anything to any, I let my manager ed now,

323
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.350
but we hadn't said anything to anybody else. Um,

324
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:24.100
literally the only ones I knew were my girls, Sean Giamatti, UCO and ed.

325
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.950
And so we go see this doctor Monday night and

326
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.570
man right off the bat,

327
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.920
he kind of captivated us because he was the first one to be

328
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.140
just chill and just like, okay, what's going on? What brings you here?

329
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.990
It didn't look at any pictures. Didn't, you know, didn't rush it.

330
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.860
And I tell him, uh, yeah, you know, I got my scans,

331
00:21:47.861 --> 00:21:51.670
it looks like I have cavernoma dah. He said, okay, let me see your scans.

332
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.740
And he's like, yeah, yeah, this is, this is a cavernoma for sure. Um,

333
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.000
how do you feel the first one to ask me? How do you feel?

334
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:06.850
And so well, uh, you know, um, this is all a huge shock.

335
00:22:06.851 --> 00:22:11.710
I've never had any problems. I feel great. I'm fine. You know, I, you know,

336
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:16.240
I don't even get headaches and um, he's like, okay.

337
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.590
Um, you know, uh, he talks with me and he's like, let's go do an evaluation.

338
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.640
We do an evaluation, do some tests. Everything's normal, like just simple, like,

339
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.710
you know, stand on one leg and all that kind of stuff. Um, you know,

340
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:34.150
and everything's fine. And so we S we go back to the office,

341
00:22:34.151 --> 00:22:37.300
we sit down, he's like, let me just see what I can find,

342
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.400
but I guarantee I'm not going to find anything that says

343
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.620
head impact or trauma is going to increase the risk of your camera,

344
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:52.510
cavernoma bleeding. And so he starts looking up,

345
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:57.250
you know, journals and, and, um, you know, uh, studies, uh,

346
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.180
all the things that doctors have access to. And he, he literally finds nothing.

347
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.921
Um, you know,

348
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:07.870
there is no studies that say that getting hit in your head is gonna

349
00:23:07.871 --> 00:23:11.410
make your cavernoma worse or, or cause you to bleed. And,

350
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:16.330
and something's going to happen. He's like, look, you can bleed,

351
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.280
you know, you can be oozing blood at any point in time, uh, little by little,

352
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.620
um, and it could become an issue at some point in time.

353
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:31.240
Um, but there is no treatment. There is no we're not going to do surgery.

354
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.500
Like there's nothing that's going to happen until you have symptoms until you

355
00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:36.340
show signs.

356
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.900
And because I can't find any studies that say getting hit in the head is going

357
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.590
to make it worse. And because you are, you know, a normal,

358
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:48.230
like healthy functioning person at this point,

359
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.260
I think it's fine for you to fight.

360
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.920
You should continue doing what you do until it becomes a problem.

361
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.720
And if it does become a problem,

362
00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.430
we'll go in there and we'll take it out the big, the big mass, um,

363
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.420
and you know, then we'll, we'll move forward. Um,

364
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:09.080
and so I'm just like, uh, you know,

365
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.810
I started getting emotional already and I'm kinda like, wow, are you,

366
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.230
so you'll write a letter saying this you'll you'll, you'll support me.

367
00:24:15.231 --> 00:24:19.190
And he's like, yeah, sure, sure, no problem. Super calm guy, just,

368
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.720
and he was the oldest doctor we had spoken to as well, um,

369
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:28.580
most experienced. And so we get this letter, man.

370
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.500
We walk out of that office, uh, me and Maddie UCO. And as soon as we,

371
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:37.160
we leave the door and we'll get to the elevator, man, I just,

372
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.180
I just like burst into tears. I just,

373
00:24:41.181 --> 00:24:45.860
I can't believe that there's some hope like this,

374
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.810
this can still happen and me and Mauricio embrace and just, we both cry.

375
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.150
I'm like, oh my God, we got the letter, we got the letter.

376
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.050
So I, uh,

377
00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.880
I send a letter to EDD and we begin the process of

378
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.170
trying to get approved. We get everything into Bella tour,

379
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:10.700
let them know they got the scans. Um, they send it over to the Europe, uh,

380
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.630
commission. They use an organization called safe MMA. Um,

381
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:20.060
and you know, we kind of like, we're happy,

382
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.350
we're positive, but at the same time, I'm still not approved.

383
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:28.400
It's still not on, you know, but, uh,

384
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:32.000
the letter is like, that was the missing piece.

385
00:25:32.001 --> 00:25:34.310
That was what we needed to be able to move forward.

386
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.960
So I finished that last week, um,

387
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:44.240
unable to really move, uh, you know,

388
00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:48.710
I can't wrestle, I can't kick. And my last week in Brazil, you know, uh,

389
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:53.060
I'm literally just hitting mids like this. And I'm like, okay,

390
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.770
trying to stay positive. I still have like a month, let's get this healed.

391
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:01.730
Let's just keep sweating. Did you get an MRI and a hamstring? No,

392
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.330
I didn't get MRI in the hamstring. Um, it, uh,

393
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:10.250
it didn't have any discoloration, so it wasn't a tear. Um,

394
00:26:10.251 --> 00:26:13.190
it was like a severe strain, but with the popping,

395
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:18.140
it didn't turn black and blue. And so without that color discoloration,

396
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.490
I didn't, I almost didn't even want to know. I was just like, right. You know,

397
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.060
like when did it start feeling better? It didn't really,

398
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.770
I actually still feel it now. Uh, it, yeah.

399
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.210
Um, it was a situation the whole way. Um,

400
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.070
but I could stand so I could stand and

401
00:26:40.071 --> 00:26:42.410
all I'm doing is boxing now at this point,

402
00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:46.560
because I can't throw a kicks and I can't change levels to, to do take-downs.

403
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.470
Um, and so that was a whole nother thing because, you know, as I'm waiting to,

404
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:57.690
to hear back on, if I'm going to get approved, I'm only punching mitts.

405
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.710
Like I might as well be doing like a cardio kick kickboxing class, you know,

406
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:02.880
without kicks.

407
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.440
And that was the last thing that I want to do with massage is just go in there

408
00:27:07.441 --> 00:27:11.100
and box, you know, that's not what I do. Right. So

409
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.800
the, the hardships and frustrations were just continued, um,

410
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:21.240
as I'm dealing with my hamstring, but at least we had some,

411
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.590
some hope. Um, so I finished that week,

412
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.810
fly home. Um,

413
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:32.460
and I'm finishing like my last couple of weeks of camp at home in Oklahoma,

414
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:37.230
Shoji comes to Oklahoma, you know, Maddie UCO was there and, um,

415
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.060
I'm trying to put together some great training.

416
00:27:39.061 --> 00:27:42.780
One of my best training partners from coulda Chiba, his name's Chris Cristiano.

417
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.580
He came to Oklahoma as well. Um, and you know,

418
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.660
everyone's aware of the situation. As far as my coaches, my team,

419
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:56.910
I did not tell my parents. Um, I, I didn't want anyone to know.

420
00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:01.680
I didn't want it to get out. Um, and so I was just dealing with it with them,

421
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.390
you know? And, um, and so we send everything in,

422
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.970
um, and we're waiting, we're waiting the,

423
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:16.860
this guy, his name is Yani. He's on the commission was safe MMA.

424
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:22.290
He reaches out to me like after the first week and he said, Hey,

425
00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:26.580
we need to talk. And so I give him a call and, uh, he's like,

426
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.390
we got the letter, we're looking at your scans.

427
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.790
We've actually created a panel of doctors to talk about this.

428
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:41.200
Um, and at this point it's 50 50, you know,

429
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.060
and just want you to know we're, we're unsure if we're gonna approve.

430
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:50.880
Um, and I just want you to hear, you know, I just wanted to touch base with you.

431
00:28:50.881 --> 00:28:53.400
When did you hear from me? We see everything,

432
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:57.660
but you have to understand where we're still not sure. So bear with us.

433
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.190
I'm like, okay, try to get through the next week.

434
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:07.500
Um, ha I had some decent days with my hamstring, um,

435
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.300
where I could shoot a little bit and work some takedowns, but, um,

436
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.860
if I had a good day,

437
00:29:13.861 --> 00:29:17.970
the next day I had to take it real light because it was just, it was so tight,

438
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.770
so tight, so tender. Um, did you get a massage at all? Oh yeah.

439
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.680
I was doing everything, everything possible. I mean,

440
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:31.350
getting it worked on, um, doing hot cold, like, you know,

441
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.420
I'm, I'm pretty like anything out there

442
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:41.410
that is for recovery. I have probably at my house, you know, um,

443
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.140
I'm big on really taking care of my body.

444
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:47.680
So I was just trying to be as smart as I could and just get through it.

445
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.070
And, you know,

446
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:56.080
we come to this point now where the fight is two

447
00:29:56.081 --> 00:30:00.760
weeks away and I don't know if it's on or

448
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:02.650
not. Um, you know,

449
00:30:02.651 --> 00:30:06.580
and I'm just trying to put together as good of training as I can stay as

450
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:11.380
positive as I can. But at the same time, I'm just like, man, I need the, yes.

451
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:14.200
You know, I need to be able to, to focus.

452
00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.680
<v 1>How are you staying conditioned when you, you barely can use your leg.</v>

453
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.570
<v 2>Man? It was, it was really hard. Um,</v>

454
00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:27.580
I was heavier. I was walking around heavier than what I normally would,

455
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.770
um, for, for my fights, you know,

456
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:34.390
by this time I'm normally below 2 0 5, um,

457
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.070
in the 200 to 2 0 5 range,

458
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.100
that's where I like to get to just off pure diet and off training.

459
00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.870
And I was still two 10 to two 12. Um, you know,

460
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.640
it was hard. Like, I, I couldn't, I could box, you know,

461
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:53.530
and I could box hard and I could spar boxing, but without wrestling,

462
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.430
I didn't feel like I was conditioned the way I want it to be. Um,

463
00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.820
I couldn't sprint, I could ride the bike. Um,

464
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.170
the bike didn't put too much pressure,

465
00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:05.530
but I couldn't go all out the way I would like to. I can Airdyne yeah.

466
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.270
Airdyne um,

467
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.530
everything was not the way it would normally be done now, you know,

468
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.830
you're never a hundred percent, you're always dealing with something, you know,

469
00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:18.490
I've, I've had a broken nose before cuts rib things.

470
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:23.020
Like there's always something, you know. Um, but, um, but it was,

471
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:24.750
it was the stress of both in,

472
00:31:24.751 --> 00:31:27.970
in the uncertainty and if we would get to fight it all, yeah.

473
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.140
That was really hard. And for sure, that's why I got hurt. You know,

474
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:36.910
that's 100% why I got hurt. Um, but anyways,

475
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:42.550
um, finally on like the last day that they could

476
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.980
give me the answer, they gave me the answer and I got the email and it said,

477
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.750
we've approved you, you are approved to fight two weeks before the fight.

478
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:57.760
Wow. I held off on, you know, I'm flying my family there.

479
00:31:57.761 --> 00:32:00.470
You know what I mean? I have all my, my, uh, there's the,

480
00:32:00.471 --> 00:32:03.370
the corner coach has been, I have a couple other coaches that I was, you know,

481
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.420
gonna fly out there and I was waiting to purchase these tickets. And, you know,

482
00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.110
I had some other guys like, Hey, where are you staying? What's what's going on?

483
00:32:11.111 --> 00:32:14.950
Like, uh, I'm ready. And I'm like, Hey, don't don't book anything just yet.

484
00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.470
Don't look at me cause I don't want them to buy tickets to London and you know,

485
00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:22.150
I'm not fighting and I'm trying to like be cool and not give

486
00:32:22.151 --> 00:32:24.340
anyone to, you know, uh,

487
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.370
too much an idea of what's going on and stay positive,

488
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.430
stay confident and everything. Finally,

489
00:32:30.431 --> 00:32:34.870
we got the green light and I'm literally flying a few days later to London.

490
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:40.280
Uh, I, we left on Tuesday, uh, and arrived there Wednesday.

491
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.500
I got there like 10 days before.

492
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:46.370
So I have one weekend before the weekend of the fight. Um,

493
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:51.650
and, uh, you know, at this point it was like, okay, once we got that, yes.

494
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.430
I mean, we celebrated, it was like, you know,

495
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.020
that's all I wanted. I mean,

496
00:32:57.021 --> 00:33:01.430
I had already fought so hard just to be able to get to this fight.
