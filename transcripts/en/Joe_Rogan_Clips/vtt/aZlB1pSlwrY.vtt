00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.480
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Like for instance, when, when, um,</v>

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.240
when John Jones was first competing, John Jones,

3
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.640
he competed so freely because, you know, it was just like, he was,

4
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.120
it was just in his nature. Like he was just so creative and,

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.440
and he fought different because of, you know, he fought from the,

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.510
that place of just creativity, that ignorance, that, that, that ignorant bliss,

7
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:29.830
you know, he couldn't be beat. He didn't believe he can be beat and, you know,

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.270
he would fight that way and he would do some genius stuff in there just because

9
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:36.670
of that, you know, but then when you have those experiences where you, you know,

10
00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:39.430
you've been caught in a fight or you've, you know,

11
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.340
you've made some mistakes in there, then you do know better, but then those,

12
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.980
those, those thoughts, it actually slows you down a bit too,

13
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:51.340
because you're not fully reacting. You're, you're thinking a,

14
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.180
a hair mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; where, before it was just kind of like a reaction.

15
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.500
Yeah.

16
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.300
<v 1>I talk about his opening fight, the opening sequence of his fight with showgun.</v>

17
00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.980
I mean, he's 23 years old,

18
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.810
he's fighting for the world title and he opens up with a flying name. Right.

19
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.050
Who the does that? That's that, that.

20
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.370
<v 0>Was that, that was that, that was that dumb and young &lt;laugh&gt;. Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:09.371 --> 00:01:11.010
You know what I'm saying? That's the best way to say it,

22
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:15.250
but at the same time that, that, that blisful ignorance. That's what made,

23
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.930
that was his blueprint for so long, you know, and,

24
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:21.530
and he's turned it into a whole fighting style just that, you know,

25
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.760
let and it off, hang out, letting it fly. And that's what worried me. Um,

26
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.040
that's why I thought in this fight with Dominic re is it was gonna be a closer

27
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.120
fight because of the fact that Dominic res now had that,

28
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:36.120
what John used to have being that, that blissful ignorance mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

29
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:37.800
he didn't really know how much, you know,

30
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.160
how better John was or didn't even care. He was just kind of like, uh,

31
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.110
I can win, you know what I'm saying? He was so confident in himself,

32
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.990
almost in a, in an ignorant blissful way, but it worked out for him, you know?

33
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.470
Well.

34
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.030
<v 1>What's interesting about that fight is first of all,</v>

35
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:54.430
it's a great argument for five round championship fights because for the first

36
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:56.750
three rounds, Dominic res was winning. Yeah.

37
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.830
The question is whether he won the third round,

38
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.590
that's the one I believe that's up for grabs.

39
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.140
Most people that I've talked to think John won the last

40
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.100
two. Clearly, most people, most people that I talk to that are experts.

41
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.780
Most people, few disagree believe that Dominic gray has won the first three.

42
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.820
And the third round is the one that seems to be, you go, well,

43
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.180
Dominic scored more,

44
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.090
but it was close enough where you could see someone giving it to John parti.

45
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:30.410
Particularly since John was pressing the action, John was pushing forward.

46
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.130
Maybe you give it to John, but they thought Dominic wanted it. But they said,

47
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:38.250
if there's aputable round, it is that third round. I agree.

48
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.490
One judge gave John four rounds to one. That's insane. Yeah,

49
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.960
this is same judge. That when Ibel, I believe, uh,

50
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.960
Luke Thomas was talking about this IM I'm sorry if I'm wrong.

51
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.080
I'm not saying the judge's name because I'm not sure if I'm correct,

52
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.960
but I believe it's the same judge that umrevin Giles who

53
00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:02.920
fought, uh, James K Crouse, um, Giles and Krauses was an amazing fight.

54
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.680
Giles wound wound up winning the decision.

55
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.640
But the first round Krause had his back for four

56
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:14.000
minutes. And the refer, the judge gave that round to Giles mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

57
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:17.520
which is insane. I mean, for four minutes,

58
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.110
Krause had its was, the guy was fighting off. Chokes.

59
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.630
Krause was real close to submitting him a couple times during those four

60
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:27.470
minutes. And the judge,

61
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.510
the same judge who gave four rounds to John Jones gave that first round to Giles

62
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.150
where there was a dude on his back for four minutes that,

63
00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:36.710
that most of the round,

64
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.660
and maybe even a four more egregious fight was, um,

65
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.860
uh, Andre uul versus, uh, Jonathan Martinez.

66
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.180
That fight was crazy. That fight was crazy.

67
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.060
That was the most crazy one Martinez won that fight. Yeah.

68
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.930
Martinez won that fight. Uul broke his arm at think so.

69
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.050
I'm not sure if it's a broken arm,

70
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:05.930
but he had a significant injury to his right hand early in the fight somewhere

71
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.210
in between either the first or the second round. Not sure,

72
00:04:08.211 --> 00:04:10.690
but he really couldn't throw a right hand and it was kind of hanging.

73
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.490
You could kinda see it was hanging and Martinez put in work.

74
00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:17.210
It was an amazing performance by him and he got over man, real bad.

75
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.360
It was bad decision making was a bunch of bad fights.

76
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.960
There was a bunch of bad decisions. Yeah. It wasn't just one.

77
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.880
I know there was like four or five on a, a card of what, 12 fights, 11,

78
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:32.160
12 fights. I forget how many it was from the opening prelims.

79
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.160
There was bad decisions.

80
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.360
Just almost like people who don't know what they're saying.

81
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.360
<v 0>Yeah. And that, and that's crazy too.</v>

82
00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:42.350
Especially when we reached a point that we have in mixed martial arts. You know,

83
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.670
I think that we've, we we've turned a corner in that meeting.

84
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:48.190
The fact that there's, there's so many, uh,

85
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.110
so much out there so much knowledge out there in the sport and everything else

86
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:53.430
like that. And if you're gonna be judging it,

87
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:58.310
you gotta at least know when somebody is, is winning around. I mean, you know,

88
00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:01.820
there there's aspects of, of John's game that, that, you know,

89
00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:02.860
a score some point, you know,

90
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:05.020
he was always moving forward with the action mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; mm-hmm

91
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.020
&lt;affirmative&gt;. But, um, you know, even when he was moving forward, the action,

92
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.300
he wasn't terribly too offensive. He would come with his legs, but you know,

93
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.980
a lot of times he, he would allow, he would allow, uh,

94
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:19.620
Dominic to kind of be the first one initiating and then moving off. And it,

95
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:23.930
sometimes it seemed like he was just kind of chasing him. But, um, you know, I,

96
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.690
I think that, uh, it was, it, it was that third round,

97
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:31.650
that third round was that, that hard round to score mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. But,

98
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.290
you know, it's, I, I, I think that Dom had the edge,

99
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.730
but if you gonna be the champion,

100
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.290
you gotta be the champion mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

101
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:45.360
And I don't think he did the at John Jones oppressed me so much with the shots

102
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:48.920
that he was able to take, but more or less the mindset that John had, that,

103
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.800
that, that mindset that John had in those championship rounds, to me, that,

104
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:57.720
that showed that this guy is, you know,

105
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.480
he is a total package and, and when it comes to fighting,

106
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.680
just mentally speaking, you know, he's, he's somebody who I fought,

107
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:08.560
thought that was frustrated and working through his own

108
00:06:08.561 --> 00:06:12.920
frustrating in the fight for his frustration in the fight, I is, is difficult.

109
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:15.480
Yeah. And he didn't succumb to his own frustration and,

110
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.030
and he kept that pressure going. It took some big shots from a heavy hitter,

111
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.710
but, uh, Dominic Ray is a problem for.

112
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.070
<v 1>Anybody. He's a problem. He's a real problem. Especially now that he's,</v>

113
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.110
he's got that rub. He touched, touched greatness. Yeah. With John. Yeah.

114
00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:32.470
Who's the greatest ever. I feel like those last two rounds should count more.

115
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.630
This is my ownpersonal opinion. But, uh,

116
00:06:34.631 --> 00:06:37.180
John Kavanaugh said something on his Twitter page, age,

117
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.260
I believe it was John Kavanaugh.

118
00:06:38.261 --> 00:06:42.060
And it reflects exactly how I feel that if this fight was gonna go on another

119
00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:44.420
five rounds, it's pretty clear to me. Who's gonna win.

120
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.940
Who's gonna who this is to the death. John Jones is gonna win that fight. Yeah.

121
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.380
You know, it's, if it's to the death,

122
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.820
there's no doubt about it in my mind that John Jones eventually gonna get him.

123
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.380
Yeah. Those last two rounds, Dominic res was hurting.

124
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.290
You could see him looking and taking big, deep breaths and trying to move.

125
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.730
And his arms were labored. And John just kept, pressing, kept, pressing,

126
00:07:03.731 --> 00:07:06.250
kept kicking him, kept punching him, kept trying for the take down.

127
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.850
And that should mean more.

128
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.690
It should mean more towards the end of the fight at the end of the fight.

129
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.450
If you win a decision, but you,

130
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.690
you just got your kicked for the last four minutes. Right.

131
00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:19.840
That seems crazy to me that you fight. Yeah. Because I mean,

132
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.600
I know this is a dumb way to think about it, but if we were in a schoolyard,

133
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:28.600
right. We were in high school and some dude and another dude fought the dude,

134
00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:32.440
who's getting the beat out of him at the end of the fight is the guy who lost.

135
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.320
Right. Right. When the teachers come and they pull you off that guy,

136
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.320
that's who won that's who wanna fight that's who won. And I,

137
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.630
I know that you can't score a professional sport the way you look,

138
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.510
but it is the rarest of rare professional sports, because it's a,

139
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.910
the sport of fighting. Right. And in fighting, when you're getting your kicked,

140
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.190
you were, you know, you're supposed to, you're supposed to lose. Yeah.

141
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:57.270
If you're getting your kicked, you lost. Yeah. But,

142
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.900
and if you're kicking the guy's, you win. Sounds crazy.

143
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.180
But at the end of that fight, John Jones was kicking dominicm craze'. He was,

144
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.460
he was, he was chasing him down. Dominic was taking a big, deep breath.

145
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:10.380
He was firing back when he fired back very well in the fourth round.

146
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.020
But John absorb, John has a hell of a chin too. Oh my gosh. Hell of a chin.

147
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.060
Oh my gosh. Hell of a chin. I mean, you can't, he's, he's,

148
00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:22.250
something's special because of everything. It's not,

149
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.730
he's something special because of his physical attributes.

150
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.210
He's very tall and long. He's very strong. It's not just his skill.

151
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:31.730
He's got great wrestling. He's got great striking. It is all.

152
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.970
It is his mind too. Yeah. It's all those things.

153
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.570
It's his ability to press forward. It's ability to break people,

154
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.480
ability to stay on top of you have that Champion's mindset.

155
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.800
And to know that he's fought the majority of his career as a world

156
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.600
champion, which is crazy. I know, I know. I mean,

157
00:08:51.601 --> 00:08:54.560
almost a decade as the greatest in the world,

158
00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.000
chasing everybody that he's fought every single fighter that he's fought.

159
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.281
You look at them,

160
00:09:01.281 --> 00:09:04.840
they're all guys like you mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; guys like maeeita world

161
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.640
champions, rampage, world champions, over and over and over again, you get,

162
00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:12.840
you go through the list of them, just all these killers.

163
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:17.030
There's this killer after gust of sin, you know, I mean,

164
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.830
you just keep going through his entire career.

165
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:24.350
DC twice stopped him in the second fight. He's a assassin.

166
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.710
<v 0>And, and the, the most impressive thing about it for me is the fact that,</v>

167
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.950
you know, on a physical scale, he's phenomenal, but just mentally speaking,

168
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.380
to be able to go through everything he's gone through, you know,

169
00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:40.620
the ups and downs. Yeah. And what that, what that does to your mind. Yes.

170
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.900
You know what that does to your mind and,

171
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.780
and just being able to put that to a side or be able to use it

172
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.900
in order to go out and still perform as if like he hasn't missed a beat. Yeah.

173
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:56.530
That is hard because it, it gets to the point, um, you know, you,

174
00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.130
you get, you get it's anything in life, you get tired of the monotony of it.

175
00:10:00.131 --> 00:10:03.330
You get, you get jaded by it. Yeah. And he hasn't been jaded by it.

176
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.810
And he still goes out there and performs like that. That's impressive. Why?

177
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.410
<v 1>I think he needed someone like Dominic to get that fear going too.</v>

178
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.970
I think he knew Dominic Graham's physically is a talented guy. Yeah.

179
00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:19.160
He's a great athlete. He it's tremendous footwork his ability to change angles.

180
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:22.120
And then fire back is insane. I know. It's so good.

181
00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.680
You saw it in the OSP fight where he knocked him out with like a couple seconds

182
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.960
to go. Yeah. You see it in a lot. His Jared can near fight.

183
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.040
He could step back and fire fire, upper cut,

184
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:36.240
step back and fire that straight left his ability to change direction.

185
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:39.310
His amazing. And I think a lot of that could be attributed to his football,

186
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.230
basketball. I mean, um, baseball, like footwork movement,

187
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.670
his ability to explode all that stuff that he did in other sports,

188
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.030
I think directly translates to his ability to move really well inside the

189
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.950
octagon. And then on top of it, he's gigantic. He's the same size as John.

190
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.340
I know, which is very unusual for John to face someone that's his height.

191
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.620
And he's really strong too.

192
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.820
<v 0>That's that? Now that was the intangible that I think that John didn't expect,</v>

193
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.260
he didn't expect for him to be as strong.

194
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.100
<v 1>As he was when he' was able to get back up every time.</v>

195
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.940
<v 0>Yeah. When he like get up, like he wasn't even on him, like.</v>

196
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:16.980
<v 1>Dang, his legs are huge. You look at rays' legs. Oh, huge. Yeah. I mean,</v>

197
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.330
he's got tremendous power. I mean, both with his punches,

198
00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:23.570
but also with his ability to move, man, he was throwing great kicks.

199
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.570
He was chopping at John's legs. I mean, I,

200
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.210
out of any fight in John's future, I wanna see a rematch.

201
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.370
I really wanna see what Dominic gray has looks like now with this rub,

202
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.880
understanding how close he was and the, then the,

203
00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:42.080
the amount of conditioning that he's going to have to put himself through.

204
00:11:42.081 --> 00:11:44.240
Right. To be able to do that again, five rounds.

205
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.240
And it's not like either guy got up in that fight where they're gonna be

206
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:49.280
severely damaged.

207
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:54.160
It's not like one of those crazy wars where like aisagnia Kelvin Gastelum.

208
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:56.560
At the end of that fight, I was like, oh my God. You know,

209
00:11:56.561 --> 00:12:00.640
I hope Kelvin takes some time off after that one. That was chaos. Just wildness.

210
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.600
It wasn't like that. It was a grueling, difficult, hard fight,

211
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.480
but it wasn't a fight where there was so much damage that both John and, and,

212
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.600
uh, Dominic needed to take a long time off.

213
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.310
I feel like you could make that fight in eight months. Absolutely.

214
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.710
And that would be the fight to make. Yeah. That's that is a,

215
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.750
that's a crazy rematch. And, and.

216
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.670
<v 0>The thing about it was surprisingly to see like,</v>

217
00:12:20.671 --> 00:12:24.110
they like their faces weren't beat up at all. No. And I'm like,

218
00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:27.550
these dudes were landing some shots on each other and their face was not even

219
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.110
yes. Like I thought for sure John's lip would be all swollen.

220
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.700
Like it was when he fought. Oh, to him. Yeah. He, he took, he took those shots.

221
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.380
Well, man, it, it is, it's amazing. It's amazing.

222
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.740
But I think that this is exactly what John needed in that light heavyweight

223
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:43.980
weight class, because you know, it, it does,

224
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.580
it was getting kind of stagnant and I think it needed some time to mature.

225
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.860
But I think, I think Dominic Ray has just said, yo,

226
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:53.460
you better stay here for a little bit. And here's another guy go,

227
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.090
Corey Anderson. Oh yes. Corey Anderson is somebody. Listen. I'm.

228
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.130
<v 1>That's the dark horse. I've been telling everybody, listen.</v>

229
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.090
<v 0>That's the dark horse.</v>

230
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.570
<v 1>The way he knocked out. Johnny Walker. Yes. And he's angry. He's angry.</v>

231
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.730
<v 0>He's angry. And that's something you never seen Corey. Yes. You never seen that.</v>

232
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.650
<v 1>Before. After that fight, he was like, letting everybody know you been slipping.</v>

233
00:13:10.651 --> 00:13:11.970
Yeah. You've been sleeping on me.

234
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.760
You guys have been pretending that I don't this that's.

235
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:16.360
That's why I'm out here beating the best in the world.

236
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.080
<v 0>If he fights John Jones. I think that's one that John better be like, all.</v>

237
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.920
<v 1>Right. I be, he better be so ready. Yeah. Corey's got, he doesn't have a chip.</v>

238
00:13:23.921 --> 00:13:28.560
He's got logs on his shoulder. I know Corey. He's angry. He's. He's off.

239
00:13:28.561 --> 00:13:30.680
After that Johnny Walker fight, he was so outta character.

240
00:13:30.681 --> 00:13:33.200
He's screaming and yelling and, you know,

241
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.590
he was so he was angry after he won. He knocked him out in the first round.

242
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.230
And then he's bad. The.

243
00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.030
<v 0>The years of disrespect though. And that's, and that's how he trained though.</v>

244
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:46.110
He always trained with that, that mindset, like, oh, they don't respect me,

245
00:13:46.111 --> 00:13:48.510
you know? And that's why he worked so hard. Yes.

246
00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:58.340
<v 2>I.</v>
