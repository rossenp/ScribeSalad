00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now, what.</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.390
<v 1>Do you do in this environment?</v>

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.560
When you look at the way people distrust the police now in particular, I mean,

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.131
I mean,

5
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:15.870
I've been reading stories about cops going to five guys burgers and they can't

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:20.280
get served. Cause people won't serve cops. And this idea that all cops are bad,

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.960
and this is a very,

8
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:26.490
really disturbing perspective to me because you're seeing what's happening right

9
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:29.970
now in Chicago. You're seeing what's happening right now in New York,

10
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:32.970
where you have this massive uptick in violent crime,

11
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.420
because it's perceived that the police presence has been demit diminished

12
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.283
greatly.

13
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.700
So how do you reaffirm the

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.290
trust in, in,

15
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.160
in law enforcement and what do you do to reform law enforcement?

16
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:50.520
Because clearly there are some people that are cops that should not be cops.

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.950
Yeah. So.

18
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.840
<v 2>There are a few things that you can do right off the bat and that people right</v>

19
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:55.130
left and center have sort of talked about.

20
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.490
And one of them is that you can abridge qualified immunity in certain areas.

21
00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.040
So qualified immunity is the idea that you're not liable to civil suit.

22
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.020
If you don't do something bad, that has specifically had a precedent in law.

23
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.880
So you could do something bad,

24
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:10.760
but as long as nobody else has done the same exact bad thing before you're not

25
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:15.110
subjected to civil liability, you could, you could, it's a little complicated.

26
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:19.340
So qualified immunity generally means that if I do something bad,

27
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.301
then as a police officer,

28
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:22.820
if I act within the scope of my general reasonable authority,

29
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:25.430
you can Sue me for it. The actual, where they.

30
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.400
<v 1>Do something bad. What if you shoot somebody while you're operating? Like.</v>

31
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.690
<v 2>Right. So, so w the,</v>

32
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:32.630
the reason that qualified immunity as currently understood under Supreme court

33
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:36.080
doctrine is too broad, is because the, the standard used to be,

34
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.360
you would have to act as a reasonable police officer.

35
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.360
If you acted as a reasonable police officer, and you took a reasonable action,

36
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.480
right? Somebody went for their waistband, they had an object in there.

37
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:46.760
You didn't know if it was gun, you shot them, right?

38
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.480
You wouldn't presumably be sueable because that's still reasonable.

39
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.850
You track a guy down, you shoot him in the back, you know,

40
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.060
and then you plant the gun on him. That presumably would be sueable right.

41
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:58.510
He'd be personally liable. So the, the, the,

42
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.230
the way that Supreme court has done this,

43
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.980
they broadened qualified immunity to such an extent that you can still bottom

44
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:06.650
line. You can still get away with some bad stuff and not be sued for it.

45
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.330
So that needs to be curved. That's one thing,

46
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.050
second police union contracts need to be utterly ridden across the country

47
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.440
police union contracts, right now protect a lot of bad cops, right?

48
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:18.200
But because the police unions are designed to protect the members,

49
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.910
the members of the union, just like any other union.

50
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.300
And so what that means is that police unions,

51
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.150
I'm not a fan of public sector unions generally. Um,

52
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.140
but police unions need to be abridged in their ability to protect cops who do

53
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:31.220
something wrong. Third,

54
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:36.200
you need to have a national registry of cops who are disciplined for violation

55
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.890
of procedure,

56
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.280
so that they can't just leave LAPD and then go work for a Ferguson PD or

57
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:43.460
something. That those are some easy things that you could do right off the bat.

58
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.470
But the biggest thing right now,

59
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:49.070
the biggest factor in terms of lack of faith between police and,

60
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.470
and citizens really is the media,

61
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:55.490
because there's been a lot of talk about the racial constituency of police

62
00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:58.070
forces. The majority of the LAPD is minority.

63
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.190
The majority of the Baltimore is minority.

64
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.180
I believe that a huge percentage of the, of the Chicago PD is minority.

65
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.560
So it really is not about, you know,

66
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.870
lots of white cops in black neighborhoods in Baltimore.

67
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:09.340
It's a lot of black cops in black neighborhoods,

68
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.030
and that has not solved the problem of people mistrusting the police on an

69
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:13.864
endemic level.

70
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.500
<v 1>It's an inherently difficult job. It's, it's a rotten.</v>

71
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.800
<v 2>Job, man. I mean, I th I have nothing, but for, for good cops,</v>

72
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.470
those th they're heroes and the vast majority of cops are good cops and they're

73
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:24.030
heroes. Yeah.

74
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.480
<v 1>I read a meme the other day. That's very accurate. It said,</v>

75
00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:31.290
if you have 130 good cops and 12 cops,

76
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.800
you have 12 cops that are bad. You have 12 bad cops.

77
00:03:34.801 --> 00:03:38.970
If you have 130 good cops and 12 bad cops,

78
00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:43.260
but the hundred and 30 won't do anything about the 12 bad cops,

79
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:47.130
you've got 142 bad cops. Yeah. And, and I think that that's right.

80
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.240
I think that's right. I.

81
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.010
<v 2>Think that it is also true that our standard of what constitutes a bad cop has</v>

82
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.210
in some ways become much more stringent. So for example,

83
00:03:57.211 --> 00:04:00.540
there are cases that have become national stories in which a cop was labeled a

84
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:01.620
bad cop, and it wasn't a bad cop.

85
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.620
<v 3>Right. He put, there are bad cops for sure. Look.</v>

86
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.410
<v 1>Here's a great example. The,</v>

87
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.440
the cops that pushed down that old ban and where was it? Buffalo, New York. Is.

88
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.690
<v 3>That where it was granted? Yep. That's.</v>

89
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.590
<v 1>Crazy. I mean, and that's white on white crime, right? I mean,</v>

90
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.250
a is a white guy pushes this old man down.

91
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.060
And the most bonkers part about that was the way the president reacted.

92
00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:28.350
Like the way he felt seemed funny. Maybe he was Antifa. Maybe he was undercover.

93
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:32.790
Like there was literally the worst possible reaction to

94
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.410
watching an elderly senior citizen get pushed down by a young strong man. I.

95
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.720
<v 2>Mean, president Trump had the worst possible reaction to a thing,</v>

96
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.590
a thing I can't believe it. Yeah. I mean, unknown president Trump,

97
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.250
having bad reactions.

98
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.500
<v 1>To that, I'm a big supporter of law enforcement.</v>

99
00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:48.660
I have a lot of friends that are cops. I know a lot of friends,

100
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.930
not a lot of people from martial arts that are cops from the UFC.

101
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.280
I know a lot of cops from jujitsu knew a lot of cops growing up from all the

102
00:04:56.281 --> 00:04:58.620
different martial arts disciplines that I engage in.

103
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.620
A lot of cops get involved in that. There's a lot of good cops.

104
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:04.380
There's a lot of good people out there, but it is a insane job.

105
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.750
And so many of them have PTSD for.

106
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.320
<v 2>Sure. And,</v>

107
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.800
but I will say that one of the great myths is that the big threat to the black

108
00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:13.440
community in the United States is law enforcement. It's just nonsense.

109
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.290
It's not only nonsense. It's counterproductive nonsense. And you're seeing it.

110
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.840
<v 1>Play out right. It is a threat all the time.</v>

111
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.280
<v 2>It is on a data level and extraordinarily small threat law enforcement.</v>

112
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:26.790
And the law enforcement is a threat to black life on a generalized level is

113
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:27.690
extraordinarily small.

114
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:31.560
The Washington post database last year showed a grand total of 15 black

115
00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:35.790
Americans shot unarmed across the United States in a country of 42 million black

116
00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:37.020
people is.

117
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.290
<v 1>When it happens. It doesn't matter what the statistics are.</v>

118
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:44.130
If people see that video and that video gets shared 200 million times,

119
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.490
it looks like there's 200 million white.

120
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.410
<v 3>Cops killing a black guy. Well, and.</v>

121
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.380
<v 2>This is why I say that the media's treatment of this stuff is just horrific.</v>

122
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.530
Just the media it's it's social media, social,

123
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.060
social media has blown this stuff up.

124
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.980
And it's gotten to the point where if you say that's a horrible situation,

125
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.070
that's also an anecdotal situation. Here's some data. If you present the data,

126
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.740
it's like, well, you're are you ignoring? People's lived experiences.

127
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.330
That's racist. How can you present the data?

128
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:11.360
The data is the data doesn't take into account. The full story.

129
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.190
Nobody takes into account an awful lot of the story,

130
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:14.870
which is why it's called data, right?

131
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:19.250
Like I just don't anecdotal evidence is evidence of an anecdote.

132
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:21.410
It is not evidence of a broad national trend,

133
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.070
nor is it evidence that taking a broad national policy like cutting back funding

134
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:28.670
to the police in a time of rising crime is a good idea because you saw a video

135
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:29.960
on YouTube. I'm sorry.

136
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.850
<v 1>Agreed. That's a terrible idea. But when you look at these videos,</v>

137
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.760
the positive side, if there is any positive side,

138
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.830
is that it's they're accountable now. And this has been going on forever.

139
00:06:41.831 --> 00:06:43.120
If you talk to people that are black,

140
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:46.960
that grew up in poverty stricken areas,

141
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.130
they will tell you horrific stories about being abused by cops.

142
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.840
And I think the number's like 25% more likely a

143
00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.030
black person or brown person getting any sort of interaction with a

144
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:04.660
cop is 25% more likely to become physical or for them to be abused.

145
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.040
That's that's real, right? When you look at the statistics of them being killed,

146
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.920
yeah. White people get killed more by cops than black people,

147
00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:13.150
but there's way more white people.

148
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.810
<v 2>Even on a percentage basis. When you have to use the control group of crime,</v>

149
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.610
you can't use the control group of RA population.

150
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.030
So you have to look at people who are in situations where a deadly,

151
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.510
inter interaction is likely there've been multiple studies that show that black

152
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.000
people are not in more danger of being shot by cops than, than white people.

153
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:31.840
But it is true that low-level uses of force between cops and black people are

154
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:34.180
worse than low-level uses of force between cops and white people, right?

155
00:07:34.181 --> 00:07:35.290
That's the role in fire study.

156
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.200
There are a few confines that have yet to be sort of worked out. I think.

157
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.740
<v 1>Probably why people are less likely to believe that the cops gonna kill them.</v>

158
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.740
Whereas black people are probably convinced the cops going to kill them.

159
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.310
That might,

160
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.640
that might play a factor in why there's more white people being killed by cops.

161
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.691
<v 2>It may very well be true.</v>

162
00:07:49.691 --> 00:07:53.710
It may also be the low-level uses of forest is maybe a forest, maybe disparate.

163
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:56.260
If you think that the cops likely to be a racist,

164
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.270
then you might be more likely to resist the cop.

165
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.700
And then he might be more likely to rough you up. So it's,

166
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.790
it's very difficult to, to rub out the confounds there.

167
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.470
The one thing that we know for sure is that the greatest threat to black life,

168
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.830
just like the greatest threat to white life is members of your own race killing

169
00:08:11.831 --> 00:08:13.630
you. Like if you're talking about actual murders,

170
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.380
white people are killed by white people, black, black by people, you know,

171
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.180
mostly right. It's it's interracial,

172
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:22.210
right there is there there's very little interracial crime like black on white

173
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:25.390
or white on black in the United States. There's a lot of interracial crimes.

174
00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:27.430
A lot of white people, victimizing white people and black people,

175
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:30.280
victimizing black people. And the question is, how do you stop that?

176
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.070
This is why I don't know if you saw this interview is kind of an amazing

177
00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:36.910
interview. Terry crews, the actor he was on with his own Don lemon, right?

178
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.730
And Don lemon, uh, is doing the black lives matter.

179
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.620
Sloganing and Terry crews says, well, all lives matter. And Don lemon says,

180
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.390
but no black lives matter. Doesn't mean all black lives matter. Right?

181
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.440
But Terry crews had all black lives matter. And he said, no, no, no,

182
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.200
not all black lives matter. Only black lives matter.

183
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:55.890
We're only talking about police brutality right now. And Terry crews was like,

184
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.660
why aren't we talking about all black lives matter?

185
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.710
Because if black lives matter means you withdraw cops and withdrawn cops means

186
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:04.710
more dead black people, then why wouldn't those lives matter too?

187
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.350
And this is where the sloganeering gets in the way of actual progress because

188
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.150
ideology hits facts, right.

189
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.640
<v 1>It gets very weird. And Terry crews was called some terrible names for that.</v>

190
00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:20.780
But then a video surfaced of Don lemon from 2013, chastising.

191
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.210
<v 2>Me on that. Right. He sounds like me talking to sounds.</v>

192
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.350
<v 1>Exactly like you, it's hilarious. Pull your pants up, get your together.</v>

193
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.270
You know, like [inaudible] literally.

194
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.750
<v 2>Saying things like don't have babies out of wedlock, right? Stay in school,</v>

195
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.290
which by the way, again, all of this is common sensical and true for all races.

196
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.610
It is not just black people,

197
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.100
young white people in Appalachian need to get their together.

198
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.800
Everybody needs to get their. But again, young white.

199
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.460
<v 1>People in Appalachian dealing with the same thing what's around them all the</v>

200
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:48.980
time is crime people taking pills,

201
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.330
everyone having babies out of wedlock. People impoverished.

202
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.600
No hope, no, no potential for escape.
