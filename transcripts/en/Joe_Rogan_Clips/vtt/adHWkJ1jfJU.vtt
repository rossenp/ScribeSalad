1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.700
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You think about how many bets are placed? Oh,</v>

2
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:09.030
Jesus Christ. I mean, there's so much money, so much money.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.410
<v 1>Out there. People love to gamble, games. When games are on,</v>

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.680
people love to gamble. You think.

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.980
<v 0>Is spent this weekend. Jamie, come on, Jamie. My question.</v>

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.080
<v 1>Joey, like, why is that a problem?</v>

7
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.850
Like w w w what's helping us by letting them regulate that?

8
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.780
Like, why, why does that ha why do you have to have a license to gamble?

9
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.880
Why know if you think someone's not paying their taxes and you can prove it,

10
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.620
is it because it's money, it's cash that's been thrown around mostly. Like,

11
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:42.920
what, why is it an issue? The government's got not getting their piece.

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.010
It seems ridiculous that grown adults could tell other grown adults that can't

13
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:52.100
gamble, but you can hear, but you can't they're okay.

14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.660
<v 0>So things like legalization of marijuana, like legalization of,</v>

15
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.820
uh, cocaine, like legalization of anything, bro. You know what?

16
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.550
There's going to be winners. And there's going to be losers.

17
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.730
My friends two years ago, Connecticut did a,

18
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.260
did an expo say on 60 minutes about women who have just

19
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.300
lost their minds gambling at Mohican sun

20
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.950
because they installed no, no disrespect. The Mohican sun, a casino industries.

21
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.990
They installed these type of slot machines that could just

22
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.970
with your mind. What?

23
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.230
So these women were going down there and losing mortgages

24
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.400
houses. You know, I was like a John Waters movie,

25
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.830
the dog dog. It was just something that listen to

26
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.990
[inaudible].

27
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.880
<v 2>Let's get something out of the way.</v>

28
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.920
<v 0>The biggest, uh,</v>

29
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.270
percentage of the generate gamblers are usually women let's look this

30
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.460
percentage up here. Women.

31
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.880
<v 2>Go deep. That's a hole.</v>

32
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.930
They don't give a about nothing. They, they play cards.

33
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.240
Women bang.

34
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.350
<v 0>It out. Wow. And they bang it out while you're at work, Joe Rogan,</v>

35
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:11.300
while I'm at work, they start with a horse. Then they go to this, you know,

36
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:14.750
those little pros they do in Jersey where they think they, when you know,

37
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:18.530
when Atlantic city was Atlantic city, you went to union city, right?

38
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.700
You pay 15 bucks to get on a bus. They gave you a coupon book.

39
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.970
And when you get to Alexa, they give it $15 and quarters back.

40
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.690
So that basically driving you to gamble and drive back.

41
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.710
I believe in gambling, I believe in making your living.

42
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:37.190
I believe that it's an itch. It's an illness, whatever.

43
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:39.200
But when you're losing your house

44
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.810
has got that's where I want to know where that's, where it bothers me.

45
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.780
It's just like, okay, it's just like, I'm drug abuse.

46
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.230
It's just like the opiate problem. It's just like any thing else.

47
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.760
It could you and I both know people who have lost their

48
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.860
lives gambling. Okay. You've seen people pool halls.

49
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.900
You see how they get Joe Rogan.

50
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.680
There's no difference in the drug addict and the gambling addict. Not at all.

51
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.753
It's no different.

52
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.440
<v 1>There. It's just a scary too, because they're conscious. It's like,</v>

53
00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:13.560
if you see the drug addict, you see him he's shooting up or whatever it is.

54
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:16.710
And you see him fainting, you go, oh, that poor bastard.

55
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.950
But when you see a guy who's fully in the grips of gambling,

56
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.900
trying to figure out how to make, get his money back.

57
00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:24.600
And he's all jazzed up with adrenaline. He doesn't understand why.

58
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.680
<v 0>There's gamblers like Michael Jordan. Then there's gamblers like Joey Diaz,</v>

59
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.860
there's gamblers who have the means to gamble.

60
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.810
And that is a killer. Also like a Michael Jordan, like Michael Jordan.

61
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.960
<v 2>And I'm not saying nothing bad. I'm a Michael Jordan accusations.</v>

62
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.340
<v 0>That you hear that he even bets on his own one-on-one basketball games.</v>

63
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.840
Like he was very, uh, he was very, uh, competitive. Oh yeah.

64
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.820
But now how Joey Diaz was doing it, not how people Charles Barkley.

65
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.140
<v 1>Lost nearly $30 million gambling. It says, Jesus,</v>

66
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.950
uh, Joey, how much money has child money?

67
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.880
<v 0>How many people did you grow up with that will like Joey Diaz.</v>

68
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.860
Now that I have the means that when 19 years old, okay.

69
00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:15.450
And one night they put a 10 times better than a Nick game. And they won $50.

70
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:18.750
When you're 19 $50 is a lot of money. That's a lot of fun.

71
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.990
So now you think you got the world by the balls. So you do it again on Friday,

72
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:24.420
Saturday, and now you enter this world,

73
00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:29.070
Joe Rogan that gets dark it's it's uh, instead of the,

74
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.950
uh, drug addiction or the alcohol addiction every morning,

75
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:34.380
you wake up like is today my lucky day.

76
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.490
It's like the people who go to the seven 11 every day.

77
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.140
And you're trying to just get a pack of Rowan papers. You you're just in a rush,

78
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.080
you just left your Jitsi. You just want rolling papers and border.

79
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.360
There's a guy in front of you. And he's telling you, give me 360 8, 4 60 fours.

80
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.530
And this poor whatever gives them 20 lottery tickets.

81
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.490
And it's $118. This is what this guy is doing every day,

82
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:02.310
seven days a week, my friend, and he bite me.

83
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.950
He might be winning $200 a week,

84
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.630
but every week he's getting deeper and deeper into a hole. Because in your mind,

85
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:13.080
you think today's your lucky day. And it's never you're luck.

86
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.220
I was in that hole when I was 19 dog. And I saw a friend lose.

87
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.800
<v 3>80,000.</v>

88
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.230
<v 0>When you're 18 years old and he had to get three jobs.</v>

89
00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:25.200
And I never really with that. Again, I learned that addiction,

90
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.820
that left my world early. You know, who's the degenerate loser gambler,

91
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.500
John Gotti. He wanted because they brag, right?

92
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.900
That's that conversation. They may.

93
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.070
<v 2>Get away from me. You know, I have no idea.</v>

94
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.600
If I had Michigan in the hook, I would have made 30,000.

95
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.980
<v 0>They lose 80,</v>

96
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:51.750
90 200,000 a weekend that the system is

97
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:55.650
designed to bury the degenerate gambler.

98
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.030
Like from, from August 15th.

99
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.853
<v 1>Look at this</v>

100
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.030
John Gotti secret obsession that weighed 600 bets in Scrabble and a

101
00:06:07.031 --> 00:06:11.800
$3,000 monopoly. Buy-in no idea,

102
00:06:11.801 --> 00:06:16.210
guys. We did the generous for like eight for like seven months.

103
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.310
<v 0>I played this ugly game, Joe, that I would start.</v>

104
00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:25.600
I knew the action. I knew that you had a bet on Monday nights and try to win.

105
00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:29.500
And you know what I lost every week and all these people who sell you

106
00:06:29.501 --> 00:06:33.790
information, listen, arch Litesa played the game.

107
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:34.960
Lost Pete rose,

108
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.250
Baton lost even Michael Jordan button lost there's rumors.

109
00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:43.210
That that's why he was asked to play baseball for a few years because it was a

110
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.520
cover up again. I did not write this. This is just things I hear on the road.

111
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.770
Everybody has a boat.

112
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.730
Gambling grabs you weird, bro. Weird.

113
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.340
And they grabbed me for a long time. I kept picking.

114
00:06:57.341 --> 00:07:01.030
That was the day and I kept betting 40 times. What's up Jamie.

115
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.850
<v 4>If they had a problem playing Scrabble,</v>

116
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:05.830
they would call up the Parker brothers hotline.

117
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.390
Dick mobsters would to dispute the rules and have them explain what those

118
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.603
what's. The.

119
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.510
<v 2>Kia is a word he's playing me. Now. It's a word joke.</v>

120
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.030
Stop. Minkah is not a word. Stop. Minky is the word. Wiki, Wiki,

121
00:07:25.031 --> 00:07:27.730
Wiki dude. He told me I used to stop me.

122
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.970
That's why they would get into arguments about garbage man,

123
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.790
garbage man cafe.

124
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.730
<v 0>You know, uh, oh my God.</v>

125
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.880
Gambling is a nightmare.

126
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.830
And once you get caught in the web and you enjoy rogue and it shuts me down,

127
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.050
then I start putting bats with Jamie.

128
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.820
And then pretty soon I start puking, dipping into accounts.

129
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.530
And pretty soon now you're done. Now you get forced into a bad hand.

130
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.730
<v 1>Told you that I was a backer on the road for a while. My friend, Johnny B,</v>

131
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.950
when I started making money doing stand up,

132
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.790
I put together a little bank roll and me and him would go places and gamble.

133
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.800
And, uh, he would win or lose, you know, sometimes he'd win, sometimes lose,

134
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.610
but it was just, uh, being an action. It was fun. You know,

135
00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:19.240
that kind of gambling. Like I was never good enough to like play those guys,

136
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.830
but I could play like people that were like my level and he'd bet like 20 bucks.

137
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:26.410
Or maybe if you want to get crazy about like 50 bucks.

138
00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:30.220
I never bet like a lot of money gambling on pool, but it makes you think more.

139
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.520
It makes you play like way more serious. It's good for your game.

140
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.840
And if you can have a friendly sparring partner, they play like friendly games,

141
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.190
like maybe a, a race to seven for 20 bucks.

142
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.880
So it's cost you probably in any city pool halls.

143
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.350
I don't know what the rate is per hour,

144
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.440
but they gotta be like at least 20 bucks once.

145
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.570
<v 0>And for all, I want you to break it down for me.</v>

146
00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.390
I walk into a pool hall with Jamie. Yeah. I got 10 GS cash in my pocket.

147
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.590
Jamie's my main man. How do I exactly make money?

148
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:08.160
And why is it that the people in the room pass money around?

149
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.560
And how does that money get dispersed?

150
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.710
<v 1>It was real simple. Everybody puts like you put in I'm in for 120 matches.</v>

151
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.290
Like it depends on who's putting it together.

152
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.900
Cause they might decide to just pooling all their money.

153
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.500
Like everybody put in on one side pooling money and you know,

154
00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:27.830
and back this guy or they might be betting on the side.

155
00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:29.270
They might not even be playing the game.

156
00:09:29.271 --> 00:09:33.740
There's always side bets side bets are probably more like if you had a bet,

157
00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:38.240
if you had like a big pool game, right in a, they used to be a place called, uh,

158
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.000
w west end billiards.

159
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.660
I think in New Jersey west end,

160
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.660
I think it was called if found west end billiards,

161
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.340
it was a world famous pool hall. We would take the drive from, um,

162
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.560
from New York to go down to New Jersey,

163
00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:59.330
to this famous pool hall that would have these like serious high level

164
00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:04.070
professionals play there and real high level hustlers from all over the country.

165
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.660
We'd go there for big money games.

166
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.710
You go there and watch people play for $5,000, $10,000.

167
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.200
I mean the best in the world would be there all the time.

168
00:10:12.201 --> 00:10:15.110
I got to play against some of the best in the world. They killed me,

169
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.740
but I got to play against him against him. Like real good guys.

170
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.290
You send to the tournament, you and I,

171
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:23.780
and you and I are in the tournament and you are, uh,

172
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.820
Efrin Rayez like the greatest of all time or Earl Stricklin or Johnny Archer.

173
00:10:28.821 --> 00:10:31.460
And I'm just Joe Rogan. I, I barely could play it. Doesn't matter.

174
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.800
I put my money up. I enter the tournament.

175
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.230
I can play against you unless it's a huge, huge,

176
00:10:36.231 --> 00:10:37.640
like where you have to get invited.

177
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.370
<v 0>Does Joey Diaz come on the side and go, listen,</v>

178
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.320
I'm putting three to one odds on this.

179
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.850
<v 2>Sure. Some people definitely. Definitely. That's a side. Yes. I that's all,</v>

180
00:10:46.851 --> 00:10:48.590
I don't know how the pool, we got a hundred bucks.

181
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.490
<v 1>On Archer. You know, you'd never seen this Diaz kid play.</v>

182
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.530
I got a hundred on Diaz and dudes I'll take that. I'll take that.

183
00:10:54.531 --> 00:10:56.930
And then you just work it out and everybody works it out.

184
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.560
But when sometimes guys will get together and back somebody to like, say,

185
00:11:00.561 --> 00:11:03.020
if you got it like a friend, that's a really good player.

186
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.320
And this guy's coming in from out of town and he wants to take a crack at him

187
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.350
and go, well, he wants to play a hundred dollars sets. Okay.

188
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:11.020
And then you have to think how many barrels do we have?

189
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.580
You pool your money together? Okay. We've got four barrels.

190
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.030
That means if he wants to play sets, we can lose four times.

191
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.820
So you have to be able to lose a couple of gain a couple.

192
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.490
Like if you're going to really play a guy out, these guys would play 10,

193
00:11:22.491 --> 00:11:26.740
12 hours. Then we keep going back and forth and back and forth. It's it's,

194
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.770
it's crazy. Like I've seen guys and you would see him the next day.

195
00:11:30.771 --> 00:11:32.900
They'd still be playing. You'd go there in the morning.

196
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:36.440
They'd be playing all through the night. I don't know what the they were on.

197
00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:39.310
Most likely, some sort of amphetamines. That was a big thing.

198
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.010
The pool world for a while, guys would just break each other with gambling.

199
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.670
It would just, it would be about who quits it wouldn't be about who won.

200
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.330
It's very rarely about like, you know, like you would, you'd be,

201
00:11:50.331 --> 00:11:54.940
you would be frowned upon highly. If you left on top,

202
00:11:55.210 --> 00:12:00.040
say if you're ahead by 500 bucks and you want to quit me and I,

203
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.460
and I'm still ready, ready to keep playing. I still got more money, man.

204
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:07.390
Let me win my money back. If you just walked away. Nope, I've got what I wanted.

205
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:08.590
I'm going to leave now.

206
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.770
Like that would be you you'd be what's called bad action. Or.

207
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.830
<v 0>Guys, I got two kids. I have to get up at seven and go in the pool.</v>

208
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.440
<v 1>Hall with two kids. You're not playing that kind of pool. There.</v>

209
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:21.550
Ain't nobody with two kids playing that level pool in pool halls like gambling

210
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:24.040
and hustle pool. Maybe now there are, there's actually a few guys.

211
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.250
I take that back. There's a few guys with kids that, uh,

212
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.120
are top of the food chain. There's a pool hall.

213
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.810
<v 0>Mile from my house. Whenever I get,</v>

214
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.290
whenever I go into Hollywood now I can't do Laurel canyon no more.

215
00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:38.310
So I got to go a long way and I get off on victory just to see it,

216
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.290
always fell with the generates. I'm petrified to pull in there. Some.

217
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.570
<v 1>Places were home to me. You know which.</v>

218
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.390
<v 0>One I'm talking about right next to the strip club? Is that.</v>

219
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.790
<v 1>Is that on victory, victory, right?</v>

220
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.850
<v 0>When you exit that is a strip club right next to a pool.</v>

221
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.840
<v 1>Well, I know the only good one in this area. I shouldn't say the only good one.</v>

222
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.750
The only good one that I know of is house of billiards and Sherman Oaks.

223
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.160
I like this area. Have.

224
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.420
<v 0>You been, this is great,</v>

225
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.920
but on the one-on-one have you seen what that place is that where you took me

226
00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:12.450
there? A couple of times to eat. We did Kami there. Member Holly would Billy,

227
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:17.130
as you took me there, it's a building.

228
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.090
What is it now to go there next time? What does it look like? I don't Joe,

229
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.090
the next time I drove by and I was like, oh my God,

230
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.910
we did comedy there to.

231
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.880
<v 5>Eat there with aria. We played pool there. A bond</v>

232
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.453
at that place was.

233
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.380
<v 0>Done. That whole area is completely. That's where I'm at crazy max. I really.</v>

234
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.450
<v 1>Like that. Dude can play some. Yeah. And pool.</v>

235
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.150
<v 0>Woo. So when you play max app, how much drive to put up there? I still pull up.</v>

236
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:47.130
Well, I would get.

237
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.410
<v 1>Tortured. You would have to bet like that. I would go to,</v>

238
00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:53.160
you're never going to bet on me. Like a guy like max Eberly.

239
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.670
He's top of the food chain. As far as his technique and delivery,

240
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.420
he could win a world championship tournament, like legitimately. He's that good?

241
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.280
I have no chance. Like if we play 12 games, I might win a couple.

242
00:14:05.281 --> 00:14:07.710
I might get lucky and win a few. Maybe I'll win four.

243
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.070
He's going to win way more. He's going to get to 12 for sure. Quicker.

244
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.730
It'd be a terrible bet. The bet would be how many games do I get to?

245
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.100
That'd be the bat. If you say, uh,

246
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.940
you'll never get past three because a guy like max Abla can run 10 racks in a

247
00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:23.010
row and I'm not exaggerating. I've seen him do it.

248
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.630
Blam brakes runs 10 racks in a row. But to the point where you're sitting there,

249
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.520
he did it in Vegas. We were all hanging out. I think it was man. Was it Ari?

250
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.700
I forget who came with me?

251
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.980
<v 0>I forget guys. You're going to the Italian place.</v>

252
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:42.300
<v 1>Yes. That place is amazing. And that's exactly what max max was playing.</v>

253
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.410
He would break and run out on guys and they would just get frustrated.

254
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:49.650
They'd be like, what the, man. They just get, didn't get to shoot.

255
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:54.140
We watched him. He was some guy. And when the set was over,

256
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:58.790
the guy was just off. Cause matches would miss. It was crazy.

257
00:14:58.791 --> 00:14:59.624
Just watch him.

258
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.640
He's playing a guy that really just wanted to take a chance and play like a top

259
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:06.470
of the food chain guy. And he gambled with him.

260
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.430
But just watching the difference between a kid who can play a little pool is

261
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:14.450
pretty good versus a world championship caliber pool play.

262
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.770
They're so precise.

263
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:20.750
Like his technique is so clean and his angles are perfect and he's just effort

264
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.960
effortlessly move in the cue ball on the table to where he wants it.

265
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.530
He sees clusters and problems way in advance and breaks them up.

266
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:31.610
It's so high level. That's my boy. That's max, Albert Lee.

267
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.400
He taught me how to play pool. Uh,

268
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.070
not that I didn't already play it before I met him,

269
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.560
but he taught me how to play it way better, way better.

270
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.160
He made my game way more, uh, technical.

271
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.950
He was explaining things that I was just guessing before.

272
00:15:45.951 --> 00:15:48.860
And he was explaining what was wrong with my approach. And like,

273
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:51.350
what was the what's what's a better way to do it. He's a wizard.

274
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:52.490
When it comes to technique.

275
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.680
<v 0>Now he can make a living going from pool hall to pool hall or no way.</v>

276
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.670
Cause he's.

277
00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.880
<v 1>Well, he's an artist too. Fortunately for max, he, uh,</v>

278
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.490
he makes pretty cool artwork, like, um, a lot.

279
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.850
See it's some of it's probably on his Instagram. [inaudible].

280
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.890
<v 5>No, no, no, no. Max that does.</v>

281
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.350
<v 0>Pull Hughes. Who does poke you somebody along the way.</v>

282
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:17.320
I said he makes like eight. [inaudible] Eric, Chris.

283
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.530
That's my boy, Eric from [inaudible].

284
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:25.390
<v 1>That's what I play with. I play with his cue. His cue is a, he's a wizard man.</v>

285
00:16:25.391 --> 00:16:28.990
He's a guy who's like really into like the grains of woods.

286
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.590
He's really into like patterns. And he thinks of like, to him,

287
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.480
wood is like mesmerizing.

288
00:16:34.481 --> 00:16:39.220
He finds like the most beautiful pieces of wood and con combines them

289
00:16:39.221 --> 00:16:41.950
together. And they have to have a certain harmonic frequency.

290
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.430
Like he drops them on a cement floor, just like dink dink.

291
00:16:45.431 --> 00:16:48.970
Like he wants to hear a certain sound from the wood. Otherwise he won't use it.

292
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.090
He's like finding logs on the side of the highway and and recognizing some weird

293
00:16:55.091 --> 00:16:56.650
hardwood that no one's ever used before.

294
00:16:56.651 --> 00:16:59.320
And he cuts it up and makes a cue out of it. He's a wizard.

295
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.210
Like his cues are for any, he doesn't give a. He makes as many as he wants.

296
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.550
He w you know, sometimes you don't make them for awhile.

297
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.510
Makes them for his friends. Won't let me pay for one.

298
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.880
After I have to pay for everything, just to not feel terrible.

299
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.750
He's like the nicest guy ever play some pool too.

300
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:24.880
<v 0>So I don't even know when this podcast started Amazon it's happening before we</v>

301
00:17:24.881 --> 00:17:29.110
started, we were talking about, uh, yeah, 4.8 billion. Oh my goodness.

302
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.030
Yeah. 3%.

303
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.570
<v 1>Will happen in Nevada. Only 3%. So most of it online.</v>

304
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.020
<v 5>Online was that Chris Christie thing, you pulled up earlier, Jamie.</v>

305
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.260
<v 0>Listen online and banks, banks.</v>

306
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.550
There's still people who are like, uh, you know, they have,

307
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.690
they got a ton of loot.

308
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.740
<v 1>Chris Christie goes to the Supreme court on betting.</v>

309
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:51.210
Is he trying to get sports betting.

310
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.270
<v 4>Legalized? They passed something in New Jersey,</v>

311
00:17:53.271 --> 00:17:56.960
I think in 2011 to allow betting and sports,

312
00:17:56.961 --> 00:17:59.630
but it's still only allowed in Vegas because of whatever law there is.

313
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.890
<v 1>I'm back on your team, Chris. All right. So he has a Supreme, a few problems,</v>

314
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.540
but we all do 17.

315
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.850
<v 4>States also with them on this. I think they want to do it.</v>

316
00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.940
<v 0>So he won. He opposed it or he's.</v>

317
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.960
<v 4>They wanted, again,</v>

318
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.300
they want betting again because they have an NHL team in Vegas.

319
00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:17.810
And that's always been like the, the logic is that there'll be some issue,

320
00:18:17.811 --> 00:18:20.090
whatever you can't be betting where their sports being played,

321
00:18:20.091 --> 00:18:21.290
because someone will throw the game.

322
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.470
<v 1>Everybody should be able to bet every city she'll do whatever you want. Right.</v>
