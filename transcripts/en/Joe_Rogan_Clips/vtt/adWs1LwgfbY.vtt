<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.710
What was your experience like the whole SNL debacle thing? What was that like?

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.270
A very, very crazy. I don't know. It's tough to,

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.470
there's not many people that have, you can even talk to about it, you know?

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.680
Cause it you up a little, like it makes you like, uh,

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.870
not trust people and for awhile. Like in what way? I don't know.

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.770
I don't know how to explain it. It's but back to the main,

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.310
the experience of it was like, you just, uh,

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.290
it was kind of surreal because I went from,

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.260
I was one of the first people to get like canceled or however you want to say it

11
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:39.870
consequences. However, yeah.

12
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.410
However you want to say it doesn't matter what we call it. It is what it, but,

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.690
uh, I was one of the first people to go from. I was doing, I was poor.

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.640
I was not famous at all. I was poor. And then I got canceled immediately.

15
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.600
Like that was my like, right. It was a very different experience.

16
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.420
And then get close to the get canceled or yeah,

17
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.840
you got canceled on the way I got canceled immediately. Yeah. They,

18
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.570
they literally were like, how about this guy? And everyone was like, no.

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.120
So you got cast on SNL? Yes. And then what happened? Um,

20
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.340
so I found out I was getting on SNL the day before they announced it.

21
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.260
They got a call. They're like, Hey,

22
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:23.310
we want to put you on the cast the whole time I was we'll start from the top,

23
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.550
my agents and all those people, they were like, you're do you want to audit?

24
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.400
Or do you want to write, do you want to send a packet in for SNL?

25
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.370
And I was like, no, I'm not going to be a writer. I'm never going to,

26
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.990
I won't work on that show.

27
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.040
And then I guess they saw me at JFL and comedy central thing.

28
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.560
And they were like, we like him. We want him to audition.

29
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.180
He can come straight into audition.

30
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.080
So I went straight to the main stage for the audition and the whole time leading

31
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:52.650
up to it, I was like, I'm never, I'm never going to get this. I don't care.

32
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.130
I want to do standup. I kind of hated SNL at that point,

33
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.480
because every time every sketch was like, you know, you know what it is.

34
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.730
And then I was like, I'll never fit in there. And then when we,

35
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:07.200
when you go to audition, it's just,

36
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.520
you just wait your turn in a green room and they keep you there extra long for

37
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:16.230
like two or three hours to like make you nervous. But I knew I was certain,

38
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:18.690
I was never going to get it. And I really wasn't nervous.

39
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:22.770
I was in there dip and hanging out. And then they were like, all right,

40
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:25.260
it's your turn to go. But that's when the nerves hit,

41
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:28.650
like you walk in and you see the main stage because that's what you audition on

42
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.430
is like the stage. And it's a totally empty studio.

43
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:36.030
The whole room is empty except for a table of like writers and producers and

44
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.043
Lauren Michaels.

45
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.090
And then you go on and they're like three to go do five minutes. Wow.

46
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.230
In front of just the camera. Right. Are you doing stand up? I did stand up. Wow.

47
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.140
I did five minutes of stand up. That's all. And then, uh,

48
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.420
I ran into Michael Che that night and I was like, I was so nervous.

49
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:56.340
Like I was so nervous when I was auditioning. Then I had to like,

50
00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:59.350
hold the mic against my chin because my hand was shaking.

51
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.270
There's no one in the room.

52
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.200
You just have to do stand up for five minutes to no one. That's so weird.

53
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:06.011
It was so, and,

54
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:09.520
and you're not supposed to look at or acknowledge the table of writers and

55
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.060
producers or.

56
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.920
<v 1>Whatever. They have rules.</v>

57
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.070
<v 0>They have rules. They have rules that your agents tell you.</v>

58
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.800
They never told you any rules. So your.

59
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.870
<v 1>Agent says, do not look at the writers.</v>

60
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.540
<v 0>Yeah. They're like, don't even acknowledge them. Pretend the room's full,</v>

61
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.530
just go. And everybody was like, they're never going to laugh the table, Lauren,

62
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:28.660
all of them, they're not going to laugh. First thing I said,

63
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:30.370
they all started laughing and it was like,

64
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.340
I was supposed to not acknowledge them, but you know, I was doing standards.

65
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.500
So what you said? No, I don't genuinely,

66
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.880
he just, just did a bit. Yeah, it was just, yeah, I was nervous. Uh,

67
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.210
but as soon as they started laughing, I was like, and then went back to,

68
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:48.730
you know what I mean? I was like looking at him. I could see they were laughing.

69
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:52.210
And I was told the whole time, no, one's going to laugh. They were laughing.

70
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:55.660
And I was like, oh. I did pretty good. Ran into Jay that night. I was like,

71
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.960
I sucked. I was nervous. He was like, no, you were, that was good.

72
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.080
Then a couple days later,

73
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:05.290
you get a call back and you go in to the office and you meet everybody and you

74
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:06.640
walk around and talk to everybody.

75
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.100
And the people I was with that were also doing that.

76
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.340
Then you go into Lauren Michael's office to meet him.

77
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.190
So the three people I was with, they all went in, slowly, met him,

78
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.210
left one guy didn't even get invited in. They just send them home, which is up.

79
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.380
They invited him to the callback and then we're like, no, nevermind. Wow.

80
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.550
And then they kept me there for an extra hour by myself.

81
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.210
And I was just sitting there like, oh, I got this. Like, I'm going to be on it.

82
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:37.270
Like, this is, I can't believe I got this. I wasn't even excited.

83
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:41.020
I was just like, this is wild. This is nuts.

84
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.280
And then I go into meet with Lauren and he's, he's the man. He's a nice guy.

85
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.540
And he was like, I'm going to use you, but I don't know how.

86
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.110
And like all that. And then time passes.

87
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:56.290
And I figured they were going to ask me to be a writer because that's usually

88
00:04:56.291 --> 00:05:00.400
how it goes. Usually you work on the show to experience what the shows like,

89
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.940
but I don't know. I didn't want to be a writer.

90
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.930
<v 1>By all accounts. That places a den of thieves, everybody. Yeah.</v>

91
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.190
I've den of thieves.

92
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.350
You hear Jim brewers accounted the climate in that place and it's

93
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:17.530
horrific. Yeah. They're all stealing from writers.

94
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.510
They're stealing from performers.

95
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.120
If you're a writer and you submit your packages,

96
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:25.960
the higher up writers will steal your according to brewer. Yeah.

97
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.280
If you submit a package, they own that package. Even if they don't hire you.

98
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.040
I know that. So if you have some great premises,

99
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.830
they decided that just going to take your premises and not hire you. They,

100
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.780
they own all those bits. Yeah.

101
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.400
<v 0>That's crazy. I mean, yeah. I don't, I don't, I don't,</v>

102
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.130
I don't care about writing. I didn't want to be a writer. So I was like, if,

103
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.850
even if they offer me the writing thing, I was like, I don't want to take it.

104
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.880
I think I would have at the time. But anyway, they,

105
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.120
they asked me to go straight to cast. So I was like, yeah,

106
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.060
I'll definitely do that. Lauren calls says, Hey,

107
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.450
we want to use you on the show. We're going to announce it tomorrow.

108
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.890
He was like, do you have anything? Uh, you want us to check out?

109
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.890
Like they have people that vet you. Right. But they,

110
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:11.540
they're not used to people having podcasts.

111
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.040
<v 1>Right. So they'd have to go through.</v>

112
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.280
<v 0>Honey. They go through your Facebook, your Instagram, your Twitter.</v>

113
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.810
I was just like, I'll just delete all that. I don't care. Delete it. All right.

114
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.720
But I was like, I also have a podcast. And they're like, yeah, what's that?

115
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:28.250
And I was like, I don't know. I say like gay and retard a lot, like were like,

116
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.000
oh, that's fine. Don't worry about it. So I was like, all right, we'll see.

117
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.770
And uh, so the day they announced it it's, uh, it was,

118
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.090
it was cool. It was very cool.

119
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.760
You hear from everybody you've ever grown up with, they're all like, holy.

120
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.970
Which is like, I can't believe you're on this. And then,

121
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:47.300
so that lasted for about like three hours before an article came out.

122
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.640
That was like, here's what this guy says.

123
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.460
There's was a clip of me saying something, you know, unsavory stuff. Yeah.

124
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.503
<v 1>But talking.</v>

125
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.920
<v 0>It was, it was the one podcast we ever filmed.</v>

126
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.170
That's the one they used and it just happened. And it was funny too.

127
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.870
Cause people like, man, they really had to dig to find this. I was like,

128
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:10.310
that was probably like three minutes in.

129
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.030
We had one podcast online and it was three minutes in.

130
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.900
<v 1>And it's what we were saying earlier. That's what podcasts are.</v>

131
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.610
And that's what comics do a lot. We talk.

132
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.920
It doesn't mean you really mean those things.

133
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:25.340
But the idea today is that talking is not real.

134
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.400
They want to take out of context,

135
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.260
phrases and sentences that you've used and put them in quotes and make you look

136
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:34.010
like a monster.

137
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.650
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. For sure. It was only one.</v>

138
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.520
<v 1>Article that came out.</v>

139
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.240
<v 0>No, there was quite a few, so many articles. I was,</v>

140
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.600
I think it was number one on Twitter for like three straight days. Wow.

141
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.890
Just getting a visceral. Read it all. I read all. Oh no.

142
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.260
Everybody was like stop reading. Cause I still read comments.

143
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:55.550
I read every comment why? I don't know. Oh, it's it's up.

144
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.650
And it's crazy too. Cause I'll read like 90 good ones and then one bad one,

145
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:03.260
one bad one will you up. Just depends which one it is. Right. You know,

146
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.700
I'll get called like a, you know, fat retard constantly. I'll be like,

147
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.950
whatever I can, I can walk through that. No problem.

148
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.910
But then there'll be one that's like he's near like something,

149
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.120
something where they get you where they, they know you. Yeah.

150
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.880
Like he laughs at his own jokes on every podcast. I was like, oh

151
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.080
Right. Anyway.

152
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.940
So I get all that stuff comes out and it was funny.

153
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:29.481
This is funny.

154
00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:34.160
I went into Lauren's Laura Michael's office and he was talking and I was

155
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:35.240
convinced I was getting fired.

156
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.660
Like I knew I was getting fired because if they didn't get me on that,

157
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:41.660
there's so much more, so much worse.

158
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.760
And so he was talking to me and he was like, no, we think we can.

159
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.260
He's like, if we just get you to the first episode, like people will see,

160
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:56.160
you're not a piece of person. Right. Just talk and was like, whatever I'll do.

161
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.170
If I just, if I get fired here, whatever, I'll just go do Joe Rogan next week.

162
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:05.940
And I'll be fine. Anyway. I thought that was funny. No,

163
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.040
what? I was like, ah, I literally thought I literally thought that. Oh, okay.

164
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.000
Yeah. I thought it'd be funny.

165
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.780
<v 1>Well, it could have been funny. Yeah. I was booked up though. No.</v>

166
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.550
<v 0>Was fine.</v>

167
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:21.090
It was just funny to truly that was a conversation I actually had

168
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.990
really even Lorne Michaels office in the middle of that. That's hilarious.

169
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.610
I was in pure pear. Yeah. Yeah.

170
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.073
But.

171
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.520
<v 1>'Cause I remember somebody contacted me like to have you on. And I was like,</v>

172
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:39.630
I don't have any room. Like for a long could do like an emergency podcast,

173
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:43.380
but I'm like this dude ride this out and then we'll do one eventually.

174
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.000
<v 0>Really glad that that did not happen. Cause I would have come in emotional,</v>

175
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:53.040
come in guns blazing. And I never felt that way.

176
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:54.060
Like the whole time I was like.

177
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.960
<v 1>I got to get it. When someone gets really canceled, you need perspective. Yeah.</v>

178
00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.490
You need, you know what it's like, it's like,

179
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:01.680
you need that venom to work its way through your system.

180
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.690
And then you develop a certain amount of immunity to the actual moment. Yeah.

181
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.490
<v 0>Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. It was, it ended up being a good thing. So.</v>

182
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.290
<v 1>When Lauren pulls you in the office and says,</v>

183
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:16.320
we just have to get you to the stage, we just have to get you to an episode.

184
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.213
Then what happens?

185
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.420
<v 0>It just, it just kept, it just kept steamrolling. Like it never,</v>

186
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:23.730
it didn't dissipate at all. Like it kept being like, no,

187
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:25.650
you guys need to fire them. And.

188
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.190
<v 1>That's where the fun is the fun.</v>

189
00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:33.420
And going after someone is not going after someone and then no consequences that

190
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:38.370
makes them sad. Yeah. What's makes them happy so they can get you fired. Yeah.

191
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.890
<v 0>And that's yeah, they did. They did a good job. Yeah. Yeah. And it's fine.</v>

192
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:44.940
Look the whole time.

193
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.150
<v 1>Here's why it's fine. Your sketches that you're doing,</v>

194
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.100
what does it Ghillean keeps. Yeah.

195
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.760
Those are the best comedy sketches that are on the internet right now.

196
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.260
I'm not bullshitting the only thing that's at the same level as Kyle Dunnigan.

197
00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.790
Oh, Kyle's done again.

198
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:04.440
The he's doing because he's got a massive advantage with that face swap.

199
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.030
<v 0>Though. And he's so good at he's an.</v>

200
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.830
<v 1>Impression he's amazing. His,</v>

201
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:12.480
if you've seen the new thing that Dunnigan is doing, he's done the, what is it?

202
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.840
The F he does a fresh prince take off with Biden. What.

203
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.840
<v 0>Is it called? Yeah. Fresh prince of DC. Some fresh.</v>

204
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.030
<v 1>Like that. Fresh pres yeah, dude. It's it's tear jerking.</v>

205
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.330
Who's bill Maher. Oh my God. It's incredible new rule.

206
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.290
<v 0>It just, oh.</v>

207
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:28.950
<v 1>My God.</v>

208
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.640
And it's just something about it that it's almost got like a south park S

209
00:11:32.641 --> 00:11:37.170
quality to it because it looks so fake, but it's obvious. It's like,

210
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.090
it's like these things like,

211
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.170
look how bad these little tiny hand he holds up for bill Maher.

212
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.860
Like the face swap thing is amazing.

213
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.970
It really is amazing because he's like, look at AOC.

214
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.320
Cause it looks so fake.

215
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:57.250
Like you would never believe that that's the real person. So it's comedic,

216
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.960
but it's also the materials. Brilliant.

217
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.680
And you can get away with so much in someone else's voice when everybody knows

218
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:06.810
it's not really that person.

219
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.240
It's really one of the most genius platforms ever created. Yeah.

220
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.590
And he's the master, him and him and Kurt Medsker Kurt is, they're incredible.

221
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:15.910
They're they're both. Yeah.

222
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.700
<v 0>It's the best. Kurt's like one of my he's one of my favorite.</v>

223
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.290
<v 1>Comedians. The you're doing is right up there with that. It's really funny, man.</v>

224
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.100
It's really funny. And it's like something you would never be able to do on SNL.

225
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.090
The stuff you guys are doing, how are you financing this stuff? Uh.

226
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.930
<v 0>I financed half and then we had a production company that finance half.</v>

227
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.310
<v 1>The Trump one was may the trumps speed dating.</v>

228
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.450
<v 0>Yeah. It's John McKeever.</v>

229
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.340
He's keeps he's incredible writer. He writes all these edits.

230
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:49.780
Some make some he's.

231
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.180
<v 1>They're really good, man. Yeah. They're really.</v>

232
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.070
<v 0>Good. I spazzed on that SNL.</v>

233
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.780
<v 1>No, you didn't at all. How do you spell it? Came out. No, no, no,</v>

234
00:12:58.781 --> 00:12:59.890
look it's awkward story.

235
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.370
<v 0>Yeah, it is. It's always, here's what's uncomfortable about it is.</v>

236
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:04.690
I don't want to sound like,

237
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.660
is weird for me to rail against cancel culture because I was a victim of

238
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:12.430
it for lack of a better word. You know what.

239
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.290
<v 1>I mean? Why is it weird for you to rail against? I.</v>

240
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.220
<v 0>Don't know. I don't know. I just, it.</v>

241
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.040
<v 1>Makes peace. It seems defensive. Yeah.</v>

242
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.160
<v 0>Hmm. Yeah. I'd rather just be like, look, if people bring up cancel culture,</v>

243
00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:21.994
I'm just like.

244
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.410
<v 1>Honestly, I really believe it's better for you in the long run. I really do.</v>

245
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.470
You're a brilliant comedian. I think your sketches are incredible.

246
00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:32.440
And I think it's better that you not get attached to something that's ultimately

247
00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:33.274
corrupting and.

248
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.310
<v 0>Going to be on the other side of it where it's like,</v>

249
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.820
I'm a free speech guy. I'm a, it's like, dude,

250
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:41.920
