00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What is it about Nigerians that why,</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.120
why are Nigerian so clever? All these internet scams,

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.690
like when you hear about internet scams, it's Nigerians, right?

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.460
Nigerians come to America.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.860
They're one of the most successful groups of immigrants in all,

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.490
all the countries hundred plus whatever countries, Nigerians murder it.

7
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.520
When they come to America, there's something about, there's a work ethic,

8
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:29.370
but there's also a cleverness to Nigerians. Like.

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.960
<v 1>I said, it I've said it before. I'm the runt of my people. Brain-wise body-wise.</v>

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.600
Cause when I went back recently on a see man,

11
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:41.430
you see people who are just brick laying and they had jacked, they are ripped.

12
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:44.340
Some of them ended up maybe have the best nutrition. No,

13
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.860
but they there's something about the genetics of our people.

14
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.490
It's a warrior race. And I don't say that likely I'm just being honest. Right.

15
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:54.510
It's different. You know? And I think also the culture,

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.740
cause I was doing algebra in school when I was like seven. And then I went to,

17
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.650
I remember when I, when I first moved to New Zealand form one,

18
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:04.620
I had to do form one and three different countries. So I started form one.

19
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.090
I don't know how well you guys have here.

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.010
<v 0>One Sally first grade. I.</v>

21
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.641
<v 1>Don't know how it is,</v>

22
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:11.130
but pretty much I was 10 years old and I moved to Ghana for a little bit,

23
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:13.350
not to repeat it again. Then I moved to, um,

24
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:16.380
New Zealand and I had to repeat it again because they said, no, he's too young.

25
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:18.420
He can't be doing that. But thing is, I wasn't even the smartest.

26
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:20.760
I was the bottom three in my class. So I wasn't the smarter,

27
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:23.220
the smartest of the bunch in Nigeria, in Nigeria.

28
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.920
So when I came to New Zealand form one men, my first day in school,

29
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.210
they had a test like, you know,

30
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.370
early workout or something or one of the first weeks of school.

31
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.480
And we had to do times table. And I knew the song in my head. So I just like

32
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.050
finished miss and all the kids like, oh,

33
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.790
And I'm just like the. And then like,

34
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:47.190
they all thought I was just savant genius.

35
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:49.320
And then like they start asking me questions. Like, you know,

36
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.520
you brush your teeth. Yes,

37
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:56.370
I do do like back home.

38
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:58.740
Do you ride on lions?

39
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.840
I went home and all these kids are dumb, stupid. Like,

40
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.860
I didn't know. I didn't understand. I just thought like, you know, I do regular.

41
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.270
Like I, but they didn't understand me. So yeah. My people are different, man,

42
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:15.540
honestly. And I'm like, you've seen it. And I'm telling you, man,

43
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.540
especially right now that what I want to do in Nigeria, I really,

44
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.070
I want to introduce them,

45
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.010
like take the football soccer ball out of their hands and just show them some

46
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:26.370
gloves. We have some great boxes. We have this thing called Dombey,

47
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.910
which is Nigeria and wrestling. Kind of like the Senegalese type wrestling.

48
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.830
I saw some beasts, but Danby, you know, they wrap a rope around the one hand,

49
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:38.100
just one hand and they just pull with the other hand and they wrestle and they

50
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:41.280
throw strikes balls. So they have like some Juju, some black magic, you know,

51
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:43.380
all that kind of stuff. Like they sprinkle that in there.

52
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:46.980
I got my own as well at 3:00 AM. You know what? I'm literally,

53
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:49.890
I can't wait to like show them like, cause when I went back,

54
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.270
I was trying to just chill low key sneaking to the country.

55
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:55.970
But my dad said it can't happen. They're watching you.

56
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.290
Everyone knows who you are from the airport. All the area, boys, Israel.

57
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.940
That's on y'all oh my God. Ah,

58
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.600
can I take a photo police officers showing what's up showing love,

59
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.770
crooked police officers. Some of them they show what's up show up. And like,

60
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.050
I didn't realize like they,

61
00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:13.450
they stay up till 4:00 AM to watch me and come up with fight. Wow. This day.

62
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.940
And I've always said I wanted to be the guy,

63
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.720
like what pack y'all was to the Philippines. You know,

64
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.290
the way when he fights the whole country shuts down, crime drops, everything.

65
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.480
I want it to like, I feel like after this,

66
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.360
now it's going to keep blowing up and I'm going to go back next year.

67
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.480
I'm going to go back next year. And I'm going to, I hope,

68
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.360
I hope they see the possibilities. Cause I'm telling you man,

69
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.360
the countries that he, I mean, it was um, Brazil at first,

70
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:41.050
in the early stages of my mermaid, then Japan, then America, then you know,

71
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.290
like it always goes back and forth and then no, the Oceania people right now,

72
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.820
we're doing some work. But I'm telling you once,

73
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.150
not just my general wants the Africans. Once they start stepping in,

74
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.390
it's going to be like my 50 cent dropped in the club and they killed the whole

75
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:53.920
game for awhile. Honestly,

76
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:57.670
I'm telling you like they ain't gonna run the game for a long time for a long

77
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.390
time. And I'm, I'm happy to be a guy that's kinda like paving the way.

78
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.250
It's crazy though. What was it like going back.

79
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.080
<v 0>There, being the champ, going back.</v>

80
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.400
<v 1>There, it was beautiful.</v>

81
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.520
Like just seeing my people it's different way than you're in Vegas and oh my

82
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.710
God, dude, I'm going to put a strain on my right.

83
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.390
But it's different when you see like a kid just in shock that you're even

84
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:20.290
standing there, like just in shock that you're in his presence. And for me,

85
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:22.360
I don't see myself as a stabbing. Um, Israel.

86
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:23.530
I just saw him at the end of the day.

87
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.820
But when they're looking at you and just like, you know, and this kid,

88
00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:28.960
I remember like it was on my Instagram.

89
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:31.120
He was kicking a bag and I just showed them. I tweaked them.

90
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.580
I just told them this to pivot on the foot,

91
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.480
stand on the toes and turn the hip literally within a minute,

92
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.960
he improved this kick like that. And I got it on my Instagram somewhere,

93
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:43.540
but man, I was really impressed. And that was just a little snippet of the,

94
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.550
of the, the, the, the creativity of our people the way, oh man,

95
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.980
this is gonna make me cry. This is my old primary school man.

96
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:53.260
Like going back here, I was looking at,

97
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.350
I used to hide there for hide and seek and everything seems so small.

98
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.920
Cause when you're a kid everything's so big. This is me. I think lucky beach,

99
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.650
just chilling with the people, man. I was immersed in the culture.

100
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.543
Seeing all those kids.

101
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.270
<v 0>With their uniforms on grabbing at your belt.</v>

102
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.280
<v 1>Is honestly, man, it was like, it reminded me of goosebumps. Again,</v>

103
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.110
it reminded me of this jam here. This was just, um, uh, uh, the stadium.

104
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:16.660
I went there to go watch. And then the guy that the trainer was like,

105
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.090
you not training. I'm like, what do you mean? He's like,

106
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.110
you got training and get up.

107
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.760
I had my nice Jordans on and I just had to like work. He may,

108
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.680
I think he was trying to flex. He was trying to show me like,

109
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.663
you're going to work you.

110
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.280
And he put us to work and that's be on holiday as well.

111
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.680
It's open state where my parents have come.

112
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:36.550
People watch this a hundred percent go on Instagram. We're going EMG, EMG. Um,

113
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.500
what do you call it? M G axis.

114
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.280
<v 0>Uh, Israel, the last style bender out of Sonia in that.</v>

115
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.780
<v 1>EMG YouTube engage media group. That's beautiful, man. But there's some more,</v>

116
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:48.910
we're doing a documentary right now. Cause, and they've like,

117
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.560
Jeff's been following me around since 2015 and I want to like, this is the,

118
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.540
I want to say this is the end of the first documentary,

119
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.150
but the beginning of the next one, want to show what I can do in Nigeria.

120
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:04.010
What I can do in Africa. Cause even, um, Kamara went to Morocco for a,

121
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.410
we almost, well, not almost died the award and there was some killers.

122
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:08.120
You see how that played? Go back, Jamie, go back,

123
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.770
see how that place go back forward as like amaze. Go for it. Yeah.

124
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.620
See how that's like a mace. Yeah. The first day we went there,

125
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.980
I went there just trying to like show love to the hood,

126
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.770
say what's up and all this area, boys like, uh, I'll go with you to do here.

127
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.440
Like what are you doing here? And I'm like, I'm just looking around you. The,

128
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:26.750
I kind of, you must set two loss. You gotta settle them.

129
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:29.120
You gotta make sure they all right. I was like, don't worry.

130
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.200
We'll look after you guys.

131
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:33.560
But then within the first five minutes of me and I'd be all on my friend who

132
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:37.400
came with me, he was like, we gotta go. Cause he he's very smart. He's very,

133
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:39.830
very wrong. So we're like, all right. And I had a guy with an AK with me,

134
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:42.590
a security guard and the guys, the gangsters, they were kind of flexing.

135
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.880
And I was like, oh no, you guys then. So the next day she was the in me.

136
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.300
I went there, shirtless all my chains on fast.

137
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:53.960
And I got like more security with me with more AKA's and when deep,

138
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.060
we didn't have to go deep to get that sky shot.

139
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.340
And Jeff hates me for it cause he panicked the whole time.

140
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.370
And I went deep and there's all these killers, man.

141
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.640
Like literally I'm talking like you see scars on them like marks because that's

142
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:06.500
the bodies, the body counts and like that.

143
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.690
And this one dude looked like Kimbo slice and he's like the head honcho.

144
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.350
And he was arguing with this other guy because they were saying like, no,

145
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:18.500
I'm giving them a tour. What they give us is my money and I'll sell it to you.

146
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:21.200
And he's like, no, I'm the, you know, I'm the big dog you report to me.

147
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.110
And they were kind of having an argument about it and it wasn't real heated.

148
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:28.580
And if they wanted to us up right there and say, you guys, that's a maze.

149
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.290
They know that. Like the back of their hand, I have no idea. You know, we're.

150
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.660
We're walking through it. Exactly. And you're walking on planks and the water,

151
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:38.420
you saw the water dirty, like disgusting, you know,

152
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:40.640
but that's like one of the slums in Nigeria. But then you see the,

153
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:42.560
before the shot, that was Victoria on it.

154
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:44.120
So that's like the contrast of my Jeremy.

155
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:48.350
You have dirt poor and you have well off like

156
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.950
Lamborghinis, like people living nicely. Those were all.

157
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.843
<v 0>The group on this side.</v>

158
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.740
<v 1>Yeah. But they're smart as. And that's the, the email is so old now.</v>

159
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.160
That's like I had a no,

160
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.210
I'm not your uncle. Don't check your emails.

161
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.710
I'm a Nigerian prince. Don't worry. You'll get your money. Just wait.

162
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.060
It's just the fees. The fees got to like the way the bank accounts set up,

163
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:15.430
all that kind of stuff. Yeah.

164
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.390
<v 0>It's amazing that they figured it out to the point where that is synonymous with</v>

165
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:21.224
scams.

166
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.700
<v 1>And scams. I hear about, and that's the thing like with scammy,</v>

167
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:28.580
but a lot of them it's because of the opportunity. They're so smart,

168
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:32.420
but the opportunity isn't there. So they can't go to school. They can't do that.

169
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:33.254
So.

170
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:37.850
<v 0>And I was sold a airport that didn't exist to</v>

171
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:42.290
Japan. Really? Remember that one, a Nigerian dude sold a airport.

172
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.660
That wasn't a real airport. We're winning.

173
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.360
<v 1>Yeah. I know many people do that with like buildings or Airbnbs,</v>

174
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:49.700
but that's the airport airport. Okay.

175
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.050
<v 0>Bro. He's sold an airport.</v>

176
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.410
<v 1>The Japanese are smart too, man. That's the thing. Well, yeah, we.</v>

177
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.590
<v 0>We, we talked about it like.</v>

178
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.070
<v 1>A couple of weeks ago. Yeah. It's bonkers. Like they,</v>

179
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.210
they spent a load of money. It was like in the eighties or something. Oh really?

180
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.430
Yeah. They gotta make a movie about that. Well, they should.

181
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.380
<v 0>Hear, it goes 242 million off sold a fake airport for 242 million.</v>

182
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.910
<v 1>It's not like I'm saying, this is like,</v>

183
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.400
this is not the best representative of people, but this shows how smart. Well.

184
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.220
<v 0>If you're stuck and you got nowhere out and you live in that maze,</v>

185
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.440
that's the way out. You gotta do what you got.

186
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.890
<v 1>When I was a standby. When I was in Dubai, I don't know if I should say a story.</v>

187
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.830
I was in a it. No one's listening. Um,

188
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.060
we're on a boat for someone's birthday party and I'm seeing all these kids like

189
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.010
17, 16, 18 with like ice stout. Rolex's,

190
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.090
you know,

191
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.140
I'm on a yacht party for some guy's birthday and they're just out there flexing.

192
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.130
And I'm just like, what do you do? So, oh, I invested in Bitcoin early that dah,

193
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:54.780
dah dah was like, ah, now Yahoo boy, Yahoo boys. Cause you know,

194
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.410
I, I knew already, but thing is, they're so smart. They know how to work.

195
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.080
They know how to like, and they all over the world, like I said,

196
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:03.000
we're like a virus we're at Nigerians and everywhere,

197
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.090
wherever you look in the world, we're everywhere. And we have our claim,

198
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:08.430
but I can't wait till this documentary man.

199
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.990
Like I really want to like show people over there, like what we can do.

200
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.840
I want to show, first of all, the story, like it's not going to be like,

201
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.790
you know, McGregor's documentary was dope,

202
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.420
but it was more catered to the MMA fans and anyone can watch it.

203
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.600
But I want this to be more like the soccer mom can watch it. And you know,

204
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:28.440
someone from the burbs, someone from Alaska can watch it and still relate.

205
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.110
So I want to, there's different. There's different levels to this,

206
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:33.810
but I'm looking forward to really putting that out. Are you.

207
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.460
<v 0>Thinking about opening a gyms over there.</v>

208
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.000
<v 1>In Nigeria? Yes. Eventually I want to kit out some of the gyms.</v>

209
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:43.230
Like the one I went to, um, the, the stadium sports stadium I was at.

210
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:46.020
I want to help them out with some stuff that's later on when I go through it.

211
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:49.110
Right. And normally I do things like this. Like when I went there,

212
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:50.760
I did some stuff, but I don't do it for like,

213
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.410
it's real weird when you're on this platform.

214
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:54.630
And I see people trying to do for the likes for me,

215
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:55.950
I cringe because I can't do that.

216
00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:59.460
But when you have a platform like this and you can bring attention to certain

217
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.380
causes and certain people, then I don't mind using my platform for like that.

218
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:08.100
So I really want to bring some attention to my people because I feel like they

219
00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:09.600
deserve it, but also they can earn it.

220
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.610
They can earn it and I know they can make.
