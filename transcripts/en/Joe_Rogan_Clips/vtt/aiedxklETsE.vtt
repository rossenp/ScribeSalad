<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.600
I was talking to a friend of mine about imposter syndrome that, um,

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.440
imposter syndrome. Yeah. You know, that feeling, you know, expression. No,

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.720
it's you get it when, like,

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.880
when people think that you're really good at something and you don't have a lot

6
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:18.480
of self worth, or you, you,

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.590
you have this per perception of yourself that you're not worthy. Right.

8
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.110
You know, like maybe as an artist, that's,

9
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.190
that's a big one that you have it as an artist.

10
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.270
Like I had it forever as a comedian and I probably still have it a little bit,

11
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.790
but less so than I used to because I'm just more accomplished and more

12
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:39.670
understanding of what it is and the more engrossed in the process. And I, I,

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.100
I, it is now more than I did before. Okay. And you, like,

14
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:48.020
when I meet famous people, if they know who I am, I'd be like, oh my God,

15
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:51.620
I gotta get outta here. This person knows who I am. I'm tricking. 'em right.

16
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:53.900
It's a trick they don't know. And they're like, Hey man, I love your stuff.

17
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.700
I'm like, no, you don't. You think you do, you don't trust me.

18
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:00.420
Let me get away from you. &lt;laugh&gt; right. It's like this imposter thing.

19
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.610
And then sometimes things, enough things happen where you go, you know what?

20
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.890
I think I might be legit. I think I might be legit. Like, this is so crazy.

21
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.170
Like I thought I was an imposter forever, but I think I'm,

22
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.010
I'm gonna relax and just concentrate on the work and not worry about whether or

23
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:17.050
not I'm an imposter anymore.

24
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.290
Just concentrate on the work that ego's always there. ISN. Yeah.

25
00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:21.130
It's always there, man. And,

26
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:25.760
but the go it's interesting imposter syndrome is

27
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.280
often more prevalent and people are legitimately talented.

28
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.880
And for some strange reason, because when you're legitimately talented,

29
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.000
one of the ways you become legitimately talented is to be ruthlessly,

30
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.680
self critical, cuz that's, that's how you get really good at something.

31
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.830
And in ruthless, like I remember, um,

32
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.210
uh,

33
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.070
KA Williams was talking about himself once and cat Williams is a crazy person,

34
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.230
but a brilliant comedian. And he said something that I,

35
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.350
I have always thought and he's like, I'm not a fan of me.

36
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.340
And he goes, he goes like, I don't, you know, I don't particularly like me.

37
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.850
You know? It's like,

38
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.340
that is why he's great because that makes you work

39
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.500
so hard at like the worst thing a comedian can be in the

40
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:20.140
beginning is sure of themselves and then incompetent at the same time.

41
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.770
It's horrible. &lt;laugh&gt;, it's horrible because you're not good. Good.

42
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.010
But you think you're amazing. And then you understand,

43
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:29.450
you don't know why the world doesn't think you're amazing because you think

44
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.210
you're good. Cuz you're delusional. You have this sort of artificial

45
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.850
image of the world that you've put up. And in the world, you are the center,

46
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.770
you are the center and you want everything to evolve around you.

47
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.720
And the worst thing in terms of, for comedy,

48
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.880
you people have to enjoy what you're doing. They have to enjoy.

49
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.760
And not, not, everyone's gonna,

50
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.160
you're always gonna have some people that don't enjoy no matter what,

51
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.480
but you're trying to make it an enjoyable experience for the people watching

52
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.921
you. Now,

53
00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:05.760
if you are delusional and clueless and if

54
00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:10.400
you, you don't understand how people see you, you,

55
00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:14.200
you have a distorted perception of reality, distorted perception of your,

56
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.080
your own, your own presence.

57
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.790
It up the vibe for the audience. It up. They, they,

58
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:25.510
they recognize it too quickly because comedy in a weird way

59
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.910
is a spiritual pursuit for the person who's making it because you are putting

60
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.510
together thoughts and ideas.

61
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.510
And you're trying to get it into these people's minds in a way that I elicits a

62
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.300
response that makes them feel good.

63
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.340
And the only way that you could really do it is you have to hit those notes.

64
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.500
You have to reach that, that resonance. You have to find that frequency,

65
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.300
whatever it is that works on them.

66
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.100
And you can't be thinking about yourself too much

67
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.170
in you. Can't be pleased with yourself. Can't be happy with yourself.

68
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.130
You always have to be analyzing you are, you are the, the sculptor.

69
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.690
You have to be critical, you know, always have to. And so in doing that,

70
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.210
it's really easy to develop imposter syndrome.

71
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.770
Cause even when you're think doing well, you know, like chip I've had like,

72
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.130
I don't know, nine or 10 comedy specials. It doesn't matter.

73
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.080
It doesn't matter how many people lack em. They, they say, I gotta keep going.

74
00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:24.360
Right. You gotta keep working at it. It like a type of, so when perfectionism,

75
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.360
yeah. So when someone would, I don't remember how we even got onto this,

76
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.560
but that imposter syndrome exists because your,

77
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.920
your ego won't like your mind understands that you ego will

78
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.350
this up. If, if you let your egos say, oh, I'm the man.

79
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.830
You're gonna ruin this whole thing. Mm. Like you have to,

80
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:47.030
you have to be aware of what this is like, this, this,

81
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.510
this ride requires you to stay within a certain frequency.

82
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.230
You have to stay inside that frequency as soon as you start going. Yeah.

83
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:58.190
Everything's awesome. It all goes away. &lt;laugh&gt; all it goes away.

84
00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.910
You have to stay inside that frequency.

85
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.820
And that frequency is not a frequency where you're very pleased with yourself.

86
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.100
<v 1>Um, I think you've gone for full circle back to the Baga Vada. Yeah.</v>

87
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.740
Cause the Bagga vagida is the warriors have to fight the war.

88
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.060
You think it's you think the Bagga vigida's gonna be like here's C Krishna

89
00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:20.380
telling R juah not to fight. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; rjna doesn't wanna fight.

90
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.850
He's got his guru on the other side. He's got his family on the other side. Um,

91
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:27.210
what's Christian gonna say about this and Christian's saying you gotta actually

92
00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:29.250
fight. You're born to fight. Mm.

93
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.050
You just have to get outta your ego with this and you have to do it as just a

94
00:05:33.051 --> 00:05:36.010
service. And I think when I, uh,

95
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.210
apply that type of teaching to my life, like sometimes I'm not a great singer.

96
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.000
I'm not a great, I, uh, you know, Indian classical music,

97
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.680
but I like to do it and I'm enthusiastic to it. And to me, it's a,

98
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.240
it's not about me. Uh it's about like, sort of like an offering.

99
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.921
It was like one of,

100
00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:56.880
one of the first teachings I got in the asram was, um,

101
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.240
when you're on stage,

102
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.000
don't do it to make sure you're doing it to serve God and not be

103
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.240
God. Mm. That statement changed my entire life.

104
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.440
Yeah. And I was like, oh. Everything I do is to be God,

105
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.750
God everyth. And it changed the way. It didn't just change the way I sang.

106
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:24.910
It changed the way I parent changed the way I like react to, to friends,

107
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.710
to fans, to my parents. Yeah. Um, it,

108
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.350
it was powerful so that I have to, sometimes, you know,

109
00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:34.870
I like to publicly sing on this. Have you ever heard Kean? No.

110
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.660
It's so interesting. What is it? It's it's it's it's um, chanting back in,

111
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.100
uh, call and response. Chanting of chanting mantras.

112
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:47.420
And you use like this pump piano and Indian drums. I'll place.

113
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.860
I'll place 'em for you later. Okay. And, uh, but it's great.

114
00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:53.780
And it's popular in America. It's been sort of Eric A. Little bitamericanized.

115
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.380
Mm. But it's but it's good. And, uh, it's great.

116
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.890
And so what we do on pilgrimage is I have, I,

117
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.410
my assistant's an incredible drummer. He's from India. Uh, and then I,

118
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.330
I played the harmonium, which is his punk piano. And, uh,

119
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.090
we just sing publicly call and response.

120
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.050
And all the in Indian people in India will come around and they'll sing with us.

121
00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:18.480
And it's like, it's all overwhelming.

122
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.920
So there's one particular temple I go to in one particular,

123
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.240
holy place where singers come from around the world, it's like basically,

124
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.880
you know, rolling stones led zapppelin.

125
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:30.840
It's like the best keton singers from around the world come and they sing.

126
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.000
And I remember one time I came with a bunch of students of mine and they

127
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:40.070
called me up to sing. And in my brain, I was like,

128
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.550
you guys are like the real deal. I don't wanna sing. And they were like, no, no,

129
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:47.950
no, you sing. And I was like, no, seriously, I don't wanna sing. Please.

130
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.910
You sing. And like thousands of pilgrims come in at the time.

131
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.430
And somehow I have felt like I have to do this.

132
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.590
I have to sing because that's what they're ordering me to do.

133
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.300
I have to do it in a loving way.

134
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.380
I have to do it in a way to make everybody excited,

135
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.740
but I can't do it with any ego whatsoever.

136
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.700
And it becomes like this incredible tight row walking mm-hmm. Yeah.

137
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.660
Can I do my best with a, can you get on stage? Yeah. And not,

138
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:16.340
it's not about me as the great comedian, you know,

139
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:17.340
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; can I do the,

140
00:08:17.341 --> 00:08:20.690
sort of as a offering where I feel like be people are gonna walk away with

141
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:22.250
something and they're gonna be changed a little,

142
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.370
they're gonna be lifted a little,

143
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:26.250
they're gonna go home a little bit more connected.

144
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.010
It's gonna help me and it's gonna help them. And can I do it when,

145
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.130
and when people, we have this thing where we say, uh, we deflect our praise,

146
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.930
people say, Hey, great, sh uh, you're a great yoga teacher. Um,

147
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.640
this is how we train my students. You're a great yoga. Uh, oh,

148
00:08:41.641 --> 00:08:43.680
that was a great thing. You did. Our,

149
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.120
our quick answer is by the mercy of my teachers. Like,

150
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:51.320
we don't wanna hold onto praise cuz praise exacerbates the ego. Yeah.

151
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.720
And so we immediately wanna say,

152
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.640
and it's not even like we're being falsely humble.

153
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.200
We actually are made up of the teachers in my life.

154
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.680
All the people that have loved me care for me. Um,

155
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.640
maybe people that have like screwed with me, but they also taught me a lesson.

156
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.600
So the Yogi's conception is everybody is creating what I am.

157
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.750
And therefore I don't own any of this. You wanna praise me me?

158
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.550
I'm gonna give the praise back to my teacher.

159
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:21.710
Now the teacher's mood is by the mercy of my teacher. I,

160
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.070
I look at back at my life and

161
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.750
I've realize I'm just like a ball of energy.

162
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.310
And generally the energy goes to like feed my ego. How can it feed my ego?

163
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.500
How can I use that to manipulate girls, to, to people like me?

164
00:09:35.501 --> 00:09:36.580
How can I use everything?

165
00:09:36.581 --> 00:09:41.460
I've got gifted for my own self aronized of

166
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:44.060
course. And so when you get these teachers in your life,

167
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.340
spiritual teachers who sort of like give you a loving, slap, or a loving, Hey,

168
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.340
and they turn you on in some way, they take what you already have.

169
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.570
And they read direct that north, instead of south,

170
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.530
everything I was doing was just a snowballing devastation.

171
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.810
And now you can, you don't re you don't give up those qualities that you have,

172
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:10.210
but you use them in a way that brings people up instead of brings em down.

173
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.690
That's what we were saying about movies too, or any entertainment or,

174
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.610
or sounds in.

175
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.000
<v 0>Our mind that that state of my line that you're trying to achieve.</v>

176
00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:19.480
When you get on stage, where you're trying to sing with no ego,

177
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.600
that's exactly the, the frequency that you have to hit.

178
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.800
When you're doing comedy, you do your best,

179
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.600
but you don't do your best so that people love you. You do your best,

180
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.280
cuz that's what you're trying to do. That's your craft. That's your, this is,

181
00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:38.150
this is your thing. Your thing that you do, your,

182
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.630
your expression, your art form, you have to manage it.

183
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.270
And the way to manage it correctly is you have, you can't,

184
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.870
you can't go out there with ego. You'll turn people off. They won't feel it.

185
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.150
You, you know, there's moments where you can use that,

186
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.140
especially with comedy where you turn, but it's not ego. It's like,

187
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.300
but even if you're doing it though in comedy,

188
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.740
you're doing it for the effect of making people laugh, right.

189
00:11:03.741 --> 00:11:06.580
You're not doing it for the effect of pumping yourself up.

190
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.140
And you have to be very careful about that.

191
00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:10.420
And if they know that that's what you're doing, they will accept it.

192
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.660
That's that's the art of it. Yes. That's the art of it. It's a dance, right?

193
00:11:13.661 --> 00:11:16.220
There's a strange sort of dance that goes on.

194
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.050
<v 1>I, I would noticed this is humiliating to mention, but I will,</v>

195
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:25.290
if I wasn't doing it in a mood of service as an offering,

196
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.730
if I got off stage and that wasn't my motivation, I'd be depressed.

197
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.010
Yeah. Because maybe you can relate to this on stage.

198
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.760
I'm the center. I'm the coolest I'm, I'm it, they're singing so long lyrics.

199
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.600
I wrote mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; on my bed and now they're all singing them.

200
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.280
And then I'm in another country right now. I'm off age. I'm a nobody.

201
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.440
So if you're not medicating with any type of drug or sex,

202
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:54.840
then all you're left with is a bunch of emotions. Interesting. And I, I, no,

203
00:11:54.841 --> 00:11:59.040
this is true, but I, I think this is why people who are entertainers can,

204
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.480
can move towards addiction or ways, ways to mass, that,

205
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:07.160
that loneliness that comes with being the center where the whole world is trying

206
00:12:07.161 --> 00:12:09.240
to convince you of the Maya. You've heard that word,

207
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.480
Maya yeah-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the illusion.

208
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.510
The illusion of life is that you are the center. I.
