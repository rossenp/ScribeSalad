1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. That's one of the culture shock things for me,</v>

2
00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:06.840
when I first moved to America, it was that, you know,

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.880
I think a lot of American kids were told like participation trophy culture. Yes.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.160
A lot of them were told that they were the best. Like, you know, like Tommy,

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.560
like you are, you know, they're nothing you can do. Yeah.

6
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:20.750
You're just like so amazing. And I'm like, do these people, well,

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.950
it's like American idol. You know, we used to get the, uh,

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.590
the seasons in Singapore too. And it's like, just people can't sing.

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.470
And that's actually why they're putting them on. They're awful. Yeah.

10
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.030
And nobody told them like, are you telling me that? Like,

11
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.670
they've been telling their friends, oh, I'm practicing. I'm going on.

12
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.750
American idol. Did nobody tell them that, bro,

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.260
like you should just be singing English shower. Nobody told.

14
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.420
<v 1>Them there's a couple things going on. First of all,</v>

15
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.140
some of those people are trolls.

16
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.540
They're going on that they know they suck and they're going on because they're

17
00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:53.180
gonna get on TV. And the best way to get on TV is actually to suck America.

18
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.780
There's.

19
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.300
<v 0>No, there's no concept of shame. Like.</v>

20
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.220
<v 1>They want do it. They want to be on TV. Look, I used to host fear factor.</v>

21
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.810
Don't talk to me about shame. Okay. I, I understand there's no shame in that.

22
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:03.180
That's.

23
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.890
<v 0>Shame in attempting to eat bull testicle. Actually I think that's heroic.</v>

24
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.930
<v 1>It's definitely.</v>

25
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.810
<v 0>Not heroic. And it's now a show on food network, right? &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

26
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.770
<v 1>Well, bull testicles are actually a common food. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:17.090
Rocky mountain oysters gross stuff is they don't taste bad.

28
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:19.770
Bull testicles does not taste bad. They're actually they,

29
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:22.480
the way they cook 'em they cook 'em well they're actually okay.

30
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.040
<v 0>But there's on there's there's no shame in doing something that most people are</v>

31
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.880
fearful.

32
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.720
<v 1>About. The, the singing thing what's going on is first of all,</v>

33
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:32.400
there's a lot of those people that are mentally ill. That's part of the problem.

34
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.400
A lot of those people are delusional. They're mentally ill.

35
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:39.080
They have like legitimate mental health issues and then they go and sing and

36
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:41.840
they sound terrible. And no one tells them because they don't have any friends.

37
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.270
So the reasons why.

38
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.630
<v 0>I think, I think there's a happy, medium. See, the thing is, you know,</v>

39
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.551
if you go up in Asia,

40
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:51.230
you're told that you're just a dumb all the time and you're kind kind of

41
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.190
constantly beat down. You know, if you come home with like 99,

42
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:57.350
over a hundred for your math exam, your parents are not gonna say, pat, pat,

43
00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.830
well done. You're they're gonna say, where was that one point?

44
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:02.190
What did you do wrong? And again,

45
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.780
you do not doubt that they love you and care for you. That's just how it is.

46
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:09.100
They're just hardcore. And, and so you kind of internalize that and,

47
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.740
and have very low self-esteem and you know, in general, like,

48
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.300
but you kind of know your limitations, right? That's the problem. Like when I,

49
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:19.340
when I moved here was that I realized like a lot of the kids I went to school

50
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:22.980
with, man, I wish they had their confidence. You know, it's like, they are,

51
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.930
they inflated sense of self worth was, was just so big.

52
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.450
But sometimes it allowed them to get the good jobs.

53
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.010
It allowed them to ACE the interview.

54
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.170
They don't have to do stupid things like drink this and get nervous.

55
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.410
You don't catch, don't have to do that either.

56
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.810
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; I grew up around a lot of Koreans because I,</v>

57
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.530
I did TaeKwonDo from the time I was, uh, young. I did too far. Well,

58
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.240
and they are, I mean, I,

59
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.640
I thought I knew what hard work was until I was around these people.

60
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.640
And I was like, oh, you can.

61
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.640
<v 0>Never outwork. Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.920
<v 1>Koreans who? And, uh, my friend ick, who was on the, uh,</v>

63
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.360
us national team when I was, uh, younger, was in medical school.

64
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.960
So he was going through his residency and training to be on the national team.

65
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.880
So while he was studying, he would put his backpack on,

66
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:12.120
fill his backpack up with books and run up the stairs of, uh,

67
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.200
the university run up and down stairs to get some additional workouts in.

68
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.830
He was trying to train for the us team with, while he was doing his residency.

69
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.230
That's, we're, it's insane, insane. He was crazy.

70
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.990
He would sleep three hours a night.

71
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.350
And he was like one of the best TaeKwonDo fighters in the world. And, uh,

72
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.430
it was all through sheer will and deter. But,

73
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:33.990
but he was explaining that to me about what it was like growing up is like,

74
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.550
you are never good. Never, never there's nothing ever good enough, you know,

75
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.260
no matter what you do, you could have done better. Exactly.

76
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.180
You could work harder. You could always do more.

77
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.740
<v 0>Yeah, no, I mean, it's, it's unforgiving,</v>

78
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.140
but it's one of those things that it's a good illusion.

79
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.260
It's it's I think a very healthy illusion to have that like work equals success.

80
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.340
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right. And, and that's why I think, you know,

81
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.370
people of Asian descent generally have pretty primed to, to,

82
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.050
to buy into the Republican, uh, politics. Right, right. Of,

83
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:07.850
of pull yourself up by your bootstraps. You don't need handouts.

84
00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:10.650
The harder you work, the more likely you gonna achieve something. Um,

85
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.330
that's why there's just such a natural, you know, ally, in terms of the, as a,

86
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.610
to rely on this group block as a political group. Well.

87
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.560
<v 1>That's UN disgusted racism in academics is</v>

88
00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:28.400
the way Asian people are treated when they're applying for major universities.

89
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.440
Yeah. Particularly for Harvard. Like they, they literally,

90
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.960
you have to score higher if you're Asian. Yeah.

91
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:38.520
Because there's so many Asian people that get in, they made it more difficult.

92
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.680
Yeah. Which.

93
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.630
<v 0>Is I'm trying to manage that. Yeah. I mean, it's.</v>

94
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.350
<v 1>Not a meritocracy anymore. Like you've,</v>

95
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:48.630
you've decided that they have to do better. Right, right. Than white people,

96
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.150
they have to do better than everybody else, which is crazy.

97
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.711
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

98
00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:55.190
I think the insidious thing in particular about the Harvard case was that they

99
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:59.230
started downgrading Asians on personality. I mean, that's the part it's like,

100
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:03.340
okay, fine. You, you wanna say that, like maybe, you know, we don't want, uh,

101
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.300
we won't, we wanna like lower the scores a little for other groups and,

102
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.900
and you know, but why, but then to downgrade this personality,

103
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.220
that's a part that, that bothered me.

104
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.380
<v 1>How did they do a, a downgrade personality? What was,</v>

105
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:15.140
what was the method that they used to do that?

106
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.300
<v 0>So they said, okay, we're not just gonna rely on standardized tests. Okay.</v>

107
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:22.570
That's the thing like standardized tests, you know, they they're, they, they,

108
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.650
the, they can be easily gamed. That was the idea that like,

109
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:29.490
you can just go for more tuition, extra classes and you'll do well. Well,

110
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.210
we care about the holistic, uh, package of the applicant.

111
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.050
So you wanna see more personality. Ultimately, this is about, you know,

112
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:38.850
like what Aristotle called the telos, right?

113
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.330
What is the TES of higher education?

114
00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:44.760
What's the ultimate goal or essence of higher education?

115
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.640
Is it to just produce perfect cogs in the machine of the global economy?

116
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.000
Or is it, you know, to produce, uh, engaged citizens or whatever it is, right.

117
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:55.680
Like, so however you define that question,

118
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.680
what's the purpose of higher education. You could tailor your, um,

119
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.640
entrance methods to meet that. And in Harvard's case, they decided, well,

120
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.520
you know, we're going to, instead of just looking at, uh, your GPA,

121
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.480
your, um, essay, we want to see, we wanna interview the person,

122
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.440
wanna see what your personality's like, can you thrive at Harvard?

123
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.030
Are you gonna be a good contributing me member of, of this university socially?

124
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.590
Yeah, exactly. And you know, this,

125
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.350
one of the areas in which consistently looked like the Asian population that was

126
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:31.110
applying to, to Harvard was downgraded in that score.

127
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.190
They scored really high when it came to like extracurriculars academics,

128
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.140
they were so strong on, on S a piece and, and, you know,

129
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:41.180
all these other standardized tests, but when it came to personality,

130
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:43.180
they were very consistently downgraded.

131
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.500
<v 1>So do you think that that characteristic like that, the seeking out that was,</v>

132
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.820
that was applied specifically to try to limit the amount of Asian people?

133
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.100
Cause that's the argument, right.

134
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.010
<v 0>Um, you know, I, I dunno if it was done specifically for, for that,</v>

135
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.930
but I think Harvard has a, again,

136
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.570
monoculture suck in general. So, you know, if you're going to,

137
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.370
even for me, like I was coming to, to study in America, like, you know,

138
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.890
10,000 miles away, right. From the place I grew up,

139
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.010
I don't really wanna go to school with a lot of Asians cuz like I could have

140
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:20.440
just stayed there frankly. But I, I was looking for, for,

141
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.760
for something that wasn't a monoculture, you have to just expand your mind.

142
00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:25.080
Right. Right. So at the end of the day,

143
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.280
the issue with Harvard is that it was taking federal money.

144
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.200
And if you see Harvard as a stepping stone to a career, to a future,

145
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.360
it is unfair. It is kind of unfair if they were penalizing you,

146
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:40.910
but based on race, that's the hard part of proof, right?

147
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:44.270
Whether or not this was personality or race or some sort of, you know,

148
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:47.190
other thing that they were selecting for that happened to correlate with race.

149
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.230
That's the part that that's.

150
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.530
<v 1>Hard to prove.</v>

151
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.230
So is it possible that they were just trying to enhance the way people

152
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:58.630
communicate on campus? And so they sort of emphasized personality,

153
00:07:59.060 --> 00:07:59.900
emphasize social,

154
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.020
social interactions and in doing so they penalized Asians without being

155
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.620
aware.

156
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.780
<v 0>Of it. Yeah. Kind of. I mean, to be, to be honest, like, you know,</v>

157
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:12.540
when I was in college, I only did my first jello shot like a couple weeks ago.

158
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.140
<v 1>And a couple weeks ago now. Yes. Okay.</v>

159
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.900
<v 0>But I, I was that typical? You.</v>

160
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.770
<v 1>Don't need to do gel shots to be in call, was.</v>

161
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.370
<v 0>On fame. Okay. No. Okay. Not that, but I didn't,</v>

162
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.210
I didn't have the typical college experience. You didn't party UN party. Okay.

163
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.770
Um, and, and I think a lot of, you know,

164
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.290
a lot of international students who come from Asia,

165
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.530
we we'll probably fall into the same, um, habits. Like we're kind of like,

166
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.530
you know, we've been told that there's only one way to succeed,

167
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:42.000
work hard and Summa cam LA and all these things. Right. So,

168
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.160
so a lot of us kind of are, are culturally aligned on that and, and,

169
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.200
you know, be,

170
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.480
do we contribute to campus in the same way that your active student union leader

171
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.160
would who's involved in other curriculars? I don't, you know, I don't know.

172
00:08:57.161 --> 00:09:02.160
So would Harvard want a diversity of, of behaviors and interests?

173
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.080
Yeah, probably. Yes. You know,

174
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:06.360
you don't want all these like boring stem people walking out, but.

175
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.080
<v 1>You want all kinds of different stuff.</v>

176
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.240
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you also want people that raise the bar really high in

177
00:09:11.241 --> 00:09:12.160
terms of performance.

178
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.910
<v 0>You do. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

179
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.070
<v 1>I mean, that's, that's that,</v>

180
00:09:16.071 --> 00:09:19.590
that enhances other people's understanding of what's possible.

181
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.750
<v 0>But as a private institution, you can,</v>

182
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.590
you can make your student population up the way you want. Right. Yeah.

183
00:09:24.591 --> 00:09:27.870
That's why you have what Liberty university, which is Jerry Falwell. Yeah.

184
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.910
And it's for Christians. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; cause,

185
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.590
but it's a private institution. They're not taking money from the government.

186
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.260
So that's fine. Unlike UC Berkeley state institution, um,

187
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.300
they abolish affirmative action, UCLA,

188
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.460
all the UCS did look at the population it's 70,

189
00:09:42.461 --> 00:09:44.740
80% Asian interesting.

190
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.673
<v 1>In California.</v>

191
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:46.643
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

192
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.953
<v 1>Why is that.</v>

193
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.780
<v 0>Be, this is the uncomfortable, you know, this is the part where we just,</v>

194
00:09:52.781 --> 00:09:55.850
you know, like I don't wanna, I it's safety.

195
00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:01.370
<v 1>I don't know because they kick. They work harder. Yeah. It's,</v>

196
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:02.970
they're more dedicated, more disciplined.

197
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.330
<v 0>People are very uncomfortable to talk about differences in group up outcome</v>

198
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.170
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because we have to kind of make everybody right.

199
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.490
The same or else there must be some sort of systematic thing. But I think.

200
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.800
<v 1>That Asians, because they're so hard work and because they don't complain this,</v>

201
00:10:17.801 --> 00:10:22.120
they get people get away with this stuff where they get away with

202
00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:23.480
discrimination against them.

203
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.440
<v 0>I think they're starting to complain. That's why the lawsuits were, were filed.</v>

204
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.920
So they are starting to.

205
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.360
<v 1>But it's like, it took that to like, all right, you.</v>

206
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.510
<v 0>And there's actually quite a big pro-Trump Asian American voting block. Mm.</v>

207
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.830
You know, interesting. And this, this,

208
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.830
this particular issue of affirmative action is really driven. A lot of Asians,

209
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:48.110
right. Word, um, in New York city that has happened to under de Bellagio.

210
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.110
Really? Yeah. Cause of the public school situation there, what,

211
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.590
what is the same thing? They, they want to lower, you know,

212
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.740
basically in terms of the, the public high schools, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

213
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.780
they, they wanna Institute the same policies. Affirmative action.

214
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.220
So that's, that's becoming an issue.
