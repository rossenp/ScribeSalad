00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What do you think about what's going on in Hawaii now.</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.300
<v 1>With the protesting of the building of this largest and latest telescope?</v>

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.130
<v 2>Yes, the, the, the TMT 30 meter telescope, which would be,</v>

4
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.960
uh, you know, the largest ever by far of any kind of telescope,

5
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:22.670
the history of astronomy is one where bigger telescopes

6
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.760
become bigger buckets to collect light.

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.330
That's the only telescopes today are the same as telescopes when they were

8
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:31.610
invented. They're just bigger, right?

9
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:35.120
The principle behind them is bigger because what they're doing is simple.

10
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.670
All you're trying to do is get as much light as possible.

11
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.270
And the more light you get, the dimmer is the object you can detect.

12
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.870
And the farther away is the object you can see.

13
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.210
And so for every generation of new, large telescopes that have been built,

14
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.063
it is,

15
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.690
it has increased and deepened our understanding of our place in the universe.

16
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.850
So that's just the, that's the background.

17
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.530
The proposal is for a 30 meter telescope, largest ever,

18
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.410
um, on the big island of Hawaii and Monica were there other telescopes there,

19
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.100
other that's where the CAC is, right where the CAC is.

20
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.080
I think they S they cited it in a place that sort of tucked behind most

21
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.890
sight lines to it, but that's not so much what's important here.

22
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.700
It's that the native Hawaiians, from what I've read, uh,

23
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.710
view the mountain as a sacred place. And so, uh,

24
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.290
to put a telescope yet another telescope there becomes sort of invasion of

25
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:41.090
sacred land. And so, so yeah, it's, it's,

26
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.670
it's, uh, there's a standoff last. I looked, I mean,

27
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:48.500
people protesting in the streets and there's some native Hawaiians who embrace

28
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.390
this because it means jobs, high high-quality jobs, engineering jobs.

29
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.100
Cause you gotta build it, you gotta maintain it.

30
00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.290
There's an entire supportive infrastructure for that. That means jobs.

31
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.930
Um, and it's done in collaboration with the university of Hawaii. Um, and the,

32
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.740
all the other telescopes are partnered with the university of Hawaii where

33
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.460
people are educated there. And so, so at the end of the day,

34
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.290
you have to ask, well, how are we going to make decisions going forward?

35
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.240
Are you gonna make them democratically?

36
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.930
Then you take a vote or you do you want the natives to,

37
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.090
to be the deciders of their own fate? And is that democratic? Okay,

38
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:33.770
so the natives vote. Okay. Or is it the few people who are protesting?

39
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.450
Do they win the day? I mean, it's, it's complicated and it's very, it's very,

40
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.390
there's a lot of nuanced issues going on. There. There's a,

41
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:45.980
there's a branch of thinking that the, the United States government and,

42
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.900
and normal municipal, uh, leaders have no authority over it.

43
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.970
There are some who claim that this is native Hawaiian property that does not

44
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:59.200
belong to any municipal entity of the U S government.

45
00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:03.130
So therefore even state representatives have no say, right.

46
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.920
So there's a lot going on there. Okay.

47
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.230
But if I were to weigh in, this is how I would do so. Okay.

48
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.710
I would say first, um,

49
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.290
I think what should happen is,

50
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.360
I don't know if they even have the infrastructure.

51
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.970
I don't know how the system is set up, but if they could set it up this way,

52
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.530
if the mountain is viewed as sacred by the natives,

53
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.750
the natives should have entire say of what happens to the mountain. Okay.

54
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.910
That's how I think that should be.

55
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:41.830
So now what you want to make sure is that whatever decision gets made

56
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:46.510
and voted upon by the natives, that it's fully informed, you want,

57
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.740
you don't want to vote being misinformed or under informed in any election,

58
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.580
let alone whether you're voting for a telescope on your sacred mountain. Okay.

59
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.030
Otherwise you're voting out of nowhere, right? Yeah. You're not, you're,

60
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:02.620
you're influencing your future based on partial information and decisions based

61
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:07.600
on partial information or bad decisions, no matter what. Okay. So I would say,

62
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.220
hold the vote with the natives and make sure everybody's fully informed.

63
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.260
And here's a bit of information. I just want to add to the information. Okay.

64
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.000
You know what we do as astrophysicists,

65
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.550
we study the universe rather passively at that.

66
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.690
We sit there at the end of a telescope and wait for light to reach us.

67
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.670
It's not a Petri dish where we stir it or heated or freeze it or crack it.

68
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.710
Or we're just kind of they're communing with the cosmos.

69
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.070
My PhD thesis was significantly fed by data that

70
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:50.560
I obtained from mountaintops at telescopes.

71
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:54.540
I got my data from mountains in Chile, uh,

72
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.330
set or Tolo and it employed all the natives, the natives,

73
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.960
the local local people. Uh, that's another telescope that,

74
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.820
so there's all these telescopes that all have specific, um, um,

75
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.900
access points to the universe. They're not all asking the same questions.

76
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.960
And so it's the collection of all the data that gives us the complete

77
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:17.320
understanding. What we think is a complete understanding of the universe.

78
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.330
So what we do is try to understand our place in the

79
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:23.164
universe.

80
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.690
And all I'm going to say is that if you have power over what happens

81
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:32.800
on that mountain and it's sacred to you

82
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.930
because whatever that is,

83
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.440
it is something important to you.

84
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:44.350
And your sense of your understanding of your place in this world

85
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.760
that's would be spiritual significance.

86
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.960
I can tell you that what we learn as

87
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:56.680
astrophysicists from those mountaintops

88
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.550
gives us a deeper understanding of who

89
00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:08.350
and what we are in this universe.

90
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.080
So I would say that whatever is your concept of God,

91
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.090
be it the, the creator of the universe, the spirit energy,

92
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:22.510
that pervades all of space and time, whatever is your concept,

93
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.400
the discoveries of astrophysicists, bring you closer to it.

94
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.470
<v 1>I get your perspective. Let me be the opposing view.</v>

95
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.530
They feel that I'm, I'm not.

96
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.170
<v 0>Trying to, no, I know this is just information I'm putting.</v>

97
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.910
This is information and I.

98
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.420
<v 2>Walk out of the room and then you all vote, right? I'm not, you know,</v>

99
00:06:48.421 --> 00:06:51.060
we believe in democracy here and majority rules. That's, uh,

100
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.790
that's kind of a good thing. It's kind of worked all right.

101
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.740
But if it's not majority rules,

102
00:06:55.741 --> 00:06:56.940
I don't know how they're going to make decisions,

103
00:06:56.941 --> 00:07:01.740
but let's say invent a future where that the natives vote. If they vote,

104
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.190
I wanted to make sure they heard what I just said. And,

105
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.980
and now take control of your own fate.

106
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.050
<v 1>I just don't think they care.</v>

107
00:07:10.051 --> 00:07:13.620
I think they've decided that that's a sacred space and they don't want anybody

108
00:07:13.621 --> 00:07:17.400
doing anything to it. Then that's their decision. Then you think that's okay.

109
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.800
<v 2>I don't, I don't judge people's. Um,</v>

110
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.310
but if you wanted.

111
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.440
<v 1>To make a convincing appeal to them, no.</v>

112
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.040
<v 2>All I would say what I just told you, that's it? That is all I would tell them.</v>

113
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.900
And when they vote, I want them to understand that fact,

114
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.420
I could take it one step further and say

115
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.570
mountaintops, because of the access they give astrophysicists. And,

116
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.140
and by proxy us all to the universe

117
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.520
are sacred places to scientist.

118
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.020
Okay? No, it's not sacred in a religious sense, but it's sacred in a,

119
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.360
in terms of a pathway to knowing and understanding who and what we are in

120
00:08:03.361 --> 00:08:07.380
this universe. We place great value on that.

121
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.740
So, but it's not our land. It's we, you know,

122
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.230
specifically these things have Europeans didn't come to Hawaii and find fine

123
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.290
legions of scientists. They're conducting experiments. Okay.

124
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.340
If on native peoples governing themselves. So, so,

125
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.840
so that's that the consequence, if it gets voted down and that's permanent,

126
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:31.740
and there's no way around that, that telescope is still going to be built,

127
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.510
it just won't be built in Hawaii.

128
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.900
<v 1>Well, where will it be built? They have to be built on mountain tops. Yeah.</v>

129
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.820
So there are other mountaintops. Yeah. You.

130
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.590
<v 2>Want to be above, you know,</v>

131
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.190
schmaltzy clouds and haze and,

132
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.960
and you want a dry environment. So there's less rain clouds. Oh,

133
00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:50.190
you visited very good.

134
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.880
<v 1>The CAC, uh, more than 10 years ago, the first time.</v>

135
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.420
And it was, I got very fortunate.

136
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.310
It was a night where the moon was not out.

137
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.470
<v 2>Yes. Moon is not this astronomer's favorite thing. Yeah.</v>

138
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.180
You want the darkest sky. You can, we.

139
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.880
<v 1>Were worried as we were driving up there, that was really cloudy,</v>

140
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:12.140
but we drove through the clouds and we got to the top and we got to the

141
00:09:12.141 --> 00:09:15.980
observatory and it was the most amazing without telescopes. Just we,

142
00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:17.900
there was telescopes there, but without telescopes,

143
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.060
it was the most amazing view of the sky I'd ever seen in my life.

144
00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:26.490
And it changed my perspective of our place in the universe.

145
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.000
Looked like we were on a spaceship.

146
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.620
Like we were flying through the universe because of the diffused lighting in,

147
00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:34.454
on the big island,

148
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.760
because it's all set up so that it doesn't ruin what they're trying to

149
00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:38.720
accomplish at the CAC.

150
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.070
<v 2>Minimize reflections in the wrong place. Not only that,</v>

151
00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:47.270
if there was a moon out and you did ascend up through the clouds,

152
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.310
the Moonlight illuminates the clouds and you are an island in the middle of

153
00:09:52.311 --> 00:09:56.900
white cotton, and you're not even connected to the earth.

154
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:57.950
It's what you imagined.

155
00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:02.330
Mount Olympus would have been when that happens with the gods up there.

156
00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:06.560
And it's kind of, that's their place it's there. So, so,

157
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.030
so yes. And so any, my, my brethren,

158
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:15.500
my fellow astrophysicist, who have also observed from mountaintops, by the way,

159
00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:18.800
it's becoming a lost art because when it's not lost,

160
00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:21.620
but it's becoming something we don't do anymore. Something called service,

161
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:25.910
observing where you put in your observing program and it gets handed to a

162
00:10:25.911 --> 00:10:28.610
technician at the telescope who points the telescope,

163
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:30.320
gets the data and sends it back to you.

164
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.330
So the next generation doesn't have the experience that my generation did

165
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.490
because it was a pilgrimage to the top of the mountain.

166
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.220
And you converted your life's path.

167
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.020
You converted your life schedule to become nocturnal. And in,

168
00:10:45.021 --> 00:10:48.110
so doing you, you know, this is,

169
00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:50.660
the journey was long enough cause you're in the middle of nowhere.

170
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.450
Now you gotta go nocturnal. And by the time you're ready for this,

171
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.830
you are communing with the cosmos. It is you, the detector,

172
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.250
the telescope and the universe.

173
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.210
And there's an eerie silence up there too.

174
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.260
Cause you don't hear any the hum of maybe the, the, the draw,

175
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.940
the motor of the telescope, but that's it. And so,

176
00:11:12.941 --> 00:11:15.920
so all I'm saying is if they choose to not have it,

177
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.680
the Tulsa will go somewhere else. One of them is the Canary islands.

178
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.890
These are also volcanic, um, hilltops,

179
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:23.720
not as high as,

180
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.610
as Mt of K that's at 14,000 feet, by the way, I should have checked it.

181
00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:29.151
What temperature,

182
00:11:29.151 --> 00:11:33.350
water boils at the top of Mount a K or we could have rounded that story out. Uh,

183
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.760
but, um, I think it's around 180 degrees actually. Uh,

184
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.970
I think I did actually calculate it one time, but anyhow, so,

185
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.600
so you'd find a mountaintop and we'll put it somewhere else and the data won't

186
00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:48.050
be as good. Um, but that'll be a consequence of it.

187
00:11:48.051 --> 00:11:50.060
And none of that will go to Hawaii. How do.

188
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.130
<v 1>You think that's going to get resolved though? If you had to guess.</v>

189
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:57.050
<v 2>I don't. Um, I, uh, I,</v>

190
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.240
I just don't know.

191
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.090
<v 1>A lot of people are against it, including Jason Mamoa Aquaman's against it. Oh,</v>

192
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.830
who's out there protesting.

193
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:05.611
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

194
00:12:05.611 --> 00:12:08.570
And so we didn't get celebrity types to put the weight of their name behind it.

195
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:13.230
It, it, it magnifies the cause of others, even if they're in the minority.

196
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.640
And so I, I, like I said, I think native should I.

197
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.070
<v 0>Hasn't been, does anyone know who all the.</v>

198
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:20.940
<v 2>Natives are? Is there,</v>

199
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.940
is there some listing so that they can all vote for this one thing?

200
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.040
You wouldn't want people voting who are not native.

201
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.040
If you're voting on whether it's so sacred, you don't want to put a telescope.

202
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:33.220
There you'd want people who have a, a,

203
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.600
an indigenous, um,

204
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.810
an indigenous concern for what goes on there. And.

205
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.060
<v 1>Indigenous in reference to Hawaii is relative. Every,</v>

206
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.360
every usage of the word indigenous is relative, especially with Hawaii,

207
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.190
because I mean, the only indigenous.

208
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.110
<v 2>People are black people in Africa</v>

209
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.170
that really human life began in Africa.

210
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.830
Everyone else traveled to where they were. So,

211
00:13:00.831 --> 00:13:05.460
so native it's you set a timeframe to declare what is native and what's not.

212
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.350
And the native and it's in its simplest form is, are you born there?

213
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.210
So I'm a native, new Yorker I'm born there,

214
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.540
but I wasn't the original settler there. I would,

215
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.620
my species did not form on Manhattan island. Right.

216
00:13:19.621 --> 00:13:22.830
So everybody traveled to where they are.

217
00:13:22.831 --> 00:13:24.480
They just got there before the Europeans.

218
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.620
And so that has become the definition of indigenous art.

219
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.350
Were you there when the Europeans landed, then you're indigenous,

220
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.900
but two other life forms on that, on that rock, on that, uh, um,

221
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:42.300
uh, Hawaii's or a volcanic, it's a volcanic, um, archipelago.

222
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.520
Um, uh, do you know how that happens?

223
00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:47.730
By the way you have all these multiple volcanoes in our, in a string?

224
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.420
Do you ever wonder why, how that happens? Sure.

225
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.240
You did wonder what are you doing? Do you know why? Oh,

226
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.250
because there's a hotspot beneath earth crust, it just sitting there. Okay.

227
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.960
And when you beneath there is crushed stuff,

228
00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:05.100
doesn't move around the way it does honors crust earth, crust shifts. Okay.

229
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.930
So that hotspot, gurgles up makes a volcano. Then the hotspot goes dormant,

230
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:15.000
but the con the shelf still drifts, you still have continental drift.

231
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.720
So it drifts. Then the hotspot says time for me to gurgle again, a girl's up.

232
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.930
Now you get another volcano. And then it goes dormant.

233
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:26.040
That volcano goes dormant. It shifts you get another one. Anytime you see an,

234
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.030
a chain of islands jet guarantee,

235
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.590
they're made by volcanoes over enough time for continental drift to it shifted

236
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.670
the plates over the hotspot of Earth's mantle.

237
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.710
<v 1>So do you think what they're concerned with is the eventual spoiling of this</v>

238
00:14:43.711 --> 00:14:48.330
beautiful natural resource that slowly but surely people are putting up houses

239
00:14:48.331 --> 00:14:52.160
there and developments and all these different things.

240
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:53.660
And then the scientists are saying,

241
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:57.140
we need this sacred land because we're going to put a volcano and they're like,

242
00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:59.570
look, there's already, there's already a, I mean,

243
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:02.990
we're going to put a telescope, there's already a telescope up here enough.

244
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:04.701
You think that's what it is.

245
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:07.580
They're trying to halt the progress of civilization or, I mean,

246
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.300
maybe progress is a bad word. The expansion of civilization.

247
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:17.260
<v 2>Yeah. I mean, think let's go back. Uh, what did Teddy Roosevelt too? He said,</v>

248
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.830
we've got to preserve these lands because they're beautiful. And by the way,

249
00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:25.210
he said that after he shot all his elephants and tigers lions and tigers and

250
00:15:25.211 --> 00:15:28.570
bears, uh, yeah, I mean, I held from a museum,

251
00:15:28.571 --> 00:15:32.080
the American museum of natural history where he's the patron Saint of that

252
00:15:32.081 --> 00:15:32.890
museum.

253
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.310
What happened was he realizes how important this land is and how beautiful it

254
00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:40.090
is. And he is the, he's the patron Saint of the national park system.

255
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.190
So, so that's the secular version of sacred,

256
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.230
right? We don't say it's sacred,

257
00:15:47.231 --> 00:15:51.790
but we've all decided as a community that we care about these lands and you

258
00:15:51.791 --> 00:15:54.700
don't want to drill on it. You don't want to put housing. Um,

259
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.670
was it Lyndon Johnson's wife, lady, bird Johnson,

260
00:15:57.671 --> 00:16:01.750
who said our freeways that were so carefully building after the second world

261
00:16:01.751 --> 00:16:05.140
war, the Eisenhower freeway project. Okay. Hi, you know,

262
00:16:05.141 --> 00:16:09.490
the interstate system is, uh, this is our country.

263
00:16:09.491 --> 00:16:12.910
We want to keep it beautiful. So certain stretches over it.

264
00:16:12.911 --> 00:16:17.560
There are no billboards, billboards would, you know, um,

265
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.650
would change your relationship to nature.

266
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.580
So certain stretches of interstate or

267
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.930
secularly sacred. If, if I can say that.

268
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.220
So I remember visiting, uh, uh,

269
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.880
visiting Australia and there's the famous rock in the, um,

270
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.420
out in the Outback, uh, the old Leura, Ooh,

271
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.500
please help me get, uh, get my correct pronunciation of this

272
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.890
[inaudible] and it said, it's,

273
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.240
I'm told it's one coherent geologic rock.

274
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.920
It's not just an assembly of rocks.

275
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.050
And so I don't know enough about the geology of it,

276
00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.670
but I do know that the Australian Aborigines are Hulu room and okay.

277
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.370
Iconic red rock, look at that cool thing. Okay.

278
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.870
So that is one sort of geologic thing.

279
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.300
And, uh,

280
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.280
and climbers want to climb it by the execute it's miles in circumference. Okay.

281
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:18.250
So, uh, we visited it. I wrote,

282
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.840
I rented a bicycle with my wife and kids and we rode around it. Okay.

283
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.180
So now, um,

284
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:31.480
that is sacred to the local indigenous peoples.

285
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.910
So they don't want you to climb on it. Well, I'm a rock climber. I, you know,

286
00:17:36.911 --> 00:17:38.950
what do you care? I'm not going to ruin it. I'm not going to,

287
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.190
they don't want you to climb on it. And I try to think to myself,

288
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.680
is there a counterpart to this that would sort of wake up a westerner

289
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.960
to say I get it all right now,

290
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:56.310
suppose some people from some natives,

291
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:58.350
from Alaska or from the,

292
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.180
some tribes from Africa or some Aborigines came up from

293
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.800
these remote places of the world, walked up to the Vatican and said,

294
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.630
we want to climb the walls of this Vatican just for sport. What would we say?

295
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.830
We want to climb the walls of St.

296
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:21.660
Paul's cathedral in downtown London. What would you say? No.

297
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.860
<v 0>Are those comparable? I mean.</v>

298
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.930
<v 2>We want to repel down the tower of big Ben.</v>

299
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.250
You're going to say no, get the. Are you would say, no,

300
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.420
these are important structures to us. Now, are you going to say,

301
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:40.620
are the equivalent well, we built those and the natives didn't build the rock.

302
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.630
Right? Exactly. Okay.

303
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.740
It depends on how important that detail is to you.

304
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:52.020
All I'm saying is on the level of weak, say, this is sacred.

305
00:18:52.021 --> 00:18:53.190
You say that is sacred,

306
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.330
and now you're gonna have different rules for who's climbing.

307
00:18:57.331 --> 00:19:00.840
What I think it'll force for sure. To take pause.

308
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.120
<v 1>Here. There's an argument in fo in like supporting what you're saying.</v>

309
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.020
Look at what's going on with the Himalayas. I mean,

310
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.340
it's the human that they ha they leave behind there. All the climbers.

311
00:19:13.341 --> 00:19:18.170
So disturbing the climbers it's horrible. It's really horrible. I mean,

312
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.920
they, there's tons of it. Tons of human waste.

313
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:22.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>

314
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.940
So what you do there is if it's still not a problem that people are climbing,

315
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.970
it's that they're leaving waste. You don't stop the climbers,

316
00:19:28.971 --> 00:19:30.440
you tax them at some level.

317
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.420
So that now you have cleanup crews that come up after.

318
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.410
<v 0>Them, but it's your solution. No, it's incredible to bring anything back.</v>

319
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:41.330
So there you go. You're all texting them. You make it worth it. All right. So.

320
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.390
<v 1>You understand, like to leave the bodies up there, right?</v>

321
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:47.030
You know that they can't hurt. That's what I heard. Well,

322
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.360
why you think they could bring tons of when they can't even bring bodies?

323
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.590
<v 2>When they invented cars and cars were killing people in the street,</v>

324
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.030
because people didn't know how to cross the street.

325
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.470
They didn't know where to cross the street.

326
00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.050
People don't know how to stop the cars. They say, well,

327
00:20:00.051 --> 00:20:04.370
cars are actually a pretty useful thing. Do we ban cars? No. We make stoplights.

328
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.510
Oh, people across here where we make crosswalks, oh, let's put lanes.

329
00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:12.890
So that cars don't hit each other and let's make airbags so that you don't fly

330
00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:16.880
through the windshield. All right. So there are ways around problems.

331
00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:19.670
If you value the thing that it is that you want to do.

332
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.780
So people leaving crap up there, you make them bring it back.

333
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:29.150
Or you develop a system that enables the stuff to come back no matter what.

334
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.340
And if you can't do that and you don't want it messed up,

335
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.750
then cancel the whole operation. We didn't cancel cars.

336
00:20:35.751 --> 00:20:36.860
We got really innovative.

337
00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.190
<v 1>About how to keep them a big difference to cars and human.</v>

338
00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.510
That's left on the side of the mountain. I think the real problem too.

339
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.790
<v 0>Is I think if you value mountain.</v>

340
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.760
<v 2>And you want to keep doing it, then you solve the problem.</v>

341
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.160
This is what engineers do. That's all they do is what's your problem.

342
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.100
<v 1>Being able to bring those bodies back because of the physical limitations of the</v>

343
00:20:59.101 --> 00:21:03.210
human body, it's barely, you barely have enough juice to climb.

344
00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.860
It's so thin the air so thin. It's so dangerous.

345
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.690
<v 2>Energy draw on you. It's so hard to leave those bodies there.</v>

346
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.190
So is that the human that you're talking about or is that you're talking about

347
00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:15.600
the fact that humans were there,

348
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.380
that we got where we were not very clean about our presence.

349
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.210
That's what you're talking about. Well.

350
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.150
<v 1>We're just being human. We have to go when you gotta go. You gotta to go.</v>

351
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.440
When you got to go up there,

352
00:21:25.441 --> 00:21:28.800
you just open up the hatch and let her rip down the side of the.
