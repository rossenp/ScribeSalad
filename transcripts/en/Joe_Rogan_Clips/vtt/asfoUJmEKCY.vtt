00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.900
I've been reading that you are having some great success with your machine.

3
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:09.930
Finally. It's, uh, everything's up and running. Last time we talked,

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:13.200
you had yet to implement it actually out in the wild. And uh,

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.610
now you explain to us what happened. You had some bumps in the beginning, right?

6
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:18.680
Yes.

7
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.630
<v 1>Yeah. So it's been quite a, quite a few years finally, something's happening.</v>

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.180
Um, so we, uh,

9
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:30.950
we launched our first ocean system from San Francisco in September of last

10
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:32.990
year and we,

11
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:36.680
we took it out and roughly two months later we fit,

12
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.980
we figured that first of all, it wasn't catching plastics.

13
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:44.000
So what we saw was that the system was moving at roughly the same speed as the

14
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.410
plastics. Maybe you just take one step back the idea and how, how it works.

15
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:52.040
So it's of course we have this great Pacific garbage patch between here and

16
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:55.820
Hawaii, twice the size of Texas, a hundred million kilos of plastic,

17
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.540
doesn't go away by itself. And the idea was to,

18
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:04.100
to have this artificial coastline that is driven by the forces of the ocean,

19
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.810
we put it in there and the plastic naturally accumulates against it and kind of

20
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:09.500
stays in there.

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.270
So we can then periodically get it out because the big challenge is that,

22
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.140
although there's a lot of plastic, it's, it's spread out over this vast area.

23
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:21.410
So we first have to concentrate it before we can take it out,

24
00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:25.670
because if you were to simply troll the ocean for plastic, with boats and nets,

25
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.720
it would just take forever. Really? So, so the idea was to, to,

26
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.680
to have those artificial coastlines, we deployed the first one.

27
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:38.210
And then what we saw was that somehow the system was moving at the same speed as

28
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:43.070
the plastic. So you can imagine if this is like your, your Pac-Man,

29
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.360
and this is your, your, you know, your,

30
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:49.580
your catch and is moving at the same speed. It's not going in. Um,

31
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.270
and sometimes it did go in, but it went out again. We've got a video of it.

32
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.190
It was great. Yeah. So, so this is the basic idea. Um,

33
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.930
but it wasn't doing that. So, so, and then, you know, we thought, okay,

34
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.800
that's that's all right, we'll learn from it. We'll try and adjust the systems.

35
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:11.570
And then literally exactly a year ago, uh, the system broke into two.

36
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.970
And so at the structural failure,

37
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:17.420
forcing us to tell the whole thing back to land and, um,

38
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.100
go back to the drawing board. So, so we didn't have the best start of this year.

39
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.430
How.

40
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.880
<v 0>Much time has been lost or how much time has been spent, I should say, um,</v>

41
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.050
in the beginning phase, the initial version that you launched,

42
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.310
this is where you're at now.

43
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.080
<v 1>So we've been going on at this for since 2013.</v>

44
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.240
So after, yeah,

45
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.600
so basically after five years launching it and seeing it break into two,

46
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:46.520
that was wasn't the best start of the year I could, could have imagined. Um,

47
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.150
but then yeah, went to the drawing board, um, and you know,

48
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:52.040
the team really took it well.

49
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.280
And we took those lessons into account,

50
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.070
adjusted the design and relaunch really just a few months later.

51
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.770
So in June and this time we made the system a bit more modular,

52
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.390
so we could try different things to try and adjust the speed, make it go faster,

53
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.440
make it go slower.

54
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.650
And then what we figured was while the system isn't going fast enough,

55
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.380
what if we actually turned the problem into a solution?

56
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.550
What if we turn it around and actually slow it down so that it goes slower than

57
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:22.900
the plastic, and then what we figured, um, th that, that actually works.

58
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.370
And in October we announced that we're actually catching plastic and really just

59
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:31.210
last week, the first two shipping containers, full of plastic, where, uh,

60
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.250
Orlando important.

61
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.930
<v 0>Wow. So it's really recently up and running. Yes. Expected. Now,</v>

62
00:03:36.931 --> 00:03:39.540
how long does it take to accumulate two shipping containers full?

63
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.750
<v 1>Oh, so that was roughly month, month and a half.</v>

64
00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:46.410
And how big of these shipping containers? 20 foot. So 42 of.

65
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.190
<v 0>These rooms,</v>

66
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.790
the only thing that's really stopping it from getting more is like the actual

67
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:52.350
size of the net itself. Yeah.

68
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.340
<v 1>So, so that's the next step. So now that we can went from zero to one,</v>

69
00:03:56.341 --> 00:04:00.920
we have the basic principle of catching plastic confirmed. Uh,

70
00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:05.100
we now have to make it bigger before we can build a whole fleet of them because,

71
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.760
you know, we've,

72
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.290
we reckon we need maybe 50 or a hundred of them to really clean up path dispatch

73
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.150
of five years. That's the objective.

74
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.170
<v 0>The whole patch in five years. That's the real objective now,</v>

75
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:17.220
is that really possible?

76
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.980
<v 1>If you have enough systems, that's incredible.</v>

77
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.420
<v 0>Now, where are you at in terms of like trying to get these systems made and</v>

78
00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:25.254
implemented?

79
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.930
<v 1>Um, so, so the, um, so now we just finished this, this first step with,</v>

80
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.660
um, the system number one, that's how we called it.

81
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:36.300
And the next step is to develop what we call system two,

82
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.710
which is indeed going to be a bigger version. And, um, it,

83
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.790
the idea is to minimize the amount of festival use that you need for it.

84
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:49.560
So that comes because boats are really expensive. Um,

85
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.270
yeah, the boat that we have costs roughly 15,000 euros per day to keep running

86
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.560
just one boat. So boat, you don't want boats to, you know, would.

87
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.490
<v 0>You anticipate that it ever gets to a point where the amount of money that you</v>

88
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:06.960
can generate from the actual resource of physical plastic can actually pay for

89
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:09.750
the expert, the whole experiment? I mean, I hope.

90
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.160
<v 1>So. That's what we want to trial next year with, uh,</v>

91
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.560
by making, uh, products from the catch that we, that we make. And, you know,

92
00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:23.220
the material itself hardly has any value. It's really the story to it.

93
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.740
<v 0>Straws don't feel guilty. It's a recycled straw.</v>

94
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.530
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Throw that in the ocean again.</v>

95
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.800
<v 0>Yeah. That's terrible idea. But what would it be?</v>

96
00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:37.950
A very sustainable business model? Just, yeah. Just keep going. Yeah.

97
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.150
What is the, um, what are the products that you're thinking about? Oh, well.

98
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.900
<v 1>We have a few ideas. We, so it's still kind of under development.</v>

99
00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:49.080
So I think in September we should be ready to launch the first one,

100
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.760
but I think it's going to be things that are jural that don't end up in ways

101
00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:58.580
that you actually, that will retain their value. So it can last for a very,

102
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:03.350
very long time and, uh, that you actually want and ideally carry around.

103
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:06.990
So you can talk about with other people. And, um, actually now,

104
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.760
so just last week we were the first plastic on shore. We said, okay,

105
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.870
now we welcome our supporters to actually make, um, well,

106
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:18.650
I shouldn't call it a reservation, but kind of, um, make a, make a down payment,

107
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.900
um, so that, um, you can be first in line. So if people go to our website,

108
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.310
they can actually put in the 50 bucks and get the right for the first ever

109
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:30.400
products made from the great Pacific garbage. Gotcha.

110
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.000
<v 0>So you're just trying to figure out what products will have the most</v>

111
00:06:34.001 --> 00:06:37.510
sustainability, what products people keep for the longest yeah. And.

112
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.450
<v 1>Things that people want. Right. You don't want some kind of gimmick,</v>

113
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.550
that's just going to be this paperweight.

114
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.090
<v 0>Flip-flops seemed like an easy one, right? Yeah. Don't they, I mean,</v>

115
00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:48.610
people love to buy flip flops if they bought flip-flops,

116
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.620
especially people that are like a sort of like outdoorsy type folks. Sure.

117
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.454
Appreciate it.

118
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.950
<v 1>And maybe I have to write these things down. Um.</v>

119
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.060
<v 0>Flip-flops, that's pretty easy. One. Any other ideas? Um, what else, Jamie,</v>

120
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.250
what else would be a good one? Belts. People like belts, shoes,

121
00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:09.760
any flip-flop shoes, like definitely some Yeezys,

122
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.370
some dope recycled. Yeah. Some recycled sneakers. Like what is foam?

123
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.140
Like the foam that they make running shoes out of.

124
00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:21.220
That's a very specific type of a, yeah. It's not actual plastic. Right.

125
00:07:21.221 --> 00:07:22.510
It's probably made us, it's.

126
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.620
<v 1>A type of plastic. We, we might be able to, to foam this material as well.</v>

127
00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:27.670
I think we've done tests with.

128
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.890
<v 0>That. Yeah. Or really turn it into foam. Yeah. Oh,</v>

129
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.080
there's some sort of a process. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

130
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:37.030
you could make athletic shoes, that'd be easy, right. People, but they would,

131
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.590
you'd have to have a way to make, to like incentivize people to recycle them.

132
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.370
It would be so ironic for those things wound up, back in the ocean. You know,

133
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.700
there's gotta be a way to do that, just to, you know, like have, like,

134
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.710
if you have your own company,

135
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.600
like drop off points in cities where, when they're done with their stuff,

136
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.210
if it's broken down or it's old, I've used it,

137
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.100
you could throw it into this bin and you will ensure that it gets converted back

138
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:07.030
into raw materials and utilized again. Right. Yeah. Circular economy. Yeah.

139
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.880
That'd be a great move if you and people would do that. If they,

140
00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:12.790
if you made it easy for them, you know, it's sorta like recycling bins,

141
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.030
they make it easy for them. They'll they'll throw their bottle in there. Sure.

142
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.130
No. Okay. So, um,

143
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:23.470
you have these two cargo ships or these two cargo containers, uh,

144
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.940
filled with this plastic stuff. Um, what do you do with it now? Yeah.

145
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.560
<v 1>So now it's going to Europe.</v>

146
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:34.120
Fortunately there isn't really any useful recycling infrastructure in the U S

147
00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:38.010
so, um, so we set up this, this, um, infrastructure in, in,

148
00:08:38.011 --> 00:08:42.520
in Europe to be able to for sort it and then shred it and then recycle it

149
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.770
and then, um, make those first products out of them. So hopefully, um,

150
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.420
and hopefully with that then generate the cash needed to, to continue, uh,

151
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.740
running the cleanup. But of course now it's still small. Right.

152
00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.330
Eventually we should have those number of shipping containers every, you know,

153
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.164
every day.

154
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.860
<v 0>So do you have like a group of people that are trying to come up with ideas of</v>

155
00:09:03.861 --> 00:09:04.850
what to make out of the plastic?

156
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.870
<v 1>Yeah. So I have a little team in, uh, inside the ultra cleanup working on that.</v>

157
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.270
And, um, yeah, so they,

158
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.150
I think they said that by September, they should be ready to,

159
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:16.700
to launch the first product. So.

160
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.900
<v 0>That's great, man. That's the whole idea behind it's beautiful.</v>

161
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.110
Don't you have a river system too, as well, right? Yes.

162
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.400
<v 1>So, so that's the other thing, right? So on one hand we need to,</v>

163
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.800
we need to clean up what's what's running in the ocean,

164
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.360
doesn't go away by itself. And, um, yeah, basically the only way to,

165
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:40.070
to deal with that is to just get out, go out there and clean it up. Um,

166
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.330
but of course then there's this other side of the equation, which is,

167
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.530
there are still huge, huge amounts of plastic flowing into the ocean every day,

168
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.880
mostly from countries in central America. Um,

169
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.170
south Southeast Asia,

170
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.850
where people are kind of at the stage of development or countries are,

171
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.440
are at a stage of development where,

172
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.820
where the people are wealthy enough to consume a lot of things that are wrapped

173
00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:08.840
in plastic. Yet there isn't any waste infrastructure yet to take care of it.

174
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:13.220
So you literally see people on, on scooters just,

175
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.440
uh, drive to a bridge to dump their municipal waste into the river,

176
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.940
because they're simply the easiest way to get rid of it to your point. You know,

177
00:10:22.941 --> 00:10:24.230
what's easiest people will do.

178
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:29.600
And so it's not really that people don't care there or

179
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.010
that they, um, are less civilized or something, but it's really a combination.

180
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.920
There's a lot of people and there is no infrastructure that,

181
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.920
that they can make use of. So, so then back in 2015, we were like, okay,

182
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.630
maybe at some point in time, this, this ocean thing will work out, who knows,

183
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.320
but then we're stuck with this problem that there's still so much plastic

184
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.110
flowing in that we would just have to keep going forever.

185
00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:58.160
And that would just be not, not very motivating.

186
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.090
And we want to be this project with a beginning and an end. So, so we're like,

187
00:11:02.091 --> 00:11:05.030
okay, so where's the plastic coming from? And then we figured, you know,

188
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.020
probably rivers rivers are like these, these are trees that carried a Trek from,

189
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.690
from land to sea because, you know,

190
00:11:10.691 --> 00:11:14.870
when it rains plastic washers from streets to Creek to river,

191
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.270
to ocean. And, um,

192
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.170
but then we found out that there's a hundred thousand rivers in the world.

193
00:11:21.171 --> 00:11:25.550
So that's kind of a big amount if you want to do something about it. So,

194
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.820
um, so we started doing measurements and rivers,

195
00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:32.930
and then what we found was that just 1% of rivers are responsible for

196
00:11:32.931 --> 00:11:35.420
80% of the, of the pollution.

197
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:40.670
So really just a very tiny amount of rivers. If you were to tackle,

198
00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:42.820
those could really address the,

199
00:11:42.821 --> 00:11:46.130
the majority of the plastic going into the ocean. And it's,

200
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.260
it's mostly like these relatively small rivers in, um, in,

201
00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:55.210
in capital cities, like Manila, like Jakarta, like Kuala Lumpur.

202
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.800
We have very high density of people, uh, near the coasts.

203
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.490
That's where most of the leakage, most of the emissions occurs. So,

204
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.770
so since 2015,

205
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.150
we've been kind of as a secret side project been working on, um,

206
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.880
seeing what can we actually develop something to intercept the plastic in,

207
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.690
in those rivers. And, uh, we just launch it month ago,

208
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.890
we call it the interceptor and it's this, uh, yeah,

209
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.600
it is scalable, um, system that that's almost like plug and play.

210
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:30.400
So you bring it to a river and, um, you install it and it,

211
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.780
it just works. It's fully autonomous solar powered. So.

212
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.750
<v 0>This is all real, the real plastic that's being pulled.</v>

213
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.840
<v 2>Out of this river from your machine. Yeah. So this was incredible.</v>

214
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.460
<v 1>This was the prototype. Um, so this is amazing. This was in Jakarta.</v>

215
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.380
<v 0>For people we're just listening. We're looking at this thing,</v>

216
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.870
pull enormous amounts of plastic out of this river,

217
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.960
and it's also doing so in there, they're stacking it into these bags. It's,

218
00:12:53.961 --> 00:12:56.580
it's a large physical quantity of stuff.

219
00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.660
<v 1>Oh yeah. And then maybe you can actually pull up the video interceptor too.</v>

220
00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:03.810
And in Malaysia. So we already have two of them in, um,

221
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.000
in real life as we speak. And.

222
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:10.410
<v 0>Is it avoid doing anything with fish? How do you avoid, um,</v>

223
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.650
kept accidentally, oh my God. Is that real? Yeah. So.

224
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.310
<v 1>This is,</v>

225
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.870
this is the clang river in Kuala Lumpur and it's according to our model,

226
00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:20.670
it's like the fifth, most polluting river in the world.

227
00:13:20.671 --> 00:13:25.230
So 1% of all plastic going into the world's oceans is coming from that one

228
00:13:25.231 --> 00:13:26.220
river. And then this.

229
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.340
<v 0>Is unbelievable how polluted this is, this is crazy. It's.</v>

230
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.920
<v 1>10 Million kilos per year, roughly. So.</v>

231
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.730
<v 0>Just, just looking at it, it looks like a wasteland. That's so sad.</v>

232
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.080
<v 1>Yeah. So, um, so then we, um, so,</v>

233
00:13:40.081 --> 00:13:43.110
so we now have four interceptors. Two of them have already been deployed.

234
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.190
So here's the one, uh, going to, um, to the,

235
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.930
to this clang river and kind of wanted to make it look like a, like a spaceship,

236
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.720
um, just so that people would like it. And so it has this barrier that,

237
00:13:56.721 --> 00:13:59.550
that concentrates the plastic to the mouth of the interceptor,

238
00:13:59.551 --> 00:14:03.630
where you have a conveyor belt that then scoops it out of the water, uh, again,

239
00:14:03.631 --> 00:14:08.280
fully solar and battery powered and then deposits it on to this

240
00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:13.110
moving shadow, um, conveyor, which then distributed across these,

241
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.120
uh, big dumpsters can hold roughly 50 cubic meters of trash. And,

242
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.190
um, yeah, it just works by itself. So it's, um, that's what it does, how.

243
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.510
<v 0>Much this that's an insane amount of garbage that you're pulling out of there.</v>

244
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.670
When you look at it, visit visually folks, you can watch the video.

245
00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:30.780
What does the name of this video? Jamie?

246
00:14:30.781 --> 00:14:34.470
So people need to find it rivers interceptor. Oh, oh,

247
00:14:34.471 --> 00:14:37.530
two cleaning in Malaysia is the title of the YouTube video.

248
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.630
It's crazy now. And you're not catching any fish in there.

249
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.410
<v 1>Oh yeah. So, uh, so because this is barriers,</v>

250
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.440
nonpermeable the current just flows underneath it. Um, basically the,

251
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.980
the sea life can pass it actually, at one point we had this giant lizard,

252
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:58.670
which was probably two meters. We should post that photo.

253
00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:03.560
It was kind of climbing onto the barrier and then have just swim around it. So,

254
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.640
um.

255
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.990
<v 3>Two meters, really? Yeah. I want a half day. It was what kind of lizard is that?</v>

256
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.400
Uh.

257
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.550
<v 1>Yeah, for, I don't know the name, but it was some kind.</v>

258
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.600
<v 0>Of monitor or something monitor that's you're right. Yeah.</v>

259
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.680
Is that you see an image of that? No.

260
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.580
Do you next week? Oh, you haven't posted it before. Oh, okay.

261
00:15:24.581 --> 00:15:27.610
He was looking for it. Yeah. I thought you were saying it was out there. Um,

262
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.980
so it's safer fish. Um,

263
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.880
what about the stuff that doesn't float on the very surface? Right.

264
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:34.870
<v 1>So the,</v>

265
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:39.130
this isn't goes down one meter that what we measured is that really almost all

266
00:15:39.131 --> 00:15:41.980
the plastic is in that top layer. So sure.

267
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.170
It won't be a hundred percent efficient,

268
00:15:44.171 --> 00:15:48.610
but I think it's really about having this pragmatic thing that catches most of

269
00:15:48.611 --> 00:15:48.970
it.

270
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.610
<v 0>And most importantly, leaves wildlife alone.</v>

271
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.250
Cause everything else can just swim underneath that. Exactly. Yeah.

272
00:15:54.251 --> 00:15:56.290
That's that's great. Um,

273
00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:00.580
and so this plan that you had, uh, when, you know,

274
00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:02.680
it's been six years running,

275
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.320
how much of your daily time is devoted to this? Oh,

276
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:09.250
I.

277
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.640
<v 1>Don't think there's much, much free time at all.</v>

278
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.700
It's so I suppose your past year,

279
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.950
I've not had a single free day. Uh, so not a single yeah,

280
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.310
just 9:00 AM to usually, you know,

281
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.990
9:00 PM in the office just it's been a

282
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.620
busy, but I think it was, um, it was worth it.

283
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.080
And I'm looking where we were beginning of the year to where we're now.

284
00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:39.490
<v 0>Now that you've actually pulled these cargo containers filled with plastic out</v>

285
00:16:39.491 --> 00:16:43.180
of the ocean. That must give you an extreme feeling of satisfaction. Right.

286
00:16:43.181 --> 00:16:47.830
That you've, you've actually made it work like it's moving now.

287
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.920
<v 1>So I was, I was kind of hoping for that feeling,</v>

288
00:16:50.921 --> 00:16:54.310
but then when you get to that point, you're like, okay, but there's still,

289
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.760
you can really only see the amount of work that's still ahead of you. So,

290
00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:02.980
so it's actually really hard to have enjoy successes

291
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.730
in, in a way. Um, I should probably get better at that.

292
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.980
<v 0>It's hard. Well, particularly what you're doing,</v>

293
00:17:08.981 --> 00:17:11.890
you have a monumental task in front of you.

294
00:17:11.891 --> 00:17:15.820
And what you're doing is rightly being applauded by so many people,

295
00:17:15.821 --> 00:17:17.960
but I don't know how many people are actually helping you. You,

296
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.690
you have a crazy thing that you're doing.

297
00:17:19.691 --> 00:17:21.460
You're trying to pull the plastic out of the ocean.

298
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:25.900
When people find out about the great Pacific garbage patch, they get panicky.

299
00:17:25.901 --> 00:17:28.150
They're like, what, how long has this been going on? How do I,

300
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.510
how do I not know about this? Because so few people, I mean,

301
00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:34.180
I would think like maybe 40% of the population understands.

302
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.670
There's a gigantic patch of garbage in the middle of the ocean.

303
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.640
<v 1>Was discovered 20 years ago. Exactly. 20 years ago.</v>

304
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.010
And still it's there just been growing.

305
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.420
<v 0>1998, no one had a clue. Nope. And then they went, wait, Hey,</v>

306
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.410
what what's going on here is all this garbage.

307
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.850
And it keeps getting bigger and bigger, right?

308
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.560
<v 1>Yeah. It's actually quite a good story. This is the sailor called Charles Moore.</v>

309
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.640
It was participating in a sail race between Hawaii and California.

310
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:04.620
And, um, while others would go further north, he thought, well, let's try and,

311
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.900
uh, cut off this, this piece. And then he was looking at the water and he just,

312
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.500
just saw all that, all that trash. And um, then he went back,

313
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:17.130
he was shocked about it. And then he decided to,

314
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.050
to take some measurements,

315
00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.190
published the results and that kind of popularized that whole concept of the

316
00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:24.680
great Pacific garbage patch. Um.

317
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.310
<v 0>It's,</v>

318
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.970
it's a weird thing to see when you see drones flying over it and you see the

319
00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:31.940
footage of it. And it's also, it's, it's a lot,

320
00:18:31.941 --> 00:18:35.750
a lot of it is a lot smaller than people think of it because it's broken down by

321
00:18:35.751 --> 00:18:36.920
the ocean. Right? Yeah.

322
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.920
<v 1>So that's, that's what happens over time is that this,</v>

323
00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.090
these larger objects have basically enters the ocean, uh,

324
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:49.010
due to the working of the waves as well as the sun breaks down to

325
00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:50.360
these smaller, smaller pieces,

326
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.620
which is actually not really a good thing because these smaller pieces are then

327
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:59.150
easier to ingest for, for fish and other wildlife. So, um, so the smaller,

328
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.890
it gets in a way that the more harmful it gets as well. And fortunately,

329
00:19:03.891 --> 00:19:08.870
what we see is that still at 92% of the plastic is still, um,

330
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.020
non microplastics, so big stuff. But of course,

331
00:19:12.021 --> 00:19:14.240
if we don't clean it up over the next few decades,

332
00:19:14.241 --> 00:19:16.520
all of that big stuff will also become microplastics.

333
00:19:16.521 --> 00:19:17.900
And then we're in a much worse.

334
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.580
<v 0>State, is the cleanup of Microsoft those microplastics possible,</v>

335
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.490
or is it just something that needs to be sort of rethought out? Well?

336
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.300
<v 1>So, uh, that was actually one of the positive surprises that we,</v>

337
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.780
that we had this year is that the cleanup system in the patch,

338
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.330
wasn't just catching plastic and not just the big stuff,

339
00:19:35.331 --> 00:19:40.070
it was also catching most of the microplastics. So down to one minute.

340
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.710
<v 0>Clogged up with all the other stuff, is that what it is?</v>

341
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.570
<v 1>We're not exactly sure how it was able to do that, but, uh,</v>

342
00:19:47.571 --> 00:19:51.440
we just saw huge amounts of those, those microplastics in the system.

343
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:55.040
It's probably has to do something with the radiation of the wave.

344
00:19:55.041 --> 00:19:59.750
So you have that big pipe that keeps the system together and because

345
00:19:59.751 --> 00:20:03.620
waves are kind of crashing against it, it reflects waves as well.

346
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.390
And almost like a lens,

347
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:10.040
it was concentrating those microplastics into one patch in the middle of the

348
00:20:10.041 --> 00:20:14.960
system, which so it was kind of holding them into, into, into the system.

349
00:20:14.961 --> 00:20:17.480
So that was so that's, that was really, um,

350
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.260
we weren't expecting to collect microplastics, but there we were pretty cool.

351
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.800
<v 0>Um, so now where are you at,</v>

352
00:20:24.801 --> 00:20:29.660
in terms of trying to expand it to a point where you could, you know,

353
00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:34.490
really get this goal of half of the plastic or the ocean in five years? Yeah.

354
00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.030
<v 1>So, so it, it would probably be easier if we had one goal,</v>

355
00:20:38.031 --> 00:20:42.140
but we now set two goals for ourselves. One is the 50% of five year for the,

356
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:46.850
for the patch. But the other one is that we want to have interceptors,

357
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:52.240
um, into the 1000 most polluting rivers, the ones that do the 80% in,

358
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:57.520
um, in the next five years. So we'll be, we'll be pretty busy, really,

359
00:20:57.521 --> 00:21:01.480
really busy. Yes. So if you're not busy enough, yeah. How many.

360
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.670
<v 0>People are working for your, in your organization.</v>

361
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:04.630
<v 1>Now? About a hundred.</v>

362
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.790
And I think really team has been as now better than it's ever been.

363
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.680
So fortunately there is, there's definitely a lot of help. Uh, but, um,

364
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.520
but we're still recruiting, uh, quite, I think not, not are 20,

365
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:22.900
30 people coming off a year. So, um, it's definitely,

366
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.550
there is a lot of work to do. And what is this ride been like for you from.
