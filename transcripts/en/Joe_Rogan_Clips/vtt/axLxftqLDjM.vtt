00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.480
<v 1>Experience. By the way, I was one of my boys was home sick the other day, uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:10.040
from school, the middle boy Slugo. And, uh, so we were sitting on the sofa.

4
00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:13.520
I said, well, you know, you're not feeling you wanna watch a movie. Oh,

5
00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:15.880
God bless him. He's he's 10 years old. He considers himself a baller.

6
00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:18.120
All he wants to do is play basketball. That's all he wants to do with his life.

7
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:19.520
He knows he's gonna get, uh,

8
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.830
recruited by two knows he's gonna end up in the NBA. And,

9
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.550
but we're sitting there and it was really kind of sweet cuz he's, you know,

10
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:28.590
he's got all this hard side to him and I'm just playing ball. And then he says,

11
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:30.150
well, yeah, let's watch a Disney movie.

12
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.430
So we kind of dialed up Disney plus because we like were sheep and we bought the

13
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:40.390
Disney plus thing and, and uh, Peter pan and the original Peter pan, right.

14
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.700
The original E Peter pan.

15
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.460
So we turned it on and I'd forgotten what that movie was like in terms of its

16
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:49.140
treatment of native Americans. Oh, horrible. My God.

17
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.220
So we're watching it and we get to that part where, you know, they're,

18
00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:53.580
they're singing that song and the,

19
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.260
the boys lost boys are tied up with windy and Michael and all, and, and the,

20
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.940
the, the chief comes in and he wants to find tiger Lily, the princess, you know,

21
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:05.210
because hook is, the viewers are like, what the hell's going on here. So anyway,

22
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.370
I'm sitting there and, and even Slugo looks at me and he goes, wow,

23
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.530
this is kind of racist. &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; really,

24
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.570
but a 10 year old said that, yeah. 10 year old sense. And I thought, well, okay,

25
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.530
everything was racist back. Everything was racist. Well, that's what we had.

26
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:22.880
We had a conversation. I said, yeah, know what you, yeah,

27
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.160
pretty much what I told them.

28
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.080
<v 0>But anyway, well, particularly about native Americans. I mean, they just,</v>

29
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.800
they were able to get away with it. Mm. Nobody, nobody protested it. I've been,

30
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.000
uh, I'm reading this book now or I'm listening to it on tape called uh,

31
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.640
black elk speaks it's about this, uh,

32
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.240
Al Sioux medicine man who was, uh, while he was still alive in the,

33
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.030
the 1930s, they, they wrote this book. We,

34
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.390
he told the story of Custer and he was there.

35
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.830
He was a young boy when Custer was killed.

36
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.950
And he told the story of like life on the planes and crazy horse.

37
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.830
And it's fascinating. What was it written? It's written in 1930s. Okay.

38
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.950
Early. It's called what? Black Elks. Black elk speaks. Okay. I've written,

39
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.580
I've listened to on tape. Uh,

40
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.860
this is like the fourth or fifth one that I've listened to on native Americans

41
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.380
over the last couple of months. But this is the best one.

42
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.220
This is the best one because not that the other ones. Weren't great.

43
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:13.741
They were great.

44
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:18.260
But what's interesting about this is the actual words of a man who lived that

45
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:20.940
life. It's not just a historical, um,

46
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.810
a book about the time and describes the events at the time.

47
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.690
This is a guy describing what he saw and he was talking particular about war,

48
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.970
about the way it was when you know, they killed Custer. And you,

49
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:35.330
he was there when they killed Custer. Yeah. And just the,

50
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.530
the battles between the American soldiers and the native Americans. It's like,

51
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.920
it's crazy. It's crazy to think that it happened just a show time ago. Yeah.

52
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.840
And, and it's also crazy to think that if no one came to America, if like,

53
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.800
if the world just stayed in Europe and Asia and,

54
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.240
and then the way it had been before Columbus and before the pilgrims and all

55
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:00.480
that, these people would probably still be living like that.

56
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.640
Cuz that's not that long.

57
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.200
<v 1>Ago. Well, I mean, it's you think about it's it's what was it?</v>

58
00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:06.680
It was a waring tribal culture. Yeah. Well else. I mean,

59
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.440
where else do we have this? I I'm probably gonna make a Bo at this point,

60
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.560
but um, yeah. War tribal cultures in the middle east. Right. I mean, it's, it's,

61
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:18.280
it's a, it's, it's, it's, it's a difficult environment, right.

62
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.070
In which to say, okay,

63
00:03:20.071 --> 00:03:22.310
we're gonna have some sort of federal system we're gonna come together.

64
00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:25.750
We're gonna work for the greater good, you know? And, but I, I mean,

65
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:29.750
I think it's, I will say this, I, the most depressing, um,

66
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.230
scenes I've ever seen have been on, um,

67
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.430
native American Indian reservations in this country. And I I've never been,

68
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.403
oh my God.

69
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.060
<v 0>Um, I've never, other than casinos.</v>

70
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.540
<v 1>It's just, um, you go and you and I, I look,</v>

71
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.820
I spent most of my adult life overseas right. In some pretty grim places.

72
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.260
And I remember the first time I,

73
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.860
I was on a reservation here in the us and I thought, how can this,

74
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.340
how can this possibly be here?

75
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.060
And I know that's a naive you've thought and people think, well, how,

76
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.610
how could you not know that it was here? But it's, you know, a,

77
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:05.610
it's not a good history, but B it's, it's not a good follow up either. I mean,

78
00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:09.010
right. We haven't, we just, to this day, we don't do a very good job at all.

79
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.450
And, uh, the reservation systems, not, not all of 'em, of course it's not,

80
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.130
it's like every, you know, not every urban center is, you know, crime. Right.

81
00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.890
I mean, that's ridiculous, but I'm just saying in general, you know,

82
00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:22.120
some of the most difficult place I've ever seen have been right here in our

83
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:25.080
borders, right. On Indian reservations and good.

84
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.760
<v 0>God. Yeah. I want to get someone who's in here. Someone to come in here,</v>

85
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.920
who's a native American,

86
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.200
who's a historian who really understands the history of,

87
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.960
of their tribe and someone who could come in here and talk to me about it

88
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.400
because I just had a,

89
00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:40.990
sort of a peripheral understanding of it up until about five or six months ago.

90
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.550
I really, you know, I,

91
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.550
I had seen movies and I had read books and I'd kind of understood, but I,

92
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.950
I didn't really, really get into it until I started reading these books.

93
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.883
And it's just,

94
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.990
it's just incredible to think that there was millions and millions of tribes or

95
00:04:56.991 --> 00:04:58.110
millions and millions of, um,

96
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.790
members of different tribes living in this country,

97
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.340
like basically like stone age people just 150 years.

98
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.420
<v 1>Ago. And, and oftentimes, you know, in, in constant conflict with each other,</v>

99
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.320
yes.

100
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.820
<v 0>That's a big thing that I didn't really understand. Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.300
The horrific things they did to each other, kidnapped each other,

102
00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:16.020
tortured each other. Yeah. And we came along.

103
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.820
<v 1>And they're like, what the? Come on, lightening up. I, geez. We, we,</v>

104
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.740
we brought 'em a whole new.

105
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.690
<v 0>Level. Uh, well, as soon as we figured out repeating guns,</v>

106
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.250
soon as they figured out revolvers with more than one bullet loose,

107
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.450
cuz they were fighting the Manches originally they were fighting 'em with

108
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.370
muskets and the Comanches could shoot like six arrows in 10 seconds.

109
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.210
So they would just lighten these soldiers up cuz they couldn't reload. Right.

110
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.970
So they would wait for the initial volley and then they'd charge in.

111
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.720
And they also could, they were such great horsemen.

112
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:46.720
They could actually shoot underneath the horse's neck.

113
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.360
So they'd hold onto the rain somehow where they were under the horse's neck and

114
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:54.360
they were protected and they were shooting at the soldiers. Yeah.

115
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.800
And they were shooting from horses.

116
00:05:55.801 --> 00:05:59.240
Nobody knew how to do that before everybody got off the horse to shoot. Yeah.

117
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.600
And they were shooting covering. Yeah.

118
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.160
<v 1>I mean, I feel bad for the horse, but he is covering concealment.</v>

119
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.840
<v 0>That's how the command sheets apparently dominated is that they had so many</v>

120
00:06:07.841 --> 00:06:09.240
horses, they were rich in horses.

121
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.880
They were the ones that figured out how to master the horse the best mm-hmm

122
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.120
&lt;affirmative&gt; they also used small horses.

123
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.070
They didn't use like these big horses is that the Americans used. Right, right,

124
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.510
right. And they were small people. Comanche were fairly small people.

125
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.510
<v 1>Yeah. No it's it's it is, it is a absolutely it's a fascinating history.</v>

126
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:27.030
I've spent more time reading sort of the military aspects of, of,

127
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.230
of the Indian wars, right. From, you know, the us military side of things.

128
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.190
And occasionally it'll a book will stray into sort of, okay, well let's look,

129
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.260
you know, from a perspective of, you know, the, the,

130
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.940
the whichever tribe they were in battle with, but not usually very good.

131
00:06:42.941 --> 00:06:45.580
So I'll pick up this book cuz it, it, it is,

132
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:48.220
it's an amazing history and you're right. It's not that long ago.

133
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.900
<v 0>There's another great book. Uh,</v>

134
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:51.780
well there's quite a few of 'em with blood and thunder.

135
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.300
It's about kit Carson read. That is good.

136
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.930
<v 1>Man, that dude, he was a beat. Get him on the show. My God. Yeah.</v>

137
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.530
He, no, he, he was tremendous. Right? Yeah. And, and from nothing right.

138
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:04.690
Came from nothing. Right. So.

139
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.730
<v 0>Uh, and was a small guy wasn't, you know, had a soft voice.</v>

140
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.850
<v 1>And yeah, there was a, there was a show, um, men who made America,</v>

141
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.480
I think, um, or it was a follow on from that. But it, they,

142
00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:21.240
they had a, a handful of episodes about kit Carson,

143
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:24.280
but they kind of went through, they picked out some of the, sort of the, the,

144
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.280
the individuals you would imagine. Right. I mean, Daniel Boone and,

145
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.320
and some of the others characters as the frontier.

146
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.920
I think the men who built a frontier I think is what it was called as a

147
00:07:31.921 --> 00:07:34.880
follow-on to that series that they did about the men who built America.

148
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.710
Um okay. Which seems misogynistic. Um, but women probably helped,

149
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.470
they, they, you know, be behind every great Titan of industry. There was, um,

150
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.230
a woman in several of his mistresses. Um, but I think that this,

151
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.670
this thing about building the frontiers was interesting. They tried,

152
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.710
they tried to provide a perspective from, um,

153
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.900
the native American Indian's point of view.

154
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.620
I don't think they necessarily did a very good job because I think they just had

155
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:06.060
so much room to cover, but it was still worth watching. So it was,

156
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.053
it was a good series.

157
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.060
<v 0>Yeah. I think most of us are pretty ignorant to what goes on on the reservations</v>

158
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.020
today. And, uh, me included, you know,

159
00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:19.100
you hear these horrible stories of alcoholism and poverty and, you know,

160
00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:23.090
it's just the, they live in these nations inside of a nation. That's, it's,

161
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:26.210
what's very strange. And the only thing that really, you know,

162
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.290
there's natural resources that can help them,

163
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.170
but really gambling gambling becomes a big revenue source for a lot of them.

164
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.023
And then.

165
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.410
<v 1>And then people are trying to gain the system they'll pun intended,</v>

166
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.050
but people are gaming the system and saying, ah,

167
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:41.120
I'm gonna create this non-existent tribe. Right. You get that in Washington,

168
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.920
DC is can't swing a dead cat without hitting some lobbyist.

169
00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:48.320
Who's trying to push for designation of some obscure element as a tribe. Right.

170
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.280
So that they can simply apply for a CA license. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Yeah.

171
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.680
I, I don't know. I'm not sure how you, how you turn that around. There's the,

172
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.480
uh, the native American Indian museum in DC, um, that opened several years back.

173
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.840
Um, it's very good. It's a little tough to follow. I,

174
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.200
I will say this much in terms of just the way they've laid the museum out.

175
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.000
Right. And, uh, but it's,

176
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.950
it's just absolutely full of the ceiling of incredible stories and art and

177
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.590
history bits, but, uh, it's definitely worth people going to DC if they,

178
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.150
if they're saying, okay, I'm gonna go to the Smithsonians.

179
00:09:20.151 --> 00:09:23.270
They should put that one on the list because it's, it's really fascinating.
