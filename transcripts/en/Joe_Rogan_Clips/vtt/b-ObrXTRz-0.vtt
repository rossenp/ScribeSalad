00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.470
I like to tell people my paths don't define me.

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.960
It refined me. Oh, I got you see,

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.550
because it's so much that I see.

5
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:21.440
I have four now so much that I

6
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:26.240
see that I've seen, I've witnessed, I've done myself personally,

7
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.750
or, you know, I've been very, very close to the action.

8
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.660
And I'm an odd man. I say, well, you know, if you do this,

9
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:38.300
then more likely this will be the outcome.

10
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.380
That's why I never joined a gang because I was like,

11
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.900
not that I didn't do anything wrong,

12
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:49.820
but I felt like if I'm going to do something wrong, I trust me to not snitch.

13
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.890
Yeah. So best reason for it.

14
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.060
I'm going to tell you a story that I tell your story. Never, never told public.

15
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.120
In the

16
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.573
mid eighties,

17
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.520
there was some cat killings in Houston that it was killing cab cab

18
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:14.870
drivers. Right?

19
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.320
The guys who were involved, who started it,

20
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.670
came to my house first to get me to go with them, to hit a lick.

21
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.710
We pour we in the hood. You know, like everybody needs money.

22
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.060
Some of us we're not going to eat. You know,

23
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.300
if we don't go out there and kill something, not literally kill a person,

24
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:42.800
but kill something, you know, so that we can, that we can, um,

25
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.480
nourish our bodies. Right. It came to me,

26
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.410
Hey man, look, we finna go do this one on.

27
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.870
And I look out and I see light is the dude that wanted to catch that's,

28
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.930
you know, in the neighborhood, that tough guy.

29
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.870
And then I S I look out and I see like three other dudes with him, high hell,

30
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.480
nah, that's too many dudes. Now, if,

31
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.370
if he wouldn't have had that many people with him,

32
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:11.510
I probably would have went with him.

33
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.830
If it would've just been him and another cat, alright,

34
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.960
I probably would have went. I don't know.

35
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.050
But he had like three other dudes with him. And

36
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.420
the next morning I hear a cab driver,

37
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.380
old black dude in the neighborhood. Well, he wasn't from the neighborhood,

38
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.640
but they killed him in the neighborhood. A,

39
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.230
the elderly dude. And they only took like 30 something bucks, man.

40
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.960
Uh, and so I know that's what happened, right?

41
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.850
So then over the next, like maybe three weeks, four more cab drivers get killed.

42
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.850
I know I'm pretty good. I got a pretty good idea.

43
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.220
Who's doing this, right?

44
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.800
Because I'm not the only one that knows it's other

45
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.530
people that know these guys and they're talking.

46
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.830
So there's murmurs in the streets

47
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.370
about this happening. So then they get caught up.

48
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.660
And each of these guys,

49
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.760
they end up with the one that got the less years was like 15 years.

50
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.060
All of these guys were miners, except that the main one,

51
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.680
they were 14 to like 19 years old.

52
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.160
So they ended up with a minimum 15 years.

53
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.860
And then the one that got to max was like 40 years.

54
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.850
So my life would have been very, very much different.

55
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.710
And I walked out that door that night.

56
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.600
<v 1>Wow. That's amazing.</v>

57
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.850
<v 0>Yes. I can see a lot of things happening. Like I can see, you know,</v>

58
00:03:56.851 --> 00:03:58.980
like experience, you know,

59
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.700
I can S I can see a lot of things happening from my own experience,

60
00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.170
but other people's experience too.

61
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:08.220
And I personally do believe that experience is not the best teacher,

62
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.680
other people's experiences, the best teacher.

63
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.320
Because if I see you go

64
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:19.860
out and if you walk around the corner

65
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.680
and you come back running back bleeding

66
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.690
profusely, Oh man, these guys around come at me, man,

67
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.320
why would I run my silly around the corner?

68
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.940
<v 1>Right. What's going to happen to me. Right? What what's likely to happen to me?</v>

69
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.060
What could happen to me if I go around that same corner

70
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.083
next?

71
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.290
<v 0>So, no, I'm not going around the corner. I'm going in the opposite direction.</v>

72
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.210
In fact, give them by me, man.

73
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.540
Cause they might come stab you again and get me while I'm with you.

74
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.300
<v 1>Yeah, I think you're right. I think you can learn from both,</v>

75
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.860
but you can learn the terrible lessons from other people that are having to do.

76
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.530
<v 0>Without ever having to do it.</v>

77
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.260
Then you stick your hand in the fire and it burned you.

78
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.670
Why the hell would I stick mine in that fire?

79
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.080
And let it burn me unless I want to be burned. So that's why,

80
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.340
you know, these, these, the gang thing. I, you know,

81
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.610
I could never get with it. I've never been a gang member.

82
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:27.240
So I don't know what these guys be thinking. I don't know what they,

83
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.620
what they be thinking, man,

84
00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:33.570
but I just don't see an upside to it. I just,

85
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.230
it has a terrible retirement plan.

86
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.210
<v 1>You know.</v>

87
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.700
<v 0>Most of the dunes, most of the dudes are killed before they're 30,</v>

88
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.260
or maybe they have a extensive criminal history.

89
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.683
Their,

90
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.980
their opportunities are severely limited because of the record.

91
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.980
People afraid to do business with them. You know, it's, it's just way too much.

92
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.640
And I just feel, I just figured, like, you know, well,

93
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.020
I'm just going to go ahead and avoid it. Plus I'm a black man in America.

94
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.580
It's all kind of ways to get killed in here.

95
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.140
It's all kind of ways to die already. Right? Okay. Besides like,

96
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.780
you know, like natural stuff, like natural death, diabetes,

97
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:25.490
cancer, lupus, uh, you know, obesity,

98
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.400
all these types of things, right. That can kill you stroke,

99
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.550
you got accidents. You know, I get hit by a car or something like that.

100
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.900
Uh, you got domestic disputes.

101
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.490
Why would I say, you know what?

102
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.980
I need one more month thing. The guy helped me rush.

103
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.620
I got to get that baby. I gotta get that. I'm going to join a gang.

104
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.920
I'm trying to eliminate the things that can,

105
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.450
that can kill me. I'm trying to avoid those types of things.

106
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.430
Why would I walk right in to something.

107
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.040
<v 2>Again, a lot of people do, like what, what, where did you get the wisdom? Like,</v>

108
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.300
you've the way you think right now, this have you always thought this way,

109
00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:19.450
where you plot ahead and look at things like you're playing 3d chess.

110
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.030
<v 0>I did to an extent, but I got a lot better at it in my twenties,</v>

111
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.640
like late twenties, I got really better.

112
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.840
And the reason why I say that is because the tricky part about it is that like,

113
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.340
there are dudes that are my age that tell me, man,

114
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.500
you was like a big brother to me. You know,

115
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:42.880
because I've been knowing them since we were like teenagers or

116
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.440
early twenties or whatever.

117
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.070
And I've always been just a few steps ahead and, and,

118
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.200
you know, seeing what was going on, you know, watching, you know, so,

119
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.490
but I still had some things that, that I had to learn, uh,

120
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:03.040
primarily conflict resolution, conflict resolution.

121
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.670
It should be taught in schools. I agree. Uh,

122
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.300
Americans have a big problem with conflict resolution.

123
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.250
It should be taught in schools.

124
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:14.980
Any of you politicians out there y'all want to work on a bill with me,

125
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:16.300
come on with it. I'm down.

126
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.250
Conflict resolution should be taught in schools because I remember being on

127
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.120
stage man.

128
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.810
And somebody would like heckle, like,

129
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.000
and it'd be like, Oh, it would be a dude,

130
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.870
always a dude heckled like, ah, man,

131
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.600
y'all dada talking crazy for no reason.

132
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.580
And I would jump off stage, knock them out,

133
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.690
get back on stage and finish the show. You know,

134
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:54.580
I would do stuff like that. I mean, once we were in Jackson,

135
00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:00.090
Mississippi, let me see, uh, statue limited.

136
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.440
Okay. I'm past. Yeah. Okay. We're in Jackson,

137
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:08.940
Mississippi and the promoter owes us our backend.

138
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.980
You know, they pay you the front end, you know, for signing the contract,

139
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.640
agreeing to do the show, then you show up, they pay you the rest

140
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.270
we get there. It's caused everywhere. It's caused lining the streets.

141
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.910
It's there all on the grass.

142
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.810
We noticed B and for all it is,

143
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:33.120
I don't care how many soda shows you do.

144
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.630
You love to see the people turn out and you go like, wow.

145
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.910
So this is one of those nights I manage our road manager.

146
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.970
Chief comes back to the limo and it's, you know, this was long ago.

147
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.350
Long time ago, people were still, we were still riding in limousine. So

148
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.570
I manager comes over. He say, he said, Hey man.

149
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:56.880
He said he ain't got all the money, promote it. Don't have all the money.

150
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.310
I said, what you mean? Ain't got all the money, man. All these people out here,

151
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.200
man. We like, man. Yeah. We,

152
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.350
I grabbed my cousin Dre and we go in there,

153
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.260
say, man, you going to come off that money?

154
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.563
Or

155
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.420
at first he chuckled

156
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.340
say, man, a Blick. He'll bring that money back here. And dah, dah, dah.

157
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.020
He gave us the money.

158
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.740
We came back to the limo, even careful with us, even

159
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.240
just the emotion, got the money.

160
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.840
We got the money and now everything is good.

161
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.000
Went on the stage and did the show and then left.

162
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.830
This is me like again, Cabo, Western days. Right?

163
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.540
Not really taking like, like it all kinds of things that could happen with that.

164
00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:03.920
And that situation. Sure.

165
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.620
Like going back on the stage, like, listen,

166
00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:12.770
just going back on the stage, backup, just

167
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.320
taking that money like that in the first place, you know, that's the case.

168
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.230
That could be a case. Okay. Then you go on stage.

169
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.890
You do a show this though we're in his hometown. He could be rallying.

170
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.930
We come out of this hole. I'm not thinking on that type of level. I'm like,

171
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.460
he violated you get this and that's it.

172
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.360
And it's whatever you want to get it for now. Oh, uh,

173
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.650
in that exact same situation, uh,

174
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.140
I would try to convince him to pay up.

175
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.850
Like he still wouldn't get away with it, but I would just do it differently.

176
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:56.010
Yeah. Hello? I get it. Yeah. Yeah.

177
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:01.120
I still, he would have to pay up. I mean, there's a long history of promoters.

178
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:05.500
Not paying people. They must pay. They must pay. They must pay.

179
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:10.390
Because what you don't want to do is you

180
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:11.950
don't want to have like,

181
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:16.780
be in a situation where people owe you money and

182
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.670
look, man, if it's an honest, day's work for an honest,

183
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:24.610
day's pay nothing more, nothing less.

184
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.390
