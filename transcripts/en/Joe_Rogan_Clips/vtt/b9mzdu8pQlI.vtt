00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.310
<v 3>Robert, can you explain some of the, um,</v>

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.330
what you ended up finding out was hidden from you?

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.290
What was the exculpatory evidence?

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.950
<v 1>Well, uh, they would've,</v>

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.230
they would've held that. Uh,

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.060
first of all, first of all, uh,

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.570
maybe I can explain that the crimes,

9
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:34.860
right there was a spree of crime that happened in the French quarters in new

10
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:36.510
Orleans. Um,

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.390
there was two at the three armed robberies, uh,

12
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.000
uh, raping the kidnapping and a murder was tied to that tweet.

13
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.980
They took all these crimes and said it was a part of a spree.

14
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.130
All right. They had a, um, a court that was involved, uh,

15
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.930
in the crime. And

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.850
they eventually over the period of,

17
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.230
well over the couple of weeks after the crime happened, maybe,

18
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.750
um, it found out who the car that was involved.

19
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.280
And during the time when they was doing the investigation,

20
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:23.580
my name came up as it it's an anonymous tip came in. Right.

21
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.990
So what we did there was they eventually arrested me

22
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.150
and connected me to the car that was actually

23
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:35.970
using in, in all these squeezes of crime,

24
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:40.170
including the murder, the robbery, the kidnappings,

25
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.820
and the rape. Uh, and

26
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.370
years later, uh, eventually find out that

27
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.280
another guy got arrested for the murder, uh,

28
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.830
and was connected. He, in his possession,

29
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.910
he had possessed it

30
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.700
jewelry and all that goes into evidence from each crime spree.

31
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.680
And.

32
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.420
<v 0>From each of the victims jewelry from the woman that was robbed,</v>

33
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:19.530
he had clothing from one of the other women. I think the woman that was raped.

34
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.650
Right. Um, and they never turned this over to him.

35
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.540
<v 1>Right. And so, yeah, they would've, they would've held that,</v>

36
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.920
um, from it, that was that. How did they connect you with the car?

37
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.510
This is what I'm about to explain. They connected me to car,

38
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.600
how they connected me with the car. Uh,

39
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.300
the prosecutor Derek was that like,

40
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:46.560
when they arrested this guy,

41
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.960
they got him to say that me and him was

42
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.810
friends. And he had,

43
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.650
he allowed me to use the car right at times,

44
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.510
uh, the commit the crime, but all the evidence suggested, uh,

45
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.213
differently.

46
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.510
And so at trial,

47
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.850
what they did was they charge,

48
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.570
he got convicted of the actual murder, right.

49
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.790
He got convicted of murder and they separated him from the other crimes and they

50
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.810
charged me with the other crimes. Right. But, um,

51
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.310
unbeknownst to me, uh, on the day of trial that I was,

52
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.953
uh, uh,

53
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.640
for the rape kidnapping in the armed robberies that,

54
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.393
uh,

55
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.350
he told the prosecutor that I had nothing to do with none of the crimes that he,

56
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.680
I never used the car, none of that. Right.

57
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.480
But when I went to trial, the prosecutor said something totally opposite.

58
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.990
They're prosecuting me on the theory. That means God was best friends.

59
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.050
You're allowing me to use. Did you know him? I didn't know him at all.

60
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.270
And I was seeing him a day in my life.

61
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.300
<v 0>And the S the short answer to your question, Joe,</v>

62
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:08.620
about what they had connecting him to the car, a driver's license,

63
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.530
you would think a driver's license, registration, insurance,

64
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:13.000
someone that had seen them in the car,

65
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.390
the answer is they had absolutely nothing. They had a word,

66
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:20.500
they had the word of a guy that had been accused and tied to these murders who

67
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:23.920
was looking to put it on someone else. How did he put it on you though?

68
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.930
He found out that there was a tip implicating him. Right?

69
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.740
<v 1>Right. Absolutely. And so.</v>

70
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.680
<v 2>He tried to be a snitch to get the heat off of him and put.</v>

71
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.730
<v 1>It on you. Absolutely.</v>

72
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.220
<v 2>And they let that happen.</v>

73
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.080
<v 1>Yup. Even though they knew. Right. And it goes deeper than that. Uh,</v>

74
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.290
so after I get convicted, uh,

75
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.210
I'm still charged with the, with the murder of the British tourist. Right.

76
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.550
I'm still, I'm still actually charged with it,

77
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.760
even though I haven't been going back and forth to court with it at this time

78
00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.920
after I get convicted.

79
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.000
And I knew I was going to get a life sentence for the rape, uh, the kidnapping,

80
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.400
the three armed robbers. Uh,

81
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.890
so the district attorney, uh,

82
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.000
made an offer to my defense attorney, uh,

83
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.040
and eventually bought to me on the deal. My citizen say that, okay,

84
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.230
uh, we could give him 25 years or 21 years for the murder.

85
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.010
You get him a manslaughter. Right. And

86
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.630
I don't know what type of stuff that happens out of my president,

87
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:37.480
between my attorney and district attorney, but I was scared as.

88
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.920
I just received a life sentence. Uh, I know I was about to,

89
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.810
you sent this to life for the rape and 25 or

90
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.680
whatever, maybe at 99 years for every on robbery. I don't know. I was scared.

91
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.500
So I took the 21 year pleat, but I never meditate anything.

92
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.843
Right.

93
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.620
And a part of that evidence was that the guy,

94
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.800
uh, who we were talking about, that,

95
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.040
that it was initially trying to involve me.

96
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.890
He was found guilty of the murder already. He was already.

97
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.080
<v 2>So they were trying you for a crime.</v>

98
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.780
They already had convicted someone for absolute.

99
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.640
<v 1>How is that possible? It happened.</v>

100
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.490
<v 0>Because what they were trying to say is that if two people are in a car and</v>

101
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:31.760
you're both out committing crimes, right, you're both responsible,

102
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:34.310
both responsible. There's something called the felony murder rule.

103
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.670
And the felony murder rule is that if you're in the commission of a crime and

104
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:42.440
somebody dies of you and I went and robbed the bank and I go

105
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:47.330
in and start, you know, shooting up with the tellers and kill two tellers,

106
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.340
you're responsible for the murder also.

107
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.870
So the theory of Robert's prosecution was that they were friends,

108
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:55.670
they were on this crime spree together.

109
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.960
And that even though he was convicted of the murder, um,

110
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.790
you know, he was still responsible and guilty of murder.

111
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.650
It's no different than the James daily case,

112
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:11.150
which I've talked about before they convicted one guy, Jack PRC.

113
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:15.740
And then they tried my client. After that one guy got sentenced to life.

114
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:17.270
One guy got sentenced to death.

115
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.240
<v 2>It's crazy that they don't have to have any evidence whatsoever that you even</v>

116
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:21.074
friends with that guy.

117
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.910
<v 1>Right, right. It had his.</v>

118
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.750
<v 0>Word. Right.</v>

119
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.110
<v 1>And, and the, the piece of evidence, another article evidence, there were hell,</v>

120
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.660
is a report that, uh,

121
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.790
that when he made a statement like the morning of my

122
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:42.710
trial, like I said, that I didn't have anything to do with the murder.

123
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:46.240
He never knew me and different things of that nature. Uh,

124
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.740
and they withheld that and it, and it would have held that.

125
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.350
And that was the only important to change the outcome of my trial because they

126
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:54.590
went,

127
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.920
they took me to trial on the theory that we were friends and that I knew him in

128
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:00.920
that I had connected to him through the car, but had,

129
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:04.700
I would've had that piece of information that interjected my trial.

130
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:07.580
I wasn't never, probably got found guilty to that extent.

131
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.510
And they also would have held various different, um, uh,

132
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.590
uh, statements and evidence as released to the witnesses that was very

133
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:20.720
inconsistent. And that was very favorable to me.

134
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.610
And that could have actually printed back to the, to the guy who was actually,

135
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.260
uh, uh, convicted of the murder, uh,

136
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.790
and attached to all those other spree of crimes. Um,

137
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.430
yeah, so it's, this was, uh, uh, a lot of stuff, man,

138
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:44.210
that they would have held that almost made it impossible,

139
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.370
um, for me to unravel and to, uh,

140
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.720
to obtain my freedom.

141
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.350
<v 0>That's uncommon too, but it's not. So in other words,</v>

142
00:08:55.351 --> 00:09:00.330
when prosecutors are working on one theory, full steam ahead, right?

143
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.160
And they then are met with,

144
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.170
you might be wrong. We might've been wrong all along the instinct.

145
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.150
99 times out of a hundred is to plow ahead and rationalize

146
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.650
why the true perpetrator in Robert's case,

147
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.870
why did he, all of a sudden say Robert had nothing to do with it? Oh,

148
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:25.470
well,

149
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:30.420
maybe he is making this up because he feels guilty that he implicated his

150
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:34.590
friend who really wasn't his friend I have in Clemente, a Gary's case,

151
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.790
which we've talked about,

152
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.660
and your listeners know about the true killer confessed.

153
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.640
She confessed over and over again to friends, to neighbors, drunk,

154
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.840
not drunk to police and denying him post-conviction relief.

155
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.950
Now this is a judge, the judge chalked it up as survivor's guilt.

156
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.660
So in other words, whether it's a prosecutors,

157
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:01.710
judges they'll make an excuse to protect the prosecution,

158
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:03.450
because it's all about winning or losing.

159
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.720
<v 2>W what is that? Is that human nature? Is it like,</v>

160
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.500
do people just want to confirm their initial suspicions?

161
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.960
And they rationalize all sorts of reasons why,

162
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.970
what they initially thought was right.

163
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:21.340
And this new evidence that shows that it's not right is wrong. Like what,

164
00:10:21.341 --> 00:10:24.780
what is it? Is it, they don't, they don't just don't want to be.

165
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.300
<v 0>They don't want to lose. I think it's a fundamental flaw, um,</v>

166
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.170
that we have as human beings that I share as a Taurus,

167
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.550
I specially share it.

168
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.170
<v 2>How dare you bring up astrology.</v>

169
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.930
<v 0>Um, but, but I I'm, I'm stubborn,</v>

170
00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:45.480
but I think as I see this time and time again, and,

171
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.400
and watching juries deliberate,

172
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.180
cause I do mock trials and focus groups or speaking to people post verdict,

173
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:55.060
but you can apply it to politics and to anything.

174
00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.150
I think of one fundamental flaw we have as mammals is

175
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:03.150
our inability to be flexible in our reasoning.

176
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.920
And I think that once we make a decision about something, it's very,

177
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:11.730
very difficult to get people to reconsider.

178
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.150
<v 2>I see that in really intelligent people too. And it's makes me sad.</v>

179
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.200
It's maddening. It's mad. It drives me crazy. Cause it's like you,

180
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:24.300
weren't part of the problem. I think with police, with prosecutors,

181
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:29.190
with the whole legal system is that it becomes a

182
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:32.070
game. And I don't mean a game. Like it's a joke. I mean,

183
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:34.260
a game like you're trying to win. Yes.

184
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.650
And whenever someone is involved in something where they're trying to win,

185
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.470
they do whatever the they can. People cheat, they move golf balls, right? They,

186
00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:44.670
they do whatever the they can. Don't look at Jamie.

187
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.370
<v 0>Whenever I hear people moving those [inaudible] here, golf.</v>

188
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.300
<v 2>Well, well people cheat, man. They,</v>

189
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:57.130
they find ways to pretend that they didn't do something when they did it.

190
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.040
They find ways to justify the things that they did.

191
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:04.480
Do they find ways to pass the buck and put it on if,

192
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.430
if they can score that w right. And you see cops do it. They,

193
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:14.110
they, they plant evidence on someone they think was probably guilty,

194
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.920
but they don't have enough evidence on them. They find rationalizations.

195
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.170
And it's because there's a game going on, it's a win or lose.

196
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.010
And it becomes a real problem. And not only that with a lot of cops,

197
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.090
there's quotas, like you literally have to arrest a certain amount of people.

198
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.170
Right. Which is insanity. Like, what the did they do? If no one commits a crime?

199
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.150
What do they do? If no one speeds.

200
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.140
If you have a quota where you have to arrest a hundred people for speeding,

201
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.440
what the do you do? If everybody makes an agreement, we all get on Facebook.

202
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:45.274
And we say, Hey,

203
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.900
let's everybody drive the speed limit for the next 60 days.

204
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.410
And let's crush the legal system because these cops have to,

205
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.560
they have to make a certain amount of pullovers.

206
00:12:56.561 --> 00:12:58.090
They have to pull a certain amount of people over, right.

207
00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:01.600
A certain amount of tickets. They have quotas. If you don't meet those quotas,

208
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.670
they get in trouble. So what the kind of.

209
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:09.400
<v 1>Right. I would say, uh, uh, a lot, a lot of that,</v>

210
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.850
a lot of just like we have structural racism, right.

211
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:18.270
And when I say squat, your race, I mean like institutional, uh, uh,

212
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:23.530
things that set up through, uh, regulation, rules and policies red line, right?

213
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.383
Uh,

214
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.700
and you just have like a flawless in a variety of different

215
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:32.980
systems. They got people that work for company.

216
00:13:32.981 --> 00:13:36.160
They got a lot of Florida's and they don't really,

217
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:41.350
they don't really understand that you're employed in a system that,

218
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.940
that, that treat people unfair cause people home and you can't even see it.

219
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.980
And some people can be a part of a system of part of a program or part of an

220
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.250
organization that, uh,

221
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.480
have that wind mentality, right. That when women,

222
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.940
by all costs mentality and

223
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.710
they lose their empathy for people. Right. And,

224
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.400
and when people lose their empathy, when, you know,

225
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.710
we did find those days and a lot of people don't like, uh,

226
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.540
they're here hearing this type of, but when you lose your empathy for people,

227
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.150
you become technical as social pack.
