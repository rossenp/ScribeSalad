1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.480
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I hate just hate it. I hate all of it. You know?</v>

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.960
I mean, I hate the fact that we get led into these things. That's the thing.

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.480
Yeah. That's this could happen that we,

4
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:16.120
people could lose brothers and sisters and friends and just.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.973
<v 1>All of it. I,</v>

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.670
the most disturbing thing I've ever seen there was this like a group of four

7
00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:23.590
pictures of this little kid. I remember his name,

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.190
Timmy and the it's like the first one he's like in his little

9
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.830
camouflage, like holding up a photo of his dad, then they made a, um,

10
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.990
like stuffed animal with his dad's face on it.

11
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.710
And then he's like holding up a sign. It's like, I love your dad.

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.180
Can't wait to see you soon. Like the dad was dead, like 20 know,

13
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.780
like show some support for little Timmy. I'm like, this is, oh,

14
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:48.460
there's one of him kissing the dad's gravestone. And I'm like, this is not good.

15
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.100
Like, yeah, we should support this kid.

16
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.020
But it would be a lot better if he wasn't in this position. It's heartbreaking.

17
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.740
And just seeing him cuddling with his dad's doll. Oh, it was,

18
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.450
it really messed with me something fierce. Oh, it's awful.

19
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.130
And we need less of that.

20
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.170
<v 0>We definitely need.</v>

21
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.170
<v 1>Less, more as, as little as PO as mean as little of that as possible.</v>

22
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.130
It's just heartbreaking to say. And he's just so cute and proud.

23
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.690
<v 0>Isn't it crazy though, that you,</v>

24
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.010
you really only can say as little as of that as we can,

25
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.000
you can't say we should have no war because no one thinks right.

26
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.960
<v 1>Humans are conflict and animals that kill each other.</v>

27
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.720
<v 0>But that's amazing. Yeah. That as much as we know,</v>

28
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.640
like our base of knowledge that we can extract information from

29
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.280
is so giant, our ability to communicate with each other is unprecedented.

30
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.750
We can translate things in real time. Sure.

31
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.830
And still we got mores inevitable.

32
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.670
<v 1>Yeah. Someone wants to take your stuff. And I don't, you know,</v>

33
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:54.190
someone else says, I don't want you taking my stuff. This has been, you know,

34
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.230
it's but it's gotten a lot better.

35
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.790
<v 0>Definitely gotten a lot better. A lot better, less.</v>

36
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:00.590
We get newed into the stone age, somewhere around March.

37
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.140
<v 1>Sure. Yeah. Just in time for the prime Marys. No, I mean, it used to be,</v>

38
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.540
it was considered appropriate that if you beat someone in a war,

39
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.220
you kill everyone. Yes. And now it's like, maybe we don't need to like,

40
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.100
literally kill everyone. They're like, oh, okay. Let's, let's try that.

41
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.000
<v 0>Maybe.</v>

42
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.500
Or maybe you kill this general and then they kill some of your guys and then you

43
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:24.410
kill a bunch of people and they kill a bunch of are people. And they say,

44
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.570
if you do that again, we're gonna NCU. And they say, go ahead, do it.

45
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.850
And then you do, and then Russia gets involved. Then China gets involved.

46
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.810
Then Los Angeles gets vaporized.

47
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.410
<v 1>So it has a happy ending. Oh.</v>

48
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.250
<v 0>Son of a. Well,</v>

49
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.090
you you'll be out here with a crazy suit on and there'd be no one here to listen

50
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.850
to us a crazy suit. What do you mean? Some sort of radiation suit.

51
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.680
<v 1>Oh, okay. Thank you of my clothes.</v>

52
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.760
&lt;laugh&gt; cuz I got an outfit ready for when I'm on Ruben.

53
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.440
<v 0>Yeah. You have a apocalypse suit, special tie.</v>

54
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.560
<v 1>Apocalypse, a convo character. Dark. Side's.</v>

55
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.880
<v 0>Got little atomic signs in it.</v>

56
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.320
<v 1>I look like a new wave, uh, singer.</v>

57
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.240
<v 0>Look. It's kind of amazing that we haven't nuked anybody since 1947. Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.080
That's amazing. In and of itself, right? Was it 45?

59
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.360
<v 1>It was 45. Japan. Yeah. 45.</v>

60
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.720
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. So we haven't nuked anybody since 45.</v>

61
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.640
<v 1>It's and no one else has either. That's what's important. That's amazing.</v>

62
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.880
Except for Russia, nuking themselves basically with your noble. Whoops. Yeah.

63
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.760
<v 0>And then North Korea didn't they do that. Didn't they experiment and the.</v>

64
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.150
<v 1>Mountains. Yes. And the mom kind of collapsed the mountain,</v>

65
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.150
but I don't think anyone died. So yeah. I mean, look, knock on wood.

66
00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:26.630
That that's all that happened is, is wood, you know? Yes it is. So I, I mean,

67
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.350
I'm very hopeful about, uh, uh, the future.

68
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.590
<v 0>Of this country in the world. How could they possibly iron things out with Iran?</v>

69
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.990
How could they possibly say they Iran? Hey, up. We.

70
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.140
<v 1>I don't think he thinks he up if Crenshaw has, if Crenshaw has his back,</v>

71
00:03:42.141 --> 00:03:45.540
you know, explaining this. I, I think he's not gonna backed on this.

72
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.700
Trump's not a backed.

73
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.533
<v 0>Anyway. Right.</v>

74
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.780
But do you think it's possible that they could somehow another work this out?

75
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.760
Yes.

76
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.220
<v 1>Really? Yeah. Because if,</v>

77
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.100
if cruise ch and JFK could work out the Cuban missile crisis.

78
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.250
<v 0>Right. But JFK never sent a drone to shoot down cruise CHS, no two guy.</v>

79
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.430
Sure.

80
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.130
<v 1>But at the same time, if you're like, look even in a sense,</v>

81
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.490
the sanctions and how we've kind of collapsed my understanding,

82
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.410
I'm not an expert. Iran's currency is also a huge deal. Right.

83
00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:14.450
And it has caused a lot of, you know, suffering there.

84
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.690
So they didn't do anything about that. True, good point at a certain point,

85
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.760
you know, if you just you're big enough,

86
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.200
the people just have to be like the there's nothing. Do.

87
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.120
<v 0>You think that's real though?</v>

88
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.880
I just feel like this one is so public and demands a response and I

89
00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:31.200
don't think they're not gonna respond.

90
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.200
<v 1>They could respond in some way. That's kind of like.</v>

91
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.640
<v 0>To say face now, how many? Right. Right.</v>

92
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.190
How many people do you think are in the Iranian

93
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.390
regime that want change?

94
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.590
And that realize that the Iranian regime and their support of certain aspects of

95
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.750
terrorism and the support of a lot of the stuff that they're claiming this guy

96
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.310
did, including the, the IEDs and this is all problematic.

97
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.830
Cause they brought this upon them by their acts and their deeds and that we

98
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.780
needed change the government. Like that's really what a sophisticated

99
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.900
intelligence society would want. They would,

100
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.900
they would wanna figure out how to infiltrate that thing, that organization.

101
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.540
And so seeds of doubt and like, let everybody know, Hey,

102
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:19.780
do you love your children? Because this guy just made a giant mistake. I can.

103
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.130
<v 1>All coming down. I can only look at it through the let of stuff.</v>

104
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.130
I actually I'm informed about, which is like North Korea and the Soviet union.

105
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.090
And what happens is these regimes, the people at the top, aren't there,

106
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.530
cuz they're smart or charismatic. They're there cuz they're loyal.

107
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.490
That's the first thing they test for.

108
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.370
And everyone's always looking after each other to kind of be like, look,

109
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:39.290
this guy's gone soft and they're getting rid of each other that way.

110
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:40.690
That's the power place going on over there.

111
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.800
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so if you have so one being like,

112
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.320
oh maybe we shouldn't do terrorism.

113
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.320
All of a sudden everyone's raising eyebrows and being like this,

114
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.000
cuz if you're gonna advocate for that,

115
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.760
everyone's gotta be on the same page cuz that's a big move to make. Right.

116
00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:56.080
Right. So if one guy's like guys, maybe this is evil. It's like, okay,

117
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.520
now you're making us look evil.

118
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.000
And I don't like having this voice in the meeting. So it,

119
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.920
I think it's gonna be very hard to have some, but the thing is about this,

120
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.400
this strike because it was so precise.

121
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.520
I'm sure they're scared also that he would have no problem killing them

122
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:14.880
individually. That's the real fear. So it's like, oh, if I escalate this,

123
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.350
he might be coming for me person next. Or the people,

124
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.590
if there's a, you know, a revolt,

125
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.630
it could be like Kadafi and you're being raped to death by like a broomstick.

126
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.450
Mm.

127
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.283
<v 0>And they don't want that either.</v>

128
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.243
<v 1>It was a bayonet.</v>

129
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.233
<v 0>Sorry. Okay.</v>

130
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.270
<v 1>I think it's a little rougher than that's even worse. Okay. Wow. Yeah. Jesus.</v>

131
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.270
Remember that picture? No, I didn't wanna.

132
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.470
<v 0>Look at it. He's standing there in shock. The guy stabbing him in the with a,</v>

133
00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:38.260
with a knife. Oh my God. Yeah.

134
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.260
But you said that that guy's gonna be the Mount EIMA guy of the future.

135
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.980
You know where the Mount EIMA guy flag is gonna be a guy just ramming

136
00:06:46.981 --> 00:06:49.420
it right up Coff's. It's probably in a mosque somewhere.

137
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.180
<v 1>So yeah, very quickly. You're gonna be wondering in my next,</v>

138
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.020
and then you also wonder, do I wonder be a martyr and like go out heroically.

139
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.930
<v 0>You're making all good points.</v>

140
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.890
But what I'm worried about is some sort of an attack on,

141
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.850
on some sort of a public place. It'll like a.

142
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.170
<v 1>Disneyland. It'll be a lot easier for them to right.</v>

143
00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:11.370
Or Disney or hitting Israel. Yeah. You know? So they like, look, we hate them,

144
00:07:11.371 --> 00:07:16.090
blah, blah, blah, or Iraq somewhere. Right. So who knows what I mean,

145
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:19.440
what they did with the Iraq war with when it was Bush and Tony Blair,

146
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.640
they bombed the train station in Spain and Spain couldn't get out of the war

147
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:24.180
Fest enough.

148
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.160
So it could be that they're going after one of her allies to separate us,

149
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.880
you know, that might be a smart move to do. You.

150
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.760
<v 0>Go for weird.</v>

151
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.920
<v 1>Jazz game. There's so many spots to hit. You know what I mean?</v>

152
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:37.440
There's no way you can really, uh, it's like a shell game.

153
00:07:37.441 --> 00:07:38.480
There's only so many shells.

154
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.750
<v 0>Jesus Christ. Yeah. This doesn't make you nervous at all. No,</v>

155
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.990
but you're a psychopath. Right?

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.910

they, and, and Iran and they're like, this is how it's gonna be.

we're at a point where we can escalate to a world war three.
