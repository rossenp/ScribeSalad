00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.721
<v 2>The, the pig thing.</v>

3
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:06.660
I'm glad you brought that up because that is one thing that I keep hearing out

4
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:08.100
here from folks that, uh,

5
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.460
there's an attitude about pigs that they're disgusting.

6
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.590
They're just dirty creatures and they kind of just want them dead. And,

7
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:20.700
uh, I've talked to people that go helicopter hunting, and I go, well,

8
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:22.920
what do you do with all the pigs? And they're like, you'll leave him there.

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.400
And I'm like, what? Yeah. I'm like, that doesn't seem,

10
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.600
that seems not just wasteful, but well.

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.270
<v 1>You know, I mean, there's a lot to that you.</v>

12
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.130
<v 0>Have ask, right. Because of the,</v>

13
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.680
sort of have to eradicate a certain amount of those pigs, but yeah,

14
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.010
isn't there like a lot of food that you're, doesn't Latin rot there is.

15
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.500
<v 1>So, I mean, you've, this is the, this is the Pandora's box topic for me. Um,</v>

16
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.030
um, I'm very vested in it. I just wrote a book about feral hogs. Um,

17
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.130
Steve Vernella to, to come full circle on that. He called me the hog apologist.

18
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.440
Um, and it's true, but to, to your point, I think that, you know, we'll start,

19
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.730
we'll start there with, uh.

20
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.630
<v 0>So to explain the numbers to people need to know how crazy it is here in Texas.</v>

21
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.790
<v 1>And, and, and of course these numbers are not going to be clearly defined,</v>

22
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.450
you know, that it's hard to get a census on hogs. So the estimate, uh,

23
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.940
in the United States is around 6 million.

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.110
The estimate here in Texas is between two and 4 million.

25
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.190
So probably somewhere in the middle of that, maybe 2.6,

26
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:33.060
that's a number that you'll see a lot, um, maybe around 3 million, but whatever.

27
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.650
<v 0>More than the entire population of Austin. Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.130
<v 1>Hogs spread out around, around the state.</v>

29
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.730
And in the time we've been talking about, um, you know, how many

30
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.590
Points, so they have no breeding season,

31
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.190
they can breed at a very young age. Um, you know,

32
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:57.840
let's say five or six months is very conceivable.

33
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.250
Um, and then they have a gestation period of three months, three weeks,

34
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:04.890
three days, and then they can drop a litter of.

35
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.020
<v 0>Noise three days. So you can just.</v>

36
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.200
<v 1>Plan it out. Yeah. I mean, that's pretty, pretty precise like that.</v>

37
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.060
<v 0>That women are very jealous. Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.090
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I'll be giving birth on Wednesday. Yeah. At a time.</v>

40
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.750
<v 1>Den. And after that, I mean, they're, they,</v>

41
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:22.170
they're able to go back into estrus pretty quickly after that.

42
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.280
And their litter size can be anywhere from two to 12, but, you know,

43
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:29.670
let's just say it's, you know, say even six is a lot. So you've got, uh,

44
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.510
you've got, uh,

45
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.280
a 10 month old animal dropping six babies.

46
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.950
<v 0>And they can do it three times a year. Well.</v>

47
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.100
<v 1>Twice, you know, that all the way that works out, you know, you've got,</v>

48
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:45.000
I think it's 20 S I want to say 26 days that they can go back into estrus.

49
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.180
Something like that. It might be 23 days. I can't remember the number right now,

50
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.900
um, after they give birth and they're back in asterisks. And if,

51
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:54.960
if they're living in an area, that's got a high population of bores,

52
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.030
they're probably going to get bred pretty quick.

53
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.070
And so that's when you see this explosion that has happened.

54
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.010
And so they're not indigenous to this country.

55
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:07.090
So they came here in the mid 15 hundreds. Um, uh,

56
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.380
Columbus brought some too, I mean, just to the Caribbean islands.

57
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.600
Uh, but the mainland was,

58
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.670
it's usually attributed to Hernando de Soto who dropped off a bunch of pigs on

59
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:22.870
his way before he died in Arkansas. Um, and then there was some other,

60
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.730
uh, explorers that also brought in pigs, um, Spanish explorers that brought in,

61
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.240
you know, domestic semi domestic hogs and dropped them off.

62
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:35.410
And so what we saw was this real slow build and pig populations.

63
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.610
There was also some Pacific Islanders that dropped them off in Hawaii way before

64
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:42.730
that. So if you're talking about the tactical United States,

65
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.740
did they drop them off in Hawaii as a.

66
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.690
<v 0>Food source? No.</v>

67
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.880
<v 1>No. When, when, oh, oh, it was, it was, uh,</v>

68
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.290
I couldn't give you a number it's it's way previous to the 15 hundreds. Wow.

69
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.710
<v 0>That's wild. So that's a weird debate in Hawaii, right.</v>

70
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:59.800
Because a lot of people are saying they're an invasive species and then some

71
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:03.760
folks like, well, so were people sure. Because if you think about it,

72
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:05.920
the hogs have been there as long as the people almost.

73
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.160
<v 1>There's going to be a lot of parallels. Yeah. Yeah. There's a, uh, a very, uh,</v>

74
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.680
destructive European animal arrives on our shores.

75
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.040
Uh, yeah. And, and now there's a lot of them. Uh, so,

76
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.330
you know, you've got these populations exploding, um,

77
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.850
throughout time, but really kind of concentrated in the late 19 hundreds,

78
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.780
you know, like the eighties. And then you saw people, uh, you know,

79
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.260
you've got a guy that loves to hunt on his ranch in west Texas.

80
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:41.920
And he says to his friend in east Texas, he's like, sure as hell,

81
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.950
I'd liked to be able to shoot something out here. You're around buddy.

82
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:49.270
And he's Texas. I was like, wow, man, I got some pigs. And then,

83
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.690
you know, traps a couple throws them on a trailer.

84
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.940
And now you have 253 out of 254 counties in Texas have hogs,

85
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.983
feral hogs.

86
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.570
<v 0>Wow. And they're spreading all across the country too.</v>

87
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.380
<v 1>Right? Yeah. There there's a downward migration from Saskatchewan, you know,</v>

88
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.050
and those are escaped domestic Hawks, but I mean,

89
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:11.140
let's also define what a feral hog is. It's a, it's a pig.

90
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.680
It's just on the wrong side of a fence. I mean, once they get out,

91
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.610
that's a feral pig. So I like to say it's a,

92
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.170
it's a domestic pig or a feral hog is just a pig without an address. You know,

93
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.620
they just, as soon as they get out of that pen, they're feral.

94
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.470
And I will readily admit, I mean, not even on purpose,

95
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:34.390
but we have shot while hunting pigs that had ear tags, you know,

96
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.470
meaning that at one point that was a farm pig. It's not anymore.

97
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.610
And what it's doing is it's breeding like crazy out there with,

98
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.140
with a feral bore. And it's just creating more feral pigs. So like I said,

99
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.360
once they're on the wrong side of the fence, they're fair game. Well,

100
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:49.600
we should have.

101
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.270
<v 0>Explain to people what happens to pigs. Right? Um,</v>

102
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.210
I've talked about it on the podcast before where people haven't heard that

103
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:59.240
episode. There's a physiological that happens to pigs when they get wild.

104
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:02.900
So when you're saying that this, these are pigs, they're wild pigs.

105
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:05.510
People like wait, but their bores boards are different than pigs.

106
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.210
Not that it's all called [inaudible] right?

107
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.450
<v 1>Correct. Correct. And once they escape within months, the,</v>

108
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.030
their hair can become shaggier. And we're talking about the same pig,

109
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.260
not it's offspring,

110
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.630
their hair can become shaggier and their snouts will elongate in order to allow

111
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:23.810
them to route more effectively because that's one of their primary ways of

112
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.780
feeding is rooting. And that's the most destructive way. I mean,

113
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:31.460
they can dig three feet down in soft dirt and they're getting routes to getting

114
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:36.110
insects there they're omnivores and they they'll go after anything.

115
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.730
And, and so once they get out, they go feral quick, they get,

116
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.790
and they get street-smarts too. I mean, they go nocturnal. I mean, they're,

117
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:48.490
they're smart, smart animals. And so you add all this together, you know, the,

118
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.324
the,

119
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.480
the herds that were initially brought here for food and then further domestic

120
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:57.530
herds, and then you have escapees over hundreds of years of, of,

121
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.360
you know, settling in this country and you've got escape, domestic cogs.

122
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.210
Then you've got hogs specifically brought in for hunting,

123
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.010
namely your Russian boars, your Eurasian bores, um, which are kind of the big,

124
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.540
hairy Razorbacks and how.

125
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.360
<v 0>Much different are those, is it all, it's still the same species.</v>

126
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.880
<v 1>Yes, it is. And they're, I mean, they're, they're, it's like,</v>

127
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.110
I believe and you know, not, I don't want to stand by it,

128
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:22.520
but I believe it's just like a subspecies,

129
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.250
there's one more Latin name after [inaudible], uh,

130
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.250
 for the Eurasian, but freely interbreeding, it's not like, I mean, they're not hybrids where they're not 

131
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.083
really.

132
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.420
<v 0>They make hybrid. Right. But the hybrids are viable. Absolutely. Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.450
So it's not like a hybrid, like a liker where they can't remember.

134
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.830
<v 1>No, no, no, no, no, nothing like that. Uh, and so then you've got some,</v>

135
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.040
some kind of specific areas.

136
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:49.400
California had a lot of Russian boars brought in and there's certain areas in

137
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:53.630
Texas. Um, the powder horn ranch down there, port O'Connor was one that, uh,

138
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.650
had brought some brought in specifically and deposited there. Yeah.

139
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.450
<v 0>Is the difference in the flavor or the way they look or the flesh.</v>

140
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.910
<v 1>It would be really hard to determine that now,</v>

141
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:09.830
because most of them over the years have interbred with your standard feral

142
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:13.250
pig and so pure bread. Um,

143
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:18.140
populations of those hogs are very hard to find it's debatable.

144
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:23.090
Whether the powder horn ranch population is purebred, Russian boar, I've read,

145
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.190
I've read different things about it. Some say that,

146
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.710
that it's not some say that it is, it's a high fence.

147
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.120
It's got a high fence around it and has had one since the 1920s, I believe.

148
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.660
<v 0>Oh, wow. Yeah. And so whenever they brought in the boars,</v>

149
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:37.880
those are the same breeding population.

150
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.200
<v 1>Right. They think, but you know, you know, offense doesn't mean to a pig.</v>

151
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:43.760
You know, I go under it, you know,

152
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.960
any way around it that they can flood waters come up, they can swim, you know,

153
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.180
it's so it's, it's not known,

154
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:54.770
but there is one sequestered population of feral hogs in the United States and

155
00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:57.390
that's Ossabaw island off the coast of Georgia.

156
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.550
And so that was an Iberia cohort, uh, brought over here by the Spanish,

157
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.380
you know, pointy hats, long brown robes. They dropped some hogs on that island.

158
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.370
And that island has sustained a population of pure bred [inaudible]

159
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.170
hogs to this day. And it's called Osama island.

160
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:19.560
And they have an OSA bow island hog, which is a pure bred Miraco hog,

161
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:24.360
which is the same hog that produces the 150, $150 a pound,

162
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.070
uh, Serrano ham.
