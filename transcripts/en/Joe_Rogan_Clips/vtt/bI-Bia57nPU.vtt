00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.230
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. When you eat the Wolf, what do you eat?</v>

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.210
The backstraps do you, do you cook the hams? Like how do you, how do you eat?

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.980
<v 1>The only way that I like to eat a Wolf is a boil it for a good long time.</v>

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.010
Cause wolves too will have parasites. They'll have trick analysis, you know,

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.660
they're meat eaters, Anthony eats meat.

6
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:23.010
You want to make sure it's thoroughly cooked. I like to boil it. Boiled Wolf.

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.160
Yeah. I haven't eaten a lot of Wolf. I've eaten Wolf, you know,

8
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.130
three or four times when I didn't have much else. And I figured, Hey,

9
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.460
I better take advantage of this food I got here rather than give it to something

10
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:33.360
else to eat. You feed it.

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.400
<v 0>To your family. Um.</v>

12
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.020
<v 1>They've probably Wolf like my kids when they a little, maybe once or something.</v>

13
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.810
<v 0>And I can't, it's hilarious. How many people could you ask that too?</v>

14
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:45.000
And they go, yeah, my kids probably Wolf.

15
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.980
<v 1>I don't know. Like I met these Mongolians once and they were like, oh,</v>

16
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.800
you shoot some malls. We want Wolf meat. We love Wolf meat. You know,

17
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.450
Mongolians they're all into it. Yeah.

18
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.520
<v 0>A lot of native Americans were into Wolf meat.</v>

19
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.670
I don't like it's a trappers were into Wolf meat. Well,

20
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:02.940
that's what they had to eat. But yeah, but some of them actually preferred it.

21
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.730
Really? Yeah. There was something from the Lewis Clark exhibition.

22
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.230
It does another thing that, um, expedition, that was something from, um,

23
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.140
Rinella was telling me about some guys actually preferred Wolf meat.

24
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.580
It was like their favorite, favorite.

25
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.370
<v 1>Domestic dog Lewis and Clark expedition.</v>

26
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:19.800
They would buy dogs from the Indians and eat them because they didn't want to

27
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:24.420
eat salmon. They had, they had fish is what I heard. They could have eaten,

28
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:28.530
but they'd rather eat dog. Cause they want to red meat. Oh Jesus. Yeah.

29
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.190
Wow. When they got way out like the Columbia river area.

30
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.690
<v 0>So did you eat these wolves that you shot?</v>

31
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.100
<v 1>I a little bit of it. Cause I was short on food that at that time, that winter,</v>

32
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.040
you know, not like the whole thing, but a few meals of it.

33
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.120
<v 0>Boil it. And w how do you do it? Like onions, potatoes make a soup.</v>

34
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.200
I didn't have anything like that.

35
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.000
<v 1>Uh, no. I mean, no I'm out there all winter long. That that was 2012,</v>

36
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.990
2013. There was a, I didn't have any vegetables.

37
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.540
Do you know where I get the vegetables out of the caribou stomach?

38
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.160
What the caribou eats for plant food.

39
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:04.590
That's what I get for plant food in the winter. That's the only, so you.

40
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.830
<v 0>Would actually eat their stomach contents. Yeah, really sure.</v>

41
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.720
<v 1>People done it for thousands of years.</v>

42
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.370
<v 0>I believe you. I believe.</v>

43
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.470
<v 1>They have. Not only that, but I pickle meat in it.</v>

44
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:16.920
I'd take a tender lines off of caribou are great pickled in their stomach

45
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:17.754
contents.

46
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.710
<v 0>Pickled stomach contents. Explain that to me. How do you do that while you.</v>

47
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.660
<v 1>You got to learn about caribou stomach,</v>

48
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:28.740
cause you don't want to go too far downstream. It starts turning brownish,

49
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.810
but like the first,

50
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.390
th the big chamber of the rumen when they eat these lichens in

51
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:37.590
the winter, that's what they're feeding on.

52
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.360
You can't eat those lichens off the ground. They're harsh.

53
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.510
But when it's partially digested in a caribou stomach,

54
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.950
it actually isn't edible food in the old people used to eat these lot.

55
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:52.770
I read about it. And I even talked to some people who had done it, you know,

56
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:57.450
when they were kids and stuff and sure enough, it's not bad stuff.

57
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.210
I got hooked on it, man. One winter, I eating a lot of caribou stomach contents.

58
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.520
And, uh, yeah, my family wasn't into that. They,

59
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:06.670
they were like looking at me like, and I was like, Aw, man, it's like salad.

60
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:11.080
This stuff's good. I don't eat much of that anymore. Basically.

61
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:13.270
I went as primitive as I could go.

62
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.490
And I satisfied my curiosity about living that extreme of a

63
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:19.720
subsistence lifestyle.

64
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.920
So now I eat much more store-bought vegetables.

65
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:26.830
I eat normal foods. Um,

66
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.770
but for a time there for a few years,

67
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.270
I got down to where I was eating caribou stomach contents. I was doing anything.

68
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.650
I just wanted to

69
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.440
just immerse myself in that whole environment out there.

70
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.210
I wanted to get my food right there. What I could see, what I could get myself,

71
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.460
just get right into it, you know, 15 months without even going out to town,

72
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.140
not talking to other people. I mean, that time I had my wife there,

73
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.363
but, um,

74
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.690
just to really get into a different state of consciousness,

75
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.420
it puts you in a different state of consciousness. And it's a beautiful thing.

76
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.770
<v 0>You said, pickled stomach contents. Yeah. How do you,</v>

77
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:12.100
how are you pickling a Tenderloin in the stomach contents.

78
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.990
<v 1>Take the caribou. You get to the right chamber of the stomach.</v>

79
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.840
They got four chambers on their stomach, you know, um,

80
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.060
you just cut a little slit in it just after you've pulled the guts out and you

81
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.750
just slipped the meat in there and you slip it right into the room and in the

82
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:29.620
contents there.

83
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.630
And what happens is assuming the temperature's about right? And it,

84
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.840
it will retain a lot of heat. It creates heat. I think the, the,

85
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.050
the micro

86
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.450
organisms in there create heat because if you just bury that in snow and snow,

87
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.200
of course, insulates, it it'll stay warm for quite a while. And, um,

88
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.930
if it was really cold, it might not work out.

89
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:55.960
It might freeze solid before it pickled. But if it's the right temperature,

90
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.800
the meatal turned brownish color over time and it'll be pickled.

91
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.330
All people used to do this all time. I read about this, you know, 20 years ago.

92
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:09.190
And then I talked to people and I said, yeah, this is safe to do so I tried it.

93
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:09.710
And,

94
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.310
and there was a winner there where that's where I got a lot of my vegetables was

95
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:16.450
out of the caribou stomach. Um, and the meat will just, it'll,

96
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.230
it'll turn brownish first on the outer part of the meat and then all the way

97
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:23.770
through it. And it gets pickled. I've done a lot of different things with me.

98
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:25.630
You know what I like to do with me? A lot of people don't realize,

99
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.340
cause you live in the modern world and just like me when I grew up. Right.

100
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.630
Um, meat's dangerous. If it's raw, you gotta be careful.

101
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:39.040
You gotta like wash everything. Be careful. Actually what I found is that, um,

102
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.260
it, it just all depends on the conditions.

103
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.210
Once you learn how to handle meat properly,

104
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:45.760
you can do a lot of things with meat that most people would be scared to death

105
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:49.270
of. Um, and it's completely safe. As far as I'm concerned.

106
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:53.170
I never had any problems with it. But, um, like moisture is very important.

107
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:55.990
If you buy meat in a storage wrapped in plastic, that keeps it moist.

108
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:56.950
You let it sit around for a while.

109
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.780
It spoils and it doesn't take long leave meat out of your refrigerator to be

110
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:00.770
spoiled in a day. Right.

111
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.930
But if you take a muscle out of an animal and you

112
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.820
butcher it properly, you separate the muscle. As one piece,

113
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.240
you don't make a bunch of cuts in the fascia.

114
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.760
You can take a muscle that's two or three inches thick. Don't put it in plastic.

115
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:23.060
Don't wrap it up. That'll cause it to spoil you, leave it right out in the air.

116
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.220
Two or three inch thick muscle. I set them on a rack, a pie above my woodstove.

117
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.510
It's like a hundred degrees up there.

118
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:33.530
Sometimes other times it's cold up there just varies during the day,

119
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:37.160
depending on how the fires stoked. Right. I'll let it sit there for a week,

120
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:42.080
10 days and then I'll eat it. Never cook it. Just let it sit there. Really?

121
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.670
<v 0>Yeah. Never cook it.</v>

122
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.980
<v 1>No, just let it sit there.</v>

123
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.410
<v 0>So he gets a crust on the outside.</v>

124
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.250
<v 1>It gets across on the outside, but it's too thick of a piece to dry.</v>

125
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:55.580
Like you would dry jerky or something, right. It stays moist inside.

126
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.210
It's like making cheese on. It turns into something like cheese.

127
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:00.440
It gets different flavors.

128
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.030
<v 0>You're aging. It.</v>

129
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.830
<v 1>Yeah. You're aging. It's actually fermentation. That's taken place. Uh,</v>

130
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.230
I believe it's actually a fermentation process,

131
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.680
but it takes on different flavors. I really like, I call it gummy meat.

132
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.120
Cause that's what my kids used to call it. And, um, gummy, gummy.

133
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.840
Cause it gets kind of gummy. Oh No, that's good.

134
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:23.870
It's good. It really is. I wish I had some, I,

135
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.630
I was saying when I left the Alaska, which adds some,

136
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.510
something like that to bring Joe down, but I didn't have anything.

137
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.930
<v 0>So when your what's going on.</v>

138
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.580
<v 2>Looking for something about the care,</v>

139
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.670
but stomach and there's this thing called the polar manual made by the

140
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.380
government. You got to take the Navy.

141
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.270
He says the Cara back fat is better than chewing gum and things made been

142
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.160
1961. So it might maybe even older.

143
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.210
<v 0>Okay. This old timers from the north mentioned many interesting Eskimo,</v>

144
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.020
Indian and Siberian foods. Pemmican. I've heard of that. It's a,

145
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:55.250
the meat of bear seal,

146
00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:59.930
caribou and walrus mixed together with fish eggs and dried into a hard

147
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:01.190
frozen block.

148
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.350
Trappers peaches and cream is chewing dried beaver

149
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.950
tail caribou back fat is better than chewing gum.

150
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.900
Don't overlook the contents of a seal stomach for a fresh fried fish

151
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.430
dinner nor the contents of a caribou stomach mixed with the trip

152
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:22.520
lining as a tasty in quotes,

153
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.880
salad of reindeer Moss and lichens

154
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.330
properly. How's that word? Acidulated.

155
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.930
<v 1>Yeah, I like the next one there. Walrus melted death gives 16 courts and milk.</v>

156
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.980
I love dairy products. I, you know, you can't get them up to.

157
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.990
<v 0>10 Quarts of milk from a wars.</v>

158
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.520
<v 1>I, one time I was thinking about milking a caribou after I killed her, but I, I,</v>

159
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.280
I didn't just because she was in bad shape.

160
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.940
She had been attacked by the wools and she had an infection in her leg and I was

161
00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:55.270
afraid that somehow I might get sick, but I,

162
00:08:55.271 --> 00:08:59.310
I just remember this lactating caribou that I'd killed. And I was thinking,

163
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.980
I never heard of people doing that, but you know,

164
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.980
milking an animal after died until you just read that. But walrus.

165
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.960
<v 0>You were worried you would have taken the milk,</v>

166
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.360
but except for the fact that she had been infected.

167
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.400
<v 1>She was the one that only had two good legs and her back leg going right up</v>

168
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:17.370
there towards her utter. Oh, it was in terrible shape. It was,

169
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.350
it was full of pus. And.

170
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.160
<v 0>I encountered that with an elk shot.</v>

171
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:30.930
Once he had been stabbed by another elk in his, in his,

172
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.250
one of his back legs. And it was just all filled with POS, like when we were,

173
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.620
uh, quartering them and taking it apart,

174
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.730
there was this one section that was just all POS. It was nasty.

175
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.000
<v 1>I've seen the same thing in a moose stabbed in the back,</v>

176
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.440
like in the haunch there by one of the times. So when.

177
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.710
<v 0>When you boiled the, the Wolf, how you eating that.</v>

178
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.410
<v 1>Uh, just.</v>

179
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.120
<v 0>Playing, just playing, just chopping.</v>

180
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.370
<v 1>You can fry it after you boil it, give it a little extra flavor.</v>

181
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.810
So what you do or if you guys can just.

182
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.340
<v 0>Yeah. Was that what you were doing or were you just eating it boiled both?</v>

183
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.600
What is it like? Is there something you could taste.

184
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.350
<v 1>Wolfie Wolfie to Wolf meters, right?</v>

185
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.380
<v 0>It's a desperation food, right? Is that how you'd.</v>

186
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.680
<v 1>Look at it if I didn't have something else or the Wolf, but yeah. You know,</v>

187
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.580
I've got other things, um, there's all kinds of stuff you can do with food.

188
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.560
You can, uh, you know, you can get as primitive as you want.

189
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.790
<v 0>Yeah. I can.</v>

190
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.650
<v 1>Imagine, but there's so much else going on. Like for me now, um,</v>

191
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.790
if, if you want to live that primitively off the land,

192
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:44.670
that's all you do. It takes all your time.

193
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.870
If you want to share that life with other people,

194
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:53.610
like what I've been trying to do the last six years, you can't just do that.

195
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.030
<v 0>Yeah. Because you don't really have the amount of time to hunt and gather.</v>

196
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.330
<v 1>Um, I wouldn't even have the ability to communicate. Right.</v>

197
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.970
I won't even be able to arrange to be on your show.

198
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.020
If I was out there living the way I was living, you know, 6, 7, 8 years ago.

199
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.440
Right.
