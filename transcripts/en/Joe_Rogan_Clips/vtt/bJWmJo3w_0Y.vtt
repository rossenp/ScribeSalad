00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.320
<v 1>The hormone augmentation thing is always a little bit of a complicated</v>

3
00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:06.200
discussion. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

4
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.320
but there's so much that's happening there right now. That's really interesting.

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.640
Like what? Well, for instance, um, sort of back to the topic of supplements,

6
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:16.600
I always say, look there behaviors are the fundamental layer.

7
00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:21.230
You have to do the right things for anything, for sleep, for learning, uh,

8
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:24.150
sports performance, but then there's nutrition, supplementation,

9
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.710
prescription drugs, and then off label stuff. Right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.430
And so we always think about when you hear hormones in sports,

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.670
you always think just the raw conversation about anabolics all the band stuff.

12
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.830
We could talk about that stuff and how it works years ago,

13
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:40.470
I used to work on androgens just AONE and it's derivatives and how it impacts

14
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:44.420
brain develop and body function, fear, and, and also mental states.

15
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.660
But there's a category of supplements that are very interesting,

16
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.980
that for most people who aren't exploring testosterone augmentation for sport

17
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.860
work very well to increase testosterone by about a hundred to 200 points,

18
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.220
not, you know, 300, you know, not a tripling or anything like that.

19
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.290
And the main ones are two substances. One is called tongue, got Ali. Oh yeah.

20
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.530
Which is that? Stuff's real, huh? Yeah. Oh yeah, because the,

21
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:09.290
what happens is the testosterone molecule,

22
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.170
it it's basically carried in a cargo, so it can be in its free form,

23
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:16.610
Unbound form, free testosterone. And everyone says, oh,

24
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:19.530
I want more free testosterone. You want more? But the,

25
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:21.930
these what are called sex hormone binding globulin.

26
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.920
So there's something called sex, hormone, bonding, globulin, and albumin.

27
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.800
They carry the testosterone molecule to the different tissues of the body.

28
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.320
So you don't want all your testosterone free.

29
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.120
You want some of it bound up so that it can be delivered to the different

30
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:38.720
tissues, including your brain. But if you have too much sex, hormone bonding,

31
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:42.440
globulin, the testosterone can't really do its things. Oh,

32
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.950
so Toga Ali about 400 milligrams per day has the effect of raising

33
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.470
free testosterone and overall testosterone by about a hundred to 200 points.

34
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.430
And so we're not talking about full T RT or blasting,

35
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.430
or now that I I'm always amused on YouTube, they now call it sports T RT.

36
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:03.580
That's when you get above 200 milligrams per week sports, this basically,

37
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:07.500
you know, you've got T RT, which is typically about 200 milligrams per week.

38
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.620
<v 2>And when you say 200 milligrams, when you're looking at a syringe, what is that?</v>

39
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.020
So thatty, is that a thousand milligrams?

40
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.820
<v 1>So the typical dose of, of, uh, testosterone replacement therapy,</v>

41
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.820
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is 200 milligrams given once every week to two weeks. But.

42
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.690
<v 2>When you look at a full syringe, what is that? So.</v>

43
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.010
<v 1>For one CC, one mill, right? That's 200 milligrams typically of C eight,</v>

44
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:29.630
which is sold in.

45
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.490
<v 2>One CC, a full CC is.</v>

46
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.410
<v 1>Only two that's one. CC is not gonna be that much. It's a, yeah.</v>

47
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:35.930
So it depends if you have a little narrow syringe.

48
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.050
<v 2>Okay. Right, right. But if you have a syringe that goes up to 10, what is.</v>

49
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.730
<v 1>That's? That's 10 CCS. That's a lot, lot. That's 10 CCS. Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:44.960
That's a thousand oh milligrams. That.

51
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.680
<v 2>Makes sense. Right. So it would be two on that. And.</v>

52
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.560
<v 1>That's 200 milligrams. That's right. So, well, as long as we're going, you.</v>

53
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.430
<v 2>Were saying like two.</v>

54
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.920
<v 1>Full syringes. Yeah. I mean,</v>

55
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.560
I actually think that a lot of people who think they need T RT,

56
00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:58.800
when I hear about guys in their twenties and thirties, it,

57
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.120
it look I'm in my mid forties. And I,

58
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.760
I can tell you that you can get and maintain very healthy testosterone levels

59
00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:08.800
without TT. If you do the right things, the behaviors, the nutrition,

60
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.960
all the other stuff early on there's,

61
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:13.080
sometimes people are of hypogonadal syndromes and things like.

62
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.200
<v 2>That. There's a lot of issues with guys that head injuries.</v>

63
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.440
<v 1>And with head injuries and AB absolutely. And we, it be a,</v>

64
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.510
an interesting conversation to talk about the role of testosterone in,

65
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.190
in neural repair. It's very interesting.

66
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.550
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but when you look at T RT, I mean,

67
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.590
the way that the clinics and the doctors typically do it is to give 200

68
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.670
milligrams and then send people out for two weeks and then they come back cuz

69
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:37.830
they can charge them to come back repeatedly. It's clear that on a,

70
00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:42.060
without any T RT testes normally make anywhere from seven to 15 milligrams of

71
00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:43.140
testosterone per day.

72
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.420
So taking this massive dose and then waiting two weeks is absolutely foolish.

73
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.940
It doesn't, uh, it's amazing to me that the,

74
00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:52.820
the medical profession does this because it doesn't match anything about the

75
00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:55.900
normal patterns of endocrinology. It's just not how the body works.

76
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.340
<v 2>The way it's been described to me to do it is to do it, um,</v>

77
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.010
with an insulin syringe and to do a tiny amount every three days. Right.

78
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.650
<v 1>That's correct. Yeah. So 0.2 milli, you know, 0.2 mill. So maybe, you know,</v>

79
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.770
it's 20 to 60 milligrams every, every few days, every third day or so, right.

80
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.810
That much more closely matches the normal pattern of release and avoids

81
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:21.720
these estrogen crash is. And a lot of problems that are,

82
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:25.160
that are layered onto estrogen are actually problems with prolactin,

83
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.640
which is a molecule that's involved in milk Glu down and lactating women.

84
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.120
But it actually shuts down the sexual desire and aggression. You know,

85
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:36.560
when, uh, this is interesting about prolactin. So, um,

86
00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:40.160
this happens in brooding birds and it happens in humans. They've done this,

87
00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:41.630
a study, he published in the journal nature,

88
00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:45.990
which is our kind of apex journal showed that when the husbands of pregnant

89
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.110
women, because of something, maybe a PHMO,

90
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:54.070
maybe some odor of the pregnant woman actually increases the man's prolactin.

91
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.470
When they're pregnant, puts body weight on the guy starts laying down body fat,

92
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:03.060
presumably to prepare the father for a long sleepless nights ahead because

93
00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:05.140
humans have always co-parented wow.

94
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.140
Am I mostly co-parented we all we know women do far more.

95
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.820
<v 2>But it's true dudes out there who get fat, don't feel bad.</v>

96
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.540
<v 1>Yeah's going on. The dad bought is, is in part due to an increase in prolactin.</v>

97
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.180
Oh, and testosterone and prolactin. You're kind of working in opposite fashion.

98
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.730
So it's a very thing. But, uh,

99
00:05:22.731 --> 00:05:26.010
the way you describe it is correct now for people that aren't getting prescribed

100
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.170
T R T, but want the increase in testosterone.

101
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.490
There are these plant compounds like Toga Ali and another one,

102
00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:36.290
which is very interesting. It's a Nigerian shrub called Fido GREs.

103
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.890
And it mimics Lutin hormone,

104
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:42.010
which is the hormone that comes outta the hypothalamus that stimulates thet.

105
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.640
If you got those in your ovaries,

106
00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:47.160
if you've got those to make more testosterone or estrogen.

107
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.600
And so those two herbal supplements together can give a significant boost

108
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.360
in free and active testosterone.

109
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.560
<v 2>So you said, tongue, God, Ali can give you 100, 200. Yeah. About.</v>

110
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.710
<v 0>That.</v>

111
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.320
<v 1>What does the other one give you fed?</v>

112
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.640
Doja has usually taken it about 600 milligrams. Um, and that can I,

113
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.900
the,

114
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.360
the most dramatic effect I've ever seen was somebody who had his testosterone

115
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.960
down in the low twos, or I think it was like low twos and it,

116
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:15.320
he got it up to the 700 range, which, but that's, but that's an outlier, right?

117
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:17.710
Most people are gonna see about a three, three to 400 point.

118
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.590
<v 0>Increase. And that's what the two of them Sy.</v>

119
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.230
<v 1>Synergistically Theia will actually make the testees grow. It's a, it's,</v>

120
00:06:23.231 --> 00:06:26.350
it's a noticeable difference. So everybody wants that. &lt;laugh&gt; well,

121
00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:29.790
the reason I know about this stuff, people are probably thinking like, you know,

122
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.990
Huberman running gear out the back of his Gar,

123
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.150
and that's not what this is about is that I,

124
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.820
I do a certain amount of work with military and I do a certain wanna work with

125
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.820
professional athletes who cannot take androgen compounds out of a syringe

126
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:44.580
because they'll lose their job. Right.

127
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.500
Or they've been doing that and they want to come off, although,

128
00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:49.060
and I'm not gonna out the organization,

129
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.620
but there is one major professional sports organization where let's just say,

130
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.660
if somebody gets injured,

131
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.770
they have permission to take up to 200 milligram a week of testosterone soccer.

132
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:04.250
No, no. No, but good guess &lt;laugh&gt; you almost got me there.

133
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.290
&lt;laugh&gt; cause I almost countered with the actual thing they did is hockey. Uh,

134
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.090
no, although those guys have the, the head head injuries. So actually,

135
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.210
so that right, the head injury thing is, is, is a serious problem, obviously.

136
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.640
So testosterone has the, the effects.

137
00:07:18.641 --> 00:07:20.680
We're all aware of like deepening the voice, facial hair,

138
00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:21.960
muscle growth recovery, et cetera,

139
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.320
mostly because testosterone increases protein synthesis.

140
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.640
You look at a young male in puberty, it's a protein synthesis machine. Yeah.

141
00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:30.460
They eat the a,

142
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.120
and they just grow and grow and grow and they're putting on muscles and they're

143
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.680
lean. And you know, so most often they're lean, but in any case,

144
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.110
testosterone has some very interesting effects on the brain. The,

145
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.430
the major mental effect of testosterone is it makes effort feel good.

146
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.150
<v 0>Oh, that makes.</v>

147
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.950
<v 1>Sense. And the reason it does it is that the Amy amygdala,</v>

148
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:53.070
this fear center in the brain,

149
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:56.590
this anxiety center in the brain has androgen receptors.

150
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:59.980
It has testosterone receptors. So it,

151
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.580
the way this works in animals and in humans as well, is that for most species,

152
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.580
the males of that species never get a chance to mate. Right.

153
00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:10.820
So if you think about, uh, I'll probably pick an example. Well,

154
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.660
you'll you'll know the exception, cuz I know, you know,

155
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:15.020
a lot about natural animals and animals that are hunted.

156
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.780
But if you think about animals with antlers like Rams,

157
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:20.250
there's been a lot of research. Believe it or not on AMS, it'd be fun.

158
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.610
I'd love to work on Rams. Do you know.

159
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.490
<v 0>Rams have enormous.</v>

160
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.570
<v 1>Balls and they have to fight for the right to make. Yes.</v>

161
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.850
And the fighting is a choice, right? And the decision to walk away is a choice.

162
00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:33.650
Usually they usually don't kill each other.

163
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.970
Although I know some of the injuries can lead to death. So testosterone,

164
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.200
these surges and testosterone that happen seasonally in certain species like

165
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:42.840
Rams or even these little hamsters,

166
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.960
the males will rip each other's testicles off in order to fight for the right to

167
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:47.794
mate.

168
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.280
So males of a given species have to actually overcome the fear of pain and

169
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:53.114
punishment.

170
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.680
And the surgeon testosterone is what causes the shift to the

171
00:08:57.681 --> 00:09:02.360
willingness to engage in battle. Mm. And so when humans are taking low doses or,

172
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.840
or reasonable doses of testosterone or they're increasing their testosterone or

173
00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:10.160
they're going through puberty effort and leaning into pain and challenge

174
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.750
actually has the effect of making the body feel soothed and good.

175
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.150
It's a drive just like sex is a drive or drinking water.

176
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:19.390
When you're thirsty is a drive.

177
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.310
This stuff is all anchored deep within the hypothalamus.

178
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:23.590
This isn't a cognitive thing.

179
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.990
<v 2>That makes sense why young men in particular are really driven to</v>

180
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.030
hard exercise and sports that are ver very difficult.

181
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:36.060
That require extreme effort completely makes sense.

182
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.060
<v 1>Yeah. And why, when people are testosterone depleted, they feel depressed.</v>

183
00:09:40.061 --> 00:09:42.500
And when people have a surge of testosterone,

184
00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:45.940
they feel relief and anxiety provided it's in the appropriate range.
