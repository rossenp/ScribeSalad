00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Imagine being born the Dalai Lama.</v>

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.690
So from the jump, you're something special. You're the chosen one.

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.070
And you're the one either reincarnation of who will this supposed to be?

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.140
<v 1>Oh, they're a tool queue is what it's called.</v>

5
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:20.250
So it's the Tohoku system and the way it would work would be, you know,

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.620
cause you have, like, if you look at the history of Tibet,

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.890
it was called the hermit kingdom and it was closed off from the rest of the

8
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.240
world is very hard to get in there.

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.230
Seven years in Tibet is about somebody you made it through and became friends

10
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:36.150
with the Dalai Lama as a kid. Anyway. So within the system,

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.200
uh, there is this idea that, uh,

12
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.140
beings reincarnate and that if you're awakened enough,

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.190
if you're like really like at the sort of last phase of this sort of, uh,

14
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.760
what would you call it? This cycle you were talking about earlier,

15
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.320
then you stop losing at least some of the amnesia that happens when you get

16
00:00:55.321 --> 00:01:00.000
processed through the liminal in-between period called the Bardo between

17
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.690
this incarnation and the next. So anyway, they go to children,

18
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.730
they put in front of them,

19
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.440
the particular items that belong to the

20
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:14.580
previous incarnation that they think they are Oracle's vision visionaries,

21
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:18.720
bring the monks to a particular village and then the kid picks it.

22
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.310
And then that big kid becomes the next, this or that. It's called a Tokyo.

23
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.450
<v 0>How many kids they look at?</v>

24
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.920
<v 1>Uh, I don't know, man. I don't know the depths of it turns out to be an.</v>

25
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.900
<v 0>I take his powers away.</v>

26
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.650
<v 1>Well, I think it has happened where telcos are like, it's similar to like,</v>

27
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.510
what the is the,

28
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.030
what is the thing where those kids get one summer to go like the summer of,

29
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.403
what does that relate to?

30
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.940
<v 0>Oh yeah. That's Amish. That's a rumble. Springer. Rumspringa.</v>

31
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.153
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.700
<v 0>What is that? There's a great documentary on that. Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.460
Something the devil's something.

34
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.260
<v 1>The devil it's like a great name. The devil summer,</v>

35
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.570
but it's just like the devils play.

36
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.530
<v 0>[Inaudible]. And the smoke. And then a lot of them come back. Well, we</v>

37
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.363
 feel empty.

38
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.920
<v 1>I believe that was one of the ways they studied the impact of MTMA wasn't it by</v>

39
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:18.030
like, cause like these,

40
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.050
like if you find someone who's taken MDME but no other drug, it's pretty rare.

41
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.150
So you need to find a person who's only taken MTMA otherwise you can't ax

42
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.350
like assess there's some cognitive damage. Cause it could have been the acid.

43
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.550
It could have been the mushrooms.

44
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.870
It could have been the time you fell on your when you were hammered,

45
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.930
who the knows. But these kids, some of them have only taken him DMA.

46
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.950
And so I believe that they use them as a sample to like determine if there was

47
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:48.210
any kind of neurological damage caused by the drug itself.

48
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.320
But so I think it's symbol where phenomena happens within that system where some

49
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:55.500
kids are like, I'm not a reincarnated being, I'm a musician.

50
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.390
I want to go play music and they leave.

51
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.950
<v 0>Do you know? Who's a musician. Who's also reincarnated being.</v>

52
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.290
<v 1>Jimi Hendrix, Steven Seagal.</v>

53
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.233
<v 0>What?</v>

54
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.430
<v 1>Yup. When did that happen? I didn't know. They had told them, I.</v>

55
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.220
<v 0>Think the Dalai Lama might've hooked him up, told them why.</v>

56
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.440
One of those guys over there told them that he was the reincarnation of

57
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.350
someone's super special. Jesus, God, it's a big deal over there. Well,

58
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.370
they had a ceremony and everything that is from 1987.

59
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:24.640
This is the long written thing about, about it. Oh, that's a lot of words.

60
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.403
That's been renamed.

61
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.240
The recognition of Steven Seagal as a reincarnation of the treasure

62
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:35.080
revealer chunk, drag door J.

63
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.090
<v 1>Wow. Of.</v>

64
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.810
<v 0>That to sail pile you'll monastery.</v>

65
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.490
So he's a reincarnation.

66
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.670
<v 1>Comforting to know he's always been with us, you know? Cause it's like,</v>

67
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:49.210
one of the things that does bother me is to imagine a world without Seagal,

68
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.350
you know? So it's cool to know.

69
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:53.140
He's always been here coming back again and again.

70
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.650
<v 0>Nobody was ever a loser in a past life, but he was always a.</v>

71
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.180
<v 1>Awesome. Well you mean, oh right. Yeah. When I went a little full.</v>

72
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.013
<v 0>Of.</v>

73
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.520
<v 1>Well yeah, of course, like what are you going to be like dirty? You know what,</v>

74
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.860
if you're making money as a psychic and you're like, whoa,

75
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.100
you are basically like a gutter rat. You are,

76
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.550
you've only been a rat filth. You weren't even,

77
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.400
you're a mucus thing. Like I'm not sure what you would call.

78
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.070
<v 0>It. A kind of jellyfish that killed babies. You're a.</v>

79
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.430
<v 1>Tapeworm. You're one of those long worms that went into someone's brain.</v>

80
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.040
<v 0>And drinking gnosis, your uncooked pork. You are.</v>

81
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.070
<v 1>A moth. You were there the whole,</v>

82
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:33.550
like to me like the whole reincarnations and toll. Cool. Yeah.

83
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.720
I told you it's a state.

84
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.730
<v 0>From the guy. I'm recognized my students, Steven Seagal, as a reincarnation,</v>

85
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.240
Toku of the treasure revealer Chung drag door.

86
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.060
J since there's been some confusion and uncertainty as to what this means,

87
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.190
I'm writing to clarify the situation.

88
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.010
<v 1>Necessary. I'll see you later, man. I got to go.</v>

89
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.413
<v 0>You might be full of.</v>

90
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.720
The girls got five hookers going to this guy's house right now as we speak

91
00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.710
well.

92
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.060
<v 1>Also the other there. So there's talk of like ending the Tulku system.</v>

93
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.983
And um,

94
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.640
the Dalai Lama has even said that and recognizing that cause what's cool.

95
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.140
Among many things is that he said, you know,

96
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.000
if he's very rational and he said,

97
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.940
if science proves something in Buddhism is off,

98
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:22.240
we'll change Buddhism to fit the rational mind.

99
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.380
And that's the beauty of Buddhism. There's pageantry in it. There's ceremony,

100
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:30.610
there's ritual in it. Just like any other religion. It's beautiful. Personally.

101
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:33.700
I think that there is a sort of, uh,

102
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.340
area of, uh,

103
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.810
experience accessible through their practices that I guess could best be

104
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:45.310
compared to psychedelics or something like that. But uh, to me,

105
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:50.050
what I love about it is all the pageantry aside and

106
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.360
all of it aside, it's not, faith-based,

107
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:57.070
it's a very basic series of ideas that you have

108
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.130
digest. You have to think about, you have to look into you.

109
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.910
Don't just get to be it. It's like, you know, maybe some forms of it.

110
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:07.010
There could be an example of that, but in general,

111
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:11.120
it's more along the lines of here's the basic fundamental

112
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.980
principles behind this,

113
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.500
not in the co in the cording of a human life that we've discovered.

114
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:22.130
Here's where some sufferings coming from all of the suffering in fact,

115
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.660
and here's how to fix it.

116
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.220
That's the four noble truths of Buddhism and that just hearing it, who gives a,

117
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.630
you could hear life is suffering. The cause of suffering is attachment.

118
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.820
Get rid of attachment, suffering ends.

119
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.570
Here's the system to get rid of attachment and you know,

120
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.290
whatever life is suffering was I even mean, what does life even mean?

121
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.070
What does it even mean by suffering this, this first noble truth?

122
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.900
It gets completely mistranslated anyway. Duka it means wobbly wheel.

123
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.010
It's more akin to like, if you're riding a bike,

124
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.120
that's got not enough air in it. It's going to be a rough ride,

125
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.730
but it's going to be even more of a rough ride.

126
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.050
If you have somehow trick yourself into thinking there's enough air in the tire

127
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.800
so that anytime you hit some bumps, you're like, what the is wrong with it?

128
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.980
That's it that's it it's like wobbly wheel. The thing's wonky.

129
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:17.810
You think you're not going to get disconnected.

130
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:20.570
When you've been on the line with Verizon for an hour,

131
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.630
you're going to get disconnected. It tends to happen.

132
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.210
You're going to get cut off in traffic. You're going to fail.

133
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:28.850
You're going to be disappointed. This is reality.

134
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.470
But somehow you've imagined that it doesn't work like that.

135
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.580
And every single time you're met with the truth, you're like, ah,

136
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.400
oh God, this sucks. And you know, so that's gonna,

137
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.320
that creates a lot of problems and it creates to, uh,

138
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.930
some ways to deal with it, which is desire and aversion.

139
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.740
So you're somewhere and you want to be somewhere else, basically, you know,

140
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:55.490
you're, you're somewhere. And you're like, I don't want to be in this place. Or,

141
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.400
you know, you're imagining that if you get this thing or that thing,

142
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.030
the pain you're feeling is of the wobbly wheel. Go away,

143
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.350
do the experiment. See if it's true. See if it's true.

144
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:10.340
That's all you can do is like, really look at the that you want.

145
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.230
Like I could come home and could have pulled up and given me seven Mogue

146
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:16.670
ones, right?

147
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.630
And I'm going to sit and play those Mogens ones for weeks and weeks until I'm

148
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:21.830
sweaty and smell like,

149
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.930
just someone shoved a salami under the balls of an ape. You know,

150
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:28.370
I'm not going to take showers

151
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.900
stink and like probably weeping into the mug and sneezing into it. Anyway,

152
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:39.980
the point is eventually after I saw the distraction has gone away,

153
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.040
I'm going to return to my fundamental self, you know,

154
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.810
the fundamental condition of existence as it is regardless.

155
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.950
And so this is sort of the print, some of the principles, as I understand it,

156
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:54.730
which are really quite intelligent, you know, it's really, and,

157
00:08:54.731 --> 00:08:58.560
and I love about it. Most of all is there's always this invitation,

158
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:03.270
which is go see, go see. It's not because I'm telling you this.

159
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:07.570
Believe it. It's like go see. Maybe it's different for you. And,

160
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.400
but you need to go check like every time you're doing the thing that you've been

161
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.850
repeating over and over again, is it making you happy for real?

162
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.080
Is it really working? Is it working? And if it's working great,

163
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.820
but if it's not,

164
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.320
and you're trying to pretend it is because you've been doing it so long. Well,

165
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.590
who are you? Who's winning this game of self-deception what, what, what,

166
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.890
there's no winning. If the game is tricking yourself, you can only want.

167
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.950
<v 0>And what do you do? Like how do you feel about life?</v>

168
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.700
If you're always tricking yourself? Hey, Twitter world.

169
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.930
<v 1>Yeah, man. That's right. You will only feel that,</v>

170
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.460
that everyone is trying to trick you and you'll feel like there's a grand

171
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:53.250
conspiracy and you'll feel like the world's out to get you.

172
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:54.600
And there is a great, a good spirit,

173
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.110
which is that you are running a game on yourself.

174
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.480
Yeah.

175
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.500
<v 0>I feel like we should end with that.</v>
