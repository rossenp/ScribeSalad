00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Lions have one shot at getting injured.</v>

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.530
They'd get injured once in their life and then it's over.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:09.860
<v 1>Mm.</v>

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.290
<v 2>So how long do you think they last, after an injury like that.</v>

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.200
<v 0>Dead within a couple of weeks, it usually started Def you think?</v>

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.490
How do you starve to death? If you can't.

7
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.260
<v 2>Eat? I think the lion keeps thinking.</v>

8
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.220
You think they have like memories and they're like that Gizelle. That goes up.

9
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.910
No.

10
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.380
<v 0>I think they hold no grudges. Right?</v>

11
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.230
I think grudges are connected to cognitive function.

12
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.260
Like our ego or our understanding of ourself.

13
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.230
That's what I'm going to get him back. Cause it's like ego.

14
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.280
I don't think animals have an ego. They have, they have a sense of fair though.

15
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.730
Animals have a sense of some animals do at least chimps do. Hmm.

16
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.020
One of the reasons why chimps attack people is because if people give something

17
00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:46.520
to someone else and you don't give it to them,

18
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.790
they have a real sense of fairness. Wow. Yeah.

19
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:53.570
There's a famous story of this guy who had a pet Chimp.

20
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.500
And then the thing about champs is you can keep them when they're young and then

21
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:59.120
they get older and it's like a man,

22
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.970
but a man that's five times stronger than you. And like,

23
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:04.580
why is he going to listen to you? He's not going to listen to you.

24
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.450
So I think he started biting off fingers. It's one of the things that chimps do,

25
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.750
chimps get mad at you. They bite off your finger. Yeah. Just to let you know,

26
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.970
they're the boss. Like they don't give a. If you're injured,

27
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.510
they have no remorse. Right. And they're intelligent. So you have this thing.

28
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.880
That's not a dog. It's not a person.

29
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.680
It's this weird in-between thing. It's an animal, but it's also intelligent.

30
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.470
And so when you do something for someone else,

31
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:31.760
but you don't do something for them, they get rage, like horrific rage.

32
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.760
So this guy gets rid of this. Chimp brings it to a shelter.

33
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.690
The shelter takes it in and he goes to visit it every year.

34
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:41.420
And the Chimp goes to see him like, oh my friend, I miss you. I miss you.

35
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:42.260
Why can't I come home?

36
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.230
But he can't come home ever because he would just take over the house. Right.

37
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.120
Because he's a grown champion. Well,

38
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.810
you don't castrate chimps the way they castrate dogs. Like you,

39
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.440
when you castrate a dog, like everybody it's standard. People think it's good.

40
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.710
Oh, did you get your dog neutered? Yeah, I did. And you're like,

41
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:01.040
you want your dog to have no testosterone. You want your dog to have no balls,

42
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.250
but then it becomes a different thing. Right? Then it's like tired. And like,

43
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.880
is it like, have you ever seen a dog get snipped?

44
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.550
I had one of my dogs get snipped at when it was five years old.

45
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.430
He was just too aggressive. And so someone talked me into it.

46
00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:14.960
And then when I got him snapped, all of a sudden,

47
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.810
he was just tired all the time. He's lazy. And I realized that, oh,

48
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:21.650
he didn't have any testosterone anymore. It's all gone, Mike. Wow, look.

49
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:25.070
So the dog's a different dog now. So you can't do that chimps.

50
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.220
For whatever reason, you can't do that. You can't neuter a Chimp.

51
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.220
So this guy goes to visit the champ and he brings a birthday cake,

52
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:34.930
happy birthday buddy. And the other chimps that are in cages right next to it.

53
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.810
They're like this mother. Didn't bring me a cake. I can't believe this.

54
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.480
So they figure out a way to get out.

55
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.450
And they got out and they attack the man and they tore him apart.

56
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.540
They tore his face off. They tore his Dick off. They tore his feet off. They,

57
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:51.890
they bit his fingers off. It's one of the most horrific,

58
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.690
cruel attacks you'll ever hear of because they did it to try to take away

59
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:57.290
from him.

60
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.000
The things he wants and needs like chimps recognize you need your fingers in

61
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.910
order to do things you need your face in order to see you need your Dick in

62
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:08.500
order to. So that's the things that go after. They don't,

63
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.030
they don't just try to kill you.

64
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.240
They try to take away what it means to be a human.

65
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:14.440
So if you try to hide your hands,

66
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.160
they'll pull your hands away from and open them up and bite them off.

67
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.710
Like crazy with rage filled,

68
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:24.280
look in their eye and they don't communicate with language.

69
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.460
So they only have this sense in their head of what's fair and what's not fair

70
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.580
and what you've done to them. So if you do something that makes them jealous,

71
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.680
they think immediately you've done something bad to them. They don't think that.

72
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:40.090
No, no. I just gave my friend a cake. You made them feel bad. So it's you,

73
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.450
you made them feel bad. So they'll go right after you. So it's,

74
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.010
it's like a sort of a, it's an interesting study in the way.

75
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.940
Sometimes people look at things like we've all been jealous, right?

76
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:52.930
You've been jealous of someone.

77
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:57.340
You see someone who's doing something well and go, oh, I wish I was that guy,

78
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.170
but you don't go attack that person. Right. People recognize,

79
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:06.520
like it's not his fault that I feel bad that he has this Corvette.

80
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.680
I have to just. I just got to appreciate the guys hustle guys out there,

81
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.920
kicking. All right. I gotta get my together.

82
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.040
But there's a thing that we have initially, especially when they're children,

83
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.990
we feel angry. Like you feel upset. Like you feel, uh,

84
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.430
like you've been shorted. Like someone's oh, why didn't I get that? This is.

85
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.720
He gets at Nitel.

86
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.890
It's a fascinating part of humans.

87
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.080
And then humans as we get older and more sophisticated with language,

88
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.300
but still carry the same child as emotions.

89
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.800
We find reasons to be upset at someone for being successful.

90
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.860
We find reasons eat the rich. You know,

91
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:52.660
we find re these by these weird little ways that we can justify our

92
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.190
jealousy or our anger or our distain for those who are more

93
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:01.150
successful than we. So it's like, we're coming up with complicated,

94
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:04.570
sophisticated ways to justify these primal behaviors,

95
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.320
that chimps exhibit and just violent rage. So this guy,

96
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.500
it's a famous case like this. You can see the pictures.

97
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:15.280
If you want to see the pictures of the cake guy of the guy who got his face

98
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:18.330
ripped apart and fingers bitten off. And yeah, I mean he was hospital.

99
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.740
<v 2>That sounds great. Do you think that this.</v>

100
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.230
<v 0>Um, folks at home, uh, prepared don't show it on the screen? Cause it's rough,</v>

101
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.270
but Tony needs to see this. So you go give a tramp cake. I'm not doing that.

102
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.010
This is wow. No nose. See how he bit his nose off. Yeah.

103
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.470
<v 1>Look at his face. Oh. Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.620
<v 2>Consciousness said after this happened. Okay. Yeah.</v>

105
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.110
<v 0>Of course. Look at us. See his right hand and the fingers bitten off.</v>

106
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.210
That's what they do. They bite off your fingers.

107
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.720
That's the Chimp right there to click on the chamber of the right-hand corner.

108
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.853
That's his Chimp.

109
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.650
<v 1>Come on. What's hot picture.</v>

110
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.230
<v 0>Oh, what does that picture? I'm surprised he let him keep it as yours. Oh,</v>

111
00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:59.000
that's the guy's face. Jamie. That's what that is.

112
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.780
He's got a trake cause he can't breathe out of his mouth. Yeah. Well,

113
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:04.250
I don't think that, you know,

114
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.570
chimps exactly know the human anatomy, all that well,

115
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.440
but they know what's important to you. Your face, your fingers. it.

116
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.843
Tore the sky apart.

117
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.920
<v 2>So if he would've brought pieces of cake and given them to all the chimps and</v>

118
00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:18.754
all the cages.

119
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.800
<v 0>They would all be happy. Right. But they're also angry that he's there.</v>

120
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.580
That they're captive. So when they get captive, look,

121
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.140
being captive for a Chimp is probably a similar feeling

122
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.640
as to what it would be to be captive as a person. Right?

123
00:06:33.641 --> 00:06:37.270
If you see a Chimp at the zoo and you're, um, you're in this big,

124
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.060
they're in this big containment and they all have these monkey bars and stuff

125
00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:40.781
they could hang on,

126
00:06:40.781 --> 00:06:43.720
but there's a bunch of people staring at them like all day long,

127
00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:46.060
people are staring at you through glass and there's a ceiling.

128
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.840
There's a net over the top. So you can't go over the top and it's fences.

129
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:53.950
And you're just like. Every day is boring. Nothing happens.

130
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.140
Nothing happens every day. There's no lions. There's no, no fruit to go pick.

131
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.480
There's no places to go journey to, to explore like chimps travel around, man.

132
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.740
They don't just sit in one particular, 100 yard area for the rest of their life.

133
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.500
And it's not even a hundred yards. Right. If you go to the LA zoo,

134
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.750
you'll see how small that enclosure is. Yeah.

135
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.180
I went to the LA zoo once really high, really high, like on an edible.

136
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.070
Yeah. And uh, I wrote a piece on my website, uh, called, uh,

137
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.210
the animal prison. And I was like, cause it made me feel I could, uh,

138
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.960
cause you know, when you're really, super baked, you're sensitive to everything.

139
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.640
Yeah. But just, I, I recognize how,

140
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.650
instead of thinking about myself and thinking about, you know, oh,

141
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:40.510
I'm going to go to the zoo and see the monkeys.

142
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.670
I went there and I immediately felt sadness. I was like, oh no,

143
00:07:45.671 --> 00:07:50.350
these poor creatures, like, they don't want to be here. Like what are we doing?

144
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.500
Like, we can't do this. I was thinking like, I gotta get outta here.

145
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.910
<v 2>It's true. No, you're right. And it's very bizarre. Same thing with SeaWorld.</v>

146
00:07:57.911 --> 00:07:59.320
Same thing with all those places.

147
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.190
<v 0>Oh see world's worst. Yeah. Cause they're as smart as us. If not smarter. Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.430
We don't know. We don't even really know how smart orcas are. Right.

149
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.850
Because or dolphins. Cause we put them in these weird categories.

150
00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:13.870
Like how much emails do they send? Um, do they make houses? No,

151
00:08:13.871 --> 00:08:17.980
they must be stupid. But they have a cerebral cortex is 40% larger than ours.

152
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.420
We don't know how smart they are. They also, they communicate,

153
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.930
they have a weird, sophisticated language that we can't decipher.

154
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.960
We can't decipher it. We don't know what their language is.

155
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.250
They've been able to recognize specific accents so that, you know, there's like,

156
00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:36.910
you know, like there's a Southern accent and a Cleveland accent.

157
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.660
There's a Chicago accent. Orcas have accents.

158
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:45.610
Like we can tell by the sound, oh this is an Orca from Alaska.

159
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.020
Or this is a Orca from Seattle. Yeah. It's crazy. It's nuts man.

160
00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:51.670
The model we put them in a swimming pool.

161
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.620
<v 1>A swimming pool.</v>

162
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.600
<v 2>So sad. How they're fin droops get depressed.</v>

163
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.170
<v 0>It's not that they get depressed. They don't use it. It atrophies.</v>

164
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.740
It's like an arm that you don't pick anything up with. It just gets limp.

165
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.550
<v 3>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

166
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.700
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.
