00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.790
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. Hello, everybody.</v>

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:08.760
I'm live here with super Yogi, Bert Kreischer,

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.010
newly sober athlete,

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.350
resting heart rate of 47 47. That's pretty crazy. I talked to.

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.410
<v 1>Her, I called my cardiologist right after I talked to you guys. Am I dying?</v>

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.250
I literally was like, Hey, Joe Rogan said, I'm dying. And he's like,

7
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:24.560
first of all, he's like, I respect you a Rogan,

8
00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:26.570
but please don't listen to him about your blood pressure medicine.

9
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.100
<v 0>But I read somewhere that blood pressure medicine and, um, uh,</v>

10
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.300
anti-anxiety medicine lowers your.

11
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.500
<v 1>Head. Uh, yes, those are beta blockers. I don't, I'm not on that.</v>

12
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.560
Which by the way I spiraled out and then my,

13
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.440
and I couldn't get my heart rate up as I was spiraling. So I was like,

14
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:45.170
I was like, I'm freaking out. Normally my pulse would be through the roof.

15
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.660
I call my doctor. He's like, no, you're healthy. He's like,

16
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:51.410
this is what we've been shooting for is you to stop drinking. So he's like,

17
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.070
let's just do what you're doing. He's like have a good time with it. And so, uh,

18
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.960
but yeah, my resting heart rates low, I,

19
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.410
my I've never felt better in my life to be dead serious with you. How many.

20
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.830
<v 0>Days in our, you know, ideas, right? Were 12 days in say the 12th.</v>

21
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.100
<v 1>I'm one day ahead of that. Cause I quit the day before I quit the day before,</v>

22
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:11.540
because I was because I listened to you guys and all the armchair doctors who

23
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:14.600
were like, you're going to die. You need to be medically induced into a coma.

24
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.600
<v 0>Well, you were telling us that you were drinking six doubles a day.</v>

25
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.680
<v 1>By the way, I, I, I talk out of my when I'm drunk.</v>

26
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.590
So I don't know how much I was really drunk because I was dead.

27
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.180
I was definitely terrified.

28
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.340
I was definitely terrified coming into the home stretch of getting sober.

29
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.600
Cause I was like, I was like, man, am I going to die? Like I literally sat.

30
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.880
And I talked to Dr. Drew about it and I was like, Hey man,

31
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.430
can I like die and stuff? And he was like, well, you can have seizures.

32
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.600
Like doesn't house, but I, uh, I stopped drinking.

33
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:46.790
I didn't even have withdrawals. It just.

34
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.300
<v 0>Felt good the next day. That's amazing. Yeah. Killed Amy Winehouse. You know.</v>

35
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.570
<v 1>I heard I've Googled all this, but I think Amy.</v>

36
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.000
<v 2>Winehouse is just over the top. You've.</v>

37
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.680
<v 1>Gotta be the second you wake up till the second you pass out drinking.</v>

38
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.500
Um, and by the way, there on that Australian tour, there were hints of that.

39
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.731
Like there was not,

40
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:10.640
I was flying in performing every night and I drink on planes.

41
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:14.060
I hadn't flown sober at that time. And so there was, I was, I was,

42
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.990
I've always been very, uh, measured with my booze. So I wasn't,

43
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:22.100
I wasn't going nuts. Did you feel good when you're doing that? Like how did.

44
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.980
<v 0>You feel when you drink it and flying and you felt bad?</v>

45
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.850
<v 1>I actually felt really bad and I, and I think, and I think we all tweeted this,</v>

46
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:32.360
but I was like, I was ready for this month. After that Australian tour,

47
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.580
I was definitely ready. That's a great way to go into not drinking.

48
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.240
Is flight Australia, do a tour for two weeks and then fly back. I was like,

49
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.373
bring it, dude.

50
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.590
<v 0>You know what, man? I don't drink that much, but I feel way better too.</v>

51
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.330
It's weird. It's like,

52
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:50.480
I would have like maybe a shot for going on stage some nights,

53
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:53.960
but some nights not. And then, you know, maybe someone go, you want a beer?

54
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:54.290
Yeah.

55
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.380
I'll have a beer and they have one or two and then maybe I'd have a glass of

56
00:02:57.381 --> 00:02:58.760
wine with dinner. So, you know,

57
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:02.950
on regular Friday night I might have four drinks. And um,

58
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.780
now nothing for 12 days and no pot, I went off the pod too. I know.

59
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.550
Cause Ari was giving me such a hard time

60
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.990
[inaudible] and I was like, all right. I told Tommy, I was like,

61
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.370
I'm just going to quit and not tell them.

62
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.160
And then break it up at the end of the month. Like it's easy.

63
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.400
The pots have been easy, but the dreams have been different.

64
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.730
It is really interesting. How, when you don't smoke pot,

65
00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:31.200
your dreams like ramp up. It makes me think like what? No,

66
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.190
honestly like, uh, just completely objectively. I mean like death,

67
00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:40.180
can't be good and not be dreaming like right. Probably something happening. I.

68
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.410
<v 1>I was my first few days of not drinking.</v>

69
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.380
I couldn't get out of lucid dreaming. Ooh. And I was,

70
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.460
I was having intense lucid dreams where I was well aware I was asleep,

71
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.960
but I knew that if I could just, I knew,

72
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.590
but I knew that I was dreaming and I was like, don't get out of this.

73
00:03:55.591 --> 00:04:00.030
You're having fun. And so, um, you have a dreaming has been intense by the way.

74
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.670
The really, my favorite thing is just sleeping good.

75
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.140
Like waking up at six in the morning and going like, feel good. Oh,

76
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.530
that and man, and by the way, I know that you're like,

77
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.600
are you like a Uber fan of podcasters?

78
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.810
There's like a lot of people I have been introduced to through your podcast.

79
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.900
And like Brennan Shaw is one of my favorite people. I love that guy.

80
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.500
He's awesome. And he gets coffee all the time. Now I look at that.

81
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.550
You get gives me panic. When I see him get a coffee for the past year.

82
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.390
I've been like, dude, how the is he doing that mean when I drink,

83
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.040
I can't drink coffee. Cause I start shaking. I get way too. Blood sugary.

84
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:35.640
Like.

85
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.800
<v 3>Really? Yeah. Just regular coffee.</v>

86
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.120
<v 1>I haven't had coffee. I haven't had like a cup of coffee. Um,</v>

87
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.820
in probably like maybe like eight months.

88
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.690
<v 0>Yeah. What is it about coffee? Is it, do you put some in coffee?</v>

89
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.690
<v 1>No, it's just coffee. It's a yeah. Cause it's uh,</v>

90
00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:54.780
my blood sugar is low from drinking. I didn't sleep well.

91
00:04:54.781 --> 00:04:57.540
I have a cup of coffee and it just, and then, then I would be like,

92
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.370
how does Brendan take naps in the middle of the day?

93
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.260
Like I could understand that, dude.

94
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.190
I enjoy getting up and going to Starbucks and getting a coffee more than I ever

95
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:06.840
enjoyed going to a bar. It is,

96
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.030
I get up and I feel like I'm part of the community.

97
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.610
<v 4>I like say hi to people. We.</v>

98
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.470
<v 1>Landed from that first sober flight I took down.</v>

99
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:15.630
I know that I'm going to sound like a child when we landed.

100
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.100
It was me and Brendan, Brendan Walsh was on my flight and he, and he was like,

101
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.110
randomly, he random. It was at my flight.

102
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.290
I'd talked to him through text the night before. And I was like, dude,

103
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:29.730
I'll see you on the plane. We got to lax. And he was like, yeah, I'm hitting up.

104
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:32.250
So Rocktober with you. I'm not going to drink either. And I was like, awesome,

105
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:36.750
man, really? Yeah. I said this and I've never said this. I go, Hey,

106
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:40.260
do you want to get a cup of coffee? And he was like, sure,

107
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.440
we both got coffees at like 10 in the morning at the airport. And I was like,

108
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.800
oh.

109
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.640
<v 4>I got a whole day ahead of me. Like I got coffee on me. Like, dude, I.</v>

110
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.240
<v 1>Had the funniest Sunday I've ever had that. When I got home that night,</v>

111
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:53.850
I was like, I won't be able to see about a cup of coffee. I want right to sleep.

112
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.490
<v 0>Are you worried that, that this like right now,</v>

113
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.060
you're in this really great place. Right? You're healthy. You're feeling good.

114
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.920
You're sleeping good. But are you,

115
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.980
are you thinking that this is just a vacation from your other life?

116
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.360
Or are you changing your life?

117
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.110
<v 1>My therapist, when my therapist, when this started, he said,</v>

118
00:06:11.111 --> 00:06:13.810
do not do this challenge. I think it's a really bad idea. And I was like,

119
00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:15.730
really? He goes, yeah, therapist.

120
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.870
<v 0>Do you have, I've heard this.</v>

121
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.860
Like Christina was mad at him yesterday at my therapist. Yeah.

122
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.450
Is this therapist telling him to,

123
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.320
because she's got a good therapist that she really likes, but I just don't.

124
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.830
Maybe your therapist doesn't trust.

125
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.590
<v 1>No, he said, he said to me at one point he goes,</v>

126
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.560
so how are you feeling? I said, good. I'm not having like any epiphanies.

127
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.410
I wish I had an epiphany, but I don't, I don't. I'm going to Tiffany.

128
00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:41.080
I'm just enjoying it. I'm really having a good time. I was like,

129
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:43.360
I don't know if I'm, I don't know how I'm going to get back into drinking.

130
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.650
And he's like, that's why you shouldn't have done this.

131
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.440
If you want to quit drinking, you should have just done it for yourself.

132
00:06:47.441 --> 00:06:50.530
You shouldn't done it out of spite for Tom orient, Joe. Yeah.

133
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.290
<v 0>But it's not spite. It's a fun little challenge. Like I look,</v>

134
00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:57.640
I don't want to do 15 yoga classes in a month loving, but we're doing it.

135
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.420
It's great. But do you really want to have an obligation to have to do you know,

136
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.740
three a week? Yeah.

137
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.480
<v 3>Do you do it? Yeah.</v>

138
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.310
<v 1>Dude, I can only work in those parameters. I can only work to the extremes.</v>

139
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.890
Like when we said no pot, no booze. I was like, I'm cool.

140
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.050
Cause I'm not gonna smoke pot. If I'm not drinking booze. I'm a,

141
00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:16.960
Teetotaller like, I take things to,

142
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.260
I take things to an extreme cause that's the way I can help compartmentalize

143
00:07:20.261 --> 00:07:21.280
things. I think.

144
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.450
<v 0>My question was like at the end of this month, when November 1st rolls around,</v>

145
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.130
are you going to just go get up?

146
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.620
<v 1>Uh, well obviously, yeah.</v>

147
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.110
I'm going to be with Ari in new Orleans and new Orleans.

148
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.980
We're doing the impractical.

149
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.140
I'm going on a cruise November 1st big J Tony Hinchcliffe, Sarah it's gamma.

150
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.850
Like we're all going to be on the cruise with the impractical.

151
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.620
Those impractical jokers guys are killing it. Dude. They did the Greek.

152
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.240
I saw 6,000 people. insane mob did.

153
00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:59.950
I would love to have sat in the front row where they sat me and on their show.

154
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.300
But I can't, man. I would love as a comic to be like, I'm better than this.

155
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:04.841
The man,

156
00:08:04.841 --> 00:08:07.990
they forget up there and they have such great chemistry and they're showing like

157
00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:11.020
inside clips and it's just a multimedia. Oh.

158
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.200
<v 0>So it's not like up. It's like a bunch of different stuff that they do.</v>

159
00:08:14.201 --> 00:08:16.780
Like they show like pranks. They play on people.

160
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.650
<v 1>They show more pictures from like their childhood, like things that,</v>

161
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.320
because they've known each other forever. Then when they were younger,

162
00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:25.690
they tell stories about them traveling together.

163
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.730
It's it actually is really a great show. Like imagine if I'm me, when Aryan,

164
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.760
Tom did a show at the store and we talked about sober October,

165
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.210
Tom and I would have a bunch of stuff very quickly that we could talk about our

166
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:39.900
hot yoga classes and Ari and all our texts. Like,

167
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.980
like one of my favorite things ever is when the Eve of sober October Ari

168
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.860
put, oh, sorry, such a con. He puts.

169
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.870
<v 4>Out all our texts privately.</v>

170
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.250
<v 1>Behind that. We haven't been sharing with you on Instagram and tacos.</v>

171
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.950
Tell me that isn't giving you panic right now.

172
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.020
Cause I don't know what I've said. Like we've all been like,

173
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.210
Joe's not quitting weed. And then Ari mannered,

174
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.720
Ari managed this coup de Todd against you for pray for Joe.

175
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.510
<v 4>Already. Look, I look, I know.</v>

176
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.720
<v 1>He gets a lot of online and everyone's fun with Ari.</v>

177
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:14.190
But I will tell you this has been exponentially fun because of his involvement,

178
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:19.050
because this is right in his little swing zone. Yeah. When, when you said your,

179
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.780
when you said I'm not, I'm not quitting,

180
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.320
we'd already then branched off to me and Tom he's like gentlemen,

181
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.040
get ready for the assault on Joe and both Tom and I were like,

182
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:32.070
I don't think that's a good idea. And I was like, no, it's happening.

183
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.500
I want you to get your comments ready. I want them to send in.

184
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:36.030
We're going to workshop each other's comments.

185
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.360
I want you to be the first comments on this video that I post on this thing

186
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:43.230
saying Joe is not taking part of sober October. So we're all sending in Tom.

187
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.160
I love Tom to death. He's such a cook. He, his first draft, I was like,

188
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:50.040
this will not be working. It's too, too pleasant to Joe.

189
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.870
We're going to re Burt and I will rewrite this for you.

190
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.350
<v 0>Well, Ari has been, he,</v>

191
00:09:54.351 --> 00:09:59.060
I think he's handling this the least like he's, he's struggling.

192
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.610
Like he's saying this is harder for me than any of you. And I'm like,

193
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.600
I think he's being serious. I think he likes the marijuana for self-medication.

194
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.220
<v 1>He does. And you know,</v>

195
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.850
he has set his life up and I think if anyone looks at art from the outside end,

196
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:15.770
he set his life up for him. Yeah. He's got his, he's got a nice piece of cake.

197
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.510
Yeah. Great apartment in east village. He got all his friends.

198
00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:21.650
They all go out every night.

199
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.810
<v 4>He's got, you know, he's and he's one of the funniest guys. Would you ever go.</v>

200
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.480
<v 1>To New York to just call him up and go? What's the plan for today?</v>

201
00:10:29.481 --> 00:10:30.830
And he's like, I don't know. Let's get lost.

202
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.630
Let's go find some lobster somewhere.

203
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.990
<v 0>But he's taken it seriously. He got mad the other day when I was with him.</v>

204
00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:39.800
And I sent that text saying that, uh, I listened to your podcast, Ari,

205
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.110
and it seems you haven't been doing all the poses,

206
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.340
but a good news is there's still plenty of days of the month to make up for the

207
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.650
15 different hot yoga classes. And he took it seriously and got, super mad.

208
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.180
<v 1>Struck, panicking me. If you had told me, Hey Burt, those ones don't count,</v>

209
00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:59.120
but you can start over. You still have 50 days. I would've been like, off.

210
00:10:59.300 --> 00:10:59.720
Like dude.

211
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.140
<v 0>I was only with them. And then my second, I had to a two wing attack.</v>

212
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.770
That was the first level. And the second level was like, look,

213
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.630
just go to classes and whatever things that you didn't do from the other

214
00:11:11.631 --> 00:11:13.640
classes, you can just redo them on the honor system.

215
00:11:13.641 --> 00:11:16.430
We don't have to do the whole class, just stand around.

216
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.780
Like I was totally with him, but he took it seriously. So.

217
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.360
<v 1>By himself in this, I feel like, like he's in New York. Yeah.</v>

218
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.280
So like text messages are.

219
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.990
<v 0>Weird, man. It's not a good way to with people because you know,</v>

220
00:11:29.991 --> 00:11:33.980
you look at it as this mother serious. You like look at it and go, no, listen.

221
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.390
We're all professional comedians. And you're the rudest one out of all of us.

222
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.100
He said he hoped you were out.

223
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.500
<v 4>Oh yeah. Yeah. And then I didn't understand the context. I go,</v>

224
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.740
I hope you're Ralphie too. Like, and he was like, no, I hope you Ralphie.

225
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:52.190
And I was like, oh, you want me to die? Yeah. What? Oh, Cari.

226
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.610
He has been, he is the most flame throwing burn the bridges.

227
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.830
<v 1>It's down kind of guy. It's awesome. Yeah, he's hilarious.</v>

228
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.860
But I think that one of the things that stinks and I wish this had been part of

229
00:12:04.861 --> 00:12:06.810
the bed, I wish it had stayed in. I wish he had,

230
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.590
you had gotten him that yellow Corvette and I wish that he had stayed in LA this

231
00:12:10.591 --> 00:12:12.990
entire month and been able to be in a part of it.

232
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.810
Cause there is a communal like when, like today you're like,

233
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.330
Hey podcasts at one 30, you want to go yoga at 10 30? I was like,

234
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.300
I had a meeting at 10, but I would've loved that. Yeah. And like,

235
00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:24.400
I love Tom will text me and go like this. And this is,

236
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.070
it's the fun littleness of this competition is like, Tom's like, Hey,

237
00:12:29.071 --> 00:12:32.520
I can only go to four 30. Um, are you going to 1230? And I'm like, yeah.

238
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.130
And then Tom will be like, well Burt's a no show. I'm like, yeah.

239
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.880
<v 4>Everyone looks at the distillery. The doughnut factories video is hilarious.</v>

240
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.360
Check all the hamburger joints.

241
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.080
<v 1>He is by the way, we having.</v>

242
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.310
<v 0>Fun with each other. But honestly I think Ari's taken seriously.</v>

243
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.280
Like all that pray for Joe. Joe's a weed addict. It didn't bother me.

244
00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.520
I thought it was funny. I was laughing. I repost it. A lot of it. Oh.

245
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.560
<v 1>That was, that was the biggest dude.</v>

246
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:06.580
I went on stage on in DC that first night and people were like, people like,

247
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.550
we should take a moment of silence. And I was like, yeah,

248
00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:09.300
let's take a moment of silence.

249
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.380
Everyone brought their head and we prayed for you.

250
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.480
<v 4>It was so much fun.</v>

251
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:14.700
<v 0>Wow.</v>

252
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.660
It's like not smoking weed for 11 days is one of the easiest things I've ever

253
00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:23.160
done in my life. It's not hard at all. I just don't smoke pot. It's not like,

254
00:13:23.161 --> 00:13:27.630
wow, how will I go on a, I've been having some great sets. So that's a bit fun.

255
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.500
Those are some I've done probably in the 12 nights.

256
00:13:31.501 --> 00:13:36.090
I probably done like 9, 8, 9, 8 or nine sets. There's a most sets.

257
00:13:36.091 --> 00:13:39.540
I've done. No weed ever. Really? Yeah.

258
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.050
Like since I started smoking pot, like 20 years ago.

259
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.420
<v 1>I real, uh, I did, uh,</v>

260
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.280
I did spots at the store the other night and I had great stone sober and I,

261
00:13:50.281 --> 00:13:51.300
you know, what's so funny is I,

262
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.380
I have a lot of apologies to issue on this podcast.

263
00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:00.720
There's a lot of things that I said when we were drinking that I then,

264
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.860
uh, did and went, oh, I guess I was a little wrong about that. Like what,

265
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.540
like for number one is I don't drink on stage.

266
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.780
Like I didn't realize that there's a difference between not drinking on stage

267
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.550
and having a drink with you on stage.

268
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.180
There's a little bit of a comfort level knowing I can kill this drink and I

269
00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:17.970
don't have to deal with this. Like, and that first night,

270
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.030
that Saturday night I went on with no booze for both shows.

271
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.730
And on that late show, I was like, oh, I could use a cocktail.

272
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.340
And I definitely drank on stage. Like I was like,

273
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.990
I wouldn't mind a cocktail right now. So.

274
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.420
<v 0>You were thinking before that you didn't drink on stage.</v>

275
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.350
<v 1>I say, I go, I, this, the truth is I don't mind performing sober. I enjoy it.</v>

276
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.980
But I would say like, if you had said, so do you get drunk on stage? I'm like,

277
00:14:37.981 --> 00:14:41.610
no, never, but I definitely bring drinks on stage with me. Right.

278
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.110
<v 0>And I like, if you had a breathalyzer tests, like have been on stage,</v>

279
00:14:46.111 --> 00:14:49.830
was driving, would you get it? Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

280
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.040
<v 1>Oh point that's number one. Apology issued. Uh,</v>

281
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.410
number two is, uh, uh, treadmills are not real running.

282
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.030
<v 4>No, I told you, dude, you got.</v>

283
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:05.500
<v 0>To come do my course do it through the course I do with me. It's ruthless. Oh,</v>

284
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.050
running Hills. That's that's where it's at, man, dude.

285
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.060
<v 5>Uh, let's just say, um.</v>

286
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:11.771
<v 1>I didn't really,</v>

287
00:15:11.771 --> 00:15:15.160
like I run on the treadmill all the time and I'm all I can easily run under a 10

288
00:15:15.161 --> 00:15:17.020
minute mile. Uh,

289
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.730
I go on the road and my first set of miles was like 12 minute miles. And I was,

290
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.420
I was in pain and I was like, whoa, this is not the same.

291
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.670
And then I got to a 10 minute mile. I was like, that feels like a.

292
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.773
You can sprint.

293
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.250
<v 0>But you know, you can get, do we show you those treadmills that are,</v>

294
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:33.310
they're really.

295
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.270
<v 1>Expensive. I've thought about getting one. But so what I do now is I'm doing.</v>

296
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:42.310
<v 0>Some sort of a deal with them. What are, who are they go to rogue,</v>

297
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.600
rogue athletics.

298
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.490
They're the guys who made the reverse hyper machine that we have in the back.

299
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.840
And, um, I'm actually, it's called true form. Yeah. Pull it up,

300
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.490
pull this out so we could see what it looks like.

301
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.640
But this thing is different because it's at,

302
00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.900
you're actually pushing your own body weight. There's no machine behind it.

303
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:07.120
It's just got friction to it. And it's got like a slope and you run up on it.

304
00:16:07.121 --> 00:16:09.880
And it really is like the closest thing to running.

305
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:14.860
I still think actual running is better, but that is a very close second.

306
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.810
According to wow, 5,000.

307
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.380
<v 1>Bucks, they're really expensive to form hit me so expensive. They hit you up.</v>

308
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.690
When they say, Hey to forum, hit me up. Hey.

309
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.440
<v 0>Hey, true form. We'll do a free ad, but we're doing a free ad for you right now.</v>

310
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.620
You flux. I don't know if we can afford that. That's a lot of money. Well,

311
00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:32.680
some people can, you know, I mean, for sure some people would be,

312
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.180
it'd be willing if you had to have one piece of equipment in your house,

313
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.170
you know, and you budgeted it out 5,000 bucks. It's probably worth it.

314
00:16:41.171 --> 00:16:43.870
If you could actually use it and get in great shape with it.

315
00:16:43.871 --> 00:16:47.470
But I really feel like the best way to do it is to just go outside. I mean,

316
00:16:47.471 --> 00:16:48.010
I think like,

317
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.400
especially if you can go somewhere where there's like a dirt trail and like a

318
00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:54.040
lake to look at, it makes it more interesting.

319
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.521
<v 1>It's been,</v>

320
00:16:54.521 --> 00:16:57.340
it's been one of the cool things about not drinking and getting out and doing

321
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.960
road work is, uh,

322
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.230
my wife calls it source energy of like getting out there and going like, oh,

323
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.020
it's beautiful. Life is really beautiful. Yeah.

324
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.410
I go to the park that like where Jo Jo used to live right by this park.

325
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:13.390
I used to go there all the time and see Joey. And uh, and I go to this park,

326
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.760
uh, once, every morning we go,

327
00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:19.420
my wife will walk it and I run it and I'm loving it.

328
00:17:19.421 --> 00:17:22.600
So what I'm doing is I'm doing road work probably three times a week.

329
00:17:22.601 --> 00:17:24.820
And then twice a week, I get on the treadmill to settle.

330
00:17:24.821 --> 00:17:28.270
I'm terrified of injury and then not being able to run. So I don't,

331
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:29.860
and I'm trying to run five days a week.

332
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.130
<v 0>Are you worried about like planner or something plan? You had that for a while.</v>

333
00:17:33.131 --> 00:17:33.220
I.

334
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.250
<v 1>Have plantar fasciitis and it's terrifying shin splints. What.</v>

335
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.870
<v 0>Do you get? You get it in the middle of your foot.</v>

336
00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:38.710
Like where are you getting that?

337
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.590
<v 1>What is it like if this is your foot like right towards the heel. Oh yeah. Yeah.</v>

338
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.940
And then sometimes it'll happen inside the heel and you'll feel it like when

339
00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:48.130
your heel touches the ground, it feels like glass.

340
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.270
<v 0>When you first doing yoga, are you noticing,</v>

341
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.280
were you noticing rather that your foot was like a unstable and that like it's

342
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.550
her, it hurts your feet to try to balance on one foot and do the poses?

343
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:04.820
<v 1>Uh, I did not notice that per se. I did notice that what I noticed it,</v>

344
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.870
the one thing that is I've bet it is the reason I will continue doing hot yoga

345
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.550
or yoga in general, maybe, but probably hot yoga is I like the sweat is, um,

346
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.180
my feet are stronger. Yeah. Like we're a lot stronger. Like I,

347
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.000
I was going to say to Bobby Kelly, I was going to text him and go, Hey man,

348
00:18:20.001 --> 00:18:22.670
you should start going to hot yoga because he has the same problem with plantar

349
00:18:22.671 --> 00:18:25.820
fasciitis that I do and go, it really has strengthened my feet.

350
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.890
And when I run now I have no pain in my.

351
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.070
<v 0>Feet. Yeah. It makes a big difference. Is Bobby still heavy?</v>

352
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.250
<v 1>Oh yeah. He's not. He's going on a diet. I w I was,</v>

353
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.770
I was going to say this girl, we should fat shame him and get him healthy.

354
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.320
<v 3>Yeah. I don't.</v>

355
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.440
<v 0>I'm not that close to them. I can't with them. I can with you guys.</v>

356
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.960
Cause people get,

357
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.480
you got to know who you can with and who's going to take it seriously. Like,

358
00:18:47.481 --> 00:18:50.630
I feel like I can't with Ari anymore. Like he takes it seriously.

359
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.450
<v 1>He just needs to get, he needs over the hump of hot.</v>

360
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.260
<v 0>Yoga. He needs a, he needs to get high. Yeah. He needs a little weed in a hug.</v>

361
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.420
He might need a little weed. We love Yari.
