00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.130
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So.</v>

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.530
<v 1>Unbelievably compelling though,</v>

3
00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:09.320
to consider the idea that somewhere out there,

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.110
there's another civilization that may be even more advanced than us. And this,

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.040
this thought of it is just so attractive. It's it's, it's,

6
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.053
it's incredible.

7
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.400
<v 2>The, the the should be. If.</v>

8
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.420
<v 3>If civilizations are common or even slightly common,</v>

9
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.130
then there should be civilizations ahead of us because there's been so much

10
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.640
time. But when you want to see what that's like, I mean, we've been Pelling.

11
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.070
You imagined the timescales we've been around as a civilization. Let's,

12
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920
let's give it say 40,000 years.

13
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:43.630
I don't know how long our civilization has been around. Let's say that the, the,

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.320
the galaxy is pretty much as old as the universe is 13 billion

15
00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:52.760
years worth of time. So the idea that there are no,

16
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.690
no civilizations arose, you know, a hundred million years ago,

17
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.240
200 million years ago, 1 billion years ago.

18
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.230
And imagine what they be like if they'd survived. I mean, we've been,

19
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:05.330
we've been around, we've had science for,

20
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.890
let's say Cynthia neaten or Copernicus 500 years at most.

21
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.360
We've had a lot what we've done.

22
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.160
We've we've gone beyond the solar system with Voyager. We've walked on the moon.

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.970
Um, we've, we're, we're about to go to Mars. I would think. So.

24
00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:23.480
We're about to begin colonizing our own solar system. Um,

25
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.090
so we've done that in 500 years.

26
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.130
So imagine a million years in the future. So I would,

27
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.830
it's one of the arguments often gave to say,

28
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:36.410
there aren't any civilizations out there in the galaxy.

29
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.030
It's called the Fermi paradox.

30
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.180
Because if you imagine a civilization that's a million years ahead of us,

31
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.360
they should have written their presence across the sky. By now,

32
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.390
they should use to see him. I mean, you'll see us.

33
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.780
If we survive a million years into the future,

34
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.840
actually even a few thousand years into the future,

35
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.570
we will be exploring the galaxy.

36
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.110
We will have spacecraft that are going to with the stars. We will be doing it.

37
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.420
So our signature will become visible.

38
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:06.860
I'm sure if we last into the medium term, would we.

39
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.480
<v 1>To not do that?</v>

40
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.100
Here's my thought on that is uncontacted tribes. Like,

41
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:17.450
do you know about the gentleman who was the missionary who visited north

42
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:21.050
Sentinel island, who was killed by the natives north Sentinel island,

43
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:25.070
which is a really unusual place because they branched off from Africa 60,000

44
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:27.320
years ago. And they've been living on this one, small island,

45
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:30.080
the size of Manhattan, and as well as we know,

46
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:34.520
there's only about 39 of them left somewhere around there. And, um,

47
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.830
we can't, we're not supposed to contact them. Like people are not supposed,

48
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.700
we're supposed to like leave them alone.

49
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.060
And there are rare tribe when they find them in the Amazon,

50
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:45.380
the uncontacted tribes,

51
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.370
our initial instinct is back off back and leave them alone, leave them alone.

52
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.320
Do you think that perhaps a universe,

53
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.370
like if there is a civilization that's a million times more advanced than us

54
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.070
been around here for millions of years of life as opposed quarter million,

55
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.850
why would they, why would they let us know?

56
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.810
Like they look at us dropping bombs on each other and polluting the ocean and

57
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:12.610
sucking all the fish out and putting the clouds into the skies of dirt and

58
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.150
particles. And why would they literally look at these crude monkeys?

59
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:16.984
Look at them.

60
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.850
They're so far beyond where they need to be before they could join the galactic

61
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:22.690
civilization.

62
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.050
<v 2>Or whatever it is true. It's, it's an.</v>

63
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.300
<v 3>Argument that there is an argument as well,</v>

64
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.070
that it technology so advanced would be difficult for us to

65
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:34.530
detect. I mean, we tend to think of, you know,

66
00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:36.810
when you say written across the sky, I suppose it's true.

67
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.940
I'm thinking of star ships and things like star wars, right? Right.

68
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.510
Big energy things that you can see the signature of.

69
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.480
But actually it may be that the civilization just becomes a nano civilization at

70
00:03:47.481 --> 00:03:50.130
tiny little nanobots because that's more efficient.

71
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.890
It's a better way to do things. So it's possible.

72
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.340
I suppose that there are space probes all over the place.

73
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.230
They're so small and it's so efficient and you sell it energy that we just don't

74
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.210
see them. I suppose that is possible.

75
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.010
<v 1>There's a theory that is actually being tossed about</v>

76
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.640
that. These people that have this ancient, well,

77
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.100
they have this memory of childbirth, right?

78
00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:17.490
So all of a sudden you're being born. There's bright lights above you.

79
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.290
There's a man or a woman. Who's the surgeon with a mask that covers their face.

80
00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:26.580
So all you see is their eyes and everything looks bright and it's

81
00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:30.300
terrifying and clinical, and you're on this table and everything's cold.

82
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.760
Most of these alien abduction experiences that people recount,

83
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.970
they take place in some sort of a medical.

84
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.710
<v 4>Facility. Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.340
<v 1>And everything is bright and strange and cold.</v>

86
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.580
And they think that what this is, is there.

87
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.080
They're saying that we had this idea that children don't have memories,

88
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.750
that babies don't have memories. And so they said, well,

89
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:56.520
why wouldn't they have memories? That's ridiculous.

90
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:59.670
Of course they have memories. They have brains, they grab your finger.

91
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:00.600
They looked you in the eye.

92
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.600
They would have a memory of every second that they were born.

93
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.070
And it's probably one of the most profound and disturbing memories.

94
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:12.300
Because before that, everything is incredibly peaceful inside the mother's womb.

95
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.480
<v 4>You're just like taken out, pulled out.</v>

96
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.140
<v 1>And then there's this bright light above. You never experienced any light.</v>

97
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.970
So every, and your visual perception, your field of view is all distorted,

98
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:26.880
right? This is the first time you're using your eyes. That's why people are.

99
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.330
So it's like.

100
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.040
<v 4>Tapping into this memory, this early memory. That's interesting. This is.</v>

101
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.200
<v 1>A theory. It makes sense to me because of you think that makes more.</v>

102
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.050
<v 4>Sense than the abduction. So.</v>

103
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.900
<v 1>Well, it does because people don't really go anywhere. See,</v>

104
00:05:39.901 --> 00:05:43.830
the thing about the abduction thing is they've put like cameras in people's

105
00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:48.180
rooms and, uh, and they say they have these alien abduction experiences,

106
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.230
but they don't go anywhere.

107
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.070
So what they're doing is they're dreaming and which is mindless.

108
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.860
<v 4>It's amazing. And it's so powerful. And we know so little still. Yeah.</v>

109
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.700
<v 1>So also like these, all these, I mean, it's, it's kind of duh,</v>

110
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.410
because they all happen while you're sleeping 90 plus percent,

111
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.550
they tend to be medical. Yeah. It's very medical in nature. Right.

112
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:15.020
You're being examined. And then there's also going back to childbirth.

113
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.850
There's also a lot of people that have these experiences that they are being

114
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:24.770
told that either they're taking their baby away from them

115
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:28.370
or they're studying their baby or that they had a baby inside of them that they

116
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:31.490
didn't know about and that the aliens have put it there and they're.

117
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.020
<v 4>Taking it out. Right. Yeah. I mean, even goes back to the Virgin birth. Right.</v>

118
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.850
I mean, it's all very weird.

119
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.100
<v 1>But this, uh, this memory that people have from childhood is, uh,</v>

120
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.780
most likely, uh, you know, probably a pretty intense.

121
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.880
<v 4>Powerful memory. That's always there. Yeah. And if your first memory, yeah.</v>

122
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:56.260
Some people can tap into it and some people can't. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

123
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.580
Mainline.

124
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.600
<v 5>Historical books about [inaudible] castles, where they go,</v>

125
00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:04.660
the aliens want blood. So they'd kill like 20 kids and everything today.

126
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.010
It leaves with like, she'll come in and heal.

127
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.270
The blood brings them in like sharks and then they want them technology.

128
00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:11.260
They go, this is how it works.

129
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.210
She built the atomic weapons this way you build it.

130
00:07:13.211 --> 00:07:15.400
And they would like show them bombers. And like, the aliens are like,

131
00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:18.080
telepathic. I don't even believe this. This is what the Nazis believe. And the,

132
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:21.010
and the aliens with mind-meld and give them the technology. They're bad aliens.

133
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.340
So are you surprised the Nazis were influenced by demons?

134
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.270
<v 1>No. If demons are real, I definitely think they'd be on the side of the Nazis.</v>

135
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.020
Yeah.

136
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.230
<v 5>But, but Joe, what I'm telling you is there'll be no immediate,</v>

137
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.400
no media is going to attack this. I'm giving you want to know where read.

138
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.870
<v 1>It. Where can I read that? Those statements that they were in contact? Well.</v>

139
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.380
<v 5>Obviously your pockets, real society.</v>

140
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.270
[inaudible] right up there with them. Like, dude, come on for three hours,

141
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.290
evacuee fly here with a report the day before I'll send it all to you with

142
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:57.250
mainline books.

143
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.060
Also I'll mail the books with the tabs in them and I'll mail documents. Okay.

144
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.400
<v 1>Cool. Yeah. I'd love I, listen.</v>

145
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.980
I think that they absolutely were obsessed with your calls.

146
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.940
That's been pretty well-documented they made flying saucers and I think, yeah.

147
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.580
<v 6>Did you talk about that alien craft that came into her? What happened?</v>

148
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.780
We tend to our galaxy. It did well with the Hawaiian name. Oh, so it's over.

149
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.840
You didn't hear about that one. The one that looks like a joint. Yeah.

150
00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:27.310
It looks or a big piece of poo. That's just a real big duty copter.

151
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.360
It's just a weird rock.

152
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.310
<v 1>I think now they.</v>

153
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.090
<v 6>Said that, uh,</v>

154
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.200
some like legit people said that it changed speed and went in different

155
00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:37.600
directions. People, legit people.

156
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.370
<v 1>Scientists. Oh, them guys.</v>

157
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.660
<v 6>Said that it was, uh, it could be something. Hmm. Could be,</v>

158
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.840
what is Nilda grassy say about.

159
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.770
<v 1>It. This is not talking right now. Okay. Yeah.</v>

160
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.440
He's in a little bit of a kerfuffle kerfuffle. What's his Jamie. Yeah.

161
00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.360
Harvard scientists say aliens may explain bizarre interstellar object.

162
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.330
Yeah. I saw that. And then I saw someone refuting.

163
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:08.310
<v 5>Scientists. Harvard. Nobody wants to believe more than me bro. Come on,</v>

164
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.540
Joe. It's real.

165
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.780
<v 1>Well, if I was going to mask my spaceship to fly through the galaxy,</v>

166
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:16.290
I would definitely make it look like a big rock, like a big asteroid. Right?

167
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.360
Why wouldn't you driving through space may, maybe with, they were like, look,

168
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:26.160
if we just make this thing drive by them and don't change speeds.

169
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.210
They'll have no idea. I just think there'll be sight that we miss them. Okay.

170
00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:34.430
A good call. Good call. Someone just hits the gas. I'm tired. Tired.

171
00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:36.800
I don't want it taking too long.

172
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.540
<v 7>What? You just died.</v>

173
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.760
<v 5>Well, you got it. The cops are behind the Dave. God it, Dave.</v>

174
00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:46.490
You're not supposed to just take off 65. You.

175
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.820
<v 0>Let's start throwing this weed out the window.</v>

176
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.600
Why would it be so hard to believe a space, rock traveling.

177
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.140
<v 1>That would be the move, right? I mean, if they're so advanced,</v>

178
00:09:57.141 --> 00:10:00.020
they can travel through galaxies. They can make this look like anything.

179
00:10:00.021 --> 00:10:04.220
They want it to, why wouldn't you doll it up? Sounds good. Doesn't it? God.

180
00:10:04.221 --> 00:10:06.290
I want to believe so hard.

181
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.440
<v 8>Well, I, uh, I hope you do because there's going to be,</v>

182
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.570
there's going to be a lot of stuff. I know what you've.

183
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.440
<v 1>Seen though. So you've seen this piece of metal. What else have you seen? I've.</v>

184
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.270
<v 8>Seen, uh, many, many documents on the studies of these things.</v>

185
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.590
And um,

186
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:26.630
I've seen a lot of the science associated with what the

187
00:10:26.631 --> 00:10:29.390
technology is and what it does. Like, uh,

188
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.480
I could show you if I fold up pieces of paper and stuff,

189
00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:37.160
what's going on with it. But basically, uh, you know, these craft,

190
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.670
you know, when you, when you try, they travel in a straight line,

191
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.320
but they're folding space, time.

192
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.790
<v 1>In event horizon,</v>

193
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.610
where they explain it by folding a piece of paper and punching a pencil through

194
00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:47.510
it. Do you ever see that movie?

195
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.940
<v 8>But it's more like, um, you know, here I can draw it for you here.</v>

196
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.260
Not that this is a, it's kinda like when you have two points,

197
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.550
um, you know, we're used to traveling in a direction like that.

198
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.050
And so when we look up, we see a plane that goes straight, right? But these,

199
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.630
these UFO's, uh,

200
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.540
fold space time like this.

201
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.950
And so it looks like to them, they're going in a straight line.

202
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.970
So if you're in the ship, you see that. But if you're on the ground,

203
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.830
you see that. That's why you see them blink off. And on a lot of those videos,

204
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.900
they're on the ch it looks like they're jumping.

205
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.410
<v 5>It's just because of this. So holding space, some.</v>

206
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.630
<v 1>Way of interfacing with space itself,</v>

207
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.900
that's very different than our idea of traveling in the linear way.

208
00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:38.210
From point a to point B the fabric.

209
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.170
<v 8>They call it the fabric of space-time because it's like a fabric it's malleable.</v>

210
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.160
Now let me ask.

211
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.410
<v 1>You this. How often into a conversation,</v>

212
00:11:45.411 --> 00:11:48.920
do people look at you and think you are crazy when you start talking about this

213
00:11:48.921 --> 00:11:50.840
and how long is the time? All the time. Right.

214
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.990
But do you ever get to the point where.

215
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.810
<v 8>Like, I don't want to talk about no, because it's it's you,</v>

216
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.190
I always tell me you don't know what I know, you know? And there's a lot. I, no,

217
00:11:59.191 --> 00:11:59.620
no. I mean.

218
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.940
<v 1>Like, do you ever get to the point where you're like,</v>

219
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:03.400
I can't do this anymore now. People think I'm crazy.

220
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.300
<v 8>No, because I'm involved on the most important I've ever been in my life.</v>

221
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.580
<v 1>So you think this is like the most important thing that you've ever done.</v>

222
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.860
<v 8>Yeah. Like I, I have meetings with senators coming up like, oh what Senator,</v>

223
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.100
I can't tell you, Dan was all this. I can tell you stuff. I know this.

224
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:19.300
This is some trench.

225
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.980
<v 1>When is all this going to come out? Like,</v>

226
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:25.120
it seems like this is like a animate eminent, rather disclosure type.

227
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.140
Watch what my company does. That's what I'll say. Well, that's awesome. Yeah.

228
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.250
I love when someone is like that, you know,

229
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.230
like your friend that hasn't talked for 22 years, I love. Yeah.

230
00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:38.820
You don't hear about that. No.

231
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.320
<v 6>Or someone that'll stop being in van Halen to go with swords.</v>

232
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:49.080
<v 5>Um, yeah. Yeah. It goes with analysts. Do you think they're really bringing.</v>

233
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.330
<v 1>Him to the Pentagon and like that? I.</v>

234
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.140
<v 9>Don't know. Cause he said that like I have no clue. And.</v>

235
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.540
<v 6>I had watched a little bit of your podcast where you were like.</v>

236
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:03.360
<v 5>I, you sent me a text message. I'm like, you know,</v>

237
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.020
but I feel.

238
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.400
<v 6>Like he's made himself readily available to do that.</v>

239
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.720
You know? Like, I don't know. It's a it's I,

240
00:13:12.721 --> 00:13:16.200
I sit and scratch my head and go, I don't know either. I just,

241
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.570
he's such a talented, talented dude too, man. He's like such a good song writer.

242
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:22.830
Yeah.

243
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.610
<v 1>He, well, he certainly is certainly a very talented guy.</v>

244
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.410
It's just so interesting that that's his main point of focus. Yeah.

245
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.830
I would think that if, if aliens were real, Trump would have told us.

246
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.300
I really do believe that that guy is, he's such a loose cannon.

247
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.390
He became the president. Like maybe they hid it from him.

248
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.860
<v 6>Chaotic. His is right now. It would somehow I don't know something would slip,</v>

249
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.330
you know? Yeah.

250
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.020
<v 1>I would think that if they told him, if they brought him a dosage,</v>

251
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.580
there's two things I would want to know who killed JFK. Those are two things.

252
00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:56.730
I'd want to know if I became the president and are aliens real. What do you got?

253
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.240
What do you got? I go to the top. Generals. I bet. Look,

254
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.570
I'm going to defer to you guys. I'm not a military expert. Okay.

255
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.190
I don't want war, but I want you guys to have support. I got full respect.

256
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.970
Tell me about the alien. What he got was this Trump orders,

257
00:14:11.971 --> 00:14:15.330
establishment of space force. He did that. That's right. The space force.

258
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.490
But that's because there's,

259
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.630
that's actually a military strategy because they're concerned that as technology

260
00:14:21.631 --> 00:14:25.920
improves, Russians are going to be in space and we're going to be in space or,

261
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.350
or fight off the aliens, right? Like will Smith type. Yeah.

262
00:14:31.351 --> 00:14:34.550
Look at him. Yeah. Mike Pence is behind him going, Jesus is going to say,

263
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.610
yeah, I don't know, man. But if I became president and I never will,

264
00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:42.444
but if I did,

265
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.990
those are the two things that I'd want to know who killed JFK and where the

266
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.100
aliens, like I got off from the comedy store. I'd like to,

267
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.650
and then I watched some goofy.

268
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.420
I've been on this UFO documentary kick watching UFO. Documentaries. Yeah.

269
00:14:56.421 --> 00:14:59.560
I told you it was David. I'd seen it. Yeah. We were.

270
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.550
<v 4>Talking about that. What were you,</v>

271
00:15:00.551 --> 00:15:03.640
did you have something specific that you would saw recently? The documentary.

272
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.370
<v 1>One of them is, uh, area 51,</v>

273
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.870
Bob Lasar and alien area 51 and flying saucers. It's uh, some,

274
00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:16.000
a documentary on this guy who claimed that he worked on these alien

275
00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:20.230
ships in area 51 in the 1980s and Hills,

276
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.550
as time's gone on Mo more of the things that he said have proven to actually be

277
00:15:24.551 --> 00:15:28.570
true, including an element that he talked about.

278
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.570
Element one 15. I think it was called organism from outer space. No, no, no.

279
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.850
An element like a man created element, you know, at this carbon, well,

280
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.530
there's an element that they created that he talked about way before it was ever

281
00:15:41.531 --> 00:15:45.610
publicized. And he talked about this thing and then it turned out to be true.

282
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.120
He talked about these, um, there's these, um, uh,

283
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.040
hand monitors that you would put your hand on this thing. And these lines,

284
00:15:54.041 --> 00:15:58.810
these metal lines would detect the distances in the bones of your

285
00:15:58.811 --> 00:16:01.750
fingers, the exact distances, and everyone is different.

286
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.680
It's like a signature thing. And that they could find out if it was you or not,

287
00:16:05.681 --> 00:16:08.470
you, it was trying to go through. So the way they would scan people,

288
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.710
the Bioscan would literally measure the bones and their fingers.

289
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.770
And people said that was horseshit. He talked about this in the 1980s.

290
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.710
People said it was horseshit, but then later on turned out, no,

291
00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:22.480
they did have that. And Los Alamos, they did have that in, in area 51.

292
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.890
And that this technology was very, very, uh,

293
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.760
advanced, very, not just very advanced, but very not.

294
00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.460
It was not well known at all. Like very few people did.

295
00:16:33.461 --> 00:16:35.140
And this guy who was creative with this documentary,

296
00:16:35.141 --> 00:16:38.530
it was very difficult for them to get photos of this hand scanner.

297
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.030
But this hand scanner did exist and existed. Exactly. As this guy described.

298
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.990
<v 4>It eighties. I mean, that's super progressive for that time. Even for now.</v>

299
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.290
<v 1>Did approve his top secret clearance to get to this place.</v>

300
00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:53.890
They know that he actually worked there. There's people that, um,

301
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.640
worked in the same Los Alamos lab with him.

302
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.400
They tried to say he never worked there, but his name's on the manifest.

303
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.600
It's very strange. It's like,

304
00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:05.800
they've tried to erase parts of this guy's past because he, um,

305
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.860
he filmed a bunch of their crafts as they were flying around.

306
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.160
Like he knew what days, this is the thing, that thing right there,

307
00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:15.250
you put your hand on that and it actually measures the distance of your,

308
00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.310
the size and length of your bones.

309
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:21.130
<v 4>That looks like something that's inside of an escape room in LA.</v>

310
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:29.350
<v 1>I went into this documentary skeptical. You should. Yeah, but I am.</v>

311
00:17:29.351 --> 00:17:33.820
I'm so done with all those things. But listen to this guy, talk for a while.

312
00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:36.550
After a while, I was like, what if he's telling the truth?

313
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.010
Like what if he is actually telling the truth?

314
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.510
Because if he's actually telling the truth,

315
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.980
there is some part of the government that had access,

316
00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:49.980
at least in the 1980s to alien technology. You believe in UFOs.

317
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.900
Oh yeah. Oh my God. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. I believe in there's other,

318
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.850
other life forms out there, but I don't, I don't think there coming here,

319
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.770
they might be, here's the thing they might. Well, why not think it, but here's,

320
00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.240
here's one thing I do believe most people are full of when it comes to like most

321
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.220
of their stories. Like it's,

322
00:18:10.221 --> 00:18:15.110
it's hard to find a person that could just tell you what happened based on

323
00:18:15.111 --> 00:18:16.160
what they really remember.

324
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.410
People want to jazz things up and they want to add salt and pepper. Yeah.

325
00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.770
They just sex with me. They don't,

326
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.660
they don't necessarily tell you the truth that tell you what they think is going

327
00:18:29.661 --> 00:18:33.980
to be an engaging story. That kind of represents a truth. Maybe,

328
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.100
especially when it's a weird thing. Like you saw something in the sky.

329
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.010
What did you really see? How long did you look at it?

330
00:18:40.011 --> 00:18:43.100
For how many seconds was it? Well, I mean,

331
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.900
here's the problem I have with UFO's. I believe there are UFO's,

332
00:18:47.901 --> 00:18:50.390
but I don't think they're coming here. Would you say that?

333
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.060
Because that means they're tech, first of all, if they're coming here,

334
00:18:53.061 --> 00:18:56.630
that means their technology is far way more advanced than ours, right?

335
00:18:56.631 --> 00:18:58.880
So why would they care? If people saw them,

336
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.500
they would show up if I was an alien and I was that far ahead of us,

337
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.770
I would lay in that right in the middle of time square and be like,

338
00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:10.280
what we are here. Why would you do that? But why wouldn't I,

339
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.300
why am I getting in fields where nobody can see us?

340
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.990
Are you aware of how we treat uncontacted tribes?

341
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.270
Yes. To a point, but to a point.

342
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.140
But what I'm saying is if you're that far advanced,

343
00:19:24.141 --> 00:19:27.410
they know if they're coming here, they know they're,

344
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.150
they're way smarter than us because they've traveled here and we don't even know

345
00:19:32.151 --> 00:19:36.020
other from far distances. We can't even imagine. And they're here.

346
00:19:36.021 --> 00:19:37.850
They don't have to hide. It's just,

347
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.680
you think they do it because they have to hide?

348
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.730
Or do you think maybe they do it because we can't handle it because we can't

349
00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:46.250
handle it. Why would they care if we could handle it or not?

350
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.330
Because here's the problem.

351
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:52.550
Whenever any civilization has ever encountered a civilization

352
00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:54.680
far superior to them,

353
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.150
the results have always been catastrophic every single time.

354
00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.510
Every time Europeans have invaded north America,

355
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.540
every time the Spanish visited the Mexicans,

356
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.200
every time that this has happened, it's been a disaster.

357
00:20:09.201 --> 00:20:10.580
And this is human beings.

358
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.940
If there was something that came down here from another planet,

359
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.320
it was so unbelievably sophisticated that it could travel through vast distances

360
00:20:18.321 --> 00:20:20.690
in space and had insurmountable,

361
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:25.400
impossible technology that we would look to it for all of our

362
00:20:25.401 --> 00:20:27.740
answers, it would become our new daddy.

363
00:20:27.741 --> 00:20:29.870
It would completely disrupt all of our governments.

364
00:20:29.871 --> 00:20:31.340
It would disrupt all of our religions.

365
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.960
It would disrupt every single belief system we have and people would fall apart.

366
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.890
They wouldn't know what to do psychologically. It would be devastating. Look,

367
00:20:39.891 --> 00:20:42.650
I'm not a doctor. I'm not a psychologist,

368
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:46.820
but I know most people would not be able to handle it. I understand that,

369
00:20:46.821 --> 00:20:50.050
but why would they care? Because that's my whole point, because they care about,

370
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.050
cause it would be affecting our culture. It wouldn't care,

371
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.900
but why wouldn't they care? Well, why would they care? We care about animals,

372
00:20:55.901 --> 00:20:58.360
bro. There's a reason why we have wildlife protection agencies.

373
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.140
We have that because we care about animals and animals don't even know where a

374
00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:05.590
thing. Okay? If you're a deer living in the forest, you're two years old,

375
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:08.260
you might not have ever even seen a purse. You don't even know what the we are,

376
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.180
but we're trying to keep those deer alive.

377
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:13.060
We spend billions of dollars every year, protecting them.

378
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.430
We do that because we care about wildlife.

379
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:20.110
If we cared about a rare monkey that we found in Indonesia,

380
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.430
for some strange monkey,

381
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:24.880
we would do whatever we could to make sure that that monkeys populations

382
00:21:24.881 --> 00:21:27.670
thrived. If there was a way to help them. I mean,

383
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:30.430
that's one of the reasons why zoos exist. They take rare animals.

384
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.840
They try to breed them in captivity. And but we're also sharing the same earth.

385
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.760
What would they, maybe they look at the universe that way.

386
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.320
And maybe they look at nuclear civilizations like our civilization. I mean,

387
00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:45.940
our civilization is a very dangerous one because we're a bunch of semi

388
00:21:45.941 --> 00:21:49.750
hairless monkeys with nuclear weapons. I mean, we're nuts, bro.

389
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.220
We're obsessed with sex with Jack off to our phones where we're taking pills to

390
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:56.320
keep our Dick hard. We're all on speed.

391
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.870
We all have AB these are we're at. And we lie. We lie about.

392
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.260
We lie about things that people did do us. We pretend,

393
00:22:05.261 --> 00:22:09.250
people think did worse things. We pretend that we didn't do things to people.

394
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.690
We lie about stealing. We lie about money. We lie about all kinds of things.

395
00:22:13.691 --> 00:22:14.820
I mean, people are. So.

396
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.830
<v 5>You're thinking, you're thinking aliens are thinking.</v>

397
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.500
<v 1>About all that before they come down. Of course they would.</v>

398
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.150
When you discuss the cosmos,

399
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.470
maybe the single most intriguing possibility to us as human beings

400
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.300
is what other intelligent life, if any,

401
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.460
is out there. And how interesting is that to you?

402
00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.290
Because you spend so much time studying the fundamental particles of the

403
00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:39.250
universe itself.

404
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:44.320
How interested are you in the possibility of other intelligent life

405
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:44.980
forms?

406
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.780
Or have you just like put that out into the it's just so

407
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.700
ridiculously unlikely or so far away from us that we're probably never going to

408
00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:55.440
make contact.

409
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.370
<v 10>Well, you see, it's not.</v>

410
00:22:56.371 --> 00:23:01.350
So there's the SETI program we're looking at to see where they can

411
00:23:01.351 --> 00:23:03.540
see signals from distance civilizations.

412
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.700
The problem there from my perspective is that although they might be out there,

413
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.050
they've got to have had a real head start on us before you would see them.

414
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.830
They might've done. So, but then I don't know.

415
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:21.720
You see actually via goes to John who's my Armenian colleague and

416
00:23:21.721 --> 00:23:26.400
who looked also for these ring shaped things and looked at them in a different

417
00:23:26.401 --> 00:23:30.870
way from the Polish people. But, um, we seem to have seen something there,

418
00:23:30.871 --> 00:23:35.520
but we wrote a paper in which we speculated on

419
00:23:35.521 --> 00:23:39.330
beings from the previous Ian communicating with us.

420
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.650
And the advantage there is that you're looking at the really advanced

421
00:23:43.651 --> 00:23:47.000
civilizations fast billions.

422
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.100
<v 1>Of years ago that they,</v>

423
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:54.140
their universe disappeared and then had to come

424
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:58.610
back to a big bank status come through and somehow or another,

425
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.110
those signals. Right.

426
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:04.000
<v 10>It's conceivable it. I agree. It's pretty far-fetched but you know,</v>

427
00:24:04.001 --> 00:24:04.834
who knows what.

428
00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:10.750
<v 1>How many billions of years are you talking about? Like the big bang, 14 billion.</v>

429
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:15.400
<v 10>Yes. But you see that's way where at the beginning,</v>

430
00:24:15.401 --> 00:24:18.490
in a sense, or it's three quarters of the way through, in another sense,

431
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.300
it depends on how you draw the pictures, right? In the sense of

432
00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.890
interesting this or in the conformal picture,

433
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.900
we are already three quarters.

434
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.580
<v 1>Of the way through so 14 billion to now. So we have content.</v>

435
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.940
<v 10>Is yours. You see the trouble is it's this, the cheat sheet,</v>

436
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.430
the year count it's as much as you like, it depends on, on,

437
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.313
on something else.

438
00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:48.040
The mass has to fade out and how you measure the time it becomes problematic.

439
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.060
And it's either infinity, you see which isn't much use,

440
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.410
or you might have a different definitions of time,

441
00:24:56.411 --> 00:24:59.230
which depending on what particle you're using as your clocks and things like

442
00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:00.064
that. So.

443
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.720
<v 1>Are you essentially saying that it's entirely possible that we are the furthest</v>

444
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.920
in terms of our technological achievement and our understanding of the universe

445
00:25:08.921 --> 00:25:11.830
itself? It's possible that we're at the front of the line though.

446
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.710
There might be some other intelligent life forms in the universe,

447
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.570
but they might be behind us.

448
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.860
<v 10>Well, there would have been, I'm not saying they got through you say, well,</v>

449
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.960
maybe they have techniques for getting through, but that's,

450
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.840
that's a bit harder to imagine, but, um,

451
00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.180
maybe information from them to get through. And.

452
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.610
<v 1>Maybe you mean from the previous EMS? Yes. Oh,</v>

453
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.280
they might've got through like somehow or another survived.

454
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.970
<v 10>Yeah. But it would have to be in the form of photons or something.</v>

455
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.440
Yeah know you could, it's not, I'm talking about ridiculous speculate. Sure.

456
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.760
Coding.

457
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.830
<v 1>Information and to photons. Yes.</v>

458
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:46.690
<v 10>Yes. Wow. It's conceivable.</v>

459
00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.050
I don't want to say that I see it happening or anything,

460
00:25:50.051 --> 00:25:54.580
but it's not out of the question that they could develop some technology,

461
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.780
which would get information, which might be them in some sense,

462
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.710
uh, across in the form of photons. But you're.

463
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.220
<v 1>Not optimistic about current intelligent life, somewhere in the universe.</v>

464
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:11.590
<v 10>Not too optimistic, just because, um,</v>

465
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.820
well maybe it took us a long time to get going because the dinosaurs were there

466
00:26:15.821 --> 00:26:19.480
for a while and somebody might've got in there earlier and they're different

467
00:26:19.481 --> 00:26:23.680
planets and they could've got there quite ahead of us. It's it's conceivable.

468
00:26:23.681 --> 00:26:28.420
I'm not gonna rule it out. I just not terribly optimistic about it. No,

469
00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:31.180
