00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.240
<v 2>And then so, uh, but my friend was like, yo, how you gonna start doing standup?</v>

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.120
I was like, I don't know, man,

4
00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:10.240
maybe I'll start doing like some clown stuff or something like that. I was like,

5
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.960
maybe like 15. I was like,

6
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:14.800
maybe I'll start doing like some clown stuff or something. Oh yeah.

7
00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:18.600
And I heard about like a clown school in San Francisco and I was like, oh yeah,

8
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.190
maybe I'll do that. And happened. And the friend was like,

9
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.350
don't you just go to like an open mic or something like that? And I was like,

10
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:27.310
oh, is that how you get started? And I was like, all right,

11
00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:31.670
then maybe I'll do that. But like fast forward, I had a lot of time on my hands,

12
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.390
uh, back in 2018, I wasn't doing. And I was at the like, man, I was like,

13
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.383
you should take a class.

14
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.470
<v 0>I was like, you already in the wave, you already does like,</v>

15
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:42.940
just go take a class, whatever. I took a clown class and uh,

16
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.300
it's called the clown school. I'm like on their website and.

17
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.340
I'm like the only I'm like the only black people, like on their website and.

18
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.980
And uh, I just started doing it in 2018 and um, it,

19
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.020
you know, what's so fun about that is that like,

20
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.460
if you didn't know what made you funny as a person or whatever, like the,

21
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.530
they help you find like your inner clown, you know, you know what I'm saying?

22
00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.850
Everybody has an inner clown and stuff like that, that what's first.

23
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.730
<v 1>Day of clown school. Like, so.</v>

24
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.210
<v 0>So I, I remember, I remember this, uh, I remember this assignment, first of all,</v>

25
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.450
I walked in there with some doc Martins on, right. I, I, they were,

26
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.810
they were maroon doc Martins. They looked like a, um,

27
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.410
they looked like clown shoes,

28
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.080
but they were maroon doc Martins and the clown teachers that they're like, Hey,

29
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.120
take those off. And I was like, why? He was like, just take 'em off.

30
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.600
And then it dawned on me. I was like, oh, I was probably disrespecting clown.

31
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.000
Cuz he probably thought that that's what I thought a clown was,

32
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.840
whatever people who wear shoes like this or because doc Martins do kind of look

33
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:44.750
like, you know, clown shoes, if you whatever. And then so, uh, did you explain?

34
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.190
No, but I, I, I, I dawned me. I was like, Hmm, that's probably.

35
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.070
<v 1>Why you really think, you thought it was disrespectful.</v>

36
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.470
<v 0>To clown to, to the whole art of clown or whatever. He was like, oh,</v>

37
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:58.470
you think clowns just wear big shoes and get outta small cars.

38
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.540
<v 1>That'd be funny. I was be a funny sketch dude, a guy who teaches clown asses,</v>

39
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:04.820
but he's like really sensitive.

40
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.060
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; about the art of being a clown and he's a purist,

41
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.420
he's a clown purist. Yeah. What do you got a rubber nose on? Get that nose off.

42
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.520
So.

43
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.660
<v 0>It is so funny, right? It's like, um, um,</v>

44
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.500
I remember the first assignment though was uh, Hey,

45
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.340
come through this door 10 funny ways.

46
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.850
&lt;affirmative&gt; and I was like, I was like, oh, that sounds funny. So I, I mean,

47
00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:29.450
so that sounds fun. So I would just come in,

48
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:31.210
I would do like a physical act or whatever,

49
00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:34.930
but I would do it 10 funny ways I would come in as a robot and I would come in

50
00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:36.250
as a, did you ever come through.

51
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.890
<v 1>Naked? Huh? No. You should. You should finished.</v>

52
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.290
<v 0>You should take that glass and then you should do that.</v>

53
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.480
<v 1>What up? No. Wow.</v>

54
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.480
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; but, but you know what? They don't limit like that though.</v>

55
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:50.960
Like if you wanted to do some like that because they want you to be free.

56
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.000
<v 1>Oh &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

57
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.320
<v 0>Got it. Yeah. So I remember,</v>

58
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.840
I remember that assignment come through this door 10 funny ways.

59
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.640
What did you do? Um, so I came in,

60
00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:04.120
like I came in like crawling and like that.

61
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.440
And then I came in like retarded and like that. I came in,

62
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.880
I came in spinning like this or whatever. And I remember I like hopped backward,

63
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.840
like a kangaroo and like that. And it was a &lt;laugh&gt; it was a bunch of.

64
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.310
<v 1>Like that. What did other people in the, what were they like?</v>

65
00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:20.750
What were the other people in the class? Like.

66
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.790
<v 0>Some in there were good. Like really? Cause the,</v>

67
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.670
because the thing about clown is like, is that they, they say like the,

68
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.070
the wrong answers are what's funny. So, you know, like if you come in,

69
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.850
if you come in,

70
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.590
if you come in or whatever and you accidentally trip and like that,

71
00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.830
like it was a accident. Yeah. That's what the clown,

72
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.260
as the clowns are the mistakes and stuff like that. And you know,

73
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:45.620
the red nose is actually, uh,

74
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.580
is actually just puts you in the spirit of being a clown and being silly. But.

75
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.060
<v 1>But the maroon doc Martins don't exactly.</v>

76
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.643
<v 0>Exactly.</v>

77
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.480
<v 1>You know what? That's like,</v>

78
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.340
that's like a bad standup coach giving you advice on standup mm-hmm
