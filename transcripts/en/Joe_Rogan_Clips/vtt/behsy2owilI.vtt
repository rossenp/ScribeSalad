00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 1>Experience. People are using these debates,</v>

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.800
knowing that they're going to get these sound bites and knowing that, and,

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.480
and you could see some of them work like yours with Kamel Harris,

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.560
and then some of 'em don't like when she was attacking Elizabeth Warren for not

6
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.720
wanting Trump to get kicked off of Twitter, &lt;laugh&gt; like,

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.350
do you read his Twitter? It's fantastic. Keep him on.

8
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.150
That's the best way we understand who he really is. Yeah. I mean,

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.990
you could get some of that outta speeches,

10
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.070
but when he posts a picture of Greenland with a giant Trump tower in it and

11
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:34.550
says, I promise not to do this. Listen, if you're on team America,

12
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.830
you want that guy to keep tweeting &lt;laugh&gt;. Cause that was, you know,

13
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:40.150
what's going on. It's hilarious too. Well.

14
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.780
<v 2>You, you called it a while ago. When you, when you say, Hey, no one,</v>

15
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.500
there's no comedians that have run that have that skill, which Trump has of yes.

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.220
Cracking jokes, making fun of people,

17
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.580
letting the other jokes roll off of his back.

18
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:54.780
Cuz he doesn't care what people say about him. Basically.

19
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:58.260
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and no one's really had to contend with that until now.

20
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.420
<v 1>Yeah. It's really interesting. Like no one knows how to handle it.</v>

21
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.890
It's really fun. I mean, when you watch the original Republican debates,

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.730
when he was running for president and he starts attacking these guys,

23
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.170
you see them &lt;laugh&gt; Marvin Walker will all the nicknames, you see lock up,

24
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.210
you know, crazy Ted, like he's going after me. He's ruining my thing.

25
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.210
It's just, it's it's a, it's a nutty place to, to watch. What was it?

26
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.360
Do you get to hang out with cammal Harris backstage? No.

27
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.440
<v 0>No. I mean there's there a way when everybody, no, there's there's like a, a,</v>

28
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:31.480
just like a little holding area kind of space,

29
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.920
like a lot smaller than this room, so, and.

30
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.160
<v 1>Oh, you're all hanging out in there together. Um, during.</v>

31
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.760
<v 0>The commercial breaks. Yeah. But you say anything to you, do.</v>

32
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.593
<v 2>You have eye contact with her?</v>

33
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.470
<v 0>No. Uh, maybe every now and then, but um, I,</v>

34
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.230
I honestly like &lt;laugh&gt; Yeah. I, I I'm,

35
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.830
I'm probably not on the top of her friend list.

36
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.070
<v 1>Yeah, you Sanged battleship and.</v>

37
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.070
<v 2>Then, I mean, Hillary Clinton. Yeah. I was in, well,</v>

38
00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:00.870
how what's up with that war &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Cause again, you know,

39
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:02.270
she's the matriarch of the,

40
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:07.140
of the Clinton and family and there she is the hero to many people of

41
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.700
the democratic party and you two are scrapping

42
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.540
&lt;laugh&gt; it's. Did that start when you did that start you, did you,

43
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.060
you supported Bernie in 2016. Is that where it started?

44
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.740
<v 0>Yeah. Okay. That and that was something, um, yeah, back in, in 2016,</v>

45
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.210
I was the vice chair of the democratic national committee. Um,

46
00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:29.970
therefore as an officer of the DNC had to remain neutral in the presidential

47
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.690
election, which was my plan to do so. Um,

48
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.730
I really made the decision to resign from that seat so that I could endorse

49
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:41.850
Bernie Sanders largely be, or actually largely because of his, um,

50
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:44.560
difference with Hillary Clinton and foreign policy, you know,

51
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:49.160
Hillary Clinton had, uh, you know, very much of an interventionist in,

52
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.440
in my opinion, um, kind of the,

53
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.080
the war Hawk regime change war policy that she had shown throughout her time,

54
00:02:56.081 --> 00:02:59.400
both in the administration, as well as, as us Senator and Bernie Sanders,

55
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.320
you know, lean the other way. He's, he's more of a non-iintervenionist.

56
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.600
And I saw that in the, those debates at that time,

57
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.600
the conversations that were the media was not bringing up this difference

58
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.080
between the two of them.

59
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.760
So the voters could make an informed choice of who they want their commanderin

60
00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:17.840
chief to be, which to me, just as, you know, as a soldier, as a veteran,

61
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.510
as mayor, I'm like, how can you not be putting this issue at the forefront?

62
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.030
So I resigned from that position,

63
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.630
endorsed Bernie Sanders started going out and just talking about and raising

64
00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:29.710
these issues, uh, on the campaign trail.

65
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.710
But I remember one of the first interviews that I did on MSNBC, the,

66
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.350
the host of the show saying, uh,

67
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.300
aren't you afraid of what the Clintons will do to,

68
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:44.180
you said this on live television &lt;laugh&gt; and uh.

69
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.780
<v 1>Scary family.</v>

70
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.860
<v 0>Oh man. You know, my, my answer was no, obviously, but it was amaz it, it was,</v>

71
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.820
it was, um, interesting to see the reaction like the, the days after,

72
00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:57.140
when I first went back to DC,

73
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.090
after I made that announcement of endorsement and friends of mine, you know,

74
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:03.370
politicians in Washington, they were like, man,

75
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.850
T like go with God, sister &lt;laugh&gt;.

76
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.010
<v 1>It's a different, it's a different animal. See,</v>

77
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:13.690
like if you get into some sort of verbal altercation with Joe Biden,

78
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:18.450
there's no concern for your life. &lt;laugh&gt; like, I'm not saying it's real or not.

79
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.440
Yeah. But, but the rumor is always, there's a thing called Biden body.

80
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.360
<v 0>Body count. Yeah. Joe Biden. I that''s.</v>

81
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.440
<v 1>Real, I don't think it is Israels. Probably some of it,</v>

82
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.440
most of it let's say it's all made up. &lt;laugh&gt; the fact that that's out there,

83
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:34.000
that the thought is out there, that they will whack you. Well.

84
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.200
<v 0>There's there's I mean, the people who are saying, Hey, look, you know,</v>

85
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:39.080
there are lists that are kept and your political career will be over.

86
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.110
That was really the message that I got from,

87
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.270
from people who've been around the block a few times.

88
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.910
And I think the most recent thing that, um,

89
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.550
that came up with what Hillary Clinton said about me is, is not,

90
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.870
it's not a, a spat between two people. It really just shows the,

91
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.790
the complete difference and, um,

92
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.620
the conflict in our foreign policy views of the,

93
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.780
what I call the Bush Clinton doctrine of interventionism and regime change wars

94
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:10.580
and, and war Moning versus, uh, what I'm putting forward,

95
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.900
which is let's stop the regime, change war world's police policies,

96
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.540
uh, work to end this new cold war and arms race,

97
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.820
put the interest of the American people.

98
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:24.290
First always ensuring that we have a strong and capable,

99
00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:28.330
ready military to defend our nation and our people, um,

100
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.490
and honoring that service and sacrifice that,

101
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.690
that our troops give by only sending them on missions worthy of their sacrifice,

102
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.570
maximizing diplomacy engagement with other countries in the world through

103
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:43.160
cooperation rather than conflict, and always seeing is a last resort.

104
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.680
So that conflict that you're seeing in the media that's been playing out.

105
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.860
And again,

106
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.640
why you're seeing so much of the corporate media and the political machine

107
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.040
attacking me is because of this difference is because of this change in foreign

108
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.280
policy that I'm bringing about because when it comes right down to it, you know,

109
00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:05.160
whether you're going back to back to the cold war, back to Vietnam, or back to,

110
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.400
you know, the Iraq war we throwing Saddam huain Libya gdafi,

111
00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:12.760
the media has always kind of been this cheerleading voice for these wars to

112
00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:15.840
happen, sending a very clear narrative out to the American people.

113
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.670
And I think it comes down to it's good business for them. It's good ratings.

114
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:19.910
Make.

115
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.150
<v 1>Some money. I want, I wanna talk to you about that,</v>

116
00:06:21.151 --> 00:06:24.150
but I wanna talk to you about what she said to you or about you rather yeah.

117
00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:26.750
That she said that you are a Russian asset. That was,

118
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.270
that was the insinuation, right? Yeah.

119
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.950
Like what was the base of that and how does someone completely baseless?

120
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.870
But that's, what's weird. Right?

121
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.740
How does someone who was running for president &lt;affirmative&gt; and it is

122
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.540
one of the most prominent politicians in our country.

123
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.220
How do they get away with something? Some saying something that's,

124
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.220
that's such a huge accusation with no information to back it up.

125
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.140
<v 0>Um, it would be a good question for, uh, a normal person.</v>

126
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.090
But when you look at the power of the Clinton machine,

127
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.130
when you look at the power of the political establishment,

128
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.330
which is made up of people who are either, you know, part of the,

129
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.610
the, um, Clinton so-called family,

130
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.090
or who are part of this political establishment that is built on the same

131
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:20.320
foundation that she, Hillary Clinton laid.

132
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.840
When you look at the media establishment,

133
00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:25.800
who've been pushing a lot of the same narrative and a lot of the same message.

134
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.240
Then you can see how somebody gets away with calling a sitting member

135
00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:35.680
of Congress, a candidate for president, uh, soldier,

136
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.230
actively serving the army national guard in of two middle east deployments,

137
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.590
basically a trader to the country that I love and that I'm willing to lay my

138
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.510
life down for and to get away with it without any evidence or base whatsoever.

139
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.590
<v 1>Not just that, but no pushback. No, that was the most bizarre thing. No,</v>

140
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.390
no one said, hold on, what are you saying? She is,

141
00:07:56.391 --> 00:08:00.300
you're saying she's a Russian asset. Define what do you mean by that?

142
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.500
Do you mean an unwitting Russian asset?

143
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.180
Are you saying that Russia's behind her to try to,

144
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.180
to do something against Bernie or Elizabeth Warren or whatever the consensus

145
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.580
pick is? Like, what are you saying? There was no, no questions like that.

146
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:13.300
There were no.

147
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.020
<v 0>Questions like that. And, and look, even if there were, um,</v>

148
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.020
Whiting or unwiting,

149
00:08:19.021 --> 00:08:24.010
so she's being ly either saying that I'm a trader to my nation or that I am

150
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.410
UN unwiting asset,

151
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.690
which means basically you are too stupid and too naive,

152
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:31.630
uh,

153
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:36.370
to know that you are being used to further the interests of a nation,

154
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:41.000
other than our own, both of which are, are, are deeply,

155
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:46.120
deeply offensive. And again, without any base. And I think that that's the,

156
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.600
like, this is bigger, this isn't, this is really not about me, the,

157
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.440
the danger here of what she did and how the media responded and

158
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.400
how almost every single other candidate for president refused to

159
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:03.520
comment refused to denounce what she said.

160
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.040
Um, burnt. I think Bernie is an exception. Maryanne Williamson, Andrew Yang.

161
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:12.720
Couple of them had the courage to say, Hey, look, this is ridiculous. Um,

162
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.710
the fact that that was, that was the response is really,

163
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.110
um, it has a chilling effect on our freedom of speech in this country.

164
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.270
And it sends a message that whether it's Tulsi Gabbard or any other American

165
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.830
or any other veteran who dares to stand up and challenge

166
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.950
the establishment challenge,

167
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.860
this foreign Paul see narrative call for peace call for an end to these

168
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:42.740
senseless, unnecessary regime change wars. Then you too can be smeared.

169
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.740
Your character can be smeared.

170
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.900
<v 2>Do, do you ever think you could reach a tipping point where this happens enough?</v>

171
00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:53.180
This kind of thing happens where you just say, all right,

172
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.130
I'm done with in this case, the democratic part, I mean,

173
00:09:56.131 --> 00:10:00.090
even after what they did to Bernie in 2016, right.

174
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.010
That I'm sure that had to be a tipping point for a lot of people that said,

175
00:10:04.011 --> 00:10:07.330
wait a second, this is the guy we wanted and you totally hose him.

176
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.130
And now we got this, this woman over here, but we didn't want him, how much,

177
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.170
how many times can this happen before people go, oh, you know,

178
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.103
I'm done with this.

179
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.560
<v 0>I, I, I see this as something that's bigger than just the democratic party, uh,</v>

180
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.000
because we see this, um, we see how this kind of, uh,

181
00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:27.280
foreign policy elite and establishment in Washington,

182
00:10:27.281 --> 00:10:31.840
it has crossed both parties, uh, over different times. Uh,

183
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:33.960
and it's something that I think goes much deeper than that. I'm,

184
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:36.480
I'm working to bring about reforms in the democratic party to,

185
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:41.470
to make it so that it is more democratic, more open, more transparent, um,

186
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.430
you know, more inclusive and welcoming of people who, you know,

187
00:10:45.431 --> 00:10:47.590
may agree on some issues, disagree on others.

188
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.470
But one that is actually serving as, as a, um,

189
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.350
a platform for the people fighting for the people,

190
00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:56.910
thinking about what's in the best interest of the people that that's the kind of

191
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.260
change in reform that, that I I'm working to bring about, uh, in the party.

192
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.060
But I think the forces that we are challenging here are, are actually much, uh,

193
00:11:05.061 --> 00:11:05.540
bigger than.

194
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:10.340
<v 2>That. I mean, you gotta give a lot of credit to the Republican party because the</v>

195
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.380
establishment Republicans,

196
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.300
the last human being in the world that they wanted as to run for president

197
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.490
called Republican ticket was Donald J. Trump. Right. And,

198
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.730
and they tried hard to beat it. They tried, they tried.

199
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.890
<v 1>Yeah. But once he was in, they said, that's our president. Yeah.</v>

200
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.090
And that's a very wise thing to do. And, and you, you know, that's,

201
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.370
that's where the fear is with, uh,

202
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.770
a lot of Democrats that someone is gonna go independent and that's someone who

203
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:35.131
is popular,

204
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:38.840
perhaps you would go independent and suck a lot of the votes away from the

205
00:11:38.841 --> 00:11:42.040
democratic party. People disagree with the direction it's going,

206
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.800
and then that's how the Republicans would win. Yeah.

207
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.680
<v 0>I'm not, I'm not gonna do that. Yeah. Uh, I've, I've been asked that a, a,</v>

208
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.960
a ton of times since, uh, I don't know,

209
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.240
months ago and every single time I've been asked, I I've said the answer is no,

210
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.960
I'm running to be the democratic nominee.

211
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.800
I will not run as a third party candidate. And, uh,

212
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.000
I think that's something else that's, that's been interesting. And again,

213
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:06.320
very transparent if you're paying attention is no matter how many times I answer

214
00:12:06.321 --> 00:12:08.480
that question from reporters. And,

215
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:13.030
and no matter how many times my answer is consistently the same, no. Um,

216
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.110
that was another thing that Hillary Clinton, uh,

217
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.150
and others continue to point out like, oh, well,

218
00:12:17.151 --> 00:12:19.470
we think we think she's gonna run as a third party candidate.

219
00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:21.750
And she's gonna be the reason that Donald Trump wins and all this other,

220
00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:25.230
she' not playing ball. No. And it, and they're, they're clearly trafficking and,

221
00:12:25.231 --> 00:12:26.750
and things that aren't true again,

222
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.630
why to raise that question people's minds and to raise that suspicion and,

223
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:35.020
and to, to do their best, to try to, to undermine the support that,

224
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:35.980
that we're getting from people.
