00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.810
Do you feel like that sometimes when ideas come to you, when you up, like,

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:10.080
it's almost like, like it's a gift from somewhere.

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.340
<v 1>I have no idea. I think</v>

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.360
all of my ideas are kind of like mistakes. It's like,

6
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.150
cause you never wake up and say today, I'm going to write the email,

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.940
congratulations or any art or any song.

8
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.730
And you kind of just it's it's all about like right

9
00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:39.470
moment, right time. Like I had, oh, I had like eight bud lights.

10
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.453
Right.

11
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.110
And then I took just a tiny bit of shrooms and then here it's like.

12
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.753
<v 2>Paul.</v>

13
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.770
<v 1>And then it just happens. Yeah. There's it's, it's like,</v>

14
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.590
it is an accident.

15
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.540
It is just like a spur of the moment type deal to where you're like,

16
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:03.950
let me sing this melody over this beat.

17
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:08.480
Or let me make this beat even. And it just kind of happens.

18
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:10.130
I don't know. Well, that's.

19
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.570
<v 0>The flow state, right? When you just,</v>

20
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.720
you can get out of your own way and you can let ideas come to you.

21
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.860
Like I was talking with this dude, his name is Joe DeSena.

22
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.430
He runs a Spartan race. He's a really smart guy, very interesting guy.

23
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.580
He does a lot of stuff for kids. He's got all of these kid programs.

24
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:29.750
These kids do like difficult tasks and they like to do it over a summer camp.

25
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.240
It gets them better. But what we were talking about it,

26
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.270
and we were talking about being healthy and all the benefits of being healthy.

27
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.610
And I was like, this there's a lot to that,

28
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.440
but there's also a lot to like the person who binges and

29
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:45.920
create something incredible. Like we were talking about Stephen King's books,

30
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.860
but some of the ones he doesn't even remember are the best ones.

31
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.890
Cause he was on Coke and drinking a case of bud.

32
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.430
Like you just blast it out of his head chain, smoking cigarettes.

33
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.280
And he doesn't even remember writing. I think it's Cujo.

34
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.390
He doesn't even remember writing it, like wrote, carry half blacked out.

35
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.570
You've read that book today, man. Sure. It's hard.

36
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.860
<v 1>My dad's a Vegas, Stephen Kingspan Stephen King fan dude.</v>

37
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.090
And he's amazing. But I mean, at the end of the day, it's like a,

38
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.850
to each his own, you know what I mean? I mean,

39
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.880
whatever gets you through three of them. No.

40
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.430
<v 0>Some people can definitely do it straight. And, and I, you know,</v>

41
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:26.000
I've definitely had ideas without any influence of anything before,

42
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.390
but I feel like sometimes things come to you when,

43
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.560
when you're like a little high, at least a little drunk and they're like,

44
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:37.270
I don't know if I would have ever thought about this without the weed. They,

45
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.990
they just come out of nowhere.

46
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.670
<v 1>And that's, and that's the whole thing too, like drinking Rosa or drinking,</v>

47
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.530
you know, bud light and then a little bit of just, uh, something else,

48
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.500
whether it be, you know, smoking a little bit of a J cause I I'm,

49
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.700
I'm an anxious person. You told me before. You're not an anxious person,

50
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.910
but really, but I used to smoke a,

51
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.390
but now not so much, maybe I'll smoke, watch a funny movie and then,

52
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.370
but it's, it's that stroke genius.

53
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:10.204
And you're like,

54
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.160
if I was not nothing in my blood right now,

55
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.270
but just blood, no booze,

56
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:23.770
no anything would, I have thought of that. Um, and that's it,

57
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.750
that's a whole different deal. It's it's uh, it's wild really?

58
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.820
<v 0>I think a pot the way I think a wakeboarding. Sure. Because, uh,</v>

59
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.150
when you're wakeboarding and you're on that wave, it looks, I don't wake board,

60
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:39.870
but when I watch people do it, I'll wait for it either. It looks awesome. Right?

61
00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:42.930
When they're on that and it catching those waves. But then when they wipe out,

62
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.990
man, they go down hard and that's like wheat. So you're not going to.

63
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.070
<v 3>Stay on that board forever.</v>

64
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.880
If you think you're really up that board's going to flip over and you can,

65
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.550
whenever you rip that big trick, you do.

66
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.400
<v 1>The behind the back double spin.</v>

67
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.130
That's a stroke of genius. And that's,

68
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.740
that's what I think that there's a certain magic that goes into making

69
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.920
a record or, you know,

70
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.510
if you're a painter or a painting or if you're a dancer, a cool dance.

71
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.550
<v 0>Moves, I think they're all related in some way.</v>

72
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.140
<v 1>Yeah. There's something there that it just kicks off and you can't control it.</v>

73
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:22.050
And you can't say when it's going to happen,

74
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:24.330
but it just happens whatever that is, that.

75
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.510
<v 0>That makes humans so interested in creating things that other people are going</v>

76
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.650
to enjoy. But it's, that's what it is. It's like, there's a weird frequency,

77
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.800
humans creating things that they know other people are going to enjoy.

78
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.580
And if you can just get lost in the beauty of just creating the thing and get

79
00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:42.480
out of your own way, then these ideas will come to you.

80
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.810
But if you get in your own way, you have less bandwidth for the ideas.

81
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.280
And when they come to it, it feels like this isn't, there aren't even yours.

82
00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:54.180
Like it's like, you're interacting with something like these ideas.

83
00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:57.720
Just like if you have an idea for like a five and idea for a new bed or

84
00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:00.480
something like that, sometimes they just come from nowhere. You're like,

85
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.720
where'd that come from? What is this? What is, uh, where,

86
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:04.830
where are premises from?

87
00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:08.910
What's an idea from it's like creativity comes from the weirdest part of your

88
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:11.070
brain that no one knows how to. I mean,

89
00:05:11.071 --> 00:05:13.410
you there's like you could have breathing exercises,

90
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:15.420
you could do all sorts of things to try to stimulate it. Right.

91
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:18.450
But the reality is you can't even measure it. No, you don't know when it's up,

92
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:21.120
when it's down, you just know what you're doing. If you're making some cool.

93
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.630
<v 1>It's so that's so bizarre. Like to think about, like you said,</v>

94
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.490
it's just really humans creating something that other humans

95
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.140
with. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. It makes you feel good. That's the most,

96
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.730
there's something there.

97
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.270
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

98
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.590
When you see like when you're in concert and you see 15,000 people rocking out

99
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:46.980
to your song, right? Like that, that has gotta be a crazy feeling.

100
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.600
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. It is. Yeah. Well, whenever you know, you're on the podcast,</v>

101
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.390
everybody's seeing you, whenever you kicking somebody in the face,

102
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.730
everybody watching, there's a there's feeling there and it's just like,

103
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.510
oh, I realize finally I'm not actually just one person.

104
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.890
Yeah. I, as, as like

105
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.040
Mithril, as it sounds, I'm with everybody as,

106
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.150
as in one moment in time, everybody is,

107
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.160
they're doing the same thing with the same energy, the same good intention.

108
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.900
Yes. It's, it's, it's magical, you know, it's weird.

109
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.610
Yeah.

110
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.150
<v 0>That's, what's what you're doing. Right. You're tapping into some magic.</v>

111
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.330
I'm trying, but that's what it is. If, if you,

112
00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:40.660
if you think about what kind of alchemy is involved in making the right sounds

113
00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:43.750
to make people feel sure, because with a great song, man,

114
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.610
you're giving a person a drug.
