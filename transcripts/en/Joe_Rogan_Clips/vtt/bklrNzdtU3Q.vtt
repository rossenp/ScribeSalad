1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.950
<v 0>I mean when, when Goggins live with me,</v>

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.800
his rule is we had to do something every day. That sucked.

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.140
<v 1>That was his role. And he's a master at that. Tell me about it.</v>

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.820
And what did he make you do?

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.970
<v 0>Uh, every day sucked.</v>

6
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.020
He didn't tell me that we're going to do that five times a day that you know,

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.400
um, no, I mean, I remember one day, what was the first thing we did was we,

8
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.380
he came in and he, um,

9
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.980
he wanted to see how many pull-ups I could do so we can map out the month he

10
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.940
live with me for a month and I went to the pull-up bar and I got like maybe

11
00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:35.390
eight pull-ups, which is an exaggeration. I probably got like 40 pull ups,

12
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.600
you know, a lot of people are listening. So,

13
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.340
and then he said, I wait 30 seconds, go and do it again.

14
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.450
And I went up on the pull-up bar and I did maybe like three or four, he said,

15
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:49.070
I wait 30 seconds. I want you to do it again.

16
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.540
And I got up on the pull up bar and I did maybe like one kipping, you know,

17
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:56.480
getting my chin over the bar barely. And it dropped down.

18
00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:59.840
I was all jacked up and I said, all right, well, what's what's next? He said,

19
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:02.360
well, what's next is we're not leaving here until you do a hundred more.

20
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.010
We're not leaving the gym till you do a hundred more that day. Now, like right.

21
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.160
<v 1>Now, right now. And I was like seven either.</v>

22
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.700
<v 0>Like probably seven to 10. And I was like, man, God knows that's impossible.</v>

23
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.270
And he said, you know, I already, I already know what your biggest problem is.

24
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:19.820
And he's like, the limitations you're putting on yourself or are,

25
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:21.920
self-imposed get the back on the bar.

26
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.510
<v 2>And you know, Jesus, Roger that man. And, uh, I.</v>

27
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.650
<v 0>Got up on the bar and I all over, over the course of an hour or two, I did them.</v>

28
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.200
And that started our journey of like,

29
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.860
you're about to go in a place where you've never been, you know?

30
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.870
And you know, we went,

31
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.560
I remember one day I was sitting on the couch and uh,

32
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.680
in Connecticut where I was living at the time and on the ticker on the,

33
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.730
on the TV, the emergency broadcast system came up, stay inside,

34
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.500
freezing rain, icy conditions, high winds stay inside. It's like beeping,

35
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:58.000
stay inside and Goggins, like, this is amazing, man. Let's go.

36
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.320
<v 2>And I'm like, they're telling us the exact opposite, man. They're there.</v>

37
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.050
<v 0>Broadcasting to the whole community to stay inside.</v>

38
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.160
So we go for a 10 mile run in the blizzard and we come home and I lived on a

39
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:15.200
lake and kids are playing hockey on the lake.

40
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.920
So we go down and he takes his hand and he moves all the snow off the ice.

41
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.740
It gets a Boulder and he breaks the ice,

42
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:24.140
a little hole in the ice with the Boulder. And then he takes his hand.

43
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:25.820
He makes the whole little bit bigger.

44
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.870
And then he jumps in and then he points at me and he takes his finger.

45
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:33.530
And he singles for me to jump in. I'm not going in the bucket,

46
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:37.280
freezing cold water. Cause my mother told me as a kid in long island,

47
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:40.760
don't go anywhere near the frozen ones you fall in, you have like a minute,

48
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.260
you know, he's bathing in it.

49
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.030
So of course I go in and uh, he looks at me, he's like, man,

50
00:02:47.031 --> 00:02:50.240
you got about, uh, about four to two, two to four minutes.

51
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.920
You got to get hypothermia. We just went on a run.

52
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:56.330
We gotta get you out of a lake. And I go to get out. He goes, you can't get out.

53
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.010
He goes, if your skin touches the ice, it's going to, to the ice.

54
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:03.130
Like the kid in Christmas story, his tongue that sticks to the pole, you know?

55
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:08.080
So he puts my shoes back on my hands and picks my up and puts my socks.

56
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.460
I put my socks on or whatever. And I,

57
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.440
I bear crawl out of the ice and I run up and I see my wife looking out the

58
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:18.340
window as I'm running into the house. And we come in and she says to, um,

59
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.700
Goggins, you know, like what's the medical benefit of jumping in a frozen lake.

60
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.700
And he said to her, there's no medical benefit. She's like,

61
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.160
this is what your husband signed up for. You know, he's like,

62
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:30.940
I want to see how far he's willing to go to get to his goals. And I was like,

63
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.180
this is going to be some 30 days. He's

64
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.290
Jesus. Wow. What was the toughest thing he made you do? Uh,

65
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.320
it was just the consistency of it. You know, it was this, like,

66
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.310
it was just like, it was just, he, she went everywhere. I went,

67
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:51.480
he shadowed me for 30 days. He went to every business meeting. We flew together.

68
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.360
He lived with, you know, with my wife and I did you.

69
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.580
<v 3>Think like, what the did I sign up.</v>

70
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.440
<v 0>For? This is back in 2010. So this is, uh, you know,</v>

71
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.210
um, yes I did. I was, and the book came out two years ago now. Yeah.

72
00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:10.860
I waited five years. I didn't, I didn't expect it to ever be a book.

73
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.970
It was just like, you know, at all, there was no book being discussed. I,

74
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.220
I kept the little blog about it, you know? So why'd you do it? Um,

75
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.290
I just felt like there was so much in it there's so many lessons and it was

76
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:29.790
funny fish out of water. Like he's coming into our house. My wife owns Spanx.

77
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.890
<v 2>I mean like the Dole dynamic of this.</v>

78
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.100
<v 0>Was crazy. And um,</v>

79
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.360
I just felt there were a lot of lessons that could be learned through it and um,

80
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.420
you know, took a shot at it. Jeez, Jesus Christ. Yeah.

81
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.010
<v 3>He's a maniac. When he did the podcast I got here, he showed up super early.</v>

82
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.400
And when I got here, he was already with his shirt off doing chin-ups

83
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.980
and I was like, I walked into the back where the gym is and he's he's in there.

84
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.770
<v 4>I'm like, look at this.</v>

85
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.400
<v 5>Amazing guy. He's a Savage, he's legit.</v>

86
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.340
<v 0>But these are all the lessons as you're talking about, you know,</v>

87
00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:07.140
and you don't know where the nuggets come from,

88
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.150
you put yourself in a position for the nuggets to appear and they don't have

89
00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:14.570
to be radical positions. Like I'm going to go get Goggins.

90
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.830
I'm going to go live with a month. You don't have to be radical,

91
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.960
but you put yourself out there, like you were saying,

92
00:05:18.961 --> 00:05:23.100
and you live a life where those lessons find you and then, and seek them.

93
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.420
You seek them. Yeah. Well.

94
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.570
<v 3>Goggins, his story is so fascinating because he wasn't that guy,</v>

95
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.820
he was fat and out of shape and unmotivated and lazy and,

96
00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:35.520
you know, talked openly about the first time he ran,

97
00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:37.470
like he quit and he was supposed to, you know,

98
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:40.710
ran about three quarters of a mile. I think he said, and quit.

99
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:45.660
And he was exhausted and just drinking milkshakes and all up

100
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.910
and somehow,

101
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:52.800
or another decided he's not going to be that guy anymore and went 180

102
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:56.850
degrees and became this intensely motivated iron man.

103
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.850
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I was at the race.</v>

104
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.850
I saw him at the race where he broke all the bones in his feet. You know,

105
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.240
I saw him. I was at the, I participated in that race. The first time I saw him.

106
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:09.230
That's how I met him. And, uh, 2007. And, uh,

107
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.370
you know, he broke all the bones in his feet. He broke. Yeah. He, he,

108
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.470
he was running a hundred. I was running this race.

109
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.420
It was a 24 hour race as a relay team.

110
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:21.860
I was with four friends and the format of the races, you know, you run a mile,

111
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:24.920
I run a mile mother, whatever team runs the most amount of miles, right.

112
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.170
Wins the race. He had no teammates.

113
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.570
That sounds like where's the rest of the team. That sounds like him.

114
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.160
And he weighed a lot at the time. So I watched him wait a lot.

115
00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:40.360
Was he bodybuilding at the time?

116
00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:43.510
He was just begging and it probably weighed 260, 70 pounds.

117
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.850
Maybe deadlifting maybe, maybe. Yeah.

118
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.350
<v 3>So was this the one where he ran 24 hours all around the room just to show that</v>

119
00:06:50.351 --> 00:06:53.890
he could run a hundred miles and he wound up himself. Yeah.

120
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.080
He told me about that. I saw it. I didn't know.

121
00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:58.480
He broke all the bones in his feet. He broke some bones. Yeah.

122
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.630
He didn't even tell me about that. And then he ran a marathon a month later.

123
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.140
<v 0>Yeah. He's a animal.</v>

124
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.720
<v 5>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he really is.</v>

125
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.900
<v 2>Yeah. He was telling me also the plane, that to your wife,</v>

126
00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:12.160
when you say he's coming to live with you.

127
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.540
<v 4>You don't know my wife happening.</v>

128
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.360
<v 2>Just kicked us both out. I just said.</v>

129
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.400
<v 0>It really fast. I told Sarah, cause I flew out.</v>

130
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.680
I flew out to meet Goggins after the race, you know, I cold called them. And uh,

131
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.790
my wife asked me how the meeting went and in the meeting, you know,

132
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.580
I realized like I kind of wanted to get the secret sauce.

133
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.940
<v 5>Like dry, you know? And, um.</v>

134
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.080
<v 3>Is got the idea like, yeah, it was like, like by,</v>

135
00:07:40.081 --> 00:07:44.740
by being around some such an intensely motivated guy that you would get the

136
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:45.574
rub.

137
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.750
<v 0>Get the rub and I I'd fallen into routine. I couldn't get out of. And I just,</v>

138
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.390
you know, like I was like, just get me out of my routine, man, you know,

139
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.140
and I want to learn from you and that kind of thing. And um,

140
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.260
my wife asked me to have a lunch meeting, went and I told her that, you know,

141
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.290
he's come live with us. She was like, what? Like lunch.

142
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.220
<v 3>Meeting with him. And did you, where are you going to propose this before?</v>

143
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.130
Uh, I went, w.

144
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.370
<v 0>What happened was I went to the meeting and, um,</v>

145
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.680
with no real agenda, other than like, I want to meet this guy, man, you know,

146
00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:21.910
it's 2007. I want to meet him 2008, something around,

147
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.270
around there was 10 years ago. And, uh,

148
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.130
I was just so like drawn to him, you know? And,

149
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.260
um, I actually went home and then, and then asked him to come, you know,

150
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.910
live with me. And, uh, and he said, yes. And then I told my wife after like,

151
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:42.940
this guy's coming in two days now, why did he say.

152
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.860
<v 5>Yes. I mean, isn't he busy?</v>

153
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.350
<v 3>Did you offer him money? Like how did this?</v>

154
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.790
<v 0>No, he was, um, he was, uh, he was active.</v>

155
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:56.610
He was still in the military at the time. And, uh, yeah, I think,

156
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.260
um, I don't know exactly what triggered. I remember asking him to comment.

157
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:02.490
I remember him saying to me,

158
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.640
if you're crazy enough to ask a guy like me to come live with you,

159
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.620
I'm crazy enough to come.

160
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.520
<v 1>Three days later, he shows up with one day knowing him. That.</v>

161
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.600
<v 3>Is exactly what it would sound like if he said it with those crazy eyes.</v>

162
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.310
<v 0>Jesus Christ, sweetie. This is David. Wow. Did.</v>

163
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.640
<v 3>You give them an objective? Do you say, did you say why you wanted him to,</v>

164
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.350
to come or what, what you're trying to.

165
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.030
<v 0>At that time in my life I had, uh, I was, I had, um, just left.</v>

166
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.210
I have my timeline, right? I think I just left the, my private,

167
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.300
this private jet card company. I had Marquis jet.

168
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.080
I was just starting out in the Zico coconut water business.

169
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.100
And I was in a routine, you know, I was in a rut, not, uh,

170
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.720
I was just doing the same stuff, man.

171
00:09:53.721 --> 00:09:58.010
I was so comfortable and I was just like this calm, shake it up, man. You know,

172
00:09:58.011 --> 00:10:01.430
you can travel with me. I got some meetings coming up, we'll live together.

173
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.910
And there was no book. There was no anything. The book happened years later.

174
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.030
And um, he said, he'd. He said he would do it.

175
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.940
That's crazy that he just loved it. By the way,

176
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.720
it was one of the best months of my life. I love being around him.

177
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:19.190
He's an amazing guy. I loved, um, you know,

178
00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:22.550
we were watching games. We were working out, I was going out midnight,

179
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.640
three in the morning. We were running in the blizzards. We were in the morning,

180
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.310
one day, he was like,

181
00:10:28.311 --> 00:10:32.300
we're going to run four miles every four hours for 48 hours,

182
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.500
Joe. I was like, I got to work. He's like, no, you don't.

183
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.640
<v 4>No, you don't. You can work 40 in.</v>

184
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.270
<v 0>48 Hours. Wow. So I would wake up at midnight. We started at midnight.</v>

185
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:51.410
We would run. Let's say it took us 40 minutes. And then we would come back.

186
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.470
We'd have, you know what? Three hours and 20 minutes of rest.

187
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.780
And then at 4:00 AM we go again for miles? Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

188
00:10:59.781 --> 00:11:03.950
48 hours. Jesus Christ. One time.

189
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.110
<v 2>I've a million stories. I mean, we.</v>

190
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.860
<v 0>Went in the sauna and he's like, all right, we're gonna stay in the sauna for a,</v>

191
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.360
I'm a sauna guy. I thought I was a sauna guy. By the way I thought I was.

192
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.770
And actually this was the steam and he's like, we're gonna stay in here for 30,

193
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.370
30 minutes. Eight ounces of water. Okay. We Jack it up.

194
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:27.110
It's cooking in there. It's I walk.

195
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.060
<v 2>In. I'm like, holy.</v>

196
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.310
<v 0>It's so hot in here. He sits down. He's whistling. Dixie.</v>

197
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
You like sitting in the corner doing his. I'm like, you know,

198
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:44.000
eight minutes into my water's gone. I've already drank my eight ounces of water.

199
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.860
And about, uh, 19 minutes in I'm like, Goggins, I got to get out.

200
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.960
He's like, you can't get out. I'm like, no, I'm gonna,

201
00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:53.470
I'm gonna F I'm going to pass out. I gotta get out. He's like,

202
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:56.110
you can't get out. I'm like, no, no, no. And I just, I couldn't,

203
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.300
I didn't even wait for him to say no again. Cause I'm about to,

204
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.120
I'm about to pass out. I can feel myself about to pass out.

205
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.530
I opened up the door,

206
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.800
all the smoke from the steam room goes flying out of the door.

207
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:09.610
I sit right in the chair. He comes storming out and he looks at me. He's like,

208
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.840
oh, you don't look good. I go, nah, I'm going to pass out. He goes,

209
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.710
we got to abort a boy.

210
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.980
<v 2>To be. Like we're not doing the rest of the 30 minutes. Like I got a pass.</v>

211
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.250
That was the only pass I got because you almost died in the sauna.

212
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.020
Or the steam was. Steam.

213
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.090
<v 3>Room is different because it's moisture and.</v>

214
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.530
<v 0>You tie it in. I was taking in like the, this sit, getting cooked, cooked.</v>

215
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.110
<v 3>Yeah. I mean, you're really getting cooked. It's not like it was sauna.</v>

216
00:12:34.111 --> 00:12:38.850
You're getting like kinda dry roasted in the, the moisture is different.

217
00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:40.020
Like you can't get as hot.

218
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.450
<v 5>In a steam room as you can and a sauna, correct?</v>

219
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.660
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. So this was a series of these just, you know,</v>

220
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.280
getting poached throughout the, uh, yeah. God.

221
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.290
<v 3>No, he would just make these up, like come up with these ideas.</v>

222
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.790
It was just constant.

223
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:58.110
<v 0>Man. Like, I mean, we would go to work. We'd be sitting at work and um,</v>

224
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.550
I'd have like a 30 minute break and he'd be like, burpee test.

225
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.330
Like what I'm at work. He'd be like,

226
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.990
I want to say how many burpees you can do in 10 minutes. I'd be like burpee.

227
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.930
<v 2>Tests. And I was like, in the middle of work, I would like.</v>

228
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.650
<v 0>Get down kickoff, Mike, you know, whatever I was wearing, I was getting like my.</v>

229
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.600
<v 2>Boxers or whatever, like just to get.</v>

230
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.010
<v 0>And I would do as many burpees as I could in 10 minutes and be soaking wet and</v>

231
00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:26.520
I'd walk into my next meeting. And everybody knew he was like, he was,

232
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:28.620
that was part of the thing.

233
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.400
<v 3>So you're explained to all these people that wow, closed every deal.</v>

234
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.300
<v 2>I close every deal, man. Cause you're so amped up. Plus he was there.</v>

235
00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:43.860
Who's going to say news. People were fascinated. I'd walk in.

236
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.140
And they'd be like, at the end of the, at the end of the meeting, I'm like,

237
00:13:46.141 --> 00:13:47.730
do you want to talk? I was like, whatever the you guys were.

238
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.400
<v 0>In, we're in, we're in. Wow.</v>

239
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.520
<v 3>That sounds so much better than living with a monk.</v>

240
00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.990
<v 4>[Inaudible] I miss him. Yeah. It's you keep in touch. Well, yeah and we go.</v>

241
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.050
<v 0>Oh, it's been awhile. But uh, yeah. I mean,</v>

242
00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:07.410
I've known him since 2007 now and it's been 10 years. Wow.

243
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.380
<v 2>Yeah. I would think that that was,</v>

244
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.350
it would be hard but exciting.

245
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.940
<v 3>Whereas the monk thing seems like the drone of it all,</v>

246
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.793
which is good.

247
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:21.930
<v 0>Yeah. And like,</v>

248
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.430
I couldn't go back to my room and my surroundings in the monk thing.

249
00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:30.510
I was like in their world forever. Forever.

250
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.570
<v 3>Yeah. They live in the same way that you did. They have a little cell as well.</v>

251
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.520
<v 0>Yeah. I actually didn't see their rooms, but yeah, from what I understand,</v>

252
00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:40.500
even smaller than when I was in and I was in.

253
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.410
<v 5>Just smaller, smaller than this table.</v>

254
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.260
<v 0>Uh, my room was about the size of this table.</v>

255
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.200
The weather's was smaller from what I understand. Yeah.

256
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.410
How's it impossible bed.

257
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.940
There's no position with like just a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

258
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.290
Just go into a space with a bed.

259
00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.170
<v 3>Blackout, wake up and start all over again.</v>

260
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.990
Drone. Yeah. No, I think the, the four miles,

261
00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:07.900
every 40 minutes or whatever the it is a four miles. Every four hours.

262
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.490
That sounds way better. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds crazy at the time, but.

263
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.010
<v 5>Yeah. How'd you end it. How did he end? The 30 days?</v>

264
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.330
<v 0>I left me a note on a post-it thanks.</v>

265
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.780
That's it? That's it. Jesus.

266
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.190
That's intense. Thanks.

267
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.910
<v 5>Wow. Jesus Christ.</v>

268
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.660
<v 0>My goodbyes are like long hugs. Right? Changing,</v>

269
00:15:34.661 --> 00:15:37.480
exchanging planning. Thanks.

270
00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.880
<v 5>That would be an incredible service.</v>

271
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.980
<v 3>Like if he wanted to do that and just go to like billionaires</v>

272
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.810
and just say, you have to do what I tell you to do for a month.

273
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.670
<v 5>I bet a lot of people would do that. I'm sure. Just charge.</v>

274
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:59.740
<v 3>Charged some stupid amount of money and have him live with you for a</v>

275
00:15:59.741 --> 00:16:00.574
month.

276
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:06.190
<v 0>You know, that's hard and anybody personality wise over time having</v>

277
00:16:06.191 --> 00:16:08.020
roommates it's hard. You know what I mean? Yeah.

278
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.790
<v 5>So he's with you 24 7. Yeah. I mean it's hard. Do you ever wake you up.</v>

279
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.360
<v 0>Every day? Every day he woke you up. Yup.</v>

280
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.490
Come in and tap me on the shoulder time to get up.

281
00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.090
Let's do with my wife right next to me. Jesus Christ.

282
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.160
It wasn't a tap of the tide to do this. Get.

283
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.410
<v 4>Up does. He would say.</v>

284
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.080
<v 1>Well, at least he was courteous. Whispered wake your wife up. Yeah.</v>

285
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.050
Was your wife like what in the are you doing? She loved them.
