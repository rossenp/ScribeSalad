00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.240
We still never got to the bagoacgida sorry about that. We turned a hard, a hard,

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.760
I wanna know why you think that that's real and what you think is going on in

4
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:14.594
those stories.

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.720
<v 1>Well, first you've got the dialogue itself,</v>

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.270
which is cool wisdom

7
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.790
for all.

8
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.830
<v 0>People. Yeah. And some of it is like hyper bizarre.</v>

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.070
Like what Oppenheimer quoted at the detonation of the atomic bomb. Right.

10
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.350
I am become death. Worldmi looks.

11
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.550
<v 1>Shy. Creep Preo. Is that the that's a sansrit how does he say it?</v>

12
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.420
Carlosmi looks SHA is that time?

13
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.100
I am the destroy of time.

14
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.820
I am the great destroyer and I've come to destroy all worlds. So that's,

15
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.900
one's the actual translation. That's the actual translation in English. Cause.

16
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.460
<v 0>His translation, um, Oppenheimers was, I am become deaf.</v>

17
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.220
Is that because of a, an issue with, uh,

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.130
the translation between in Hindu and yeah, there's a.

19
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.330
<v 1>English. It's just different people translated slightly different, but it's,</v>

20
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.450
it's similar. Meaning, meaning, um,

21
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.930
in that particular section that you pulled out that was Christian explaining,

22
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:18.410
like God is beautiful. God is charming. God is your best friend.

23
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.200
He's also death personified. So he's sang in that part particular place.

24
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.360
I'm actually also the destroy of all the worlds. When we think of

25
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.680
the yogis, explain that God is everything,

26
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.200
both the beauty and the destruction as well. And so Christian just is,

27
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.720
is sharing his attributes.

28
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:43.390
And in that particular chapter chapter allow he's his,

29
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.430
the muscle almost intimidating. Where do you think.

30
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.670
<v 0>All these stories come from? Where do you,</v>

31
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:55.470
what do you think the origin of the Baba GDA of the maabarat of,

32
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.990
of all the ancient text? What do you think the origin was? What was the,

33
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.420
what was the motivation to put this stuff down? What was,

34
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.060
what was the original concepts that led them to write

35
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:14.780
this? And where did it all come from? Mm, there has to be an origin of these,

36
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.500
these wisdoms, right? Yeah. What do you think that is?

37
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.410
<v 1>You know, um, to even to answer the question,</v>

38
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.250
I have to take myself out of Ragu and just answer like a yoga teacher. Okay.

39
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:29.910
Cause the,

40
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.690
to answer of what do you think it's one thing you're sort of trained not to do

41
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.530
in as far as what is your personal opinion?

42
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.170
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I can give you my personal opinion,

43
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:41.290
but I have to separate it from what the stories themselves.

44
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.130
<v 0>Say. Okay. Well, gimme your personal opinion. My personal opinion.</v>

45
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.760
<v 1>Is, um, I hear what the stories have to offer.</v>

46
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.320
I find some value in the stories and I try to apply wisdom to my life.

47
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.880
It helps the direction of my life. It helps me escape potholes.

48
00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:59.640
I understand the stories themselves say these are all real.

49
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.800
They're be beyond way beyond your perception.

50
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.640
They were orally transmitted at a certain time.

51
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:08.120
Historically they understood people are getting dumber.

52
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.280
See, we have a tendency to think we're at the pinnacle of evolution,

53
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.480
but the Vadic teachings is at, as we go on in this age,

54
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.280
we get more and more disconnected.

55
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.630
There was a time where architecture was more evolved where the sciences were

56
00:03:23.631 --> 00:03:24.830
more evolved where.

57
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.670
<v 0>Wait a minute, stop. &lt;laugh&gt; the sciences were more evolved.</v>

58
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.950
<v 1>The sciences, like, like for example, the building of these vionas,</v>

59
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.550
which when we read them, now we just think that's mythological.

60
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.790
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; even weaponry, um, uh, weaponry.

61
00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:40.020
They say they were done with sound.

62
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.900
If you study that there's one book called the Donner, but okay.

63
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.820
<v 0>But do you think this is.</v>

64
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.180
<v 1>Real? Do I think it's real? I think it could be. I don't think it's definitely.</v>

65
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.660
I definitely.

66
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.060
<v 0>Don't. So you, at one point in time,</v>

67
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.740
human beings had Vonas and they flew around the sky and then they had weapons

68
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.420
that used sound could.

69
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.460
<v 1>Could, why not.</v>

70
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.490
<v 0>Was no evidence rcular logical evidence that there was a flying craft or was</v>

71
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.250
that there was ever any technology that allowed people to leave gravity.

72
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.530
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. There's sometimes there may not be evidence.</v>

73
00:04:10.531 --> 00:04:14.410
Just like there's let me, let me show you, what was the guy's name hill or the,

74
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:17.570
the bar Barney hill. Barney hill. What's your evidence? You could just say,

75
00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:19.370
well, it's my own experience. Well, I mean, he's.

76
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.720
<v 0>Just laying that's, that's a totally different thing.</v>

77
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.560
He he's just relaying his personal experience.

78
00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:28.240
He could have had some sort of a psychotic break he could have had, I mean,

79
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.760
it could have been mass psychosis with him and his, I mean,

80
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:35.880
with two people up psychosis with him and his wife, I can say.

81
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.480
<v 1>That there are things that make no sense. I,</v>

82
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.950
to me yet, I sort of tried them anyway.

83
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.190
And then after time they made sense like, oh wait a second.

84
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.830
That does make sense. It it, or at different vantage points of my life,

85
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.270
it didn't make sense when I was 20, but at 50, that makes a lot of sense. Mm.

86
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.390
So there's certain things that are

87
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.980
huge leaps of faith that I can't say. I definitely know that to be true.

88
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:06.340
Just like chanting on mantratrous made no sense made no real sense.

89
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.340
But over time I realized actually that helps in this particular way, but it.

90
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.500
<v 0>Achieve as a state, a state of consciousness. We've known that forever,</v>

91
00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:15.260
that achieving that meditation in general, right?

92
00:05:15.261 --> 00:05:18.740
Achieve certain states of consciousness. And you can actually, with FMRI,

93
00:05:18.741 --> 00:05:22.730
you can actually monitor the changes in the way the rain, uh, is.

94
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.250
<v 1>See, this is what I like about you.</v>

95
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:26.730
You're one of those guys you get into these very interesting,

96
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.810
like subtle sciences and you,

97
00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:31.890
then you find it's like hard evidence for these things.

98
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.370
And just hearing that thing with James Wil and breaking all these things down.

99
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.170
I'm I'm, &lt;laugh&gt;, I'm more of a simpler guy.

100
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.410
I find people where I trust the way they live,

101
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.320
they've applied stuff and walked the it's more like I can tell time,

102
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.520
but I don't know how to take part a clock and put it back.

103
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.600
<v 0>Togetherhmm no, I think exactly the same way. I'm fascinated by watches. Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.080
But then you see all the gears behind a watch, like a self-winding watch.

105
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.640
And you're like, I don't know what the is happening here. I'm sure I can.

106
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.480
I can find it out. Eventually. I'm like.

107
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.320
<v 1>That with a lot of things.</v>

108
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.680
And I'm always impressed when you dig into it with people like this.

109
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.200
But truthfully, if you wanna know the honest, honest truth, I was like, oh man,

110
00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:15.240
I hope Joe doesn't dig into it with me because I'm not that kind of hard science

111
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.710
guy. You don't have people don't have to, even all the stuff,

112
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:18.950
stuff I did in yoga. I'm concerned.

113
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.030
<v 0>From, with you as a human being. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what,</v>

114
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:25.510
that's why I asked you very specifically. What do you.

115
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.430
<v 1>Think? Right. Well, I can say like,</v>

116
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.990
the stuff that you liked about me fighting was endurance flexibility.

117
00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:35.710
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I give all the credit that to yoga.

118
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.950
You did at the time front of.

119
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.220
<v 0>I've told many people that you, you had crazy cardio and your cardio was,</v>

120
00:06:42.221 --> 00:06:44.140
you never did. Cardio. You just did breathing.

121
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.660
<v 1>Exercise. Never did cardio just sat down.</v>

122
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.820
<v 0>You was great. Cardio. You always, you always led like really good endurance.</v>

123
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.380
<v 1>And my cardio was even better.</v>

124
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.940
I remember being at the bomb squad once on day 17 of a 21 day fast.

125
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.490
Wow. Day 17. And I remember fighting, I can't remember his name as a cool guy.

126
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.710
He's like, what?

127
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.930
And you know how ju jut jujitsu class ends when we're all tanked and we're all

128
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:09.850
like, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I just kept on going. And he's like, man,

129
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.850
what is up with you? I was like, I don't know.

130
00:07:11.851 --> 00:07:16.010
I haven't eaten solid food in 17 days. So it's not like I'm a genius.

131
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.440
It's just that these are sort of like yoga, fasting, deep breathing.

132
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.960
I've just been doing them. Yeah.

133
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:24.800
And I'm sure there's people that can give you the,

134
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.160
a modern take on what the benefits are and yeah, but that's.

135
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.993
<v 0>Not what I'm asking you.</v>

136
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.000
What I'm asking you is why you believe the BOGO vagi is real cause. Sure.

137
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.440
<v 1>So my point is there's reasonable amounts of faith in these other things that</v>

138
00:07:37.441 --> 00:07:39.910
I've applied. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that have made me take a next step.

139
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.630
So whether I believe it's real,

140
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.030
I just believe the truths I can extract from it are real. Yes.

141
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:47.190
Whether the war actually happened, there's a leap of faith.

142
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.550
<v 0>The benefits of those, of, of,</v>

143
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.310
of following those scriptures you apply and you, you feel those benefits.

144
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.323
So that's enough.

145
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.910
<v 1>That's enough to make me move forward towards those. Yeah. Just for example,</v>

146
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.340
the idea of faith and cuz especially in America,

147
00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:03.820
we don't like the concept of blind faith.

148
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.860
But if I saw you walking in downtown or let's take it the other way

149
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.720
you saw me,

150
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.420
you're driving you're Porsche and you saw me walking in Manhattan and you say,

151
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:18.020
Hey brago how do you get to times square? And I said,

152
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.610
so the first step I could lie to you.

153
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.730
People lie all the time when you ask them for directions,

154
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.330
but you have some reasonable faith. I know him, he's a friend.

155
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.010
Why would he gimme bad directions? So there's a reasonable amount of faith,

156
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:35.210
but even still people get into their egos and they just want to be

157
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.610
the knower of directions. But I say,

158
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:39.930
you go up the 14th street and you're gonna see a McDonald.

159
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.960
You take a right then you're gonna go down all the way to

160
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.800
whatever. I can't even remember Manhattan anymore,

161
00:08:46.801 --> 00:08:50.640
union square and take a left and go up third. And then at, at union square area,

162
00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:55.080
you're gonna see a park at that park. You take a hard left. So again,

163
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.280
you have a, some type of extended faith towards me, not blind faith,

164
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.360
but you'd go up to 14th street and there's at McDonald's as you go to McDonald's

165
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:07.680
or that next signpost you realize, okay, maybe he does know where he is going.

166
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.600
Then you go farther there's union square. Okay.

167
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.720
I think he actually knows what what's going on.

168
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.310
And all of a sudden you see a times square in the distance.

169
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.870
So faith isn't just like, I believe. And if anyone was to say, I believe this,

170
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.270
I believe in these Vanas I believe in mantras, I I'd start to question them,

171
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.710
but it happens with small degrees of,

172
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.260
of things being just sh shown to you. You want to take all right,

173
00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:38.020
what's the next step here? What do they say about this?

174
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.100
What do they say about that? And then you apply and see, well,

175
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:45.420
does that work with me? And like I said, sometimes things didn't make sense.

176
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.100
I remember when I first met monks and they said, uh,

177
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.890
uh, question about, or, or not even monks,

178
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:59.090
but people were just like following very strict with their sexuality. Even in,

179
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.730
even in family. And the guy said I don't have sex.

180
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.170
I don't thought I was 17. I was like, you don't have sex with your wife.

181
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:11.410
Are you crazy? He's like, no, I do other, we do other things.

182
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:17.120
And I just couldn't understand that as a 17 year old boy or 18 year old boy,

183
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.400
I couldn't understand. Why would you be with a person? Well,

184
00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:20.800
what was not for that answer? What were their answer?

185
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.880
It was cuz they said we we're practicing detachment. We're practicing,

186
00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:29.720
going internal to find or pleasure. And he said, I said, what do you do for fun?

187
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.560
And he goes, you go for a drive. I go, I was like, you go for a drive.

188
00:10:35.561 --> 00:10:38.670
Are you crazy? But it,

189
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.430
it was where this person was one on his path of,

190
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.070
of really controlling the senses and finding his pleasure internally

191
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.070
at different, at time in my life. It made no sense whatsoever. Maybe he really.

192
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.990
<v 0>Didn't like having sex with or looking for some sort of an excuse or maybe</v>

193
00:10:55.991 --> 00:10:58.860
there was going internal. She's like what? What's happening?

194
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.140
<v 1>Maybe there is trauma. We don't know the whole story.</v>

195
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.340
<v 0>Anyway, I see what you're saying though that, but if applying this stuff,</v>

196
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:10.820
whether or not you break it down scientifically and objectively and try

197
00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:13.900
to analyze each and every word and whatever the translation is,

198
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.250
you could actually apply those truths air quotes to your life and have real

199
00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:21.690
benefits. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

200
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.730
<v 1>Yeah. Um, yeah. And,</v>

201
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.050
and other things are just, I don't,

202
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.650
does it make a difference if viona's exist or not? No.

203
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:34.690
It makes no difference in my practical life. Could they exist? Sure. It could.

204
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.640
All these. Yeah. It could answer a lot. I,

205
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.440
I think a lot of these things we've talk about like life on other planets and

206
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:47.080
aliens, they all are very much explained or here's another good one.

207
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.080
What do these spiritual paths have in common?

208
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:55.320
We're we train ourselves to find the differences in all of them and theve to

209
00:11:55.321 --> 00:11:56.840
teach and say, don't you understand?

210
00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.960
You should be able to walk into a mosque into a church,

211
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.600
into a synagogue and say how nice these people are trying to connect.

212
00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.640
Not that we gotta win these people over to our team. Right?

213
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.680
Cause they're all an illusion and they're all gonna hell forever. Right?

214
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.070
Everyone's on a type of path. And I appreciate them trying to surrender.

215
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.670
And the only thing that's gonna get in their way,

216
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:17.870
cuz people say things like this all the time. Yeah.

217
00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:21.950
It's religion that caused all the problems in this world and it's not religion.

218
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.470
It's the ego that goes with joining a particular church, synagogue asrom,

219
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:31.110
et cetera, that we have it our way and everybody else their problem.

220
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.860
And we gotta fix it. That's what gets in the way,

221
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.940
because you could say materialism causes lots of problems as well in the world.

222
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.500
So I don't think it's it. The ego's sneaky. It'll sneak into your diet.

223
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.860
It'll sneak into your God. It'll sneak in.

224
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.340
And that's why there's an appreciation instead of a, uh,

225
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.530
instead of a, a condemnation &lt;affirmative&gt; of people that are different than us.
