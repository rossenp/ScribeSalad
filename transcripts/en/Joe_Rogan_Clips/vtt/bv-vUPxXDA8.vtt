<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.240
<v 2>In your documentary, you did a race, you tried to do a,</v>

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.920
an Iris, which is an amazing documentary. If you haven't seen it,

4
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:13.040
I recommend it highly, you did a race clean,

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.680
and then you were gonna do a race all juiced up and you went to him and he was

6
00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:21.630
the head of the Russian anti-doping Federation. Is that what, what it is? Yeah.

7
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:21.890
So.

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.830
<v 1>So Gregory Roche of, um, BA basically the premise was, um,</v>

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.270
is, is I,

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.270
I felt that the entire doping system in sport was a

11
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:37.910
fraud. And, and the reason why I, I, I had this belief was,

12
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.300
is I had, I had followed Lance Armstrong, my whole life,

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.900
a guy confesses in 2013. But if you had actually followed that story,

14
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.020
it's kind of like what you're saying about, you know,

15
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:51.300
Russia's band from the Olympics, but are not really banned.

16
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.180
And they just can't wear their outfit. Well, in the case of, of, of Lance, well,

17
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.900
yeah, he confessed to doping,

18
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.460
but the guy to this day never was actually caught.

19
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.850
And here's, this guy had passed, like, I don't know, five, 600 tests.

20
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.770
So as he confesses and I'd been a cycling fan, a lifelong cyclist,

21
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.210
I'm going, wait, wait, wait, um,

22
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.330
you caught the guy based on a, a criminal investigation,

23
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.480
but you didn't catch him based on the science. And if you can't test the most,

24
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.840
and if you can't catch the most tested athlete on planet earth, well,

25
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:30.280
what does this mean for every other athlete on planet earth?

26
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.760
And so the idea was, is I was gonna do like a supersize me in the world of, uh,

27
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.280
in the world of, of, um, sport. I was gonna race clean.

28
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.120
And then the next year I was gonna dope the hell outta myself,

29
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.830
take testosterone, HG H EPO. I mean,

30
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.230
uh, H C G uh, I was up to do anything. I mean, I was,

31
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.510
I was literally like E injecting myself with like, you know, it was like, uh,

32
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.870
10 syringes a day. It was just so stupid. And, uh, and then literally, like,

33
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.300
I'm going to getting blood test to like build, uh,

34
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:06.380
biological passport to like test my hematocrit.

35
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:11.340
So like every other week I'm literally going get my blood drawn. I'm to like,

36
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.861
you know,

37
00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:16.580
build like my whole steroid profile to basically try to evade

38
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:19.460
testing. So I get connected to this guy,

39
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:23.970
Gregory Rechov and at the time he's running Rua, which the,

40
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.290
uh, I'm sorry, the water lab, the world anti-doping lab, uh,

41
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.170
for Moscow, which is like the third largest, uh, you know,

42
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:37.130
anti-doping lab in the world at the time, uh, this is now, uh,

43
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:41.930
20 14, 20, 20, 15 and Gregory basis. Like, yes, I'll,

44
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:46.040
I'll help you dope and I'll help of a testing. And, uh,

45
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.920
I'll basically show you how you can game the system. And I'm like,

46
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.000
this is nuts.

47
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.080
Like the guy who just did all the testing for the Sochi

48
00:02:57.081 --> 00:03:01.920
Olympics and is running the entire anti-doping lab in Russia is basically

49
00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:06.920
gonna like test my samples and show me how to cheat, like what's going on here.

50
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.640
So the two of us start working, he comes to the United States,

51
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.320
he comes to Los Angeles. We have a great time. I then go do this next race,

52
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.790
completely doped outta my mind. And I'm like taking blood samples,

53
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.310
I'm taking urine. And right after this race, I hop on a plane.

54
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.550
I go to Moscow and I'm like hanging out with Gregory for like a month.

55
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.430
And he takes all my samples into the lab and there was this investigation

56
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:36.390
already going on. And I was like, okay, something's off here.

57
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.580
And so I spent this month in Russian, I come back,

58
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.700
what was the investigation that was already going on? So in, uh, in the,

59
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.980
in 2015, um,

60
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.620
wa releases in the, I can't remember exactly when it was, it was like early,

61
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.180
uh, like March of 2015, something like that.

62
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.170
The world anti-doping age agency had already been investigating the Moscow

63
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.930
laboratory. And they come out with this, uh,

64
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.130
with this report that they believe that Gregory Roche is like

65
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:16.570
the mastermind of this state sponsored doping operation.

66
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.440
And they've got a bunch of evidence, but they had no idea. It was like,

67
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.720
I mean, they had like, literally like the tip of a pinky and,

68
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.880
and the size of the scandal was basically, you know,

69
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.000
like an entire, an entire body. I mean,

70
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.840
and they literally just had the tip of the pinky,

71
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.910
but the tip of the pinky was so bad that they shut 10 on the

72
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.670
Moscow lab. Gregory is now the fall guy he's forced to resign.

73
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.590
And you know, and Putin's basically on television going like, look, look,

74
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.590
whatever you want to believe. None of this is true. We have never doped.

75
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.390
We don't cheat. These are all lies. Oh. And by the way,

76
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.963
says,

77
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.300
anybody who is responsible for this crime will be

78
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:08.134
punished.

79
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.980
So basically Putin is literally on television going Gregory Chekhov is,

80
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.860
is going under the bus and Gregory is in Moscow. And we had, you know,

81
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:23.050
been working together. He calls me up and he's like, but I am, but I,

82
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.290
I need to escape. And I'm like, um, uh, okay, when, when he's like,

83
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.010
now I need to leave now. And I'm like, uh, like, like now,

84
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.450
like as in now, he's like, yes, yes, I need the flight now.

85
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.400
And I'm literally sitting there on Skype and I start doing a search for

86
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.840
Moscow, Los Angeles. And I'm like, um, well, uh, there's,

87
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:50.520
there's a flight in like, uh, uh, 12 hours.

88
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.600
And he's like, okay. I'm like, you want me to book that flight? He's like, yes,

89
00:05:56.601 --> 00:05:58.920
book the flight. If I put it on my credit card, well, no,

90
00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:02.280
you'll have to put it on your credit card. So I literally booked this flight,

91
00:06:02.281 --> 00:06:05.560
put it on my credit card. And a day later,

92
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.640
here's Gregory in Los Angeles and about a

93
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:14.680
month into him being in LA. And you know, going down in Russia. I'm like, look,

94
00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:17.550
man, you gotta tell me what happened.

95
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.950
And he opens up and

96
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.350
you know, and that's was IOUs. I mean, it was.

97
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.030
<v 0>It's amazing. It was crazy the way it, it was unfolded in the documentary,</v>

98
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.710
it's it, it couldn't have been written better. Like if it was a drama,

99
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.540
it was a scripted drama. It could not have been written better.

100
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.660
And the fact that it was all just circumstance, just all happened,

101
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.620
all happened at the right time. It it's an amazing documentary.

102
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.380
And for a person like Jordan burrows who was here yesterday, it,

103
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.540
it was too much. He literally had to shut it off. I told,

104
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.450
I convinced him to watch the rest of it. I, you have to, I go, it's so good.

105
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.890
