00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.670
What was the research done with mice with myostatin inhibitors?

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.440
Did that not increase lifespan as well?

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.633
<v 1>Yeah, sure. I mean,</v>

5
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.830
a lot of things have extended extended lifespan a fair bit,

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.110
but what we have at the moment is not all the components of what I

7
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:22.860
just said. If you do something genetic to mice,

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.280
or if you do it to them throughout their lives,

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.600
then we can already get that year, year and a half out of mice. Certainly. Yeah.

10
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.010
Okay. But not if you start at 18 months, if you start at 18 months,

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.090
the best we can do it maybe four months. So that's the difference.

12
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.970
You've got to be able to start late and get the big extension,

13
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.300
and you're not going to get that without bonafide rejuvenation.

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.210
<v 0>So that's not going to come by way of genetics.</v>

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.540
<v 1>Well, even if it did come by with genetics, it wouldn't matter.</v>

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.520
It wouldn't persuade my colleagues or me that we were on the

17
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.970
brink of doing it for humans who have the misfortune of being already alive.

18
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.710
<v 0>Um, so the rejuvenation is going to come through some sort of biologics.</v>

19
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.590
<v 1>Yes. Through the kinds of things we're working on that I mentioned earlier,</v>

20
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.550
stem cells, gene therapy, to do various things, to introduce, for example,

21
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.630
bacterial enzymes that can break down waste products for analytics that I talked

22
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:17.280
about pharmaceuticals to do other things.

23
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.450
<v 0>Um, what about the use of CRISPR show? Well.</v>

24
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.300
<v 1>Chris was a very, very important part of this. So.</v>

25
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.510
<v 0>Can you please explain what CRISPR means when people don't know where we're</v>

26
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:28.344
talking about?

27
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.551
<v 1>Yes.</v>

28
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:33.090
So CRISPR is a technology that was first developed about eight years ago now,

29
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.220
and it is the exploitation of a bacterial

30
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:42.540
mechanism that allows bacteria to defend themselves against viruses.

31
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.060
Uh, essentially how it works is that it allows us to

32
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.110
change the sequence of our genome in a particular cell,

33
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.020
um, in a very specific way,

34
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.180
it's often called gene editing and there are other technologies for gene editing

35
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:03.150
that already existed before crest, but a very laborious,

36
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:06.780
very expensive and very clunky that is far, far cheaper and easier to use.

37
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.650
So what that does is it allows us, for example,

38
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:15.120
to inactivate a gene or for that matter to, um,

39
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.920
change the frequency of a gene from a mutant form into a normal

40
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:23.790
form so that it works when it was previously not working now,

41
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.830
doing that in the laboratory in a Petri dish is fair enough. The question is,

42
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:32.970
can we do it in the body? And initially, no,

43
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.330
initially this technology was too error prone.

44
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.060
It was prone to do what,

45
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.890
what George Church has called genetic vandalism and, um, make,

46
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.800
have what's called off target effects. In other words,

47
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:50.550
basically do other changes to the genome elsewhere that you didn't want,

48
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.901
but of course,

49
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:54.360
people have known this and people who've have been working really hard to

50
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:55.500
improve the technology.

51
00:02:55.501 --> 00:03:00.310
And it's getting to the point now where it's possible to actually use it on

52
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.240
humans. Maybe, you know, it's getting, it's getting there. Um,

53
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.630
now you can't do everything with CRISPR.

54
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.680
One thing you definitely can't do with CRISPR is insert new genes into the

55
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:13.930
genome. And that's something we really need to be able to do.

56
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.060
But actually one of our big projects is a kind of two step thing where we use

57
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.370
CRISPR to make a small change to the genome that allows us to insert last

58
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.790
genes where we couldn't previously. Um, so yeah,

59
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.450
so CRISPR is huge and it's, you've not only in aging research,

60
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.280
but across the whole board of biomedical world.

61
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.570
<v 0>That's, uh, they have done some work in China,</v>

62
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.370
apparently on live human beings.

63
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.751
<v 1>Very controversial.</v>

64
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:45.220
What happened was that a group in China use CRISPR

65
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:50.140
to alter the DNA of embryos that were going to be used for

66
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:52.390
IVF for a bit of elevation.

67
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.980
And the change that was made was itself.

68
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.450
Quite a curious one,

69
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.850
essentially what they did was they tried to change a gene called CCR five

70
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.150
into a mutant form that doesn't work,

71
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.100
but that in an inactive form protects the body

72
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.260
from infection by HIV.

73
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.160
This is something that was discovered a long time ago. Um,

74
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.720
and maybe 1% of people have this genotype. Um,

75
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.230
and so this was introduced, unfortunately, first of all,

76
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:31.060
it probably wasn't done very well, but also, well, what people looked at the,

77
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.900
uh, at the process and it probably didn't,

78
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.950
they probably didn't make the correct, um, modification. Uh,

79
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.780
but also it's not clear whether doing it for someone lifelong is actually a

80
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:45.190
good thing, because as I say,

81
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:48.100
it's an inactivation of a gene that must exist for a reason,

82
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:49.390
or it wouldn't exist at all. Right.

83
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.990
<v 0>We'll have a side-effect of increased intelligence.</v>

84
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.950
<v 1>That is complete speculation, isn't it? Yes. Why.</v>

85
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.750
<v 0>What would cause them to speculate that.</v>

86
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.490
<v 1>People speculate all the time?</v>

87
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.900
<v 0>That's just like clickbait stuff that gets people excited about it. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

88
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.770
Okay.

89
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.710
<v 1>Um, but yeah, so anyway, the other thing was that there's not,</v>

90
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.000
it's not obvious why it's even worthwhile to make

91
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.750
an embryo genetically resistant to HIV. First of all,

92
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:20.050
they don't have HIV yet in the first place and they may never get it.

93
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.921
And secondly,

94
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:24.640
we've got drugs that worked pretty well to control HIV antiretroviral. So, um,

95
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.470
yeah. So, um,

96
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.950
so it's not obvious why this was a sensible thing to do in the first place.

97
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.190
However, it's certainly got a whole bunch of debate going. Um.

98
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.070
<v 0>Yeah. Well, when I hear about something like that, I always assume,</v>

99
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.360
first of all, I mean, just American prejudice. You assume that it's in China,

100
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:42.100
they're doing something crazy. Right.

101
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.510
And you also assume that if they're telling you about someone who's been

102
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:47.050
altered,

103
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.970
that means that they've probably been doing this for a decade or since CRISPR

104
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:55.660
was initially initiated eight years ago. You never know. Yeah. You never know.

105
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.280
It's just, it's interesting to me. And, um,

106
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.310
I don't want them to do it on people, but when they do do it on people,

107
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:04.280
I'm fascinated, you know, it's, I don't.

108
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.481
<v 1>Well, that's right. I mean,</v>

109
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:10.190
that's the attitude that I have and a lot of people have to medical tourism in

110
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:13.430
general so that the, um, you know,

111
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.590
th these are not adequately regulated treatments and

112
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.650
they are certainly not adequately characterized. In other words,

113
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.060
the people who get the treatments are people who pay for them rather than people

114
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.890
who have been chosen to be in a standardized group of any kind.

115
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.900
And that tends to be very little follow-up,

116
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.250
but still it's better than nothing in the sense that, um, you know,

117
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:38.090
some information exists about the efficacy and safety of these treatments as a

118
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:40.370
result, the more that exists, the better,

119
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.010
the more that people who are administering these treatments can be India to

120
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.990
reveal that day. So the better, you know, even if it's anonymized, um,

121
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.620
but you know, uh, other P other, some scientists,

122
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.490
quite a lot of scientists take a much stronger view that, you know,

123
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:02.720
we just should oppose all of this period. And we should just say, you know,

124
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.090
everyone who, who indulges,

125
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.990
who gives treatments to people in off shore places should be shut down as much

126
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.680
as best we can and should be demonized. I don't really think that's true.

127
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:14.060
I think there's a halfway house.

128
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.370
<v 0>Um, personally, I've had, uh, my, my family,</v>

129
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:23.900
my mother has gone to Panama twice and she was on the verge of a knee

130
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.820
replacement. And now she walks without pain.

131
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.590
<v 1>Yeah. I bet you bet actually went to Neil Riordan clinic. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

132
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.080
I mean, there are a lot of people who have very good stories,

133
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:35.330
I of nails group and, um, I,

134
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.730
of course the thing is you don't know, unless someone has a really bad story,

135
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.020
whether things are going wrong. So, um, I mean,

136
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:47.390
I don't know whether Neil release his numbers,

137
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.330
that the total number of patients per year, that he treats.

138
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.890
So we don't know what hit rates.

139
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.840
<v 0>Yeah. I don't know. I just do know that I have, uh, speaking, spoken to, uh,</v>

140
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.350
several fighters from the UFC that have gone down there. And again,

141
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:03.350
my mother was, I mean, she didn't want to get a knee replacement.

142
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.980
So when I sent her down there and it took key,

143
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:09.920
she's 52, she's 73.

144
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:15.200
So it took her somewhere around six to eight months before

145
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:17.990
she started feeling anything. She was really worried that it wasn't gonna work.

146
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.950
But then at eight months in just the pain just went away and it's continued to

147
00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:22.341
get better.

148
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:25.070
And then I sent her down a second time and I'm going to keep sending her down

149
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:27.440
there. It's just, it's at a pretty profound effect,

150
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:31.700
but what's fascinating to me is they do three days of intravenous therapy.

151
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.310
And the intravenous therapy has,

152
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.320
I don't know if it's just my imagination, but she looks younger. Like she looks,

153
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.290
she looks more vibrant. You know, like when I saw her,

154
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:44.960
she came to my house for Christmas. I mean, she looked better.

155
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:48.020
She looked a year younger than she did the last time I saw her.

156
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.780
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, um, you know,</v>

157
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.160
this is what we would hope that stem cell therapy with this,

158
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.130
but I remind you of what I said about that original pocket since trial for more

159
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:03.130
than 25 years ago for 15 years, really didn't know that one.

160
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.190
That was right. Exactly.

161
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:08.610
So only a few people benefited the people who did benefit, benefit,

162
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.970
benefited enormously, but huge numbers of people had no benefits.

163
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.190
Now that is the kind of stage that we're in for a lot

164
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.810
of stem cell therapies.

165
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:23.760
Right now Parkinson's disease is a kind of outlier in the sense that the

166
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:26.940
desired function of the stem cell is really well understood.

167
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:32.040
So what kinds of stem cells to introduce into the body and where to introduce

168
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:34.440
them is not in doubt.

169
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.440
Most of themselves therapies are not that far along.

170
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:39.570
So every time anyone gets treated right now,

171
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:43.860
it's still an experiment and that's okay up to a point,

172
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.320
but it does mean that we're all learning curve and it's vital

173
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.120
to have the people like now who are administering the therapy to quite a lot of

174
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:57.450
people to actually not just, you know,

175
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.960
live off the stories of,

176
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.550
of high-profile people who get good benefits and talk them up,

177
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.710
but actually to go and release the full data unexpurgated,

178
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.220
you know, including any negative stuff and including follow-up,

179
00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:15.054
that's the key thing,

180
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.400
because so many therapies in regenerative medicine in general have the

181
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:25.260
potential to be beneficial over the first few months to a year or whatever.

182
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.460
And then to start having side effects that are detrimental,

183
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.400
what have you heard that are detrimental side effects? So what of course,

184
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:36.180
the biggest thing that we always have to worry about is cancer,

185
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.200
because I think it's true for a whole bunch of things, you know, telomerase,

186
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.880
activators, and so on. The thing is that aging can,

187
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:49.830
in some senses be characterized as a trade-off between cancer

188
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.230
and everything else. In other words,

189
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:57.120
a huge amount of what goes wrong with the body late in

190
00:10:57.121 --> 00:11:01.380
life is the result of a kind of dialing down of

191
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.850
regenerative functions that we actually do naturally have in the body,

192
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.650
but which are not as active in older people as they are in younger people.

193
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.830
And so of course we have to ask, why are they less active?

194
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.560
And a lot of biologists, including myself,

195
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.850
believe that a huge part of part of that is adaptive. In other words,

196
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.500
it is kind of the body recognizing that

197
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.780
there is, as time goes on,

198
00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:32.460
I progressively higher number of cells in the body that are almost cancerous and

199
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:36.090
that have to be kind of kept in check in order not to become properly cancerous

200
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.201
because of course,

201
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:40.560
cancer is the result of a gradual accumulation of mutations and so on in the

202
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.500
cell. Right. Um, and so yes, um,

203
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.910
every time that you are improving regenerative capacity,

204
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.770
whether of the cells that you put in,

205
00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:54.280
or more importantly of the cells that are nearby, the cells you put in, um,

206
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.930
you are potentially taking a risk of hastening,

207
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:01.450
the onset of actual cancer.
