00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I saw the one guy, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.430
you've got dqued right? Yeah. Yeah. That's brutal.

3
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:11.220
Just a straight knee to the face while you're on the ground. Yeah.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.210
<v 1>Super unfortunate. And one of his coaches was yelling, just punches,</v>

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:20.130
just punches. Oh yeah. Marcos tomato. Who's a, the, uh, his name is nicknames.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.470
[inaudible] is the jiu-jitsu coach.

7
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:25.860
And one of the coaches for American top team and he's yelling out, just punches,

8
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:26.694
just punches.

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.680
And then someone else in the coach is yelling Russian in Russia. And they're,

10
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.340
you know, the yellow won't appeal to, to hit him. And, you know,

11
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:40.200
cause he's thinking that the guys it's confusing to some fighters.

12
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:43.890
When is a downed opponent, a grounded opponent is technically.

13
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.920
<v 0>I'm sure if he's hunched over, it's like, wait, is this foot, is his knee down?</v>

14
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:47.754
Or is.

15
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.880
<v 1>Well, here's the thing. If you have your feet down, but one hand down,</v>

16
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:52.410
you're not grounded. If you have to,

17
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.200
maybe Nevada's still Nevada uses a hybrid version of

18
00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:02.400
the new, uh, mixed martial arts rules. It used to be,

19
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.640
um, anytime you had a hand down at all,

20
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.640
you were a grounded opponent and then they switched it to,

21
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.770
if you have two hands down, you're grounded opponent.

22
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.740
But if you have a knee down, you're a grounded opponent.

23
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.300
So he had a knee and two hands. So he was, he was grounded. I mean, it was like,

24
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:19.890
there was no question about it. He was grounded,

25
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:24.450
but I think maybe he thought he was coming up and peeled or tried to catch him,

26
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.080
catch him as he was coming up. But it was a hundred percent illegal. Yeah.

27
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.100
I mean that's so you could see it here at sea. He see he's got one hand down.

28
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.430
Yeah. He's got one hand. No, it doesn't have both of his hands.

29
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.190
So maybe that's what he thought.

30
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.980
Maybe it was because the knee was down in both hands were up.

31
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:44.100
He thought he wasn't grounded. Yeah. Maybe that's why he was confused,

32
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.350
but it's a hundred percent.

33
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.270
<v 0>Illegal for both of them. See if.</v>

34
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.020
<v 1>You, you hear your coach yelling, hit them, see, see,</v>

35
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:55.860
even I'm like thinking like, okay, is that grounded or is not grounded.

36
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.370
I know it's I know it's grounded because this has come up before,

37
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.180
because it used to be that when your hands were down, then it was grounded.

38
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.970
Yeah. But then big John McCarthy explained to me, no, no, no.

39
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.410
Anything other than the surface of your feet on your legs, like, so your knee,

40
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.930
if your knee is down, that means you're grounded opponent.

41
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.620
<v 0>Like w would that guy like, is he coming over from a different fighting league?</v>

42
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.890
<v 1>He's the champion. No, he's the champion. It's just,</v>

43
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.100
there's different versions of the rules. Right? In some places,

44
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.830
a grounded opponent. You,

45
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.300
what is the new version of the, the rule? There's a,

46
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.110
one of the new versions of the rule is if you are putting weight on your hand,

47
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.950
so like, you can touch it, but you can't, if you have weight on it,

48
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:40.050
then you're grounded opponent. But if you're just touching,

49
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.480
that's not a grounded opponent. All right. That's.

50
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.370
<v 0>As soon as you allow opinion to come in, it's like,</v>

51
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.310
well then there's the debate on like, was that the right call, bad call?

52
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:53.490
It's like just set up a clear definitive rule. Right?

53
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.320
<v 1>Well, there's other folks that also think, well,</v>

54
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:56.880
why isn't that illegal technique? Well,

55
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:59.470
how could we go punch him in the face again, NEMA in the face. This is stupid.

56
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.230
Like, why can't you get, well, how come you can't kick them in the face?

57
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.770
How come when a guy's lying on his back, he can kick you in the face,

58
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:07.210
but you can't kick him in the face.

59
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.560
That seems stupid to from 2018 Nevada rules on it. This is the new,

60
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.700
the Nevada has a hybrid version. It didn't adopt a new ground rule, I think,

61
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.560
unless they've changed it since then. Yeah.

62
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:20.170
I think this is to be considered grounded.

63
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.910
This is a more technical piece.

64
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.540
The new rules pertains to that of a grounded opponent,

65
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.060
which states a fighter must have both of their hands down on the ground,

66
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:32.800
whether it's be palms or fists for them to be considered grounded unless a knee

67
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:36.640
or anything other than the soul's kicks or knee strikes to the head of a

68
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:40.780
grounded Stryker or fighter rather, therefore is illegal. However,

69
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:43.540
the Nevada state athletic commission will not be adopting this part of the new

70
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.990
rules. And we're stick with the old definition for grounded fighter,

71
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:49.930
which means anything but the soles of the feet. Okay.

72
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.770
So that's why it's confusing. So the grounded opponent thing,

73
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:56.560
the fighter must have both their hands down on the ground.

74
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:57.610
That's what it used to be.

75
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.800
Whether it be palms or fist for them to be considered grounded unless a knee or

76
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:04.900
other than the soles of the feet are down as well.

77
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.380
So either way he was grounded because there was a knee down.

78
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.660
So it was a illegal technique all over the world. That one, that move,

79
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.770
which is unfortunate. I mean,

80
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:17.350
that's going to suck for him of like he was winning the fight too.

81
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.710
That's what sucked pewter Yon was a, he,

82
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:23.710
it looked like he was starting to gain control of the fight.

83
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.870
And I think it was in the fourth round. Was it the fourth round?

84
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.260
It was a good fight though. Really good fight.

85
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.970
And I'm sure they're going to have a rematch.

86
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.820
And the rematch will be super hyped up, you know,

87
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.540
but he had dropped Aljamain and he had taken him down and tripped him,

88
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:39.280
slammed him to the ground a few times.

89
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:42.430
And it looked like he was in control of exchanges, but,

90
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.540
