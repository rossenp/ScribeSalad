00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I haven't done it. I haven't done it.</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.350
I haven't traveled to England since the whole Brexit thing has been going on.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.560
<v 1>I did, I went through touring and it should've just been like,</v>

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.000
just hop on a plane to go to your other countries. You just stuck in customs,

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.010
hoping someone comes for you. Okay.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.730
<v 0>I don't know enough about the arguments pro and con to comment on it honestly.</v>

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.760
<v 1>Well then it truly doesn't matter cause we don't have a vote in it, but I.</v>

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.640
<v 0>Know the dude looks like a British version of Donald Trump.</v>

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.940
He looks like he's got up yellow hair.

10
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:33.210
The whole deal literally looks like their version of Trump. Like a.

11
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.100
<v 1>Wonkier. If it's possible younger.</v>

12
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.070
<v 0>Wonky or hotter, he's a little hotter.</v>

13
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.630
<v 1>And they say America sneezes. The rest of the world catches a cold, you know,</v>

14
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:43.890
like we do something. People will start to.

15
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.790
<v 0>Imagine if dudes with up blonde hair, just start taking over the world.</v>

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.280
<v 1>I feel like that was Hitler's vision.</v>

17
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.230
Like I feel like that's where they were headed.

18
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.400
<v 0>That was right. It was crazy. It was like Hitler didn't look like.</v>

19
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.090
<v 1>Brown hair. I think he even had like a Jewish grandma, brown eyes,</v>

20
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.150
every Juno's this Jewish grandma. I think it's something like that.

21
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.100
<v 0>Look at that guy. Come on. He.</v>

22
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.933
<v 1>Looks like.</v>

23
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.260
<v 0>Take it away. He's not hotter. He's just younger. When Trump was younger,</v>

24
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:11.820
he was way hotter than that too. No, that guy's.

25
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.730
<v 1>Terrible. Terrible looking.</v>

26
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.100
<v 0>You know, a lot of Trump's supporters this weekend is Colby.</v>

27
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:21.090
Covington was fighting in the UFC and he's a big Trump supporter.

28
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.370
<v 1>You know, I gotta say this. This is not pro-Trump,</v>

29
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.880
but this is pro your own rights. We have this thing in California.

30
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.250
I said something. I was in a writer's room.

31
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.180
And I said something about someone who I knew that voted for my family that

32
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:36.690
voted for Donald Trump. And they, someone was like,

33
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.770
someone in your family voted for Donald Trump. Do you still speak to them?

34
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.670
And I was like, don't get hyphy with me. This idea that you can't.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.830
I understand he represents all these horrible things,

36
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:51.270
but we have to be able to have conversations in this country and

37
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.150
on both sides and other liberals at times.

38
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.060
And I say this as a person who's fairly liberal, it's terrifying.

39
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.440
Just attacking your own allies and creating no space for a conversation.

40
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.610
<v 0>Liberals used to be when I was a kid and my parents are hippies.</v>

41
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.770
And we lived in San Francisco when I was a little kid.

42
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.190
And so I always thought of liberals as being the people that were like,

43
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.160
open-minded, you know, uh,

44
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.440
not wanting to silence people,

45
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:20.790
letting people speak their all about people, just being whoever they are,

46
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.250
who they are and not,

47
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:25.980
not trying to enforce like rigid patterns of behavior and thought on people.

48
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.190
But that's not the case now because they think they're doing the right thing

49
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.300
because they think they're combating something that's awful and aggressive and

50
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:34.800
regressive, you know,

51
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.040
that's something that is that they feel like the country that they know and love

52
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:39.810
is slipping away. So they're.

53
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.030
<v 1>Conservative. So does everyone, but.</v>

54
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.400
<v 0>Their response to it is not the right way to go about it.</v>

55
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.880
The response to it is a show. A great example of what your,

56
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.010
your ideology represents by being a good person by being

57
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:57.630
open-minded by being kind. Instead, people are being super, super.

58
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.740
There's so many super people that think they're doing the right thing because

59
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:05.200
they're progressive and all they they'll. They want good things.

60
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.060
They want gay rights and they want racial equality and they want people to be

61
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:11.920
able to make more money. And they want people to be.

62
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.390
<v 1>Attacking anyone who from the get-go doesn't agree with you because by the way,</v>

63
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.291
if you,

64
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:20.770
if you and I disagree and you calmly want to have a conversation with me,

65
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:24.430
I am very open to having my mind change. Of course,

66
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:26.800
I want to be on the right side and I want to do the best thing.

67
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.040
If you yell at me and you call me stupid,

68
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.400
call me over and you're attacking me and you're on the defense from the get go

69
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.310
you're on the offense from the get-go. But just as a person with pride,

70
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.390
you're going to want to be like, you know what?

71
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.780
I don't want to hear it and you because you represent now all the good

72
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:44.680
intentions, like you're the representative of all that. And I don't like you.

73
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.260
So you are, um, you're an ambassador for your cause when you speak,

74
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.680
I'm really into the environment and plastic and stuff like that.

75
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.790
And I am very specific about how, and when I post about things,

76
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.950
because you don't want people to get activism, fatigue,

77
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.040
and you don't want to be the person who posts about everything,

78
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:04.750
because then no one will listen to anything.

79
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.490
And you don't want to call people out specifically because just because somebody

80
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.400
carried a plastic bottle that day doesn't mean they don't drive a hybrid.

81
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.260
You don't know what people are doing. That's literally what I'm thinking of.

82
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.390
And while I love that, he did that. Part of me is like,

83
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.590
that's a little holier than now. Shamed him. Jason Momo is so hot, so hot.

84
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.120
So he's not, but we were so, especially online.

85
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.460
We're so quick to be like, you're not doing it right.

86
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.070
We do it with feminism too. And you have no idea,

87
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.890
the pious good life that person is leading.

88
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.490
And you're judging them on a snapshot on which you don't want to be judged.

89
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.190
<v 0>Well, they want to judge people. The thing is about,</v>

90
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.580
it's a lot of what this is about people that are on the fringes.

91
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.430
It's the ideas are great, right?

92
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.090
But the people that want attention for espousing, these great ideas,

93
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.530
oftentimes are the fringe. So the far left and the far right? A lot of it,

94
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:57.364
what it is,

95
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.260
it's just people that are ultra aggressive about enforcing their ideology.

96
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:05.170
And then they're really and they want other people to comply.

97
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.590
And so you get these people that represent the right and the people that

98
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:13.240
represent the left, but a lot of the ideas of the right and left way,

99
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:15.370
there's nothing wrong with being fiscally conservative.

100
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:16.900
There's nothing wrong with being socially.

101
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.370
<v 1>True. Republican is, and you want less government in your money.</v>

102
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.640
<v 0>The room in there for conversation. But when you go far, right,</v>

103
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:26.530
and then you go far left, then there's no room.

104
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.280
<v 1>And when you start vilifying people from the get-go, uh,</v>

105
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.810
and when you start expecting people, I Owen Benjamin,

106
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.080
who was just basically as like in a tinfoil hat somewhere,

107
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.280
and like living off the grid, he offended a lot of people. Right.

108
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.380
You just staring at me. Oh. Uh, and he said a bunch of stuff about trans stuff.

109
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.660
And I remember there was this girl that I was friends with

110
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:54.550
on social media. Didn't know her, but just followed her.

111
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.790
Cause I liked her writing. That's it. And she dams me one day and she's like,

112
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.760
she's like, oh, and Benjamin, like, how could you be like, maybe I had,

113
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.910
I don't know if I'd interacted with him on Twitter. I I'm never on Twitter.

114
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.020
Cause I think it's a toxic hole. Uh, and she was like, she's getting mad at me.

115
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.030
And I go, what are you talking about? She was like, he said, oh,

116
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:13.010
this stuff that's anti-trans and I hadn't heard anything.

117
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.370
<v 0>Well, let me, let me say what he said. Okay. And here's the thing.</v>

118
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.040
He went off into a spiral. Right.

119
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.640
But I agree with what he said,

120
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.040
what he said was there was someone that he knew someone who works in Hollywood

121
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.940
that had a three-year-old that they were turning trans.

122
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.830
And he said that that was child abuse.

123
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.540
That was what led I don't disagree with this crazy situation. Totally. No,

124
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:41.080
I agree with it. A hundred percent disagree with that. Yeah. I agree with him,

125
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.810
the child, a hundred.

126
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.510
<v 1>Percent child decide what it's eating. Right.</v>

127
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.350
<v 0>So that's somebody who had a great joke. You don't let, I always say this.</v>

128
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:49.880
I wish I could remember who, who it was.

129
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.980
They said you don't let a kid pick their outfit.

130
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.090
Why the would you let them pick their gender for the rest of the day? Yeah.

131
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.740
But it's somebody did it already. Right?

132
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.050
<v 1>I'm not going to do the joke. Uh,</v>

133
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.150
but so that aside and the spiral side, which I didn't even participate,

134
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.610
like it's whatever, like those are your choices. That's what you're saying.

135
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.713
I had known that, that.

136
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.850
<v 0>Here's the thing that cost him dearly.</v>

137
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.440
His agency left him and then comedy clubs banned him for that. That was the.

138
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.240
<v 1>Beginning. Just steered into that skid.</v>

139
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.120
<v 0>Well that's but that's what started the skid. Right?</v>

140
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.680
What started the skin was that.

141
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.130
<v 1>About like, he called someone who had written a look,</v>

142
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.600
this that's not the point of what I'm saying.

143
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.740
<v 0>Went south.</v>

144
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.980
<v 1>Afterwards. You have to manage those things. My point was, I knew none of this.</v>

145
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:35.360
So I'm just like going to brunch one day and this person starts attacking me

146
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.630
offline. How can you be friends with them? And I go, whoa,

147
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.210
what are you talking about? She's like, he's saying all these horrible things.

148
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:44.270
And I she's in my like direct message.

149
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.310
And this is my only point is I said, I've known Owen, most of my career.

150
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.590
Let me go read what you're talking about.

151
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.520
And she was angry at me for wanting to gather information.

152
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.000
This person is a trans writer who I literally,

153
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:02.750
until that moment didn't know was trans because I was just a fan based on merit.

154
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:05.030
Like I just liked the writing. And I said,

155
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.890
how dare you shame on you as a journalist, you should applaud that.

156
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:11.240
I go and collect my facts.

157
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.940
<v 0>Compliance like immediate instantaneous.</v>

158
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.330
<v 1>And I said, I'm an ally. And I am pro trans and I'm pro gay rights.</v>

159
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.950
But you do not get to bark at me on a Sunday morning when I've no idea what

160
00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:23.450
we're talking about and get mad at me.

161
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.141
<v 0>I just have to tell you,</v>

162
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:26.720
I don't trust anyone who says they're an ally about anything.

163
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.020
But you say that if you say I'm an ally.

164
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.000
<v 1>Anything I'm antitrust, not a buy on it.</v>

165
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.680
<v 0>I vote. Kate's Mrs. Doubtfire, alpha ally.</v>

166
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.120
She is just the term allies gross. It's it's okay. When other people use it,

167
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:43.670
like he's an ally that guy's an ally. She's an ally. I get that.

168
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.280
That's a good way to use it. But when you say I'm an ally, I'm like, yeah.

169
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.420
<v 1>Okay, well, I'm pro trans good for you. And I,</v>

170
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.070
and I blocked that person. I was like,

171
00:08:52.071 --> 00:08:56.160
you don't get to bark at me and tell me for any, cause yeah.

172
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.900
<v 0>I too many people live on Twitter. It's not good. It's not healthy. Folks.</v>

173
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.040
<v 1>I talk to people. Twitter is it's become like a subway bathroom wall.</v>

174
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.410
<v 0>Michelle Wolf told me the exact same thing last week.</v>

175
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:08.244
She doesn't have it on her phone.

176
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.300
<v 1>Because you're just screaming into a void. And all it does is just, uh,</v>

177
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.290
it just nets negativity. So they're just waiting for you to up by the way,

178
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.900
anybody who's ever said anything awful to me on Twitter,

179
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.530
who I've seen in person, they say nothing and I'm yeah.

180
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.430
<v 0>I'm probably the only way people should talk is face to face. Yeah.</v>

181
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.860
Louis C K said that to me. We were talking about this and he said,

182
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:30.840
it's just talk, but it's written down.

183
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.060
So people think it's like more than it is.
