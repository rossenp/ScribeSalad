00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.200
<v 1>I do not think, uh, polyamorous folks are on the right track.</v>

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.200
I think that what they're up to is, I mean,

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.840
I know from the ones who are serious about it and talk about it,

5
00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:16.200
that even within the polyamorous community,

6
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:19.880
there's a recognition about just how difficult it is to make it work. Um,

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.510
but I don't really want to interfere with their right to do it.

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.990
I would like to be able to talk about whether it's a good idea,

9
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.750
whether it has societal implications that we should be a aware of,

10
00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:29.550
but by how do.

11
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.790
<v 2>You feel like they're not on the right track and isn't everyone's track. I mean,</v>

12
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.830
if we can accept trans folk and we can accept, uh,

13
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.910
women to subscribe to cultural norms and wearing high heels and makeup in the

14
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:44.180
worst place, can't we accept polyamorous behavior and what's, so that.

15
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.980
<v 1>That's what I'm telling you, is that difficult though?</v>

16
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.820
I personally would counsel somebody if you know, and I,

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.260
I have had this conversation with many students, for example, um,

18
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.020
I would counsel them away from it because I think it actually prioritizes

19
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.250
one thing which is desirable, but that the call of it is very, very high.

20
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.530
Um, and what does it prioritize?

21
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.370
It prioritizes not locking yourself into a

22
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:12.130
single sexual relationship.

23
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.090
And I think there's a way in which there is a terror that surrounds locking

24
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.170
yourself into a single sexual relationship.

25
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.730
And part of the terror goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning

26
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:25.280
of the, if you think that, um,

27
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.840
beauty max is maxed out at 20,

28
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.720
and then it wanes over life. Then as a woman,

29
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.920
you're trapped in this terrible situation where you've got this power

30
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.030
long before you know what to do with it, and it's going to evaporate.

31
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.190
So you better capitalize that.

32
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.110
And if you're a man you're very frightened that you're gonna get into a

33
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:49.730
relationship,

34
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.230
and then you're gonna watch this person that you love fall apart in front of

35
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:56.430
your eyes. And you're gonna be, you know,

36
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.710
you're gonna be caught in that situation.

37
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.550
And I don't think this is the reality of a Parabon.

38
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.580
I think the reality of a Parabon is way better than we fear, but that,

39
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:11.220
because we've got this overly simplistic mythology surrounding it,

40
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.940
a lot of people are trying to solve that problem.

41
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.340
How do I not get locked into that relationship?

42
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:18.940
That's going to trap me with somebody who's how do I not get bored decaying in

43
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:20.940
front of me? Right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, yeah, I.

44
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.300
<v 2>Don't think it's a decaying thing. I, I would push back against that.</v>

45
00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:25.290
I'm would say, people just want more variety.

46
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.450
They just want they're attracted to other people and they want to act on that.

47
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.650
And if they find a partner who is also willing to do that and they stay

48
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.370
together, I don't see what would be the issue if they wanted to.

49
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.610
<v 1>Do it. Well, I'm, I'm,</v>

50
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.410
I'm telling you specifically that I don't wanna stop them from doing it,

51
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:43.810
but I do want people to think very carefully about the issues. I mean,

52
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.200
I'm just speaking as one guy who's lived one life. Um,

53
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.400
the value that I get out of, um,

54
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.960
having as close to perfect security at home,

55
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.640
as I can have in a relationship, I mean,

56
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.800
Heather and I have been all over the world.

57
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.840
We've taken our kids into parts of the Amazon that are four

58
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:14.840
hours by boat from the nearest road, right. This is not a boring relationship.

59
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.990
This relationship has been a non-stop adventure. Right. But no, one's.

60
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.710
<v 2>Trying to push polyamory on you. Right?</v>

61
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.430
<v 1>Well, a, I wouldn't say that that's true.</v>

62
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.430
I would say that the people are not as an individual,

63
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.870
but what I would say is they are promoting an idea that this

64
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.510
is the sophisticated way to live. It's the wave of the future, if they really,

65
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.230
yeah. And how common is this? Is this well, I mean,

66
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:42.020
you mentioned sex at Dawn yourself. And so the idea is.

67
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.900
<v 2>Yeah, but Chris is my friend and he is crazy.</v>

68
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.780
<v 1>There you go. But what I.</v>

69
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.300
<v 2>Would say, but he believes it, he might be right.</v>

70
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.500
<v 1>He does believe it. And I, you know, I, for him, it is right.</v>

71
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.540
I have been convinced by, uh, a friend, you know,

72
00:03:56.541 --> 00:03:58.820
who I had a longstanding argument with on this topic.

73
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.530
And what he convinced me is that a friend who is polyamorous, yes,

74
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.810
a friend who is polyamorous,

75
00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:08.290
and this friend has convinced me that it can be accomplished that there's

76
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:11.370
somewhere to get, but he acknowledges that it actually, um,

77
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.130
in the case that he points to took several generations, um,

78
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.530
literally several generations to arrive at a stable, uh, situation. But.

79
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.640
<v 2>You guys have a wonderful relationship though.</v>

80
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.400
I know many people who have terrible, terrible relationships. And for them, the,

81
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.440
the notion of monogamy seems absurd. It seems like a trap that you get stuck in,

82
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.840
you grow to resent each other,

83
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.240
you and then you get sick of each other and then you fight in court until you

84
00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:36.840
figure out who gets all the money. Totally. Right.

85
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.480
<v 3>I would say, you know, those people shouldn't be together,</v>

86
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.640
obviously I think you're right.

87
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.230
But then the is a conflation between polyamory and promiscuity, right?

88
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.430
That just a free for all a sex with strangers free for all mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

89
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.190
is different from the kind of careful approach to

90
00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.710
polyamory that this friend takes,

91
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:58.550
which still looks extraordinarily difficult to pull off given

92
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.940
what human beings are from a jealousy.

93
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.900
<v 2>Perspective, but isn't monogamy extraordinarily difficult to pull off. I mean,</v>

94
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.780
isn't the rate of divorce in this country alone. It's somewhere around 50%.

95
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.340
And Chris rock famously said, that's just 50% who had the courage to leave.

96
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.820
How many coward still? Well.

97
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.780
<v 1>But here, but this is, this is part of the point about novelty.</v>

98
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.850
We are living in a situation where our narratives sell us a false picture

99
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.330
of our opportunities. Um,

100
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.050
our narratives are partially driven by an economy that wants us to be insecure

101
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:34.370
enough to spend money like crazy. Um,

102
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.770
and so I'm not telling people that they should live one way

103
00:05:39.771 --> 00:05:43.640
or the other I'm telling them that they should UN understand what their real

104
00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:44.560
options are.

105
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.760
And polyamory as an experiment is all well and good.

106
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.880
But what happens when you introduce children into the mix,

107
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.600
right? That's very, very different.

108
00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.280
It's very different because children are so costly to raise.

109
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.840
And because human males are wired to fear raising

110
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.240
offspring that they themselves did not produce genetically. Now,

111
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.200
I don't think it makes sense to actually care very much about your genes

112
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.520
and advancing their interests.

113
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.910
I think this is something evolution has stuck us with that is not valuable.

114
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.630
It's actually destructive it's so nonetheless, we can potentially move past,

115
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.990
but we are wired for it.

116
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.870
And so what I'm expecting to happen is if you, uh,

117
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:33.150
have a large scale experiment in polyamory,

118
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.100
what it's going to do is it is going to break into

119
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.980
polygeny and it is gonna break down into single motherhood

120
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.460
as men leave these relationships in order to engage in perhaps more

121
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.060
polyamory with younger women. And it's going to be yet one more thing that is,

122
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.260
uh, unevenly distributed between the sexes. So.

123
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.370
<v 2>Choose your mate wisely. Well.</v>

124
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.450
<v 1>Choose your mate wisely,</v>

125
00:07:00.451 --> 00:07:04.330
but we don't even realize that we are interfering with your ability to do that

126
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.610
in ways that we don't. Um, we don't Intuit.

127
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.730
We have a landscape in which nobody, uh,

128
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.090
is paying attention to the way we are interfering in the normal processes.

129
00:07:15.091 --> 00:07:19.560
That would cause you to find a mate with whom you might have a very rewarding,

130
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.113
uh.

131
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.400
<v 2>Lifelong processes. Are you referring.</v>

132
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.360
<v 1>To, well, let me take an absurd one. Okay.</v>

133
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.120
We have no idea what effect deodorant is having &lt;laugh&gt;

134
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.200
on us choosing the right mate. We do know that in studies that, um,

135
00:07:34.201 --> 00:07:38.240
there are molecules that you can't consciously tell you're detecting that do

136
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.390
affect mate choice. And we know that we're interfering with that stuff. Well.

137
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.430
<v 2>We know that birth control affects that as well as well. Women's ability,</v>

138
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.830
promot, birth control. Yeah.

139
00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:50.430
Specifically woman's ability to smell whether or not she's even genetically

140
00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:51.030
compatible with.

141
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.870
<v 1>A man. Absolutely. And which is.</v>

142
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.110
<v 2>Really freaky. It's like those lizards, how do they know? Right.</v>

143
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.620
They just just know rubbing up against each other, get a sense. So.

144
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.380
<v 1>I think, I think what, um, do you wear deodorant? Uh, I try not to,</v>

145
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.500
um, at the moment I'm wearing it because sweat stains would be socially.

146
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.390
<v 2>You're wearing anti.</v>

147
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.260
<v 1>Purse press. I guess I am. Yeah. I guess I different's important.</v>

148
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.900
<v 2>Distinction there yeah's dangerous. Well, but here, this logging.</v>

149
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.220
<v 1>Up your pores. This is a great,</v>

150
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:21.490
this is a great example because I actually did spend, uh,

151
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.770
I don't know if it was a year as an experiment, not wearing deodorant. Um,

152
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.450
how'd that go? Well, &lt;laugh&gt; he was already.

153
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.410
<v 3>Married. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

154
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.410
<v 1>Um, so a couple interesting, uh, facts. One, it did, uh,</v>

155
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.130
drive some people crazy. I'm sure. Um.

156
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.090
<v 2>Not.</v>

157
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:39.970
<v 1>Me though. Not you.</v>

158
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.760
<v 2>Did drive, you didn't bother you at all.</v>

159
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.120
<v 3>I'm not, we've all been around people. We love who at some point are like, dude,</v>

160
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:47.650
take a shower.

161
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.440
<v 2>Right. But you know, no, but as long as you took a shower, well,</v>

162
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.040
actually the thing though, is it a shave the armpits thing?

163
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.720
Like if you shave your armpits, do you, I mean, it's the one spot, right?

164
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.720
We're not putting deodorant anywhere else on our body.

165
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.040
We're just putting it on the armpits. Like, is it the, a shaving thing?

166
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.480
Like if you shave your armpits.

167
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.560
<v 1>If you shave your armpits,</v>

168
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:08.000
you decrease the rate at which it less diffuses into the environment.

169
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.400
I should make.

170
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.240
<v 2>A judgment call.</v>

171
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.040
<v 1>Well, but in some sense, look, I don't know which it is.</v>

172
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:17.910
Maybe we're being right. And we're being, you know, we've got an industry of,

173
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.190
I don't know how much they make per year selling us these things because we're

174
00:09:22.191 --> 00:09:24.470
afraid of our own human smell. Right, right.

175
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.550
But there's a huge difference between the way somebody smells,

176
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.150
if they don't have good hygiene and somebody who

177
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.980
has the luxury of daily she hours and doesn't wear deodorant,

178
00:09:36.981 --> 00:09:37.620
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; frankly,

179
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.740
I don't find somebody who is taking daily showers and isn't wearing deodorant.

180
00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:44.740
I don't find it that offputting. And in Europe it's considered much, much.

181
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.580
<v 2>It's just a different smell. You smell them as opposed to smelling right.</v>

182
00:09:48.581 --> 00:09:49.500
Guard or whatever. It's.

183
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.780
<v 1>Exactly. And so, anyway, I, I have no idea whether, uh,</v>

184
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.170
if we back our deodorant and anti per sprint stuff off,

185
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:01.450
whether it would change, who ended up with whom and whether or not.

186
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.690
<v 2>Marriage is the last might have a small degree of.</v>

187
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.971
<v 1>Change. Right.</v>

188
00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:07.810
But how many other things are there on the list that we wouldn't think to name

189
00:10:07.811 --> 00:10:08.644
that? What about makeup.

190
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.890
<v 2>Be interfer? What if women stopped wearing makeup? How much would that change?</v>

191
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.490
Who hooks up with who, how.

192
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.490
<v 1>Much would it, and you know, if we,</v>

193
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:20.560
how would it change if we actually learned that there's

194
00:10:20.561 --> 00:10:22.920
a difference between hotness and beauty.

195
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.840
And we actually allowed little girls to

196
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:30.640
recognize that maybe they weren't so interested in being hot,

197
00:10:30.641 --> 00:10:33.000
because although it gets you a lot of attention, it's a kind of attention.

198
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.790
That's a dead end, right? How much would that change ends up with whom? I mean,

199
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.150
a lot of who ends up with whom at the moment is presumably dictated by people.

200
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:44.910
Having had their attention captured through hotness.

201
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.430
And then there's a question of whether there's anything there to back it up.

202
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.790
So I, I,

203
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:56.110
what I wanna see for my own kids' sake is I wanna see a

204
00:10:56.111 --> 00:11:00.780
world in which the noise of the way the market influences,

205
00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:04.940
how we interact with each other. And the notions that get, uh,

206
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.340
promoted as sophisticated,

207
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.980
where that noise is reduced so that people can really begin to detect the

208
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:14.580
patterns in their life. Actually, this worked for me,

209
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.530
I dated in this way, and this worked for me. I dated in that way,

210
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.730
and it didn't work for me.

211
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:22.290
It wasn't rewarding that begins to tell you something.
