00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Oh, we didn't even talk about your cult dude, right?</v>

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.410
Yeah. We forgot. We have time. Yeah. All right. Plenty.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.000
<v 1>Of time. All right. I don't even know where to begin.</v>

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.590
<v 0>When, when did you first become part of.</v>

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.030
<v 1>The cult? So I got sent away to this coal. It was like a cold boarding school.</v>

6
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.510
I was 14. I just turned 14.

7
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:27.920
And did your parents know what was going on or did they think, uh, no.

8
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.960
They had no idea. What did they think it was?

9
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.580
They heard it was for a place for troubled kids to get some help.

10
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.330
And then yeah, they had no idea. It was a Colt.

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.430
<v 2>Wow. No idea. What was it? It was, uh, yeah, it was called.</v>

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.820
<v 1>Sea-Doo it's a C E D U.</v>

13
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.080
And they called it that because you could see yourself how you want to be,

14
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.880
and then you do something about it.

15
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.410
<v 0>That sounds like something that like Tony Robbins would say. Yeah. Uh, it.</v>

16
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.951
<v 1>Used to be,</v>

17
00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:04.430
I think it was created from originally from something called sin Anon,

18
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.210
which I think is more well known, but it's uh, yeah, that sounds like some.

19
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.970
<v 0>Cheesy, not, not Tony Robbins, but like a low level,</v>

20
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.920
like online motivational guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

21
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.963
What should he do

22
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.930
for you? You're going to see what you don't like,

23
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.380
and you're going to do something about it. Everybody's like, oh my God. Thanks.

24
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.480
<v 1>For being here at the Hilton in Alhambra.</v>

25
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.960
<v 0>So this is pre-internet you're 14 years old. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.160
<v 1>1993. Um, I was a cutter.</v>

27
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.120
I was living in Tarzana. I grew up in Tarzana. Yeah. Ooh, big cutter.

28
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.480
What was that.

29
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.740
<v 3>About? I don't know my friends doing it. No, no.</v>

30
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.480
<v 1>I was doing it. I don't know. I, I, my, my dad left and then I started cutting.</v>

31
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:54.890
I kinda got in. Then I was getting into fights at school. You know, it was, uh,

32
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.820
punching holes in my wall. I was an angry kid. And so it was sort of an outlet,

33
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:03.320
I guess. And then they kept sending me up to the Northridge psych ward.

34
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.660
So I got sent away up to Northridge in the youth psych ward.

35
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.840
And then, uh, uh.

36
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.020
<v 2>They, uh, I don't remember specifically.</v>

37
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.400
<v 1>What they said. I think they just told my parents, they,</v>

38
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.930
they didn't tell me anything. I think they told my parents probably.

39
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.930
<v 0>Your parents. Didn't like to have a sit down with you and say, Hey, psycho.</v>

40
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.823
After the third.

41
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.230
<v 1>My mom didn't know what to do, do it with me. But after the third time,</v>

42
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.520
they said, after the third time I got sent up to the psych ward. They said, uh,

43
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.380
if you do this one more time, you know,

44
00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:39.770
anything else we're going to have to send you away somewhere a little, you know,

45
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.300
more serious, probably. Whoa. And so I did it again.

46
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:47.390
And then, uh, we took a tour up to, they said they were,

47
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:50.450
we were just going to go up to take a tour of the school that I could be sent

48
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:52.880
away to. That was it. They said, if you do it one more time,

49
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.650
we're going up and we're going to tour the school.

50
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.180
And if you do this one more time,

51
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:59.030
then we're going to bring you back here and drop you off. You're going to stay.

52
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.880
And so we went up to the San Bernardino mountains and we got, um,

53
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.750
I got out of the car, I toured the campus. It was a beautiful campus.

54
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:11.890
It was like a, this giant cabin up near lake Arrowhead.

55
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.920
And it used to be owned by the Houston's, you know,

56
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:19.630
all Walter and Angelica and John Houston. Um, and, um,

57
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.320
and they were telling me, you know, uh,

58
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.950
just about the school and stuff and all the rules, there were a lot of rules.

59
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.890
They call them agreements. And then my parents, uh,

60
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.820
I came back and went and talked to my parents and they told me that, uh,

61
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.680
I was staying there and I just said, well, you. And then I left. And, uh,

62
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.660
and they strip searched me. And then, um, and that was it.

63
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:46.810
And then I went into what they call a wrap and wraps are intense.

64
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:51.310
So what the rap was is three hour long, uh,

65
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.810
kind of like a group therapy session, but everyone is just sort of, um,

66
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.840
oh my God, it was so bizarre. So I had only been at the school to two hours.

67
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.700
I'd just been strip searched. And I been put into one of these three hour raps.

68
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.620
And the, the girl next to me was like rocking back and forth on the chair,

69
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:16.360
sorta like sobbing quietly. And then the kid next to me, got up,

70
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.150
walked across the room and switch seats with someone.

71
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.100
Cause you weren't allowed to talk to someone next to you.

72
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:22.420
You had to be across the room.

73
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.500
And that kid started screaming at the kid right next to me over here.

74
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:30.850
And then this one just started screaming at the floor and like

75
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.590
started like screaming at the floor. Like I hate you, mom. I hate you dad.

76
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:39.190
And then someone started putting all the, like this Kleenex,

77
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.170
all these tissues too. And I'm like,

78
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:43.330
why are they putting all these tissues here?

79
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.460
And then you just see all this snot and spit and like mucus empty out of this,

80
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.430
this girl's body. Cause she's just screaming.

81
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:56.320
And like blood vessels are popping in her and she's crying and screaming.

82
00:04:56.321 --> 00:05:00.730
And it was the most disgusting thing you've ever seen. And I was like,

83
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.760
oh my God, I'm going to be here for two and a half years.

84
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:06.730
And this is how this is going to happen. Three times a week.

85
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.020
There was a lot of sleep deprivation. They had, uh,

86
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.000
what did your parents think? It was,

87
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.980
they thought they were told by the counselors at the psych ward that it

88
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:20.410
was like a place for, um,

89
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.900
troubled kids when you didn't know what else to do with them.

90
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.850
<v 0>So it's like programs in on it.</v>

91
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.710
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. And so I think, um.</v>

92
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.200
<v 0>They were fooled or do you think that they knew what was going on that maybe</v>

93
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:35.400
they were fooled?

94
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.790
<v 1>I think they were probably fooled. I don't think, I don't think anybody.</v>

95
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.170
<v 0>Pre-internet right.</v>

96
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.250
This is all here to fool people because you can't do a Wiki on them. I mean,

97
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.980
the government finally shut them down.

98
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.250
So they were accredited though or something. I mean they were,

99
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:51.510
I think proved by.

100
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.530
<v 1>Yeah, it had been, you know, around Cedar was there for,</v>

101
00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:58.520
I think since the seventies want to say, maybe even earlier,

102
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:00.940
maybe the late sixties, that's the scary.

103
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.350
<v 2>Ones. Yeah. The ones with legs. Yeah. Yeah. You know.</v>

104
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.380
<v 1>But it was a really weird mix of students. It was like,</v>

105
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.690
I think Paris Hilton went there at one point.

106
00:06:10.691 --> 00:06:14.860
And then there was like just a lot of kids there on court orders.

107
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.240
And there was, um, you know, it was just a real mix, weird mix of people. Wow.

108
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.240
But they have these 24 hour what they call pro feats.

109
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.010
And they were all named after a different chapter of a book called the prophet

110
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.550
by Kahlil Gibran. You go through the program with the peer group.

111
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.730
So everybody that was enrolled at the same time as you in the same,

112
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:34.600
like two months,

113
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.030
you go through these almost like these rites of passages called profits.

114
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:44.230
And there were these 24 hour long workshops and they're all based around each

115
00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:47.200
chapter of this book called the profit. Um,

116
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.780
and the first one was called the truth and it was like,

117
00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:51.040
the truth will set you free.

118
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.600
So you basically tell everything you've ever done that you felt bad

119
00:06:55.601 --> 00:06:59.980
about. Um, and, uh, it's like confessional most.

120
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.500
Um, and what was odd is that all the staff members were,

121
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.520
there were a lot of,

122
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.690
there were like two or three staff members who are the counselors at the school.

123
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.780
They'd had no real credentials. They weren't like therapists,

124
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.160
but they acted as therapists, but they all had up lives too.

125
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.610
And so, and some of them, yeah. And so some of them,

126
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.930
like there were people that really got off on the power, like cult leaders do.

127
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.150
And then there were some, um,

128
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.930
that were former students there that were sent away for being bad kids.

129
00:07:31.931 --> 00:07:36.070
So there were staff members like confessing to heard.

130
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:39.820
One guy said claimed that he, he set a homeless guy on fire.

131
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.930
Another one would strangle cats. And they're like,

132
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.420
these are the people that are teaching.

133
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.610
<v 0>Sleep around and duties to strangle.</v>

134
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.850
<v 1>No, you couldn't fall asleep in the pro uh, in the profits. Uh, oh, oh.</v>

135
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.440
I mean eventually, I mean they lived off campus.

136
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.690
man. Uh, it sounds insane. Yeah. It was pretty wild.

137
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.930
<v 0>They all have that element in them. That's a Scientology element too. Right.</v>

138
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.950
And then also Catholicism, you have to confess, right. That's a,

139
00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:11.470
there's a thing that Scientology does where they, uh,

140
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.040
they go over all sorts of aspects of your life and they,

141
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.760
they like save that. Yeah. I save all those recordings.

142
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.050
And then when you want to talk that like, oh, well you think about leaving. Oh,

143
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.150
fascinating. Yeah. We're gonna,

144
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.360
we're gonna tell everybody about that thing that you do with clowns. I.

145
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.630
<v 1>Wonder why they would do it here then, because we had no power to look.</v>

146
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.060
We were all under age. We, they.

147
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.100
<v 0>Well, that's different, different organizations.</v>

148
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.200
What they're doing is probably getting power over you. I mean,

149
00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:43.090
it seems like that's what those things are always about.

150
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:44.650
They're always about a power.

151
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.990
And then it's usually the main dudes banging everybody's wife

152
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.360
and they get a lot of.

153
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.030
<v 1>Money. Well, the teachers, there were teachers that were for sure,</v>

154
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.690
bang in the students, there's nothing to.

155
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.720
<v 0>Put on them going in that it was a call when you figured.</v>

156
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.690
<v 1>It out until it was like until like a two years after I had graduated.</v>

157
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.273
Oh my God.

158
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.980
<v 0>So two years after it's all over, you sitting around going, Hey.</v>

159
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.420
<v 1>I think I just started talking to someone they're like,</v>

160
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.350
didn't you think that was a little weird when they did this or this or that? Or,

161
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.250
and I was like, oh, it's you mentioned it. Yeah.

162
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:30.410
Wait a minute. Yeah. We had to do, um, 14 days through Joshua tree,

163
00:09:30.411 --> 00:09:32.710
which was beautiful, which was great. Um, but then, uh,

164
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.920
the four days solo where they give you like a,

165
00:09:35.921 --> 00:09:39.770
a bag of trail mix and some water and a whistle and they say, all right,

166
00:09:39.771 --> 00:09:42.800
we'll come back and four days, but as a 14 year old, it's like, what the?

167
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.620
What the? Yeah, it was intense, but.

168
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.280
<v 0>Where was this? Where were the woods in Joshua tree?</v>

169
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.110
That's a sketchy area. Yeah. 14 years in the desert. Yeah.

170
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.570
That's crazy. Yeah. Where are you supposed to get your water?

171
00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.430
You had a big bag of water that was going to for four days. For four days.

172
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.480
How big is this bag?

173
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.270
<v 3>Uh, I don't know.</v>

174
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.270
<v 0>I can't give your own bag. Yeah. Yeah. You were.</v>

175
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.380
<v 1>Alone. They give you an area about half the size of this room, the studio,</v>

176
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.060
and they say, all right, we'll come and get you in four days. Here's four, uh,

177
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.020
granola bars,

178
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.610
a bag of trail mix and a bag of water and a whistle in case you get bit by a

179
00:10:22.611 --> 00:10:23.444
rattlesnake or.

180
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.320
<v 0>Something. Oh my God. Where are they with Zara? And then nowhere near here,</v>

181
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.040
they were.

182
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.670
<v 1>They were around and they monitor, they, I think they monitor you.</v>

183
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.710
So they probably saw a lot of beaten off 14 years old.

184
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.410
I think I spent, most of my days, I was a 14.

185
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.130
<v 0>Year old and I came up with a call. That would be one of the rules was a rule.</v>

186
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.750
No, no, no, no. It'd be like,

187
00:10:44.751 --> 00:10:49.280
you're going to all be by yourself for days for granola

188
00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:51.470
bars and a bag of water. Like,

189
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:54.580
it sounds like something a 14 year old would come up with. As far as the rules,

190
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.200
I was like an episode of fear fact. And here's a whistle.

191
00:10:57.201 --> 00:10:59.900
If you get bit by a rattler, I'll be over at the top of the hill.

192
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.930
You won't see me and I'll be able to hear you. Like,

193
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.760
that sounds like a 14 year old.

194
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.880
<v 1>I'll never forget too. When we came out, uh,</v>

195
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:12.170
they told us Kurt Cobain had just killed himself. It was so was 94.

196
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.200
<v 2>But, uh, I remember if.</v>

197
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.830
<v 1>You get in trouble, they put you on something called a full-time. Um,</v>

198
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.850
and that was never fun because it was like, uh, you, you had,

199
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.230
no, it was the amount of time of the full time was in the turn.

200
00:11:27.231 --> 00:11:29.090
So it was based on the staff member.

201
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.010
It was either you ran away or you had sex with another student or?

202
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.860
<v 3>Yeah, not me.</v>

203
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.960
<v 0>Snotty. Screams. Yeah. A lot of primal scream therapy,</v>

204
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:44.840
but, but on a full-time.

205
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.900
<v 1>Like you wake up and you have to like try and dig out a stump.</v>

206
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.350
That's been there since the seventies. No one was ever going to take it out.

207
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.850
The biggest stump you've ever seen. I remember when I got enrolled,

208
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:57.910
the first thing I saw was a kid and a pickax. And I'm like, what the?

209
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.840
That's why they have dynamite. Yeah. And.

210
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.070
<v 0>That's the dynamite. Well, they.</v>

211
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.060
<v 1>Used it for full-time,</v>

212
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.810
but you're not allowed to laugh or sing or no human contact.

213
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:11.920
You can't talk to anybody for three weeks. Oh my God. They're mice all long.

214
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:13.480
Long was yeah. They mind you.

215
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.470
There was something called smushing where everybody, it was like,

216
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:21.670
you walk into this giant house at the every night and everyone is telling each

217
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:23.170
other their life stories.

218
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.420
But it looked like you remember Jonestown when like the 909 people had

219
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:32.080
just drank the Kool-Aid and it was just body on top of body.

220
00:12:32.081 --> 00:12:35.120
That's what it looked like. Everyone's just cuddling with each other. Oh my God.

221
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.970
It's like, all the staff members are rubbing hair as girls.

222
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:40.690
And you're like,

223
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.310
this seems highly inappropriate with like girls 13 year old girl's head in their

224
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:49.750
lap. Yeah. It was, it was trippy. But yeah.

225
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.200
I've uh, my buddy, our buddy, Jeff Garland,

226
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:56.170
put me in touch with this fantastic writer, uh,

227
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.180
who writes a lot of episodes of better call Saul.

228
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:01.910
And we're almost done with our pilot. We're gonna, um, pitch it in,

229
00:13:01.911 --> 00:13:03.910
in about a month. I feel like.

230
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.061
<v 0>That's one,</v>

231
00:13:06.061 --> 00:13:10.500
that's going to be fascinating to see how they play that narrative out.

232
00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:12.930
Like whether they will show that kind of,

233
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.390
like a 13 year old girl on a guy's lap.

234
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.870
Like that seems like he can't even do that.

235
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.300
We'll say you can't even do that in fiction. You know what I mean?

236
00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:24.510
You'd have to imply it. That's a good point. Well,

237
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.250
fully closed. The problem is it really happened. Right.

238
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.430
So it's not like it's fiction. So if you were creating this kind of fiction,

239
00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:34.860
you're putting it out. People would be like, what you sick.

240
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:39.690
Why did you even think of that? But you're not doing that. That's true. Yeah.

241
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.810
You're, you're releasing some crazy that you actually experienced.

242
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:47.280
And how many years were you there for almost three. Wow. Yeah. Some of the.

243
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.930
<v 1>Exercises were crazy.</v>

244
00:13:48.931 --> 00:13:52.530
They did this one called lifeboat where they choose two students.

245
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.420
I was one of the students they chose and you're on a chair and you can only save

246
00:13:57.421 --> 00:14:02.190
two people and all of your best friends and are sobbing. And they're like,

247
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.353
please pick me.

248
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.500
And you have to look each person in the eye and tell them why they, they die.

249
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.700
What the? And then they, and then everyone had to write their own eulogy.

250
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.880
weird. A girl slit her own throat. Oh Jesus. Uh,

251
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.950
and another kid jumped off cliff.

252
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.460
<v 0>When they get into it in the first place. Are they doing it because they've,</v>

253
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.850
it's been done to them. Like some of them clearly, right?

254
00:14:26.851 --> 00:14:28.830
Some of them seems like they were a victim.

255
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.690
<v 1>Sure. That's why I know the one who likes set the homeless guy on fire.</v>

256
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.260
I know that for sure. That's why he did it. He got put through this.

257
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:41.880
He was going to inflict it on somebody else. Yeah. Garbage,

258
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.020
garbage people.

259
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.520
And then the craziest thing was maybe about seven or eight years after I

260
00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:50.940
graduated. A lot of kids would split. I split, you run,

261
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.830
but then you get caught or you walk or you come back to the school.

262
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:56.570
Once you find out your parents, aren't going to take you out.

263
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.440
But a lot of kids never came back and we just that's it.

264
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.680
That was just the fact to the kids. We don't know what the happened to them.

265
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.540
They would always tell us that, uh,

266
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:08.810
the parents pulled them out of the school that some of the kids that ran away

267
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:12.230
and never came back. Oh, but it was on the side of this giant,

268
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:14.960
like almost like a cliff, this backside of a mountain.

269
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.110
And some kids would walk down into town through the road.

270
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.700
And some kids they said would run away and go down the backside of the mountain.

271
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.860
And they said, some kids died going down the backside. Some kids got kidnapped,

272
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:29.630
who knows. But.

273
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.550
<v 2>Uh, I found out about seven or.</v>

274
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.320
<v 1>Eight years after the club was closed.</v>

275
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:37.640
They found out that there was actually a serial killer that was working at the

276
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:42.500
school. He was like, um, like the night janitor kinda guy,

277
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.320
um, and confessed to murdering, uh,

278
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.670
like a handful of kids that we thought ran away. And, uh,

279
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.210
he got caught for something else. And then confess to all of these murders.

280
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:55.640
He had committed over the last decade and,

281
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.950
and four of them were kids while he was working up at the campus. Holy. Crazy.

282
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.690
And that was while I was there. Yeah.

283
00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.110
<v 2>Bonkers pretty well.</v>

284
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.940
<v 0>So it took you a few years.</v>

285
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:14.320
Was it a relationship that you were in where a girl was explaining to you?

286
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.790
<v 1>It was talking to a former students. Oh,</v>

287
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.570
I started opening my eyes and I was like, oh yeah. So.

288
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.120
<v 0>It wasn't talking to someone who wasn't in it. Great.</v>

289
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.510
It was talking to someone who wasn't at. So together you were like going, Hey,

290
00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:31.300
I've talked to some other people and uh, exactly.

291
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.140
That's not what 14 year olds do. man.

292
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.810
<v 1>And then when Facebook, it was even longer than that.</v>

293
00:16:37.811 --> 00:16:41.530
Because then I think then when Facebook came out, then it was like,

294
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.590
there are all these groups and everyone's like, yeah, we were in a cold.

295
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.430
<v 0>Once you got out and you realized you were out and you talk to all the other</v>

296
00:16:48.431 --> 00:16:50.650
people that were out too, and you all realize that you were out,

297
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:51.880
how did it affect the,

298
00:16:51.881 --> 00:16:56.290
what did you have to like remap those years in your head?

299
00:16:56.291 --> 00:17:00.040
Did you have to kind of think about what life is really like?

300
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.270
<v 1>It was, it was interesting. Cause I got out when I was 16, so I had to go out.</v>

301
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.990
As soon as I got out, I had two more years of high school. So I got thrown at,

302
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.670
uh, down the street, a Taft.

303
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.080
I went to Taft high school in Woodland Hills and then, um, yeah,

304
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.160
did a couple more years there, but it was, it was tough to get reacclimated.

305
00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:22.060
And then, yeah, I, I didn't know. I had to retrain my brain.

306
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.380
Like I felt like I.

307
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:24.910
<v 2>I knew.</v>

308
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.140
<v 1>It was almost like I knew what they were trying to do.</v>

309
00:17:29.141 --> 00:17:33.340
I almost felt like I was being brainwashed and we were taught to self police,

310
00:17:33.341 --> 00:17:36.280
each other. And, and obviously it's like North Korea.

311
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.070
<v 0>Style. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

312
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.240
<v 1>Otherwise, you know,</v>

313
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.350
they would put you on a full-time and you'd have to dig out a stump.

314
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.510
<v 0>So when you say we were forced to self police, each other,</v>

315
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.580
were you forced to self police yourself or other selves and others

316
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.620
read up the right to.

317
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.900
<v 1>Yeah. You'd have to write a dirt list every week.</v>

318
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.870
<v 0>Which I just had to cover. And how do you let go, Hey, all right. This is all.</v>

319
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.500
<v 1>I think it took some time and it took, it took years,</v>

320
00:18:01.501 --> 00:18:05.520
but I w I w I was one of the lucky ones. I was like, you know what? I did it,

321
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.180
I took, I took the positives. I was like, you know what? It wasn't all bad.

322
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.290
I learned some tools. And if I didn't go through that,

323
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:16.320
I wouldn't be the person I am today. And I'm not the, you know,

324
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:21.210
I'm not the worst guy in the world. So I made it out. I survived,

325
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.690
it. Right. I'm not gonna, there were a lot of people that wouldn't let go.

326
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.670
They were just hold on. And to this very day,

327
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:31.380
they hold on so tight to this bitterness and this anger and they

328
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:34.500
can't sleep at night. And all they think about is what they went through.

329
00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:37.650
They lost three years of their life. I do hate that.

330
00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:40.830
I do bummed out that I missed out those three years of a

331
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.613
[inaudible]. Yeah, that's true. Come on, man. That's true.

332
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.840
<v 2>That's earned character. Exactly. It's like.</v>

333
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.200
<v 0>You know, we're talking about with Joey Diaz, like you earned this. I totally.</v>

334
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.980
<v 1>I, not only do I not regret it, um, there's many, many,</v>

335
00:18:55.981 --> 00:18:59.310
many days more days than not that I wish I could go back and do it all over.

336
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.900
<v 0>Again. I swear to God. I don't know. Cause it was, it.</v>

337
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.790
<v 1>Was, there was, there was a comradery. There was, um, it was like,</v>

338
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.030
uh, there was something about it. I, I didn't have to,

339
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.580
I had all that other to worry about,

340
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:18.690
but I didn't have to worry about a roof over my head job. You know,

341
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:21.720
all the other that you have to worry about as an adult.

342
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.560
<v 0>Yeah. I'm sure exactly. Yeah. Yeah.</v>
