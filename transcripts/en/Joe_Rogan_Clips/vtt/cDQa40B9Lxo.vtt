00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.320
<v 2>How much time before there's regular travel back and forth,</v>

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:10.140
Tamar's roughly

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.780
like a real civilization on Mars.

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.710
<v 1>Well, I think it's going to take a while to build that a real civilization</v>

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.150
that I, that the real, the threshold that really matters is

7
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.410
for getting past the great filter, uh, is,

8
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.350
do we have enough resources on Mars, such that if the,

9
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.740
if the spaceships from earth stop coming, you can.

10
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.610
<v 0>Survive. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.140
<v 1>So I can only be just missing one little thing. You'd be like,</v>

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.130
you're on a long sea voyage. And the only thing you're missing is vitamin C. Uh,

13
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.020
it's a luck. Uh, it's only a matter of time, you know? Yeah.

14
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.440
And those can be curtains. So you gotta have, uh,

15
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.690
all the things necessary to sustain civilization on Mars. Um,

16
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.520
and the reason that those shifts from, oh, stop coming could be world war three,

17
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.030
or it could be due to a slow decline of civilization.

18
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.660
So civilization here on earth could end with a bang or a whimper.

19
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.250
<v 0>Um, or natural disasters. Yeah. Asteroid impacts. Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.200
<v 1>And the band category. Yeah. It'll just be like a whole series of things, like,</v>

21
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.560
see, like what killed the dinosaurs as well. It wasn't just one thing. Right.

22
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.850
It was like a whole bunch of things happened in a row. And, and, uh,

23
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.640
you know, um, while like they could have taken any one of those things,

24
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:45.330
they had like three things happen and no dinosaurs, which is.

25
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.390
<v 0>Kind of amazing that crocodiles are still here. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.343
<v 1>Those.</v>

27
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.250
<v 0>While.</v>

28
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.500
<v 1>They're resilient crocodiles that, um,</v>

29
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.450
they all live on decayed meat and they love rotten meat.

30
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.820
And so in, uh, any kind of disastrous such situation,

31
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.100
there's a lot, a lot of dead creatures and the crocodiles love it. So, um,

32
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.430
that's why they're around crocodiles and bugs and mushrooms.

33
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.403
<v 0>Um, and shrews.</v>

34
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.570
<v 1>Shrews, and just while we're here. Yeah, exactly. Great. Great, great, great,</v>

35
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.790
great, great grandparents were true.

36
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.960
<v 0>What a strange thing. So like you have to come from, so there's hope.</v>

37
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.980
There's hope for all you wrote ins out there. Yeah. One day you can go to Mars,

38
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.370
just keep doing your homework. That's silly. So,

39
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.590
so there'll be that you see the great filter. What did you mean by that?

40
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.863
Um.

41
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.000
<v 1>Well, so there's something called like the Fermi paradox of like,</v>

42
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.110
where are the aliens? Yeah. So where are the Indians?

43
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.900
Um, and, um, I think it was called Sagan that said like,

44
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.023
uh, if

45
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.080
they're either are a lot of aliens or none and

46
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.240
the either they're equally terrifying. Um,

47
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.310
if there are a lot of aliens, well,

48
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.810
I mean the invasion ship slash uh,

49
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.030
uh, you know, bug infestation, just, you know, like

50
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.610
Starship.

51
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.443
<v 0>Troopers style.</v>

52
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.220
<v 1>Well, yeah. I mean, it's like,</v>

53
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.000
it's an answer realization might just view us as like a bug infestation. Right.

54
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:29.620
You know, it's like, Hey, we left that planet. It was fine.

55
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:32.380
Now it's got a bunch of bugs, just go fumigate. It, you know, um,

56
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.600
like re fumigate a house. Um, that's certainly possible. And then,

57
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.700
uh, but if there are no aliens, well,

58
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.960
could it be that all civilizations are just destroyed before they become, enter,

59
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.980
enter a stellar? You know? So, uh,

60
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.480
and I wouldn't be clear, like to the best of my knowledge, I,

61
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.200
there is no evidence for alien life on earth that alien, I there's, no,

62
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.300
there's no evidence for alien life. There's no direct evidence for alien life.

63
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.340
No, no. And if somebody says, oh, what about this alien? Uh, you know,

64
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.120
uh, citing or whatever. I'm like, listen,

65
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:14.800
it's gotta be at least as good as a seven 11 or ATM cam. Okay.

66
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.080
It's like somebody has got to have at least like an iPhone one level camera,

67
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.270
like something, you know, the.

68
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.970
<v 0>Problem with that is it's just too easy to fake things today, too.</v>

69
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.960
<v 1>Yeah, sure. I look at least try hard in there and faking.</v>

70
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.790
<v 0>Are you familiar with, uh, commander David favor's account of a,</v>

71
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.350
the tic-tac UFO that he encountered off of the coast of San

72
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:42.250
Diego? Let you know, Lex Lex Friedman. Yeah.

73
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.270
Lex Friedman interviewed him on his podcast and I interviewed him as well.

74
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:49.930
And if you ever get a chance to listen to Alexis, a conversation with them,

75
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:53.500
it's really excellent. But this guy is a Naval fighter pilot.

76
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:57.280
And he talked about this thing that they tracked on radar that went from more

77
00:04:57.281 --> 00:05:01.810
than 60,000 feet above sea level to one foot in less than a second shaped like a

78
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:05.710
tic-tac no visible sign of propulsion, uh,

79
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.840
blocked radar, uh,

80
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.060
actively jammed their tracking systems and then went to their predetermined

81
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.550
point that they were supposed to, uh, that the, uh,

82
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:20.080
the fighter jet was supposed to scramble to went to it, uh, 30 miles away.

83
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.860
And, you know, a couple seconds, like they have no idea how it did it.

84
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.400
They don't know what it is. And these guys that were, uh,

85
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.100
were working for the Navy off the coast,

86
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:33.370
said they encountered them several times. They didn't know what they were.

87
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:34.300
They didn't know what to do.

88
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.100
<v 1>Or something.</v>

89
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.750
<v 0>They do. They have video of it. Uh, they have video of it. They have, um,</v>

90
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.070
there's if you ever see the New York times article that came out in 2017 about

91
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.993
this stuff.

92
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.650
<v 1>Uh, I don't know. Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.340
<v 0>There was a New York times article in 2017 that was detailing this.</v>

94
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.290
And there's a couple of, there's a,

95
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.080
a couple other different sightings that were very similar.

96
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.310
They were trying to figure out what these things were and why.

97
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:03.140
And it was also in the COVID relief package that the CIA was

98
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.060
supposed to release. Yeah.

99
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.120
The politicians are trying to figure out what all this is.

100
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.110
So they try to get them to release all the information they have within 180

101
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:12.944
days.

102
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.470
<v 1>Honestly, I think I would know if there are aliens.</v>

103
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.880
<v 0>I would hope so.</v>

104
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.470
<v 1>That's why I'm asking, you know, I, I, I be jumping on that. Like, you're like.</v>

105
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.090
<v 0>You should watch that conversation with Lex. It's like, here's the thing.</v>

106
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.210
Do you think that they would want us to know?

107
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.350
Or do you think they would just be observing and making sure we don't blow

108
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.670
ourselves up? Would.

109
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.550
<v 1>Civilization sure. Our subtle, I mean,</v>

110
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:43.010
if they wanted us to know, obviously they, they could just for sure know,

111
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:46.820
show up and walk down main street, you know, I'm an alien check me out,

112
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:48.590
you know? Right. Oh, here's my space.

113
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.590
If I just land in the middle of times square, I'll be like, right. Okay.

114
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.350
<v 0>We're hover over downtown LA. Yeah. Yeah. We were.</v>

115
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.060
<v 1>Like, okay, we believe you. Um, so w whatever they are,</v>

116
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.020
they are very subtle, very subtle. These aliens. How.

117
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.920
<v 0>Often do you think about it?</v>

118
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.780
<v 1>None. Zero. Zero.</v>

119
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.090
<v 0>Even though you're thinking about an interplanetary travel,</v>

120
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.130
you don't really think about aliens.

121
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.990
<v 1>No. I mean, if they show up, I'm like, great, okay, now this is new information,</v>

122
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.030
but yeah.

123
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.100
<v 0>What an interesting way of putting it. This is.</v>

124
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.950
<v 1>New information, this new information, like, where are you guys up till now?</v>

125
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.750
Yeah. Um, so anyway, uh let's um,

126
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.670
if, if, if I see some evidence for aliens of, I'll be like,

127
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.530
I'll be the first to be like, ah, alien.

128
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.390
<v 0>Right. Then you'll investigate.</v>

129
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.850
But until then you think it's kind of a waste of time. Yeah. Yeah.

130
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.870
It definitely seems like a waste of time if nothing's happened so far,

131
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:48.740
you think about all the people that have been researching aliens for their whole

132
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:51.680
life, and they have very little to show for it.

133
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.780
<v 1>Well, you know.</v>

134
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.400
<v 0>There's other than cool stories.</v>

135
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.620
<v 1>Yeah. Um, I mean, we have archeologists going all over the world,</v>

136
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:03.530
looking at things, you know, where this, this people, like,

137
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.280
if we would have find something like, let's say like a cube of titanium,

138
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.540
just like a one inch cube titanium, see in the middle of the permit,

139
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.980
I'd be like aliens. For sure.

140
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.180
There was no way they could've made a titanium back then. Nope. There's no way.

141
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.530
That's hard. That's all one Oak do even need a computer.

142
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.510
Like a computer would be like, Hey, wow, computers.

143
00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:26.120
They didn't have computers back then. So it must be aliens, but,

144
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.820
but even just like some advanced metallurgy, anything like mean,

145
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.743
is there anything like that.

146
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.090
<v 0>Right now? Nothing like that, that we could point to that we can't do.</v>

147
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.900
<v 1>Everything that we've found archeologically is consistent with the time, uh,</v>

148
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.400
the technology they had at that time.

149
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.450
<v 0>Geologically. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you just talk about old stuff. Yeah.</v>

150
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.330
<v 1>Yeah. Just throughout history. It's not like, yeah. Like,</v>

151
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.470
like failing miserably, there'll be something buried somewhere. I think. Um,

152
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.390
we haven't seen anything. So anyway, I mean, maybe there are aliens,

153
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:06.060
but they're very subtle if they are, they're just very, uh,

154
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:11.310
they're being pretty shy. So, um,

155
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.240
far as we can tell there's none.

156
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:17.310
So nor are we seeing signals from any other solar

157
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.960
system or anything like that. So, um, now,

158
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.890
and the thing is that, um, on a galactic timescale,

159
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.540
even with sublime travel, you could absolutely colonize the whole galaxy,

160
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.900
even some of the neighboring galaxies. Um, so if you gave,

161
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.800
if you said a million years with, with, with, and say, there's no,

162
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.300
there's no new physics. Could you colonize the galaxy in a million years?

163
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.650
Absolutely. The entire galaxy.

164
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.650
<v 0>So you would start with Mars, build bases on Mars,</v>

165
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.030
then you use Mars to jump off to all these other planets set up places there and

166
00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:52.170
over thousands of years.

167
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.690
<v 1>Yeah. Kind of like, you know, software, one solar system to the next. And yeah.</v>

168
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.370
<v 0>It seems like that's imperative,</v>

169
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:05.790
like that has to happen if the human civilization is going to survive because

170
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:07.050
our planet is just,

171
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.800
we're too subject to natural disasters and our own folly.

172
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:14.250
And if the species is going to survive, we kind of have to escape.

173
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.230
<v 1>It's mostly about the species. I mean, there've been some real doozies of like,</v>

174
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:19.890
you know,

175
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.780
massive meteors and supervolcanoes and the continents

176
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.010
Moodle over the place. And it's been a snowball and super hot. It, the,

177
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.670
if you read like the geological history of earth,

178
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.440
it's like very long and complicated. Um, so,

179
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.600
and then there'd been so many extinction events, not like just a few. Um, yeah.

180
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.420
I mean the, the Permian extinction event,

181
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:48.540
that was a real rough one where it's like, well,

182
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:52.530
over 90% of all species died out. Um,

183
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.190
and that doesn't tell the whole story because a huge chunk of the remaining

184
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:59.910
species were fun guy and, um, you know,

185
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:03.570
like sponges and stuff like that, you know, uh, like if are you,

186
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.770
are you a sponge? Okay. You probably don't. Okay.

187
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.950
They're still around. Are you a mushroom?

188
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.210
Do you like being in the dark and feasting on dead? Dead, dead,

189
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:19.620
dead plant and animal matter. Okay. But if you're like a human you're screwed.
