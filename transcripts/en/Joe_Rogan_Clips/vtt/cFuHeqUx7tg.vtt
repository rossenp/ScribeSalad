00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.040
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. That's.</v>

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 1>Like, great. Well, you're, you're an unusual guy in that.</v>

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.800
You're very left wing like me,

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.800
but you're also very second amendment pro second amendment, for sure. Like me.

5
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.400
Yeah. You know, like I find like you and I have very big parallels on that.

6
00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:23.670
That's, that's true. You know, all for everyone's rights, like for everything.

7
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.510
I mean just, I, I want people to be free yeah. To do whatever. Yep. But when,

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.670
like this goes down and people are just randomly lighting targets on fire and,

9
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.523
you know, and,

10
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.310
and now smashing windows and stealing things and knocking cars over and pulling

11
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:40.144
people outta trucks.

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.140
Now you underst stand that the veneer of civilization is

13
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.140
very thin and the,

14
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.860
the chaos of being is very deep and it's,

15
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.580
I don't ever want to have to ease a gun ever. No, no,

16
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.260
a human being ever in my life, if I,

17
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.340
if I make it to the grave and never have encountered anyone that I,

18
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.370
I needed to shoot to per tech, my or my, my loved one's lives. Yeah.

19
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.530
I'd be a happy person. Yes, of course.

20
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.010
But I'd be much happier if I get to make that choice, you know? Yeah.

21
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.330
And I, I get to,

22
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.730
I have the opportunity or the ability to protect myself or to protect someone I

23
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:16.564
care about.

24
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.090
<v 2>Well, I mean, it's like, it depends on the climate that you're, you know,</v>

25
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.610
we live in a climate that is like for very,

26
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.600
so many reasons have we've gotten to this point at which essentially

27
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.800
I could just say a blank. The blanket blame goes to capitalism in general.

28
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.560
I mean, I'm sure like you talk about this on this, on the show a lot.

29
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.480
And capitalism in its most fundamental state is just essentially trade it's what

30
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:40.920
humans did at a, you know,

31
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:43.630
you set up a fruit stand and like someone's got bread and someone's got,

32
00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:44.710
you know, and you, you trade.

33
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.270
And then there's kind of like an understood value for things.

34
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.190
And on a basic level, it's just kind of what we do as human beings. We barter,

35
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:52.310
we trade things like that,

36
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.150
but then you flash forward and you like overlay complexity over complexity,

37
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:59.710
over complexity that is then guided by people who are like, oh,

38
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:00.910
I can game the system a little bit more.

39
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.500
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I can game the system a little bit more and you get all

40
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:08.340
these hoarders and hoarders and people and choke points of resources.

41
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:09.540
Right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so then they're,

42
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:11.620
they're kind of dictating the value, blah, blah, blah, blah.

43
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.660
Same thing goes with the arms. Uh, you know, um, it's like, yeah, I,

44
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.580
I enjoy the reason why I enjoy my ability to have a firearm is because I

45
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.970
respect their power. Um, I'm in,

46
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.370
I'm an engineered minded minded person.

47
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.970
So I like the engineering and the craftsmanship behind it.

48
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.130
And I like the responsibility and the safety factor of it that people take it

49
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:37.890
seriously. When I grew up, people were really adamant about the safety of guns.

50
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.890
Like everything that whenever I touched a gun,

51
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:42.050
looked at a gun before you pick it up, they'd be like,

52
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.570
never put your finger on the trigger.

53
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.920
Never pointed at anybody unless you plan on firing it. Um,

54
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.120
all the things that we all hear about that gun owners are supposed to be taught.

55
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.480
And so growing up with guns, I didn't really fear them. They were just a thing,

56
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.240
you know, and my, my whole mom's side of the family was all, uh, police,

57
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.880
police people. And my dad was a military policeman. He was in the military. So,

58
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.560
you know, guns like that was just a part of the thing, farmers hunting,

59
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.240
all that stuff. Great fall, same thing. Growing over to my friend's house,

60
00:03:11.241 --> 00:03:13.560
seeing a, a deer hung up, strung up, you know,

61
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:15.960
on the rafters with a bunch of cardboard on the ground, you know,

62
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:19.990
getting ready to be processed, all of that stuff. &lt;affirmative&gt;. And for me,

63
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.070
I came back to guns like maybe like 10 years ago or something like that. Um,

64
00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:26.190
because I wanted to,

65
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.470
I was interested in training and overcoming my fear of handguns. And, um,

66
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.390
and so that fascination was great, went to Montana. And my experiment was like,

67
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:36.750
how long will it take me to get a handgun? You know?

68
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:39.740
And I walked into a sporting good store. One of my,

69
00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:44.460
one of my favorites walked in, timed it 20 minutes. I walked out. Wow.

70
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.420
And I had a bag with a handgun and ammunition in the bag and

71
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:53.020
I was walking outta the store. So there's no waiting period. No.

72
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.580
Now you fill out the, you know, the,

73
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.260
the background check mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you do the background check.

74
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.250
They're like, it looks like there's no red flags or whatever.

75
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.610
You can have the gun. Wow. Which, which part of me is like, part of me is like,

76
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.210
if you're a responsible gun owner and you respect firearms, um,

77
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.810
that seems kind of normal. Yes. You're like, oh, I'm responsible.

78
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.570
I know how to use this weapon safely.

79
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.490
I'm gonna buy this gun and I'm gonna walk out. Right.

80
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.280
And that was my first firearm I bought. Um,

81
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.520
whilst it was an interesting experiment, I will say.

82
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.880
And when I talked to all my law enforcement friends in Mon in Montana, like, uh,

83
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.880
you know, um, who was it, the guy who walked in,

84
00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:36.360
he walked in his suit and had a full on three piece suit and then had his carry,

85
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.310
conceal carry on him and then walked in with a huge bag of like crazy guns.

86
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:42.643
But, um,

87
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.990
he is a prosecutor and has to have security when he &lt;laugh&gt;,

88
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:50.550
when he goes to cases and things like that. Because when they get convicted,

89
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:53.790
sometimes people sick, their friends on him and stuff like that. Anyways,

90
00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:54.950
he'd never had any altercations,

91
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:59.270
but an interesting guy really like very heavily armed, blah, blah, blah, blah.

92
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.510
And I started talking to him. I was like,

93
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.860
what would happen if in order to get a firearm,

94
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.420
you had to like back when the NRA was the, when truly was the NRA,

95
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:12.020
when it was a bunch of like war vets who were like,

96
00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:16.180
this is how you use firearms safely, like way back in those days. Uh,

97
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.260
if people had to go through training, um, and had to be evaluated,

98
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.170
how have to pass driving, like when you drive yeah. Get your driver's license,

99
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.130
you have to get into a car and you have to an instructor there and you have to

100
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:30.970
like pass these tests. And, and when I talk in that way, they're like,

101
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.290
I don't really have a problem with that. And I'm like, yeah,

102
00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:37.250
because you're promoting, you're only doing yourself a favor, right. You're,

103
00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:40.850
you're, you're promoting safety and you're educating people about with firearms.

104
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.010
And so up to them, if you,

105
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.680
you want to have a firearm or you don't want to have a firearm, but if you do,

106
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.320
you have to know how to safely operate a firearm.

107
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.480
And there are many kinds of firearms. They're not all the same thing. Yeah.

108
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:58.120
So anyways, but it was an interesting conversation. That is a powder keg.

109
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.120
<v 1>Of a conversation. Right. I, I know if you even intimate, just, just,</v>

110
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.560
just beat around the Bush,

111
00:06:04.561 --> 00:06:08.800
that maybe be a good idea for people to learn how to use a gun before they buy a

112
00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.680
trader trader

113
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.160
second amendment is a right.

114
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.390
<v 2>I know. And that's, it's all right. I, I know. And, and I get, and you know,</v>

115
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.230
and, and it's so funny because that's why I, like, I never talk.

116
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.310
I've got a bunch of friends. They,

117
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:25.030
they got conceal carry all the time for their professions in great falls.

118
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.590
You know, I'm sitting down with them, they've got a firearm on them.

119
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.470
I never feel like nervous or anything like that. But, and,

120
00:06:31.471 --> 00:06:35.310
but they're highly opinionated about people who open carry and people who open

121
00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:39.620
carry. They're always like those people almost always, uh, conceal,

122
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.300
carry permit. People always say that those,

123
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:44.020
they don't like those people because it's,

124
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.820
you have a weapon that's visible and it doesn't have a fancy biometric lock on

125
00:06:48.821 --> 00:06:49.900
it. There's nothing. It's like,

126
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.100
if you're in a situation that someone walks up behind you and takes your gun,

127
00:06:53.101 --> 00:06:55.980
they just, now they've got a gun and you just told everybody,

128
00:06:55.981 --> 00:06:58.250
you just shown everybody that you have a firearm. Right.

129
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.410
And so there's this weird thing about open carry that conceal carry people

130
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.930
are like, this is ridiculous. While you can do it, if it's legal in your state,

131
00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:12.410
certainly. Is it a good decision? I don't, I don't, I don't think so.

132
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.890
<v 1>It's probably not a good decision to do it when you just go on Walgreens,</v>

133
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:16.850
but that's what I'm saying. Yeah.

134
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.680
It's believe exists so that no one can ever

135
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.600
infringe upon your rights to have one in any capacity. So if you're sure,

136
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.640
you know what I'm saying? So like,

137
00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:30.040
it's not a thing where you want to do all the time, but if you,

138
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.360
if some goes down and you have a gun outside of your house, the,

139
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.840
the law should be, you could do whatever the you want. Like you,

140
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.350
the law says you're allowed to open carry.

141
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.190
So you can have this gun outside your house doesn't mean go to the movies with a

142
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.190
AK 47 strapped your chest. Yeah.

143
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.670
<v 2>Which people do. And, and I, and I get it. And I,</v>

144
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:54.070
and the whole thing about like the gun issue is that it needs to start somewhere

145
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.190
and it should start at education. Yeah. You know, education's.

146
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.980
<v 1>The, that's the key, right? Yeah. Like, and, and some people are great at it.</v>

147
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.420
Most people that I know that are into guns are very into the safety aspect of

148
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:08.660
it. And they understand it and it's yeah. Have it's very important to them have.

149
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:13.180
Yeah. But it's one of those things where first of all, here's, what's weird.

150
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.060
I know so many people that want a gun now.

151
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.940
So many people that are asking for all.

152
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.220
<v 2>These liberals, so many liberal friends of mine are asking me,</v>

153
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:21.850
they're know you have a gun to be like, whethereveryone was like,

154
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:23.650
what is it take? I'm like, I was.

155
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:24.350
<v 1>Talking, wow.</v>

156
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.890
Two different friends who have had friends ask them if they can borrow

157
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.210
a gun. I'm like, you can't loan someone a gun. No. Can't.

158
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:34.210
<v 2>No, can't&lt;laugh&gt; you.</v>

159
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.530
<v 1>You, you, people that are anti-gun are hilarious because yeah.</v>

160
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.680
They don't know that there are rules. Like this idea that there's no rules,

161
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.360
no there's rules. Yes. Like, all they hear about is, oh,

162
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:47.800
but what about the gunho loophole? They start talking about the gun loophole.

163
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.960
Yes, yes. Yeah. Yeah. Go to a gun show then. Yeah. See any gun shows? No. Well,

164
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:52.520
you can't have my gun. Get the outta.

165
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.960
<v 2>Here. Yeah, I know. I know. It's so, uh, that's the thing, that's,</v>

166
00:08:55.961 --> 00:08:58.800
that's the thing that's so hard about it, because like, for me, I'm like,

167
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:03.400
I'm a pragmatist. And um, and to me, it's always about awareness.

168
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.920
It's always about education mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

169
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:09.080
And the thing that the conversation always breaks down on either side where it's

170
00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:09.161
like,

171
00:09:09.161 --> 00:09:13.640
if it's a gun nut and they're like any hint of something that says we're gonna

172
00:09:13.641 --> 00:09:15.670
have to talk about yes. You know, they're like, no.

173
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.830
And then the people who are really anti-gun,

174
00:09:17.831 --> 00:09:21.710
they're like any hint that there might have to be a compromise made,

175
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.710
then they're also equally like, no, and it nothing's ever gonna get done.

176
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.230
Unless you get soldiers, cops, people who use guns for an,

177
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.510
who have to use guns for a profession,

178
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.900
talking to people who are heritage, gun owners,

179
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.100
people who've been growing up for generations doing that.

180
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.220
Two people who live in urban situations where there's illegal gun sales and

181
00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:47.540
black market guns and their problem with guns and their com their communities,

182
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.340
all that stuff needs to be talked about. But, but the sides are so entrenched.

183
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.300
It's very, very, very difficult. Well.

184
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.930
<v 1>I think something like we're, we're experiencing right now,</v>

185
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.050
these riots and El looing, this opens people's eyes. This is, uh,

186
00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:04.610
like we were talking about our liberal friends that are very interested in

187
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:09.290
getting a gun. Now this opens people's eyes. You realize like, this is not, no,

188
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:10.210
one's on a power trip.

189
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.570
You're just talking about your ability to safely defend your loved ones and

190
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.240
yourself. Yeah. That's what that's all you're talking about. I, &lt;affirmative&gt;.

191
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.840
<v 2>Absolutely a hundred percent, you know, and I'm my thing is too,</v>

192
00:10:19.841 --> 00:10:23.040
it's like technology is amazing and, and,

193
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.680
and guns are an interesting form of technology because obviously if again,

194
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.600
in a healthy situation, you're like, oh, did you see the new blah, blah, blah,

195
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.400
blah, blah. Oh yeah. They enhanced this. Oh, there's a trimout for the, uh,

196
00:10:33.401 --> 00:10:35.880
silencer. So did you apply for the silencer? I have a class, one license,

197
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.310
all that geeky stuff. It says geeky, as people working on engines and hot rods.

198
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:42.030
Right, right. Exactly. There's there's that right.

199
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.310
Then there's the whole cultural thing that movies, you know, like, uh,

200
00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:47.150
bad boys and everything,

201
00:10:47.151 --> 00:10:49.910
just guns are just stuff that people just have and they're just shooting around.

202
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.310
And the thing is like,

203
00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:55.230
people never understand when you talk to a war vet about guns and,

204
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.900
and gun fights and fire fightts especially recent fire. Fightghts,

205
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.620
they're like I never,

206
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.340
ever would ever wish you to ever be in a gun fight ever.

207
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.700
And so, uh, and I, and I believe them,

208
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.580
cuz I know things can change so quickly a bullet when you shoot a gun and it

209
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:16.100
hits somebody and it ends their life.

210
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.330
Even if they were like threatening you so forth,

211
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:22.330
that is one of the most traumatic things that can happen in a human being's

212
00:11:22.331 --> 00:11:25.250
life. And they have to live with that all the time. I mean, soldiers,

213
00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.410
at least they have like, I'm on a side and I'm trained, you know,

214
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.330
in their psychological help and all that stuff. Or police officers, same thing.

215
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.370
Most of 'em never even draw their weapons, but when they do and they do fire it,

216
00:11:34.371 --> 00:11:37.250
the consequences are devastating on a psychological level.

217
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.000
But I will say that, you know, I, I, my friend who carries, I was like,

218
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:45.680
what if the first three rounds that you have in your personal protection gun,

219
00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:47.920
like at home or whatever your handgun, whatever it is,

220
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.400
what if the first three rounds were rubber?

221
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.000
And then there were live rounds after that. And he was like, oh,

222
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:59.640
that's an interesting idea. And I'm like anything to protect yourself,

223
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.160
but not necessarily Guarante that you're going to kill, kill somebody if it's,

224
00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:07.520
you know, if it's a, a weird situation, situations happen fast.

225
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.760
And I understand when someone comes into your house, all bets are off.

226
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.633
Whatever you need to do.

227
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.230
However you feel if someone breaks into your house that's I understand that

228
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:18.630
completely. But for me I'm like,

229
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.590
what can I do to make it really hard for someone to even get to me in

230
00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:25.550
the first place? Yeah. And my last, last,

231
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.470
last resort is a weapon that can kill somebody. That's my very,

232
00:12:30.471 --> 00:12:33.940
very, very last, but I'm gonna do everything I, to be as preemptive,

233
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:38.580
as possible to not be enticing for people to want to come up and attack.
