00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How do you feel in your and your sober October?</v>

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.871
Like what,

3
00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:09.360
what are the biggest differences that you notice or do you notice any?

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.640
I feel great. Yeah.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.200
<v 1>The pillows, the booze is what gets ya, booze get like booze slows you down,</v>

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.340
for sure. Like, I feel way better without a couple of drinks,

7
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:24.480
but I like a couple of drinks. So it's like the balancing act of.

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.710
<v 0>I wish I could have a couple drinks. I don't, I don't see the point. I don't,</v>

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.723
I like.

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.570
<v 1>Bucket. Well.</v>

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
<v 0>I just don't see the point. It's like decaf coffee, or, you know, like.</v>

12
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.843
<v 1>A couple of drinks.</v>

13
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.720
<v 0>No, because I want to get.</v>

14
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.150
<v 0>And I was saying this, you know, before we came out, I'm like,</v>

16
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.150
I wish I could just smoke weed. Cause I did that through.

17
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.200
So for most of my twenties, I did everything to avoid having to get sober again.

18
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:53.670
And a lot of my thirties and I definitely was

19
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.410
trying to like manage it.

20
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:57.720
And there were years where I just smoked weed and didn't drink.

21
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.320
But what happens to me is that it'll be a gorgeous day like this and I'll be

22
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:06.030
down in Venice and I'll smoke some weed and then maybe I'll get a little racy

23
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.920
because the weed is racy.

24
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.550
And then I want to balance it out with that gorgeous looking half from on the

25
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:15.750
waterfront. And next thing you know, I'm doing lines in the townhouse like that.

26
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.410
That's where it goes every time for me.

27
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.150
<v 1>Do you think that there's like a well oiled groove that's in your</v>

28
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:28.020
brain that once you get some substances in there, like, woo.

29
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.913
<v 0>I wonder,</v>

30
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.110
I wonder what it is because it's interesting because so many, um,

31
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.720
this is why I love like 12 step because no one wants to be there and there's

32
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:40.410
some of the funniest places ever.

33
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:44.370
And then I'll hear people come talk about like 12 step and how it doesn't work

34
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:47.520
and blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, it, it works for a lot of people.

35
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:48.720
And every time I go,

36
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:53.010
I get to listen to like essentially some up story that turned into a miracle,

37
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.480
like some guy who was like, and then I had hookers and then I was jazzed.

38
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:00.810
And then now like, and you've been sober and you're like an upstanding,

39
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.530
like there,

40
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.340
these rooms are filled with people who would be men menaces to society.

41
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:10.140
Myself included. I came out of a blackout driving on the 4 0 5.

42
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.150
Yeah. It was one of the hands down, most terrifying moments of my life. It was.

43
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.430
And I had been at universal studios.

44
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:21.840
So I had driven all the way from universal to the 4 0 5 getting on the 10,

45
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.750
how you got there. I had no recollection.

46
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.740
Apparently I had been out with a bunch of people and I got scared when I was at

47
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:31.080
the bar because there were these guys following me around.

48
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.960
I was with a bunch of like high poker, high rollers.

49
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.750
And I made alcoholism look amazing.

50
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.020
<v 1>Crazy people. They.</v>

51
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.000
<v 0>Were security guards. I didn't know this.</v>

52
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.030
<v 1>Love it. When you can get off drugs,</v>

53
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.020
like that's one addiction that people take very seriously.

54
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:51.450
And they're happy for you when you get off of drugs or alcohol.

55
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.490
But if you get off of gambling, no.

56
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.910
<v 0>Yeah, no, no, no. Well, some people do. I mean,</v>

57
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.430
it's funny because I've had four P I've helped four people quit smoking weed in

58
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:05.380
the past year and it is gnarly. And part of the problem, I know you,

59
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.760
I know you give me this. I know, I know, I know you don't want to hear it. Um,

60
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.290
but these are people who were really addicted to it and they couldn't stop or

61
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:17.490
mentally, well, I think the physical part you get over, it's just that,

62
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.860
that it's insidious because you get laughed at.

63
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.180
<v 1>The one that fuzzy distance.</v>

64
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.770
<v 0>The fuzzy does scent and it's easy. And it's like, for me,</v>

65
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:28.630
what I noticed was that, um,

66
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.530
it was like this we'd seal glass kind of ceiling made of smoke.

67
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.710
And once I stopped quit smoking weed,

68
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.970
I was suicidally depressed two years, like two years,

69
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.800
I smoked for 20 years in my developmental teenage years.

70
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.030
I don't think I had any two years to get, I mean, it's an oil.

71
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.560
I think it gets into your fat.

72
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.450
<v 1>Do I don't think there's any.</v>

73
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.340
<v 0>Real loss? No, I don't think there's any science.</v>

74
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.230
I just know from my experience that it took me awhile to like get back online.

75
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.660
And I felt like I was having a hard time kind of boosting up to like where I

76
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.290
I'm naturally like a happy guy. I wake up and I'm like trial a lab.

77
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.280
But for the two first years I got sober. It was gnarly. It was.

78
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.030
<v 1>I think Pete, there's different people. I mean, I'm just joking around,</v>

79
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:17.110
but them not being addicted.

80
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:19.180
I think there's people that get addicted to a lot of things.

81
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.860
<v 0>Well, it's been what's the problem is that people don't take it seriously.</v>

82
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.120
So there'll be like, oh yeah,

83
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:26.970
that's not a real addiction because it doesn't kill.

84
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.370
<v 1>So when someone says that I'm addicted to PI like, ah, get over it.</v>

85
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.890
<v 0>You won't do, but so you don't do anything, you know, I'm like, yeah,</v>

86
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:39.280
you won't do anything. You won't kill anybody. You just won't do anything.

87
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.040
And I think for my experience,

88
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.990
that clarity that I got at the is, um, kind of priceless. I mean,

89
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:51.160
I used to write the stuff and think that I was just so funny or so insightful.

90
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:52.960
And it was like, what the was that.

91
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.173
<v 1>Most embarrassing.</v>

92
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.910
<v 0>I'm going to come back and read my journals that I wrote when I was high and</v>

93
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:04.750
thought I was so insightful. And you can tell I'm just high and drunk, like,

94
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.230
right. Thank you. That I'm being like, so insightful.

95
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.410
<v 1>Occasionally you'll get gems, occasionally marijuana.</v>

96
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.010
We'll let a little air through. And you're like, oh, what is this? I found.

97
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.780
<v 0>I miss it. I was saying that the addict in me, it's the thing I love the most.</v>

98
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:24.100
I've always loved it. The mowers and the addicts and me, I'm like, I'm worried.

99
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:26.800
I'm going to like give myself cancers so that I know

100
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.450
like subconsciously. And then when I got sober, I did get cancer. I got Basil's.

101
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:38.050
Hell yeah. I like, I was like,

102
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:41.470
I guess I need to smoke weed. Now. My friend's like is basil, south Bridget.

103
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:45.340
Like, it's not real. It's um, I don't know.

104
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:49.810
It's it's like it's skin cancer, but it's like the least I have a scar here.

105
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:53.890
It's like the least, um, it's not Melanie. It's kind of a joke.

106
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.100
I mean maybe, maybe, I don't know. Maybe,

107
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.160
maybe I'll Google this and find out it kills like millions of people,

108
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:04.940
but it was, my doctor made practically a joke of it.

109
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.410
It's kind of like the beta or arc of, of skin cancer. It's like,

110
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.230
it wants a lot of attention, but it's just, he became president,

111
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.850
but it's completely ineffective.

112
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.573
<v 1>Because adorable.</v>

113
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.750
<v 0>No, he's.</v>

114
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.870
<v 1>So famous. So close to beta too. I know better.</v>

115
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.600
<v 0>Yeah, I know. I know. Do you think that he's just like using his, um,</v>

116
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.670
his like father-in-law's money?

117
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.790
<v 1>Um, well he definitely is doing that right.</v>

118
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.910
<v 0>Is that, I don't know.</v>

119
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.740
I have no evidence starting rumors on Joe rogan.com.

120
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.680
<v 1>I think he started the fire in the Palisades.</v>

121
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.930
He probably gave me cancer skin cancer. He's the one who made your drink.

122
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.970
He provided the lines of the condo.

123
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.930
<v 0>I do. I do sometimes. Like I watch your podcasts and it's like,</v>

124
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.260
I bet I wish I could just go drink whiskey with the boys.

125
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:03.950
Like I used SU and like go travel the world.

126
00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:06.260
I was in Sri Lanka partying and it was in.

127
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.990
<v 1>I have a good night party. And now</v>

128
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.370
you got a good night where it didn't go off the rails. Maybe not an alcoholic.

129
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.430
<v 0>I do. I do a whole standard routine about how, when I quit drinking,</v>

130
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:22.580
my family gave me like a reverse intervention because my,

131
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.310
my family is also, um, there.

132
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:29.810
So there's an aunt now. It's like a Irish Catholic,

133
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:33.260
huge family. It's just part of the culture. And they were like,

134
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:36.920
we're worried about you. You're not drinking enough.

135
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.653
<v 1>Clarity of pregnant.</v>

136
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.200
<v 0>What are you so bad? Oh, wait, are you going to get vegan now? Breasts.</v>

137
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.620
<v 1>What are you going to do? Save the whales. You stop using plastic straws.</v>

138
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:50.623
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

139
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.630
<v 1>That's hilarious. Yeah. I think there's people that can't do stuff. Yeah.</v>

140
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.650
<v 0>I, I, I wish I could. I tried. I mean, it.</v>

141
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.550
<v 1>Seemed to be having a good time.</v>

142
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.490
<v 0>It's a mirror. I'm still nuts. All that. The second,</v>

143
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.290
like wife stuff happened in sobriety. That was like a crazy time.

144
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.870
That time in my life. It wasn't like college. It was like,

145
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:14.120
I was like 37 years old.

146
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.850
<v 1>A little slide truck, no big deal. I.</v>

147
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.830
<v 0>I'm, I'm grateful. It's a miracle that I did make it, make it to getting sober.</v>

148
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.010
Like when I look from 20 to 35, I mean,

149
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.610
even though it was years when I moved back, when I was here at 19 in the valley,

150
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.800
it was just a lot of playing dominoes and doing blow late into

151
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:36.950
the night. Oh yeah. All night with a bunch of like,

152
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.620
D-list like porn stars and a lawyer who dealt

153
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:47.600
us all of our blow. And it was just, and I was,

154
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.280
uh, yeah, I mean, I, and from that to like dating a really rich student,

155
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.580
being all over Europe and drinking Dom everywhere and being in Santra bay.

156
00:08:56.581 --> 00:09:01.530
And I was like, I've, I've always joked. I've made it look amazing.

157
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:05.160
But in, and people are like, why'd you quit? Why did you quit Virginia?

158
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.460
And they want to hear some story. Like I killed someone in a,

159
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.280
in a drunk driving accident, something that they can, and I'm like,

160
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.260
I was just dying inside,

161
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.890
like something in me knew that I could do better.

162
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.490
Like I knew there was like a little voice that always knew.

163
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.940
And part of it was being in rehab at 19.

164
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:28.210
Like it wasn't like I had evidence that, yeah. Yeah.

165
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.870
I mean, I can't imagine me on Twitter in 2016 without

166
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:37.080
alcohol and drugs, I would, I'd be banned.

167
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.710
I'd be canceled and I'd be banned.
