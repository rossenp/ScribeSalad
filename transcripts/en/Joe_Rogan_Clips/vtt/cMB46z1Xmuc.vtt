<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.720
But has there been anything in your life that was so horrific that they couldn't

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.820
imagine telling you?

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.380
<v 1>You know, except for my father's murder, not really. Maybe that was it.</v>

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.400
Maybe that was it, but boy, that,

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.430
that doesn't seem like it's big enough. I don't know.

7
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:24.510
How was your father murdered? Um, dad, uh,

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.200
dad was murdered in may of 1999.

9
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.840
He had answered a personals ad, um, for,

10
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.120
uh, a woman who was looking for a, you know, a boyfriend and, uh,

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.000
and the ad was headline kismet.

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.290
I believe as the Arab board for fate and dad,

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.630
uh, met with her, her name was Rita. She was a lawyer. Um,

14
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.650
she had worked in the prison system in the Midwest and dad was really,

15
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:58.920
really taken with her. She was really bright and really smart.

16
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.500
And she had an ex-husband who had sexually

17
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.290
abused her daughter from a different marriage.

18
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.180
And they were pressing charges against this ex-husband and he was going to go to

19
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:16.800
prison and she had met him while he was in prison and she was doing legal

20
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:19.230
work and she had helped him get out of prison.

21
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.620
So she helped him get out of prison and she'd married him.

22
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.430
He had abused her daughter. She divorced him.

23
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.090
She was prosecuting him to send him back to prison.

24
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.670
Then she met my father and this ex-husband

25
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.660
had said that if he ever caught her with another man, he would kill them both.

26
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.930
So my father

27
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.630
was going to pick her up and she was going to stay at his house in the mountains

28
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.400
until the time of the trial.

29
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.310
And as he was going to pick her up, he was going down this,

30
00:01:56.311 --> 00:02:00.780
this mountain road on his property and a giant Boulder broke

31
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.930
free and it rolled down the hillside and it blocked the road.

32
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:08.100
He couldn't get out. So he spent the day with this, uh, lever,

33
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.040
uh, forcing this Boulder off the road.

34
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.480
And then he took a couple extra hours and he made a sign that said kismet rock

35
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.960
so that he could label this Boulder as a kind of landmark.

36
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.360
But when he brought her back to sequester her and as he cleaned the

37
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:25.200
house, incredibly,

38
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:29.670
the house was just neat as a pen and stocked with all this food.

39
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.620
And, you know,

40
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:36.060
he really planned to have this fantastically sort of idyllic time sequestered

41
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.890
with his new girlfriend. And he labeled the rock to surprise her.

42
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.210
And then he went to pick her up. And when he went to pick her up,

43
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.320
the ex-husband showed up and he shot my father

44
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.990
and my father and the woman took refuge in her

45
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:58.050
house and the man set fire to the house

46
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.840
and the house eventually collapsed.

47
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.640
And the coroner says that they were both dead before the fire got to them.

48
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.620
Uh, and the coroner says that because of the angle of the shot,

49
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.580
my father probably took about 20 minutes to die because the bullet ruptured his

50
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.450
diaphragm. So with every breath, he would have been, um,

51
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.780
accumulating air below between the lung and the diaphragm.

52
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.770
And so every breath would have been more and more shallow because his lungs

53
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:31.510
would have been more and more constricted by this air, uh, above the diaphragm,

54
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.590
but that eventually had suffocated. Um,

55
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.270
and all of this sounds horrible and tragic,

56
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.930
but it forms this fantastic pattern in my father's life.

57
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.900
Because my father, when he was very small,

58
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.120
he lived in Northern Idaho with his, this enormous Ukrainian family.

59
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.940
And his father went, uh, crazy one day.

60
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.580
This is all public record. I've talked about this a lot,

61
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.040
but his father took a rifle and walked around the house and tried to

62
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:11.680
kill him, my father and,

63
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.160
and ultimately killed my father's boat.

64
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.660
Man killed his wife, my father's mother, and then killed himself.

65
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.740
But my father's earliest memories are of hiding underneath a bed.

66
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.270
As his father walked around the house in logging boots with a rifle,

67
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.500
calling his name, trying to get him to come out so that he could be killed.

68
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.300
And so my father spent his entire life sort of looking

69
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.440
for his mother because as his father was trying to kill him,

70
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:47.200
he was trying to find his mother who at that point had been killed.

71
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.660
And so my father really had this kind of cereal pattern with women.

72
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.770
He was always looking in a way for the woman, the woman,

73
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.150
and ultimately he was shot by the man with a gun

74
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.290
in the way that he would have been shot when he was four years old.

75
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.780
And one of the uncanny things is that their bodies were only preserved because

76
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.290
a bed on the second floor of this structure, as it was burning,

77
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.280
the bed fell over their bodies and insulated their bodies.

78
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.980
And my father had escaped his father by hiding under,

79
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.760
underneath the bed when he was a small child. And the fact that the,

80
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:32.230
the, the lonely hearts ad was, was headlined kismet.

81
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.220
And the fact that this Boulder rolled down in front of my father's car,

82
00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:37.420
just as he was leaving.

83
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.890
<v 0>That prevented him from getting there in time where he probably would have been</v>

84
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:44.710
able to escape before the ex boyfriend arrived.

85
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.220
<v 1>Or was, I don't know, there's so many odd,</v>

86
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.480
bizarre coincidences and synchronicities, you know,

87
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:55.960
you could sort of, you would have to really, um,

88
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.400
dismiss a lot of things in order to make this not something

89
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.930
a significant.

90
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.840
<v 0>Not fate or not some</v>

91
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.490
reoccurring theme woven into time.

92
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.170
<v 1>And in a way that, you know, understanding all these different aspects of it,</v>

93
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.550
it provides a comfort that it doesn't seem like this random thing.

94
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:23.690
It seems like something that my father's some aspect of my father's life that

95
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:27.560
was coming full circle, uh, and was finally being completed.

96
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.400
And maybe I am clutching at straws,

97
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.250
and I'm just a kind of person looking for significance,

98
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.170
which is what we all are. Um, but I'll take comfort where I can find it,

99
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.920
watch.
