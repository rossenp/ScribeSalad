1
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.990
<v 0>UFC 200. Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.230
the land arguably the landmark event and the history of the UFC.

3
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.270
We lose our main event the Wednesday before

4
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.350
UFC 200 millions, if not,

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.190
tens of millions into the marketing of that. Um, you know,

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.020
the success of the pay perview probably hinges on that great main event between

7
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:30.340
John and, and Daniel and we lost it three or four days before.

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.380
And that could happen at, you know, at any given moment.

9
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.700
Now we talked about this.

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.100
<v 1>Before the podcast, um,</v>

11
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.980
what you could or could not talk about with the current state of John Jones

12
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:41.380
investigation. So where's.

13
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.330
<v 0>It at right now? Yeah. So, you know, generally we don't talk about, um, a case.</v>

14
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.410
So, so how the process works when an athlete tests positive,

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.730
yada will notify me. Um,

16
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.770
I usually pick the phone up right away and call Dana and let him know.

17
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.850
And the UFC puts out an announcement. They say, you know, in the case of John,

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.960
John tested positive, uh, and in an, in competition on this date,

19
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.440
um, you know, more information will be provided at the appropriate time.

20
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.520
That's generally all we'll talk about. Now,

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.400
if the athlete chooses to talk about, you know, scenarios of, of what happened,

22
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.480
then they're free to do that. Um,

23
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.600
at that point you saw it in the UFC can comment on it. So there's been,

24
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:25.950
some things talked about in the John Case. Um, John, um,

25
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.990
particularly he had two clean tests on July 7th and

26
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.950
July 8th before his positive test on, I think July 30th,

27
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:37.110
which was way in day. Um,

28
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.070
and the positive test was for de hydro chloral methyl, testosterone,

29
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:43.310
or oral ball. Um,

30
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.660
this is a substance that was used by the east Germans, um,

31
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.780
regularly in the late sixties, and then came into the fold a little bit more,

32
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.620
um, of what's come out recently, um, outta Russia. So, um, I know you had, uh,

33
00:01:56.621 --> 00:01:58.820
Brian Fogel on for the, for the OUS movie.

34
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.300
I think he talked about a little bit about this, um, uh,

35
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:05.300
Gregory the head of the, the Moscow Wata laboratory.

36
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.050
This drug became kind of part of his protocol, um, with his athletes.

37
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.370
He then ironically enough developed a test for the long term metabolites of the

38
00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:17.570
drug. So previous to that,

39
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:22.450
the detection window of this drug was a couple of days. So it was a drug that,

40
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.970
you know, even if you run a strict program, an athlete may gamble with taking,

41
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.360
because it had a quick clearance time after he discovered the long term

42
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.280
metabolite, um, test that changed.

43
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.160
It went from a detected when detection window of a couple days to a detection

44
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:40.360
window of several months. And this was widely known. You know,

45
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.840
it wasn't a secret initially they kept it quiet.

46
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.560
They went back and retested some samples and there was a whole, you know,

47
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.790
a bunch of positives.

48
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:51.830
And then it got out 2013 around that there was this new test.

49
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.750
So right up front, you know, I've, I've said this a while now is,

50
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.960
would not make a lot of sense for an individual, a UFC athlete that knew,

51
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.120
you know, especially, you know, a champion contender like John Jones that knew,

52
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.060
Hey,

53
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.720
I'm tested quite regularly in this program would not make a lot of sense that

54
00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:13.520
that would be your drug of choice if you were intentionally trying to cheat.

55
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.400
Um,

56
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.230
I think it's come out after the fact that you saw to did another test on

57
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.270
John, um, a month or two or a couple months after his positive test.

58
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.670
And he was negative during that test. So that would be indicative that,

59
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.450
you know,

60
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.910
the prohibited system entered his system or the prohibited substance entered his

61
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:35.030
system, you know,

62
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.180
sometime after July 7th or eighth and was likely know a pretty small amount

63
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:44.300
and that it cleared his system pretty quickly. Um, again, you know,

64
00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:46.020
who knows where it plays out,

65
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.300
but certainly on the surface of things I have said, you know,

66
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:53.620
at this point in the game with that type of information out there, um, it,

67
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:57.460
it wouldn't indicate intentional use. Now that could be wrong.

68
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.850
I don't know that definitively. And, and we'll see how this plays out, uh,

69
00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:06.330
right now where the process is, is John and yada are working closely. Um,

70
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.490
I'm aware that there was a meeting a week or two ago, pretty lengthy meeting,

71
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.970
which, uh, I was told was productive. Uh,

72
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:16.130
wasn't given details of what productive meant. Um,

73
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.890
but I think that's an important thing right now,

74
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.000
and that John's follow through with is to of retrace all of his steps between

75
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:22.790
that, you know,

76
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.520
last July 8th positive test and or negative test and the positive test on

77
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.120
July 29th or July 30th.

78
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.240
<v 1>It certainly seems like, uh, based on what you just said,</v>

79
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.520
that this is something that was accidentally taken,

80
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.040
but if you can't prove that something was accidentally taken,

81
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:43.310
like if you can't nail it down, um, what do you, what happens there? Yeah, it's.

82
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.670
<v 0>It's difficult. And that's, you know,</v>

83
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:46.910
that's kind of the nightmare scenario that a lot of, you know,

84
00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:50.670
that an athlete can face and in a big role of what Donna and I do to prevent

85
00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:55.670
that from happening to show them what type of care and consideration is

86
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:59.230
needed to make sure you don't get into a scenario like that, you know,

87
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.990
under a program like this, you have to be,

88
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.020
be careful about everything that's put into your body, um, everything.

89
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.420
And, uh, if you're not, there can be, you know, severe consequences. Um,

90
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.940
so yeah, we'll, we'll see where this plays out. I,

91
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.780
I tell you the one thing that I, that I can say about this is, you know,

92
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:21.770
this is obviously John's second time, um, in the program with testing positive.

93
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.850
And in the first time he went through a pretty lengthy, um, appeal process.

94
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.370
And there was a publicly issued, uh, decision 50,

95
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.690
60 pages that went through all the evidence that, um, that the independent,

96
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.530
um, uh, arbitrators heard and, and decided on.

97
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.160
And what they said defend in that case was John,

98
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.120
there was no evidence that John intentionally cheated,

99
00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:51.120
however he operated with careless, reckless disregard. Um,

100
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.040
so he ended up getting the maximum for that, for those substances,

101
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:55.320
he tested positive for a.

102
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.680
<v 1>Year. And that was for some gas station Viagra type.</v>

103
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.800
<v 0>No, well, it was actually a couple of anti-estrogen drugs,</v>

104
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.920
but what was shown and what the evidence pointed to was that he took a pill,

105
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.520
um, that was manufactured from a website by the name of all American peptide.

106
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.720
Uh, the pill was reported to be a sea Alice, um, pill.

107
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.710
So Recile Def dysfunction pill that was tainted with these two drugs. Mm.

108
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.710
Now the problem with the arbitrator said is if he would've gone to that website

109
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.710
and the arbitrators did, and I did,

110
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:31.070
you would've seen that that same website offered, you know, tons of performance,

111
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:35.950
enhance prohibited, performance enhancing drugs. And the website said, you know,

112
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.900
not for human for research purposes only.

113
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.180
So it really was careless this regard, that being said, however, John's,

114
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.180
you know, second time through the program. Now,

115
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.620
the second sanction this time for, you know,

116
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.820
an anabolic type steroid would have, you know,

117
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:55.700
a starting point potentially of a four year suspension,

118
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.650
that's a starting point that that could be a starting point, right?

119
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.410
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, unless there are mitigating factors. Now I don't,

120
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.343
you know, again,

121
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.570
the beauty of this program is it's not the UFC or not me deciding, right.

122
00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:09.850
You know, what the sanction's gonna be. No one can accuse us of, you know,

123
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.090
operating for business purposes or favoritism or whatever. Right. Um,

124
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.250
but that being said, you know,

125
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:18.920
when we put this program together and figured out, you know,

126
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:20.280
what sanctioning would look like,

127
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.960
I don't necessarily think that we put up a four year sanction, um,

128
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.280
for a second term offense,

129
00:07:26.281 --> 00:07:29.160
when the first term offense was shown that that person didn't cheat

130
00:07:29.161 --> 00:07:32.680
intentionally, right. Just operated with careless disregard. So, so who.

131
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.600
<v 1>Makes that distinction.</v>

132
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.360
<v 0>Then yada, yada makes that distinction. They, you know,</v>

133
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.590
they have a whole team looking at it. They can compare it to other cases under,

134
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.350
you know, the wa uh, Olympic type umbrella, similar cases. Um,

135
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.230
I will say this, that, you know, I think we've had, uh, a few over 60, um,

136
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.670
positive adverse events in this case.

137
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.430
And those that have been adjudicated I've been comfortable every time that

138
00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:59.580
they've made a fair and balance and reasonable decision.

139
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.980
And that's part of my job is to be the eyes and ears for athletes to make sure

140
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.860
not only is the program being administered properly and has strength,

141
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.460
but also that they're being treated fairly and that they have due process.

142
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.020
So I have all the confidence in the world. However, this does come out,

143
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.380
that it will be the right decision.

144
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.330
The other really cool thing about the program is the transplant see the program.

145
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.690
So, you know, it won't just be me saying this, however, it does come out,

146
00:08:24.691 --> 00:08:28.250
whether it goes to arbitration or whether John and you saw to reach a

147
00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:33.170
settlement, it'll be well spelled out about why that sanction, uh,

148
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.023
was determined.

149
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.050
<v 1>Now you say starting point, meaning that it could potentially be.</v>

150
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.200
<v 0>More, it could. So, uh, when there's something called aggravating circumstances,</v>

151
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.240
so more than just knowingly taking the drug, lying, taking the drug and lying,

152
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.640
trying to cover it up, taking multiple drugs, one trying to hide the other.

153
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:56.840
Yeah, you could, you could get double, um, uh, the sanction amount. So, um,

154
00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.960
you know, on a second time,

155
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.960
anabolic steroid four years is kind of the starting point.

156
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.760
You can go lower for mitigating factors.

157
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.400
You can go higher for aggravating factors up to eight years. Um,

158
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.360
so yeah, I mean, it would have to require something, you know,

159
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.830
really severe and egregious to get wow. To get up that, that.
