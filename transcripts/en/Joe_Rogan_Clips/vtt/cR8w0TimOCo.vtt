WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So have you been,</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.050
have you paid attention to this Jeffrey Epstein's stuff? Yeah.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.700
A little bit way things going on.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.310
<v 1>I think, uh, uh, I think he, uh.</v>

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.433
<v 0>If you had to guess.</v>

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.590
<v 1>I think the too many, very powerful people, he had stuff on too many,</v>

7
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:22.710
very powerful people likely, right? Probably.

8
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.440
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. They took the guy off suicide watch,</v>

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.650
even though he's one of the most important witnesses. Yeah. Weird.

10
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.360
A really creepy high profile case that might have

11
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:36.030
connected a bunch of really powerful people. Yeah.

12
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.160
<v 1>I don't, I'm not, I don't, I don't necessarily believe that it's,</v>

13
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.390
you know, the people from like it's Trump or it's the Democrat.

14
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.840
I think there's other very powerful people that would have wanted this guy to

15
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:49.674
go.

16
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.650
<v 0>You have no idea how many very powerful people want Scott to go away.</v>

17
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.340
He could sing, he could sing for his freedom.

18
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.191
<v 1>My question is,</v>

19
00:00:56.191 --> 00:01:00.570
is there didn't they give like a whole bunch of evidence and stuff from him that

20
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:02.130
like these powerful people would have. Yeah.

21
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.560
<v 0>Oh yeah. Yeah. Whereas all of that stuff. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.240
You said you didn't know that he had a cellmate.

23
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.260
This was the guy that was the cellmate. Well that's how hard is he?

24
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.273
That guy him.

25
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.750
Former cop Jeffrey Epstein reported it wasn't checked on for hours before his

26
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:17.970
appearance suicide. That, that guy found him there.

27
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.160
Like how high do we think that that guy didn't kill him.

28
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.653
<v 1>They left her.</v>

29
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.110
<v 0>Rope in there.</v>

30
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.260
That guy could definitely kill him without leaving that guy looks.

31
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.390
<v 1>Like he could do some damp. Look at the guy's arms.</v>

32
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.430
<v 0>That guy could just wrap Jeffrey Epstein up in a bear hug and hanging himself.</v>

33
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.910
Maybe.

34
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.743
<v 1>Just choked him.</v>

35
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.591
<v 0>Yeah. I mean,</v>

36
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:38.700
he could put that noose around Epstein's neck and then squeeze his arms together

37
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:41.670
and just pull on it until the guy hangs to death and then go, oh my God,

38
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:43.530
I phone him hugged. How.

39
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.910
<v 1>Did that guys jacked?</v>

40
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.440
<v 0>Huge.</v>

41
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.640
Imagine you go to jail in a high profile case and they throw you in there with a

42
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:53.390
giant bald guy. That's like gross a burger.

43
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.180
<v 1>From stir.</v>

44
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.560
<v 0>Crazy. But look at this.</v>

45
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.950
This is like caricature of the guy you don't want to be stuck.

46
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.160
<v 1>Exactly. Yeah. In the bad movie.</v>

47
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:04.830
That's the guy you're waiting for you in the cell. Next cop.

48
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.230
<v 0>Yeah. He looks like, what is his name?</v>

49
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.790
<v 1>What? He go to jail for it.</v>

50
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.110
<v 0>Look at his name. [inaudible].</v>

51
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.030
<v 1>Westchester county charges.</v>

52
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.880
The deaths of four men stabbing from an alleged cocaine, drug conspiracy.

53
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.400
<v 0>And bro, he's that big. And he's 51.</v>

54
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.360
How many cops are smuggling steroids in their to, to get to this guy?

55
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.220
How is he staying that way?

56
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.800
<v 1>So how he hung himself? So then,</v>

57
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:34.230
so they had like a belt or a rope left in there.

58
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.560
<v 0>This guy probably said, listen, if you keep getting me into juice,</v>

59
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.570
I'll keep this guy on ice. Right? They didn't, uh,

60
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.730
they said, this is the one conspiracy.

61
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.750
This is the one conspiracy where nobody

62
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.840
believes the true story that I've talked to. No.

63
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.160
<v 1>Nobody except.</v>

64
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.510
<v 0>Michael Shermer. Who? Michael Shermer, the guy who runs skeptics, magazines.</v>

65
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:00.580
Friend of mine. Nice guy. I couldn't disagree with him more.

66
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.380
He thinks that things just happen and people kill themselves. Oh,

67
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.560
he that's his take. He likes a lot of conspiracy. No,

68
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:11.890
no silence is conspiracies. He's never met a conspiracy.

69
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.020
He likes doesn't like any conspiracy.

70
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.890
And this one is almost predictable.

71
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.560
He's right now he's writing away.

72
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:23.410
And I think his concept is pull up his tweets so we could read what he's saying.

73
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.240
<v 1>I mean, you're not in a good place.</v>

74
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.700
You could see wanting to kill yourself for sure.

75
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.230
<v 0>You know, make that a larger blues.</v>

76
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.330
<v 2>I don't know where he like he started. Yeah.</v>

77
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.410
<v 0>Well just, just make it larger. It just seemed to make no scroll.</v>

78
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:39.040
Scroll down a little bit there. Okay. A new conspiracy theory development.

79
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:42.010
I was thinking regarding suicide. They made it happen on purpose

80
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.580
[inaudible] in here. It is here. It is. Scroll down.

81
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.850
If some no-name pedophile die by suicide in prison, awaiting trial,

82
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.400
anyone would anyone bother concocting?

83
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.950
Conspiracy theories about him being murdered,

84
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.660
murdered by clan to Stein outside forces. Of course not as with JFK,

85
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.610
Diana, Maryland at all.

86
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.110
Fame warps perspective and fuels unwarranted speculation.

87
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.860
First of all, this is not unwarranted. Second of all,

88
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:12.790
if you don't think that powerful people have people killed your hilarious,

89
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.100
like that is awfully naive. Yeah, they do do it. It says,

90
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:22.660
remember the adage regarding conspiracy theories never attribute to malice.

91
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:27.430
What can be explained by incompetence or chance. True. Sure.

92
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.030
You shouldn't do that. It is possible, but what, what are the odds?

93
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.690
There's something, this is so bad.

94
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.800
<v 1>Because he's in so many circles and touch so many super powerful people.</v>

95
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:39.634
It's different.

96
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.810
<v 0>Powerful people.</v>

97
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.050
<v 1>It's he's not just a pedophile.</v>

98
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.170
<v 0>Like he's saying,</v>

99
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.880
gave him a $70 million house in New York

100
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:51.550
city gave him, him. One of his clients gave.

101
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.210
<v 2>He was the power of attorney at the time. So he signed it over to himself.</v>

102
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.900
Rather.

103
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.160
<v 0>Not let him do that.</v>

104
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.670
<v 2>That's the question is whether or not he even knew it was.</v>

105
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.740
<v 0>Happening. Oh, come on. Like he just stole the house.</v>

106
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.450
<v 2>From the guy. He was in control of a lot of stuff. Yeah.</v>

107
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.530
<v 0>[Inaudible] seven games coming. That's what's coming out now.</v>

108
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.810
But how would the guy who did he signed it off on?

109
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.420
How would the guy not know this guy stole his house and not Sue him?

110
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:14.200
He was in control.

111
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.430
<v 2>Of all of his finances.</v>

112
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.260
<v 0>Right. But the guy was, he was living in the house. Who? The guy Wexner? No,</v>

113
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.980
absolutely.

114
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.350
<v 2>They bought, he bought the house for him basically.</v>

115
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.490
<v 0>That's what I'm saying. The guy bought it for Epstein, right? Yeah.</v>

116
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.390
But he who it buys you a $70 million. I don't know. No one's.

117
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.230
<v 1>Bought me nothing.</v>

118
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.630
<v 0>There's there's so many questions. This guy's about where his wealth was.</v>

119
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:39.640
And then the color of his house.

120
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.960
<v 1>Didn't he own anything.</v>

121
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.650
<v 2>I love the eyeballs on the entrance and set the about the house is crazy too.</v>

122
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.720
<v 0>There's like cameras inside the house and.</v>

123
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.030
But the other thing was the house that's on the island.

124
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:51.820
That is the same color it's painted in the same way.

125
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:53.980
These rarely flag is [inaudible]

126
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.813
. And this, there was an idea. People are wondering like how far this guy's influence goes and where it comes from. And look at this house, bro. That was his house, his house on this island.

127
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.380
<v 2>Island. It's like a building there that's.</v>

128
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.070
<v 0>A temple year out on his island, bro. That's a dope temple by the way,</v>

129
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.280
Elena was awesome. Jeez. I would love that. If that was my house, come on in.

130
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.090
Oh, how'd he get so much money. Exactly. No one really knows.

131
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.070
<v 1>Didn't he have something to do with Victoria secret?</v>

132
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.420
<v 0>Yeah. He, um,</v>

133
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.130
he managed some money for the Victoria secrets guy that owned that. Correct? Uh,

134
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.220
the guy who gave him the house. Oh yeah. You know,

135
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:33.110
bill Clinton flew on his private jet. No less than 26 times. Whatever.

136
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.160
No big deal. He.

137
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.080
<v 1>Was hung out of Mar-a-Lago. Yeah.</v>

138
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.900
<v 0>But I mean, I flew with him 26 times.</v>

139
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.690
I've never flown with it. It'd be,

140
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:44.450
have to be my very best friends that I tour with all the time.

141
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.490
Have I flown with you 26 times? Maybe four or five when I'm ain't really ever.

142
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.670
Maybe if we flew together, it might be a little more than four or five.

143
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:55.550
It might be 10. It might be 10. I mean, I've known you for years.

144
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.960
It's not been 26 times. So bill Clinton swollen with his one guy.

145
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.330
Why he's the president of the United States? I think.

146
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.840
Was he still president then? Or it was afterwards. I.

147
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.080
<v 1>Flew with Jerry probably 20 times. I don't make any money.</v>

148
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.160
<v 0>I liked fly whichever I don't have to pay. I mean,</v>

149
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:16.460
that's a lot of times it would be partying with a dude.

150
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.770
You would think that you would find out about how that guy.

151
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.140
<v 2>That when he hadn't planned on the plane was sort of when he up.</v>

152
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.270
Cause he was that's when he stopped flying under the radar.

153
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.960
Who did Jeffrey up to when that, when that day happened. Oh,

154
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.110
and he's been like hiding ever since, because that was like 2003 or four.

155
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.710
Oh really? When he got busted was shortly after that.

156
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.760
<v 1>Since then it wasn't, uh, it wasn't Trump talking about it with Howard.</v>

157
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.940
<v 0>And Howard stern. What was he talking about? Oh, about that.</v>

158
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:45.050
He likes them young ladies.

159
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.670
<v 1>Yeah. Like why were they talking about him? I don't know. Cause he was, uh,</v>

160
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:50.030
I guess he.

161
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.590
<v 0>Was arrested or something.</v>

162
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.880
<v 1>No.</v>

163
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.070
<v 0>I was just in the news. The rest was later.</v>

164
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.040
And that was part of the problem was that with the arrest,

165
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.780
the arrest was for some sexual thing with underage girls and he got a really

166
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:05.320
light sentence and people were freaking out about,

167
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.550
and then one woman pursued this pretty heavily.

168
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:10.340
She was a journalist and she produced, pursued this story. Right.

169
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.700
<v 2>I'll tell you, I tried to find out the Miami Herald. But uh,</v>

170
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.160
that book I was telling you, I just read about James Patterson.

171
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:18.320
He said everything that kind of came out in that story,

172
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.720
they already wrote about, about 2016.

173
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:23.450
And for some reason the media didn't really pick up on it.

174
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.490
He said he wrote letters to everyone. Well, yeah, that was.

175
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.510
<v 0>When that was when this guy got that really light sentence was around there.</v>

176
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:31.700
But this one woman kept writing about it.

177
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.490
And this is one of the things that pull up the name of this woman that,

178
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.890
because this one woman really doggedly pursued this story is because of

179
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:40.724
her.

180
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.540
And I think a lot of it had to do with her recognition that this guy who had

181
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:47.030
gotten his creepy lights on. Yeah.

182
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.550
Not to be confused with downtown Julie Brown.

183
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.490
<v 2>Julie Cape, she.</v>

184
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.000
<v 0>Was great. Like Michael B. Jordan doctor. Not the,</v>

185
00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:57.780
not the.

186
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.990
<v 1>World's greatest. No one wants her name is even close to the story.</v>

187
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:06.120
<v 0>James Brown, the sportscaster was that guy. Nice guy.</v>

188
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:09.780
James Brown. Sportscaster. Yeah. How the do you call yourself? James Brown.

189
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.510
Dare you like he owns that, right? Like Michael Jackson,

190
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.240
if you're Michael Jackson and you're a singer. You're who.

191
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.670
<v 1>Right, right. Yeah.</v>

192
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.480
Don't you have anyone in your camp telling you this is a bad idea. Isn't it?

193
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.540
<v 0>They're two of those cuts. Like a knife guys. What's that? Guy's name?</v>

194
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.280
The guy from Canada. Um,

195
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.960
Brian, Brian Adams.

196
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.170
<v 1>There's Brian and there's Ryan. Ryan.</v>

197
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.130
<v 0>Ryan, Ryan. Your name.</v>

198
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.930
<v 1>You can't even got in trouble too.</v>

199
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.900
<v 0>How about Ricky Adams? Be Ricky Adams. Ricky Adams,</v>

200
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.880
Whatever happened to Bryan Adams, man that cuts like a knife gun.

201
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:49.853
Like that was awesome.

202
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.570
<v 1>Summer of 69.</v>

203
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.980
<v 0>Yeah. He had some great jams.</v>

204
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.220
<v 1>I think he's still playing casinos. Yeah.</v>

205
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.260
I really I've seen him in a show tonight where Bristow, Virginia.

206
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.930
<v 0>They shall go to see him. We should make a road trip. He.</v>

207
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.090
<v 1>Best. Yeah. I'm sure it's a good show.</v>

208
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.720
<v 0>We really have to start doing stuff like that. Yeah. Road trips.</v>

209
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.220
Just to go to see ridiculous shows.

210
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.430
<v 1>Yeah. Definitely friends out there. Journeys.</v>

211
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.490
<v 0>Out there. The journey with the Japanese in there. Yeah.</v>

212
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.020
<v 1>That's bad-ass.</v>

213
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.790
<v 0>As good as Steve Perry ever did in his prime. I know.</v>

214
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.970
<v 1>Amazing. Steve Perry is still out there. I don't think he's performing,</v>

215
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:27.804
but he's still around.

216
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.580
<v 0>What are you playing? Brian Adams. Try and crop. Wow. Look at that. Fine Adams.</v>

217
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:33.810
Yeah. That's all.

218
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.490
<v 1>Yeah. That was a star.</v>

219
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.500
<v 0>Post-menopausal chips.</v>

220
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.510
<v 1>At the summer of 16.</v>

221
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.060
<v 0>What does he look like these days? I stretch in here.</v>

222
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.850
<v 1>That he's REMS fit.</v>

223
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.990
<v 0>Stretched out back. He says Brian abs that's the ham.</v>

224
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:50.903
<v 1>Yeah. It's him.</v>

225
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.160
<v 0>It's a weird black and white photo.</v>

226
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.440
So he's got some Snapchat filter on them too.

227
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.210
<v 1>He's obviously a spiritually sound. He looks healthy.</v>

228
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.810
<v 0>Well listen, man, that guy was a, he was a rock star when I was in high school.</v>

229
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.130
That's right. And if he looks that good today, that's incredible.

230
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.440
<v 1>Taking care of himself. Must be. Yeah, he's doing something right.</v>

231
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.890
It's not running around after teenage girls. It's living a good life.

232
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.410
<v 0>Floozies flying them a bill. Clinton's</v>

233
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.270
[inaudible] what are we doing today?

234
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.510
<v 1>Yeah. It's for.</v>

235
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.680
<v 0>Conspiracy theorists right now. Like for uh, Sam Tripoli. No Sam Tripoli,</v>

236
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.500
tinfoil hat podcast in who's.

237
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.320
<v 1>Gone. God couldn't be happier.</v>

238
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.820
<v 0>But he's taken it to another level.</v>

239
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.810
He thinks he's not really dead that they faked his death. Ah, of course.

240
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.430
<v 1>Geez, Louise, for.</v>

241
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.180
<v 0>When a conspiracy theory is obvious, they look for the non-obvious possible.</v>

242
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.750
Cause they do the exact opposite of what Michael Sherman was talking about.

243
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.810
Theorists never attribute to malice, everything. Right?

244
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.830
Everything is malice. All of it.

245
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.320
If it looks obvious, this is something more.

246
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.620
<v 1>Uh it's so creepy. God. Well God good. Who cares? How, what?</v>

247
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.933
It's good. He's gone.

248
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.110
<v 0>Maybe not man. Maybe not these guys. Maybe not. Maybe if he stayed alive,</v>

249
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.900
he could have told us some stuff about some terrible people that are still alive

250
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:17.734
doing things.

251
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.660
<v 1>He's the worst one. I don't know.</v>

252
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.160
<v 0>About that. He's a creeper.</v>

253
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.280
How do we know that we know he's a creep most likely,

254
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.970
but we definitely don't know if he's the worst out of all those people that he

255
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:30.010
was creeping with. Yeah.

256
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.400
The thing is if the guy really did film a bunch of people that are super

257
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:34.570
powerful people doing crazy.

258
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.320
<v 1>Yeah. There's gotta be some stuff. Right. Um,</v>

259
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.130
if I was leading the investigation, I'd go after the hard drives.

260
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.080
That's where they keep it all.

261
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.970
<v 0>They did find hard drives, filled with stuff that he had. They did, yeah.</v>

262
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.420
That he had with the very young girls and suggestive poses.

263
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:54.790
And I don't know if it was pornography,

264
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:59.590
but they were talking about how many different photos of young ladies

265
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.143
found on his computer.

266
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.830
<v 1>All right. Enough with this guy.</v>

267
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.860
<v 0>But I don't know if they were young, like illegal or young, like 18.</v>
