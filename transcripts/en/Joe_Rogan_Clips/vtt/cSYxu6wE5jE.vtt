1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.160
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um, what.</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.110
<v 1>Is it like in the lockdown for you? You still live in New York.</v>

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.990
<v 2>Yeah. I live in New York, so yeah. I mean it's, I was telling everybody it's,</v>

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.970
uh, you know, it's, it's very, it's not like new people like us,

5
00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:19.400
like New York in the seventies now, the seventies was a whole different vibe.

6
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.630
And, but now it's all boarded up stores, the store, my corner,

7
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:28.400
like the corner bodega basically just closed. And it was, uh, you know,

8
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.000
it was around for a long time and you know, it's,

9
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.590
it's depressing like you on the subway.

10
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:36.710
There's only a few people on and it's still smell it smells is they've been

11
00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:39.710
cleaning it every day and it still stinks. It doesn't even smell better.

12
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.330
That's how ingrained it is. And, um, you know,

13
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.260
the, the pigeons are homeless. Cause Antifa took down all the statues,

14
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:52.730
so they have no place to live. And, um, yeah,

15
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.180
it's a very sad, it's a very, uh, weird place. Yeah. You can't.

16
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.820
<v 1>Say like people that say it's like the seventies, like no, the seventies,</v>

17
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:01.880
it was like, it was the fifties and the sixties and the seventies was like,

18
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.390
it didn't change much. It was seedy and weird. And,

19
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.830
but it was always like that this is our drastic change from six months ago.

20
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.210
You can't say it's like the seventies because it's not, it's like a,

21
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.910
something's deteriorated, there's a collapse. Right.

22
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:20.090
And then there's all this weirdness that comes along with that. The.

23
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.310
<v 2>Seventies was kind of a collapse, but it was a different type.</v>

24
00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:26.420
So like in the seventies, all the stores at night would be locked up,

25
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.000
but they were open during the day. So at night,

26
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.060
if anybody's out after nine at night, that was on them. But I mean,

27
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:34.250
but it was not like now that she's 24,

28
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.070
you're walking down deserted streets is nobody out. You know what I mean?

29
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.960
Have you always lived in New York present? Yeah. Yeah.

30
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.530
<v 1>So, so it was sketchy in the seventies.</v>

31
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.680
<v 2>Oh my God. Yeah. I mean, I did a whole, I did a whole show about it basically,</v>

32
00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:46.101
but I mean,

33
00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:50.660
it was basically like we bought one of the jokes from my own New York story was

34
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.070
that, and it wasn't a joke.

35
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:55.280
It was if you walk down your block because there's no cell phone.

36
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.040
So if you walk down the block from the train, after nine at night,

37
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.280
people would lean out the window and be like, genuinely surprised,

38
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:05.090
like good for you. You made it home. If you, if you stayed out, if tonight,

39
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.890
like times square people would go to Broadway shows by 11

40
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:10.610
o'clock.

41
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.420
It was deserted except for criminals because people would leave watershed.

42
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:15.860
They wouldn't go out for a drink with dinner.

43
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.620
They would get in a car and get out immediately.

44
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.160
<v 1>And Giuliani is the one that cleaned all that up. Juliana cleaned it up. Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.740
And then amazing. It gets no respect. Now. Now.

46
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.500
<v 2>I know, you know, he went a little crazy, but he really, he,</v>

47
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.240
he did what no politician has ever done in, in any, in history,

48
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.810
which is, he said, I'm going to transform this. And he did. He.

49
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.870
<v 1>Turned it around. Yeah. He really did. He really did. Maybe.</v>

50
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.703
<v 2>A little too far,</v>

51
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.950
like at a certain may have been a little too far square became like a mall.

52
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.030
He has times square is very, uh, uninspiring to became like a big Applebee's,

53
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.230
but that's yeah. That's exactly. That's exactly what it's like.

54
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.220
And w you know, even though like, now I look back and I'm like, oh,

55
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.440
taxi driver in New York, it was edgy. It was fun.

56
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.820
But at the time it was joke people, you know,

57
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.330
I glamorize it through rose colored glasses, but it was serious. Yeah.

58
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.100
So the thing about.

59
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.420
<v 1>Crime and crime ridden areas, like people always glamorize it after the fact,</v>

60
00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:11.850
but if you're living there while it's going down, it's terrible.

61
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.720
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, most people love New York once he took over in the nineties,</v>

62
00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:18.270
people forget that. Yeah. That everybody was just like, oh,

63
00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:22.440
I can go out at night. Oh, I can work. I can in, I mean, before that it was,

64
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.940
it was crazy. And I used to bartend around times square. And I mean,

65
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.820
the stuff you saw, you know, was just brutal. You know.

66
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.780
<v 1>What I mean? Well,</v>

67
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:33.570
one of the things we're finding out from this lockdown is that it really is

68
00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:37.770
important who your mayor is to be important. He didn't really care.

69
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.810
People didn't care who the mayor of LA was,

70
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.180
half the people didn't even know that's right. And now they're like,

71
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:45.570
who is this? That's keeping everything closed. Yeah. Yeah.

72
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.160
And the same thing with New York.

73
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.630
<v 2>Was Blasio from day one, Mo a lot of people like it and now everybody hates it.</v>

74
00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:56.610
But this is his second term. Yes. He got reelected. Oh, he swept both elections.

75
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.720
That's hilarious.

76
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.790
<v 3>You know? And now we're finding out yeah.</v>

77
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.420
<v 1>Oh, he's, he's a. Yeah. Just took, it, took something,</v>

78
00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:06.570
whereas a crisis where you realize like, this is not a leader.

79
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.660
<v 2>And everybody hated Bloomberg for running a third term.</v>

80
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:12.390
They wish they had him for fifth. Now, remember, he's like, oh,

81
00:04:12.391 --> 00:04:15.570
he's forced himself to rifle one for third, nobody misses, you know.

82
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.750
<v 1>A guy like him. Could he go back? Could he run again?</v>

83
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.920
Because he can't be president.

84
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.010
<v 3>Ones. But, um.</v>

85
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.990
<v 2>I don't know. He was so terrible in the debate.</v>

86
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.490
It's so funny because the thing about Bloomberg that disappointed me as far as

87
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.810
it was when he was mayor, when he first got elected mayor, I was a Darrell,

88
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:36.030
Hammond had to bail on some show he supposed to do so they,

89
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.010
at the last minute they asked me to do a favor, do a guest shot at the show,

90
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.490
which I go up really didn't go that well. But it was, you know,

91
00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:45.570
I did what he was asking me.

92
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.440
<v 1>What kind of show, what was a standup show? But it was just a show.</v>

93
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.990
<v 2>For Bloomberg Bloomberg. I was trying to get the, uh,</v>

94
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.180
the Olympics here or something. I think it was the Olympics. So he asked me to,

95
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.220
you know, Doris was at a show when he had something else.

96
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.000
So I ran over and I lived in Midtown. I ran over, literally ran over.

97
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.670
Did the show in front of the Olympic committee or whatever the committee was.

98
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:09.750
I think it was the Olympics and you know, 30 people in his uncomfortable room.

99
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.570
And then afterwards Bloomberg shook my hand and I knew he was already a

100
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:15.600
billionaire. And he goes, I owe you one. I go, thanks. Thanks. He goes, no, no,

101
00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:20.040
no. I don't just say that. I always, we pay my debts. I owe you one.

102
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.150
So I was kind of hoping to be president. And then I could call in my chit.

103
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:27.180
Cause I never did the whole time. He was mayor realized he was busy.

104
00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:28.140
I let it slide. But.

105
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.100
<v 1>He still owes you though, huh? Yeah. You got it on a ledger somewhere.</v>

106
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.030
<v 2>No, but I just have my oral, I believe in the, or I have the oral history.</v>

107
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.970
Oh yeah. I mean, I've thought it came right out. Didn't.

108
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.770
<v 1>It? Got it. Oh yeah. So maybe if he becomes a man, can you become married again?</v>

109
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.980
How does that work? Can be president again? Can you be mayor again?

110
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.290
<v 2>I guess you can. Yeah. Why not? Is probably no longer.</v>

111
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.070
<v 1>Governor of California that Jerry Brown guy, he became governor again.</v>

112
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.950
That's right. Yeah. So if you can be governing, you've gotta be mayor.

113
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.860
Like he was governor in like the nineties, the early nineties,

114
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:01.960
I think, I.

115
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.350
<v 2>Think in the eighties, because I think Johnny Costa used to make those shirts.</v>

116
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.273
Oh, for smoking.

117
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.230
<v 4>Crack didn't he went again in DC for being.</v>

118
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.470
<v 1>Married. Mary and Barry. Yeah. There you go.</v>

119
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.120
I wonder how many terms he did though.

120
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.540
Like wonder if there's like a limit on how many terms you could be.

121
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.830
You're more politically minded than I am. Like.

122
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.140
<v 2>I don't know that kind of stuff though. No. How many.</v>

123
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.220
<v 1>Terms can you be a mayor?</v>

124
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.670
Cause someone like Bloomberg has got to come back in and clean New York city up.

125
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.420
Cause it's,

126
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.600
you're not going to get there with this social justice warrior out to the

127
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.130
DeBlasio has it's just going to lead to more complete deterioration of that

128
00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:33.910
city. Yeah.

129
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.290
<v 2>But it may, it may be too late. You never know too late. You never know. I mean,</v>

130
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:42.760
nobody likes to think of New York that way, but it's like a lot of people,

131
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.190
so many people move to that. I was shocked,

132
00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:48.250
moved to the suburbs that I was like, wow, this is serious. Like,

133
00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:51.700
I didn't really believe it just because I'm so New York, like I just,

134
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:54.670
I don't even think in terms of leaving New York, even, even though, you know,

135
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.750
it's irrevocably changed to me before any of this happened.

136
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.890
But so many people moved out. I was like, this is getting sick. What'd.

137
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.460
<v 1>You think about that? Uh, alter cer Jerry Seinfeld,</v>

138
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.650
little feud about New York is dead. You know?

139
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.320
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, you can argue either side of it and be right.</v>

140
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.110
You know what I mean? Like, I don't want it to be dead, but at the same time,

141
00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:20.740
we're not going to pretend it's not in deep trouble. Yeah. So, I mean,

142
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:21.790
I don't want to, I don't know how.

143
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.490
<v 1>It gets out. That's what my worry is. I know.</v>

144
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.570
Unless COVID gets cured and then Ari Shaffir things,

145
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.420
artists are going to start moving in again. But that's, he's one of those guys.

146
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.610
Right? He's got that, you know? Cause he.

147
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.440
<v 4>Needs to be gritty. New York city needs to be right. Yeah.</v>

148
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.310
<v 1>But ever been mugged. That's why I never really had the beat out of them.</v>

149
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.820
Yeah. You do need a couple of those in life.

150
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.600
You just need to know that it's possible to be like, oh,

151
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.540
what does gritty mean to you? Let me tell you it's it, ain't a,

152
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.370
it's not midnight cowboy.

153
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.990
That's a movie real gritty as you get stabbed and then it gets infected

154
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.510
and then you're in the hospital for six months.

155
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.560
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. You need to, at least ever had, had regretted laughing.</v>

156
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.590
Cause you're holding your broken rib at least for six weeks in a row.

157
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.270
You're like, is this ever going to get better?

158
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.420
<v 1>Yeah. It's um, that gritty is like, boy. Yeah. I see what you're saying.</v>

159
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.570
I kind of get, I know. Yeah. Some places that are gritty. They're fun.

160
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.170
<v 2>Yeah. No it's it's fun. And like I said, when I'm watching taxi driver,</v>

161
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:25.510
I'm like, yeah, I miss New York. But I mean, I would walk.

162
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.640
I remember walking through times square.

163
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.320
We don't have to ask what I was doing at 12 o'clock at night by myself,

164
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.810
19 80, 81.

165
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:39.580
And literally they had like thieves dens above the porno theaters.

166
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:44.230
They had thieves dens. So like they go through, they had a little turnstile.

167
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.760
I went in one once with this kid, he was taking me there.

168
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.020
If I forget what we're trying to do something shady I'm sure. And he went,

169
00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:54.460
we went up and it was like 50, like thieves, like, like, like Oliver,

170
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.280
only New York,

171
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.960
like a gang of people with illegal goods trading, illegal goods,

172
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.320
right on 42nd street. Wow. It was crazy.

173
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.600
As you see gangs running down, if anybody was there, just swarm somebody,

174
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.830
take their stuff, leave them on the ground and just keep going. The.

175
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.720
<v 1>Thing about it is though the, the disrespect of the police right now. Right.</v>

176
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.440
It leads it to a very difficult situation of trying to bring it back.

177
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.620
It's like that didn't that wasn't the case in the eighties and nineties people

178
00:09:24.621 --> 00:09:28.280
respected the police. Like when they, when Giuliani brought it back there,

179
00:09:28.281 --> 00:09:33.110
wasn't this overall nationwide resentment of the police force like we're

180
00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:35.180
having now, which is pretty unprecedented.

181
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.570
<v 2>Well, I mean, there sort of was in New York. Actually at that time,</v>

182
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.600
there was a couple of incidents where, you know, but yes, not like this,

183
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:42.890
this is a different level,

184
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.600
a luxury that people are labeled to indulge themselves by,

185
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.620
by putting all, you know, lightening rod sort of, you know what I mean?

186
00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:54.710
Like the police to me, it's like a proxy war, you know what I mean?

187
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.500
Everybody knows cops, everybody knows cops and nuts.

188
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.990
We all had the friend that you grew up with. You like whatever happened to him,

189
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.670
he became a cop. He became a cop.

190
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.550
<v 0>But, but.</v>

191
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.870
<v 2>You know, no one denies that pot. Um, even cops know that about themselves.</v>

192
00:10:08.871 --> 00:10:13.520
But that being said, it's easy for everybody to just go, okay. Like I say,

193
00:10:13.521 --> 00:10:14.354
proxy war.

194
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.190
So all the bottled up racial resentment in the country.

195
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.100
And it's like the people that have to actually go and say, Hey, listen,

196
00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:24.290
here's what has to happen. They're going to be the,

197
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.440
they're going to be the fall guy for that. And that's, you know what I mean?

198
00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:28.610
That's what this is. In my opinion.

199
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.620
<v 5>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

200
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.770
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

201
00:10:36.771 --> 00:10:37.910
they're going to be available everywhere.

202
00:10:37.911 --> 00:10:41.510
But after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

203
00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:45.530
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

204
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.600
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much.

205
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.710
Buh-bye.
