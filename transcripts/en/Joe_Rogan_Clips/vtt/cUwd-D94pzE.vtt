00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.320
<v 2>And what is going on with eating.</v>

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.960
So if you have one meal and say this meal comprises, um,

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.080
you know, 2000 calories or whatever,

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.000
and you have this meal at 6:00 PM and you fast for 24 hours until you eat again

6
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.720
at 6:00 PM. If you have this one meal a day,

7
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.910
why is it better do that then to have say, you know,

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.790
smaller meals of like 500 calories,

9
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.350
multiple times per day, little snacks?

10
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.990
<v 1>Well, because going back 6 million years back, you know, were in the trees.</v>

11
00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:39.990
And then in this Savannah, our bodies were designed well or evolved to,

12
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.300
to adversity. And we've removed that from our lives because it feels good,

13
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.980
but we need adversity to be resilient and to fight disease.

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.500
So what I'm saying is that period of hunger,

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.180
and it's not even hunger these days, I don't even feel it. I feel great if,

16
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.540
if I don't eat and it, it takes a few weeks. So anyone wants to start,

17
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.300
give it some time, give it a couple,

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.050
but what's happening in the body is you're turning on these adversity,

19
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.371
hormesis response genes.

20
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:11.930
We call 'em longevity genes and they make the body fight aging and diseases.

21
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.770
And so by, by eating through the day, the traditional, oh,

22
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:18.570
you gotta have breakfast best meal of the day, blah, blah, blah. Um,

23
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.000
first of all,

24
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.600
it's not true that you need to be full or fed to think clearly,

25
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.440
it's, it's very clear that people who are fasting have as good,

26
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.000
if not better at mental a acuity. Okay. That's one.

27
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.760
So I think that that needs to be throughout the window. Kids are different.

28
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.040
We're not talking about kids talking about adults and we're not talking about

29
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.840
malnutrition starvation too. Let's be clear,

30
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.630
but we are talking about lengthening that window of not eating.

31
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.190
So if you always are, are associated fed, your body says, Hey,

32
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.270
I've just killed an, you know, a mammoth, no problem.

33
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.990
Don't need to worry about survival.

34
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.230
I'm just gonna go forth and multiply and screw my long term survival. Mm.

35
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.750
So this's all about long term survival by making the body freak out that there's

36
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:05.660
tough times and that's running away, like running away from a cat,

37
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.460
like the Savannah and being hungry, or, you know,

38
00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:12.060
there's molecular reasons that all this works, but, you know,

39
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:15.060
trust me that the data is very clear that this is the way to go.

40
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:16.780
If you want to be healthy in your eighties and nineties.

41
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.580
<v 0>Well, it, it actually does make sense when you put it in that way,</v>

42
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.220
that your body, when your fed relaxes.

43
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.690
And so if you're just doing that all day long,

44
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.410
and I know for a fact that when I am, um,

45
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.690
not fed and I go and do things, whether it's perform,

46
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.610
one of the things that I've been doing, um,

47
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.610
is I don't eat before shows.

48
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.770
Like I take many, uh, many hours before a comedy show.

49
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.120
And I used to just like eat whenever I just eat. And,

50
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.960
and then I would do shows and I would have a meal like an hour before the show.

51
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.680
And I like trying to wake up. I'm really trying to come on, come on, come on.

52
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.160
But I've now recognized,

53
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.280
actually I saw a video where cat Williams was talking about this. Do you know,

54
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.000
KA Williams is hilarious, comedian.

55
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.560
<v 1>Uh, I do.</v>

56
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.160
<v 0>Know. Well, you're slipping if you don't. Uh, he's, he's hilarious.</v>

57
00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:09.240
When he was doing this interview and he was saying, they were,

58
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.760
what's your process before a show. And one of the things he says, I don't eat,

59
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.360
I make sure I don't eat. And I was like, that's wise, that's really smart.

60
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.470
And I'm like, I needed to hear that know. I kind of knew it,

61
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.710
but I never written it down. I never like associated it. Absolutely.

62
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.790
But now I have, like, now I do not eat before shows.

63
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.510
I won't do it unless I know I have three hours.

64
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.230
<v 1>So what, what's your average day.</v>

65
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.270
<v 0>Look like? It depends entirely on whether or not I'm doing podcasts.</v>

66
00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:39.900
If I'm doing podcasts generally, I'm up early. I get my, my workouts in,

67
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.500
I, I usually have something to eat after the workout. So I'm talking about like,

68
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:49.420
I eat around 11, 11:00 AM. That's my first meal of the day. And then, uh,

69
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.460
I go and do my stuff.

70
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.300
And I generally feel like my workouts are so strenuous that I need some sort of

71
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.500
nutrition afterwards, some sort of, uh,

72
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.490
fruit to pump the muscles back up and give them some sugar and some

73
00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:03.324
protein.

74
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.250
So usually I'm eating meat and maybe like an apple or something like that.

75
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:11.090
That's like a normal meal for me. And then I don't eat again until nighttime.

76
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.710
Great.

77
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.610
<v 1>And you're not snacking?</v>

78
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.770
<v 0>No. Eh, maybe sometimes after a podcast, I'll have, like, we have these, uh,</v>

79
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.520
on it warrior bars that are just Buffalo meat, some cranberries and stuff.

80
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.200
I like those I'll.

81
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.120
<v 1>Eat one of those. Good. Well, at least you're going till 11. You got that sleep.</v>

82
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.880
Yeah. So you're probably not eating late. Yeah. It's just.

83
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.040
<v 0>The STR strenuous activity. Me.</v>

84
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.400
Like my workouts are very hard. So after them, I feel like I need something.

85
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.480
You know, I just,

86
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.270
I don't like that feeling of like a brutal workout and then being starving for

87
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:47.190
four or five hours, because then it becomes a distraction. So I, I,

88
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.390
I listen to my body, but if I don't work out, I don't eat until dinner.

89
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.230
Like say a day like today I didn't work out today. So I woke up,

90
00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.110
hung out with a dog, had some coffee, sat out, you know, like just got,

91
00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:01.460
went over. Some emails, did some,

92
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.460
just a relaxed morning and then rolled into here. No food. Perfect. I won,

93
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.260
I won't eat until we're going to dinner tonight. I won't eat until then. Yeah.

94
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.980
Relax. That'll be fun. Yes. That's gonna be fun. And John Donna her.

95
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.660
<v 1>Yeah, of course. Looking forward to meeting. Yes. Uh, yeah,</v>

96
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:20.140
so you you're doing the right things. Um, certainly better than most people. Uh,

97
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.450
but what I'm trying to build a make are molecules that mimic fasting as well.

98
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.410
So if you cannot fast, like I do, then you can just take a pill.

99
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.210
And what we've shown in, in my,

100
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:36.090
at least is that if you give them this molecule that I'm taking NN nicotinamide,

101
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.050
mono nucleotide, which as I mentioned, um,

102
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.040
speeds up metabolisms and all that stuff. Those mice could run on 50% further.

103
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.440
These old mice, we gave it to them for three weeks,

104
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.280
put them back on a treadmill.

105
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.480
And those that had the men in their water ran 50% further.

106
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.360
They had better blood flow, better oxygenation, better energy.

107
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.600
And that is literally exercise in a pill. That's crazy.

108
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.240
So we're, we're in late stage human clinical trials. Now.

109
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.320
<v 0>When do you think there's gonna be released to the public?</v>

110
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.040
<v 1>Well, it depends on what the FDA does and if it was, oh,</v>

111
00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:12.000
don't get me in trouble. &lt;laugh&gt; love the FDA. Um,

112
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.400
but it's fair enough. They protect us. But yeah,

113
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.950
we we're going through the procedure, Jo that has been around since,

114
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.430
as I mentioned, early 20th century,

115
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.550
but it we've done hundreds of people now. Um,

116
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.230
certainly dozens over the last few years.

117
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.710
And we know at least that this molecule is apparently safe and raises the levels

118
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.630
of the molecule. We wanna build up the molecules called N a D.

119
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.300
Do you wanna talk a little bit? Yes, please. So a D is what MIT,

120
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:41.420
those mitochondria little, uh, mic and I little, uh, uh,

121
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.340
energy producing things use to make

122
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.420
energy. So you, you need,

123
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:49.140
there are two molecules in the body that are really great.

124
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.740
You need both for life. And without them, as I said, you're dead.

125
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.740
ATP is the energy. And ad makes that, and as we get older,

126
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.530
the levels of a down our body makes less and actually also degrades it more.

127
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:01.770
You have. So I,

128
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.490
if you take my skin or in the study that they took people's skin,

129
00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:09.370
when you're 50, you've got half the levels of this N a D that you did,

130
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.970
then you did when you were 20, which is scary, cuz this is,

131
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.610
this molecule is required for life without it we're dead in 30 seconds.

132
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.840
So what we're doing with our clinical trials is giving a pre so a, a,

133
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.560
a smaller version of this that the body will turn into a D and bring those

134
00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:26.240
levels back up from where they are when you're old to where you are,

135
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:27.680
when you're young. And we,

136
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.480
we see at least in animals and hopefully in people that it revs up their

137
00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:35.120
metabolism and makes them fight aging and disease like we do when we're young.

138
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.430
I mean, there's a reason we don't get a lot of heart disease when we're young or

139
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:42.430
Alzheimer's cause our bodies fight against disease as we get older.

140
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.430
And especially if we sit around or smoke and don't exercise our bodies,

141
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.264
just give up.
