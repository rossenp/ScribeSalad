00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.090
Because if they continue to do things like Chaz,

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.850
the six block place in Seattle, I mean,

4
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:12.870
that seemed like almost a little bit of a test, a little bit of a test run.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.441
I mean,

6
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:17.700
they did a mad max style takeover of six blocks in Seattle and held it for a

7
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:21.720
considerable amount of time with the compliance of the mayor who called it the

8
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.580
summer of love. Okay.

9
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.650
<v 1>I saw, I saw a video, a video of their, uh,</v>

10
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:31.010
of what happened after chairs. And there were like zombie,

11
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:33.260
like people lying around on the grass.

12
00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:36.800
Everything seemed to be covered in urine and there weren't any statutes.

13
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:39.940
Obviously there are a hell of a lot of plinths and everything had graffiti over

14
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.870
and I thought people should realize,

15
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:46.490
this is what you inherit that you'll inherit rubble. So inherit stain rubble.

16
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.790
And I'm not sure how many people have got that lesson yet.

17
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.870
<v 0>Well, they should read your book. The madness of crowds is excellent.</v>

18
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.120
It really is. It's a very good book. And, you know,

19
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.480
you wrote that book before the really hit the fan, but, uh,

20
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:03.390
it was eerily accurate in, in many ways when you were,

21
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:05.930
you were talking about the current problems and where they could lead.

22
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.610
And there's,

23
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.200
there's so much of what you were saying in that book that could be used as like

24
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:14.240
a guide to what's happening today.

25
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.880
<v 1>That's what I hoped. I mean, I did it a year ago. I've updated it now. And,</v>

26
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.350
uh, did you hit it off? Well, basically because now, um,

27
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.830
is that is out of this month, is that basically,

28
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.280
I thought something very interesting happened through the COVID era,

29
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.840
which was that at the beginning of it, I thought we all thought, okay,

30
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:39.230
this is a plague like with Justinian plague, it's going to end the empire.

31
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.010
You know, we're all going to lose Matt and massive numbers of our loved ones.

32
00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:47.210
And if that's the case, at least at these end times,

33
00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:50.720
the social justice warriors will pipe down. Uh, you know,

34
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.330
it was my one constellation was I thought, at least,

35
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.530
at least we won't have to deal with them so much because if everyone's got real

36
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.590
problems, if everyone's got real complaints,

37
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.310
kind of microaggressions start to seem less important than they have done in

38
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:05.180
recent years.

39
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.810
So that was my assumption at the beginning was if the plague was what it seemed

40
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:11.000
at first, then we'd hear less from these people.

41
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.540
And then my impression was that as, as, as COVID went on,

42
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.070
something very interesting happened,

43
00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:20.480
which was that our tolerance for the social justice activists

44
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.950
diminished. I mean, there were little,

45
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.020
little things like a little bits of light, like Sam Smith, you know, uh,

46
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.530
from his mansion posts, a photo of him, uh,

47
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.010
sort of crying a bit and sort of sad because he's lonely.

48
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.080
And normally that would be old Sam Smith. They,

49
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:41.810
they is feeling bad and, and, and so on. And there was just total,

50
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.250
uh, um, we don't care. We don't care who, you know, Smith,

51
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.160
Samsung Smith is a brilliant, I'm so pleased. You don't know of him. Um, uh,

52
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.390
fills me with joy. He's got a horrible, horrible whining voice. He sang,

53
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.711
uh, the,

54
00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:02.710
one of the worst bond sort of theme songs against some really stiff competition,

55
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.730
as you know. And, um, it was one that nobody had, anyhow,

56
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.300
Sam Smith was the guy who came out as gay then as gender,

57
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.090
and then as nonbinary or look at me.

58
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.640
<v 2>Or look at me, at least.</v>

59
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.310
<v 1>Casey is coming out. He's coming out as a look at me.</v>

60
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.840
<v 2>That's what it should be called. It should be called, coming out is look at me.</v>

61
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.740
Yeah. What the is non binary.

62
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.360
<v 1>So, so then he,</v>

63
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.440
so he came out as look at me and then a bit later he wanted more attention and

64
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.260
he posted a photo of himself in his mansion saying how difficult he was finding

65
00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:39.240
COVID and just, there was a complete lack of empathy. Oh my God.

66
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.360
And I sort of thought things like that were a good sign, you know,

67
00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:45.060
because we got that, that's it, you know, if at best,

68
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.910
we're all going to see a massive decline in our living standards.

69
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.590
And our whole society has got mass unemployment and so on. Then I thought, well,

70
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:54.300
at least we'll hear a bit less than those guys.

71
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.790
And then several things happened. Um,

72
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.050
the first was that some people started doing things along the following lines,

73
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.400
as you know, a madness of crowds.

74
00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:07.110
I do each of these internally gay women that is relations between the sexes

75
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.370
race and trans.

76
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.150
And I noticed that the women thing came in first that people started saying

77
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:16.080
things like women are suffering most from COVID.

78
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.350
And I thought, well, okay, we've got to look at the stats on this.

79
00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:22.230
And then the stats came in and it showed that men were disproportionately likely

80
00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:24.990
to die. And then the same people said, well,

81
00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:26.640
the men like to do during the dying,

82
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.950
but the women are doing the suffering or something.

83
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.410
And that didn't make very much sense,

84
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:35.370
but it showed that there was some people who needed to look at this through the

85
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.020
prism. They've looked through everything, which is women, men,

86
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.590
uh, disproportionate, uh, relations between the sexes.

87
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.270
And then you got some people doing that with gay. Um,

88
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.900
the BBC in my own country in Britain started running pieces about, you know,

89
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.840
it's difficult for a lot of LGBT people because they're,

90
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.310
they're living with their families who might be homophobic. And, um,

91
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.220
again, you know, you sort of read these stories, you thought, well, yeah,

92
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.250
a lot of people are living with their families who are the well, their families.

93
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.101
I mean,

94
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:09.930
they're having to live with their mum and dad and they might be heterosexual and

95
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.230
they'd just be forced into chastity by government regulations. You know, they,

96
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.910
you know what I mean? It's difficult for everyone.

97
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.410
Why do we need to single that out?

98
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.800
Then there was a story about somebody who I kid you, not, by the way, Joe,

99
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:20.634
you'll love this one.

100
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.140
The BBC had a story which was of a trans person who said,

101
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.260
write a headline was I'm I'm,

102
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.120
I'm fearful that I'm going to be buried in the wrong gender.

103
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.650
Oh boy. And of course I just thought, well,

104
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:43.590
a lot of us are just fearful of being buried, you know, period,

105
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.350
call me a woman when I'm dead. I don't know you can, mis-gender me,

106
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.840
all you like, I just, I don't want to be buried. That's.

107
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.330
<v 2>Not so grazing, not.</v>

108
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.560
<v 1>This year, not this year, the citizens.</v>

109
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.260
So that sort of thing started happening. And I thought, oh,

110
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:04.910
this is just they're just, but again, I still thought they'll double down,

111
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.120
but the majority won't listen to them.

112
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.800
And then Minnesota happened and the race one came back with a

113
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:16.790
vengeance and that had been happening through COVID obviously,

114
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:21.620
because in all of our countries, we had this thing of, uh, uh,

115
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.940
ethnic minorities,

116
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.330
sticky black people suffering disproportionately from the virus.

117
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.230
And what I was worried about was that in the American media and the British

118
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.550
media and elsewhere, this was being portrayed as if, as if,

119
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.400
if this was the case. And it does seem to be,

120
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.770
then it was because like America couldn't even import a virus from

121
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:47.300
China without giving it its own special racist, spin. You know,

122
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.370
that all of the things that you could look at to explain why there might be a

123
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.980
higher mortality rate, including, uh,

124
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.180
higher numbers of perhaps nurses in the health service, um,

125
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.550
underlying health issues and,

126
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:04.580
and much more that that wasn't being focused on.

127
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.690
It kept on being portrayed as if this could only be because of racism.

128
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.090
And, and that just worried me because I thought even a virus,

129
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.340
a pandemic can't bring us together and we still have these people doing this.

130
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:22.790
But as I say, it wasn't until after Minnesota, that then that really took off.

131
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:25.340
And we discovered something very important, which is that,

132
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.950
but the racism and the whole issue of race is even more important than

133
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:35.210
trying to avoid the pandemic. And, and that,

134
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.410
and everything has flowed from it is just rolling on and on. And it's very,

135
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:41.810
very worrying. It's everything I feared would happen,

136
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.910
which was everybody doubling down on these identity traits

137
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.800
in the era. When we all hoped we could move beyond them. You know.

138
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.830
<v 0>We also got to this weird point where we're supposed to collectively</v>

139
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.780
ignore the fact that having 50,000 people marching through the streets,

140
00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:04.450
arm and arm could easily be spreading the disease.

141
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.750
And there was this giant uptick of the disease in America,

142
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:12.280
and everyone stuck their head in the sand and pretended they were not

143
00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:14.770
connected that everyone wanted to pretend well,

144
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.780
it had nothing to do with the protests. Well, if you.

145
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.340
<v 1>Yeah, it's cool. More, it wasn't, it wasn't just head in the sand.</v>

146
00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:24.640
It was actually saying that we don't mind. I mean,

147
00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:27.760
the medical medical professionals in America who signed a joint letter,

148
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.560
defending people going out on the protests were saying that the

149
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.410
racism kills and so does COVID,

150
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.640
but racism is a clearly a bigger underlying risk than COVID.

151
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.180
And if you've taken that view,

152
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.090
then everything's possible. Isn't it? I mean, I mean, I mean,

153
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:49.990
apart from the fact, there's not,

154
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.820
it's clearly not true because however you would, you know, work,

155
00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.120
the numbers of people killed by racism, uh, which does exist.

156
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:00.954
But I mean the,

157
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.000
to claim that the mortality rates from racism are a higher than those from COVID

158
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:08.010
when, what are the figures in America now? You know,

159
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:12.690
six figures of people who've done under 90,000, you know,

160
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.670
I guess it's surely the people who claim that racism kills more people than

161
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:20.820
COVID should have to answer and say,

162
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.470
where are the 190,000 racist murders in America this year?

163
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.270
You know? And that doesn't happen. And that's medical professionals saying that.

164
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.490
<v 0>Well, you've got everyone terrified of being labeled as a racist.</v>

165
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.480
That that's where we've gotten to this point, how we've gotten to this point.

166
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.770
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Well, we live in an era where all of the,</v>

167
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.080
all of the worst things you can be accused of are also not provable and not

168
00:09:48.081 --> 00:09:51.590
disprovable. And that's something I say in the madness of crowds,

169
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.720
which is just very difficult for us. You know,

170
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.210
it happens every day to someone is, you know, I mean,

171
00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:59.600
someone gets called the whole charge sheet, but homophobic, transphobic,

172
00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:03.140
misogynist, racist. And first of all,

173
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.560
obviously people can level that without any evidence.

174
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.540
And often knowing that it's not true,

175
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.470
but the problem is the person who is said to has no defense. Cause you, you,

176
00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:15.530
you cannot eat actually prove you're not a racist.

177
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.720
You can't prove you're not a misogynist.

178
00:10:17.721 --> 00:10:20.630
You can't prove you're not a homophobic happens all the time. People say,

179
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.880
you know, I'm not a homophobia. Uh, um,

180
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.340
it happened with the former Australian prime minister the other day.

181
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.760
I'm not a homophobe and my sister-in-law's a lesbian and she married a partner

182
00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.670
and I was at the wedding, but they still say, he's a homophobia.

183
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.690
You can't prove that the claim isn't true.

184
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.420
And the worst of that is obviously with racism.

185
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:43.130
And so obviously everybody in the era is trying desperately to avoid the

186
00:10:43.131 --> 00:10:47.630
claim because once the claim is made, we, as society has no way to brush it off.

187
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.480
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

188
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.630
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

189
00:10:56.631 --> 00:10:59.030
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

190
00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:02.750
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

191
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.740
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

192
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.570
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
