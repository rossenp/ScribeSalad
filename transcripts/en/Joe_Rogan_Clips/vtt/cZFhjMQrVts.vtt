00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.760
What you said when you sat down was absolutely perfect that the timing could not

3
00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:08.840
have been better. Well, tell everybody what you do, Michael.

4
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.760
<v 1>Well, thank you. I'm a, for a lack of a better term, a medical detective,</v>

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.360
I've spent my whole career tracking, infectious diseases down, trying to stop.

6
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.000
'em trying to understand where they come from so we can make sure they don't

7
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.470
happen and the first place, but most of all,

8
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.870
trying to respond to situations just like this.

9
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.830
<v 0>Just like this. And, um, just off the bat, how serious is this?</v>

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.790
Is this something that we need to be terrified of? Or is this overblown or how,

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.430
how do you stand on this? Well, first.

12
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.930
<v 1>Of all,</v>

13
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.230
you have to understand the timing of it in the sense that it's just beginning.

14
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.380
And so in terms of what hurt pain suffering death is a happened

15
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.180
so far is really just beginning. Um,

16
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.980
this is gonna unfold for months to come yet. And that's,

17
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:55.460
I think what people don't quite yet understand, um, what we saw in China, uh,

18
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.580
I'm convinced as our many of my colleagues is soon as they release all of these,

19
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.610
uh, social distancs is mandate to stay in homes.

20
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:04.730
Haven't left your home in weeks and weeks kind of thing.

21
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.250
When they go back to work, they're on planes, trains, subways buses,

22
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.690
crowded spaces, manufacturing, plants, even China is gonna come back again.

23
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.890
And so this really is acting like an influenza virus,

24
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:18.370
something that transmits very, very easily through the air.

25
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.930
We now have data to show that you're infectious before you even get sick.

26
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.600
And in some cases, quite highly infectious,

27
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:28.240
just breathing is all that you need to do. So from this perspective,

28
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.240
I can understand why people would say, well, wait a minute,

29
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.800
flu kills a lot more itself every year than this does.

30
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.560
And I re remind people this just the beginning,

31
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.160
probably the best guessment we have right now on what limited data we have would

32
00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:39.800
say,

33
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.550
this is gonna be at least 10 to 15 times worse than the worst seasonal flu year.

34
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:44.384
We see.

35
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.310
<v 0>10 To 15 times worse in terms of fatalities. Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.790
<v 1>Yeah. And, and just illness. In fact, I just, I brought some numbers. We, uh,</v>

37
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.870
conservably estimate that this could in, uh,

38
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:57.870
require 48 million hospitalizations, 96 million, uh,

39
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:02.110
cases actually occurring over 480,000 deaths

40
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.180
that can occur over the next three to seven months with this situation.

41
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.900
So this is not one that to take lightly.

42
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.740
And I think that's what I can understand.

43
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.580
If you say there's only been 10 deaths or 20 deaths or 50 deaths,

44
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.340
just remember two weeks ago,

45
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.660
we were talking about almost no cases in the United States,

46
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.300
and now that we're testing for it and watching the spread as it's unfolding, uh,

47
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:24.930
those numbers going up astronom three weeks ago,

48
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.370
Italy was just living life just fine.

49
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.890
Now they're literally at a virtual shutdown in the Northern parts of Italy,

50
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.490
and that's the challenge with an infectious disease like this.

51
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:36.770
It can spread very quickly and it also can affect people.

52
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.730
I think maybe to put this into modern terms,

53
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:42.650
cause this is something we think of often when we think of, of, you know,

54
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.280
pre antibiotic days, you know, the old time medicine, um,

55
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.520
we have an employee at our center for infectiies research and policy at the

56
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:53.040
university of Minnesota. And she has a dear friend who lives in Milan, Italy,

57
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.200
and she works at a hospital there.

58
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:59.000
And she texts us to this employee of ours last night.

59
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.480
And this was an email that came out yesterday from one of their physicians in

60
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.520
Milan, at the largest hospital there. And he said,

61
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.400
I just got a very disturbing message from a cardiologist at one of the Milan's

62
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:12.640
largest hospitals. They're deciding who they have to let die.

63
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.280
They aren't screening the staff anymore because they need all hands on deck.

64
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.400
And they have a very small areas of the hospital, dead,

65
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:21.870
a dedicated to non COVID patients where they still screen doctors.

66
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.670
Everybody else is dedicated to COVID patients. So even if they're positive,

67
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:29.190
meaning that they're sick, they don't. And,

68
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:33.070
but they don't have a severe cough or fever, then they have to work. Uh,

69
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:37.990
he says that that they're seen an alarming number of cases in the 40

70
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:42.020
something, an D Dr. And as these are horrible cases.

71
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.460
So we need to stop thinking that this is an only an old person's disease.

72
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.340
This is what's, I'm gonna unfold, not just in muuhan,

73
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.140
it's unfolding in the line. It's unfolding here in, in Seattle.

74
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.060
And this is what's gonna continue to rollingly unfold throughout the world.

75
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.530
<v 0>Yeah. Where did this rumor come from? The, that it's a, an old person's disease,</v>

76
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.890
is it just because the majority of the people that have died from it so far have

77
00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:05.010
been.

78
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.450
<v 1>Older? Yes. In fact,</v>

79
00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:10.090
that's the primary risk factor for dying as being old and then having certain

80
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:13.330
underlying health problems. For example, in China, uh,

81
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.650
those men over the age of 70,

82
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.250
who also smoked were eight to 10% of them died.

83
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.600
65% of older Chinese men smoke the, uh,

84
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.960
case fatality rate.

85
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.040
The percentage of people who die in women in that same age group was only about

86
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:33.160
2% in that case. Very few women smoke. Now,

87
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.760
the challenge we have is that that's the Chinese data,

88
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.800
but there are a series of risk factors that we worry about that if they overlay

89
00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:42.030
on this are gonna cause bad outcomes.

90
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.110
And we happen to be right at ground zero for one of the major ones here in this

91
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:48.110
country. And that's obesity, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,

92
00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:52.310
we know that obesity is just like smoking in terms of its ability to really

93
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:57.190
cause severe life threatening disease and 45% of our population today over the

94
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:01.340
age of 45 in this country are obese or severely obese and there's men and women.

95
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.140
So one of the concerns we have is we're gonna see more of these, uh,

96
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.220
what I guess I would call very serious and life threatening cases occur in our

97
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:14.340
country because of a different set of risk factors than we saw in China.

98
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.600
<v 0>Now, you,</v>

99
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.020
you mentioned that there's some sort of incubation period before people become

100
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.410
sick. There's still contagious. What is this incubation period?

101
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.530
And how do we know about it?

102
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.130
<v 1>When we call something an incubation period we're talking about from the time</v>

103
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.610
you and I got exposed,

104
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:34.210
meaning I was in a room breathing the air that somebody else who was infected,

105
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.210
uh, with the virus was expelling out.

106
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.850
I breathed it in how long from that time period,

107
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.010
til the time period that you get sick. And what is that?

108
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.880
That's what we call incubation period.

109
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.800
So that's when case numbers can double or triple in every so many days in this

110
00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:50.720
case, it's about four days. So,

111
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.400
and we actually have data there from people who are exposed one time or one time

112
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:56.080
only. And we know when they were exposed,

113
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:58.640
where they were exposed and how soon do they get sick afterwards?

114
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.880
So the chaufffer in the car where an individual was sick or showing symptoms.

115
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.800
Then the chauffer gets it four days later. You know,

116
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.200
they were there one time and one time only.

117
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.080
<v 0>And if the chaufffer does not show any symptoms, he still contagious. He can.</v>

118
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.040
<v 1>Still, still, he, he could also be contagious too, or he,</v>

119
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.670
and that's one of the things that's challenging here is I might get exposed to

120
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.710
somebody who is totally asymptomatic, no symptoms that virus would appear. Well,

121
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:24.710
that's not a very strong virus, but in fact, when it infects us,

122
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.630
it could kill us. So we've seen cases of,

123
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.630
of fatal disease that were exposed to people that had minor symptoms themselves.

124
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.070
Wow. And this is what's unfolding here. And,

125
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.380
and this is where I think is such an important, I said,

126
00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:39.500
why the timing is so important, cuz you know, Joel,

127
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:41.220
we really gotta get information out to the public.

128
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.980
There is so much misinfo information right now and you know,

129
00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:48.020
we're gonna be in this for a while. This is not gonna happen overnight.

130
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:50.220
And I worry, I keep telling people, we're handling this.

131
00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:53.260
Like it's a Corona blizzard, you know, two or three days mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

132
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:55.660
we're back to normal. This is a coronavirus winter,

133
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.650
and we're gonna have the next three months or more six months or more that are

134
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:04.250
gonna be like this. And you know, so far this thing has been unfolding exactly.

135
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.810
As we predicted it, we in our center put out a piece, uh,

136
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.090
on January 20th and said,

137
00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:12.570
this is gonna spread worldwide at the time people said, ah, no, it's just China.

138
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.690
We put out a piece the first week of February and said,

139
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:17.210
this is gonna pop probably the last week of February.

140
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:20.560
First week of March is what happens is it has what's called an R not or a

141
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.400
doubling time of, of, of these every four days.

142
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.240
So two increases doubling every four days.

143
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.600
So if you go from two to four to eight to 16, it takes a while to build up.

144
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.320
But when you start going from 500 to a thousand to 2000 to 4,000,

145
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.240
that's what we're seeing happen in places like Italy.

146
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.030
We're beginning to see it in some ways up Seattle. It's what happened in China.

147
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.310
And uh, you know, when people are confronted with that,

148
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.270
suddenly this low risk phenomena that everybody talks about,

149
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.030
isn't so low anymore. And that's what you need to prepare people.

150
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.070
<v 0>For now, what can be done? Like what,</v>

151
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.470
what can the average person do I see people walking around with masks on wearing

152
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.990
gloves? Is that nonsense largely.

153
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.260
<v 1>Yes. Yeah. First of all, um, let's step back.</v>

154
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.500
The primary mechanism for transmission is just the respiratory route.

155
00:08:04.501 --> 00:08:07.300
It's just breathing, um, in studies in Germany,

156
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.340
which just have been published literally in the last 24 hours. Um,

157
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.940
they actually followed a group of people who had been exposed to somebody in an

158
00:08:14.941 --> 00:08:16.340
automobile manufacturing plant.

159
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.890
And then they had nine people that with this exposure, he said,

160
00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:21.690
if you have any symptoms at all, contact us,

161
00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:24.450
we wanna follow up with and they all agreed. Well, they got infected.

162
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.210
And so in the very first hours just feeling bad, sore throat,

163
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.090
they went in and sampled their throats, their, their saliva,

164
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:35.570
their nose for virus, they did blood, they did stool, they did urine.

165
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.650
And they found that at that very moment, when they first got sick,

166
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:43.080
they hadn't incredibly high levels of virus. Sometimes 10,000 times out,

167
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:45.240
we saw with SARS in their throats,

168
00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:47.320
meaning they were infectious at that point already.

169
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.240
And they hadn't even had symptoms yet of really any nature they weren't coughing

170
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:51.440
yet. Wow. And,

171
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.080
and that's where we're concerned because that's the kind of transmission it's,

172
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.440
you know, I always have said trying to stop influenza virus, transmission,

173
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:00.160
like trying to stop the wind. You know,

174
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.600
we we've never had anything successfully do that other than vaccine.

175
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.160
And we don't have a vaccine here.

176
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.920
So what's happening is that people in public spaces are getting infected and the

177
00:09:09.921 --> 00:09:14.870
way you need to address that is unfortunately if you're older, over 55,

178
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:17.390
you have some underlying health problems, which unfortunately,

179
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.470
a lot of Americans do. We have, uh,

180
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:22.990
obesity then right now you don't want to be in large public spaces.

181
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.670
You trying to potentially get infected.

182
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.150
So you can take care of that part as far as what can public health do.

183
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.710
We're not gonna, we can talk about this.

184
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.950
We're not gonna have a vaccine anytime soon. That's happy talk. Um, well we,

185
00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:37.260
you know, we can close school. One of the big challenges we have right now,

186
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:41.700
if we close schools, what do we accomplish in influenza virus when you,

187
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.420
we close schools during outbreaks,

188
00:09:43.421 --> 00:09:46.300
because it turns out kids are get infected in school.

189
00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:48.260
And they're like little virus reactors, you know,

190
00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:51.140
they come home and they transmit it to mom and dad and brothers and sisters.

191
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.300
And uh, so we close school.

192
00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:57.090
Sometimes Christmas breaks are always rate for kind of putting the dampening

193
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.570
effect on flu. In this case,

194
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.410
kids are not getting sick very often at all,

195
00:10:02.411 --> 00:10:05.610
which is one of the really good news features of this disease in two China,

196
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.250
only 2.1% of the cases are under eight, 19 years of age. And why is that?

197
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.530
You know, we don't completely know. Uh, and,

198
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.410
and I'm gonna come to that in a second because they're getting infected.

199
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.920
It turns one study showed that they still get infected with the virus,

200
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.480
but they don't get sick. And we have that happen.

201
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:24.320
There's a disease called infectious hepatitis, hepatitis a,

202
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.760
where we have outbreaks in daycares.

203
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.080
And the way we know we have an outbreak is cause it's transmitted through the

204
00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:30.330
stool.

205
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.520
Fecal oral is mom and dad and the daycare providers all get sick and the kids

206
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.030
dose symptoms, we go in and test kids positive.

207
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.030
So some diseases will manifest my primary when you're an adult,

208
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:43.510
but not as a child. This one appears to be the same.

209
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.670
So do we close schools or not? If we're not really spreading the disease,

210
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:49.710
because it turns out that if we close schools,

211
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.870
we in a recent study done showed that 38% of nurses today in this country who

212
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:56.950
are working in the medical care, have kids in school.

213
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.180
And if suddenly we're closing schools for two or three months,

214
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:01.140
who's gonna take care of those kids.

215
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.020
One fourth of the American population has no sick leave. If we close schools,

216
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.700
they don't get paid if they have to stay home. So when you ask, what can we do?

217
00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:11.740
We have to really be thoughtful about what we do.

218
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.660
Are we doing more harmed and good by closing schools? For example,

219
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.940
even though everybody will say, oh, we gotta do everything we can.

220
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.170
Or do we just tell people, you know,

221
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:21.810
it's gonna be limiting your contact as much as you can.

222
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.930
And that's really about what we can do.

223
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.410
<v 0>And limiting the contact. Is that really gonna help?</v>

224
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.810
<v 1>It does because it's like putting rods in a reaction. If you,</v>

225
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:33.810
if you don't have as much close contact, you can, you know,

226
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:38.010
not transmit as much if I'm, if I'm sitting in a room with a hundred people,

227
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.680
people, and we're kind of sharing air,

228
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.440
the transmission's remarkable right here off the coast of California.

229
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:44.440
You've got your cruise ship.

230
00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:48.840
Cruise ships are notorious for recirculating air inside the inner cabins.

231
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.440
We've had a number of outbreaks. That's why they're.

232
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.440
<v 0>Having these outbreaks.</v>

233
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.000
<v 1>On cruise ships. Yeah. And then you leave 'em on.</v>

234
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.120
<v 0>There. I think the, the cruelest human experiment we've done in a long time.</v>

235
00:11:57.121 --> 00:11:59.840
Yeah. With humans is leave 'em on these ships, get 'em off right away.

236
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.800
Should they get 'em off right away? Oh, absolutely. And what get,

237
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.680
'em what they do with them. Well,

238
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:05.800
they can put 'em in quarantines of some kind if they want and follow up on 'em,

239
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:08.480
but you're guaranteed. They're all gonna keep getting infected day after day.

240
00:12:08.481 --> 00:12:11.600
It seems like we're not really prepared for something like this. Although the,

241
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.990
the CDC's been in telling us for a long time that.

242
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.470
<v 1>We should be, you know, we are, uh, not prepared at all in the sense, you know,</v>

243
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:23.470
I, uh, wrote the book, um, deadliest enemies that was published in 2017.

244
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.790
Thank you and gentlemen, &lt;laugh&gt; thank you. Go get it. Need it. And panic.

245
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.430
In a chapter 13,

246
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.620
the title of the chapter was SARS and MES a Harer of the things to come.

247
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.820
You know, we've predicted this. And then I wrote a chapter on there.

248
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:40.580
What a flu pandemic would look like if it emerged in China. And if you read it,

249
00:12:40.581 --> 00:12:42.860
it's exactly what's happened. The supply chains went down,

250
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.380
China locked down the country, it spread to other countries,

251
00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:48.780
people all pointed fingers. And you know, it's,

252
00:12:48.781 --> 00:12:51.860
it's the kind of thing where we hear it and hear it, but don't get prepared.

253
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.770
You know, five years ago I gave a talk at the Mayo clinic. Uh,

254
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.410
first time I talked about this,

255
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.850
I talked many times afterwards and I showed a slide of Puerto Rico picture of

256
00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:01.291
Puerto Rico.

257
00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:04.170
And then I showed the map and then I showed a picture of a building in Puerto

258
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.570
Rico, non-descript building. And I said, this is our next big disaster.

259
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.810
Turns out that 85% of all the world's production of IV bags was

260
00:13:12.811 --> 00:13:16.080
sailing that we need desperately were made in these plants in Puerto Rico.

261
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.200
And all we needed was one, one category,

262
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.040
five hurricane to come through and take it out.

263
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:24.400
Maria came through a year and a half ago and the world went into a major crisis

264
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.480
with shortage of Ivy bags. Now that was so obvious that was gonna happen.

265
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.840
And yet we don't prepare. That's so foolish. I know, I agree. And that's what,

266
00:13:32.841 --> 00:13:35.070
hopefully this is a wake up call the business as community.

267
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.950
I hopefully will wake up. You know,

268
00:13:36.951 --> 00:13:38.870
one of the other things we're doing right now, uh, Joe,

269
00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:42.630
this is really one of the things that has me most concerned about this whole

270
00:13:42.631 --> 00:13:47.350
situation is our group has been studying for the last year and a half, uh,

271
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:50.070
with support from the Walton family foundation. Um,

272
00:13:50.071 --> 00:13:51.590
looking at critical drug shortages.

273
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.660
It turns out that we identified 153 drugs in this country that people need

274
00:13:56.661 --> 00:13:58.940
right now or they die. I mean, it's on the crash card.

275
00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.220
It's acute critical drugs, a hundred percent more generic.

276
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.020
All of them basically are made offoffshore of the United States and large part

277
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.460
'em were made in China and India. And at this point we have shortages anyway,

278
00:14:11.461 --> 00:14:14.140
every day, just before this crisis happened.

279
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.010
Now these supply chains have gone on down.

280
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.010
Our group is actively helping the United States government try to figure out,

281
00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.450
you know, where they're gonna get these drugs. Now, just think of this.

282
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.210
If I came to you and said,

283
00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:27.890
the defense department was gonna outsource all its munitions production to

284
00:14:27.891 --> 00:14:30.650
China, you'd look at me and say, come on. You know what?

285
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.130
The us defense department has no more access to these drugs than anybody else

286
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.680
they are beholden to for these drugs.

287
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.000
690,000 Americans have in-stage renal disease right now,

288
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.560
most of their primary drugs are coming from China.

289
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.560
And now with the shutdown and what's happening with this,

290
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:48.960
and this is what I talked about in the book,

291
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.800
why I was so concerned because we are at risk. So even this situation is unfold.

292
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.080
It's not just about what the virus does to you.

293
00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:01.240
It's about what the entire system is rigged up to be and what this virus

294
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.280
does. Once it gets into it, Jesus, you're making me nervous.

295
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.640
Well, but that's, before we get done here,

296
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:10.400
we're gonna talk about what we can do to get people not nervous because this is

297
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:13.670
why it's too late. &lt;laugh&gt; no, no, no. What I mean is we're gonna,

298
00:15:13.671 --> 00:15:15.750
we're gonna bring you around to take, you know, it's,

299
00:15:15.751 --> 00:15:18.510
my job is not to scare outta your wits. It's scare you into your wits.
