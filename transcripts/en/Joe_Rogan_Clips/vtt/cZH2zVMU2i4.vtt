1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And I'm not immune to getting canceled.</v>

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:10.710
I'm sure I've said before that. Just waiting to resurface on that roast.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.160
Oh my God. I was scared to do the rose.

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.670
I was like this stuff isn't gonna age. Well,

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.150
you know, it's scary. You went hard in the paint. Oh dude.

6
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:28.350
I w I was supposed to go so much harder to, yeah. I had to cut a lot of jokes.

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.590
You have to cut a lot of jokes because Caitlyn Jenner didn't want us talking

8
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:35.160
about her car crash. So Jesus Christ,

9
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.710
that was like the bulk of my material. Don't be here.

10
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.640
I know she didn't even know that it was possible that we were going to do that.

11
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.860
Oh my gosh. I was like,

12
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.930
I know comedy central told me they're like, listen,

13
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:51.870
we don't think Caitlin knows that those jokes are coming. And I was like,

14
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.670
will you tell her, or will someone give her a heads up? Like, and they're like,

15
00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:59.970
we don't want to alert her. Cause she might not want to do it now.

16
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.980
So who decided to not do the jokes?

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.880
I was doing the jokes around town to get ready for it.

18
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.500
Like I was going like Caitlyn Jenner, uh, such a beautiful woman.

19
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:13.860
You killed with your car four years ago. You know, stuff like that. Right. Um,

20
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.400
I love doing, keeping up with the car crashing. It's just like different things.

21
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.670
Um, uh, I love that you, um,

22
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.860
I love that you're a woman that can't mend straight yet.

23
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.810
You still managed to have blood on your hands,

24
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.250
like great jokes and you can't mend straight

25
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.140
menstruate menstruate yet. You still manage it. Yeah. You can't get your period,

26
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:36.600
but you still managed to have blood on your hands. And um,

27
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.960
and I was sticking to it and they were like my favorite jokes of my set.

28
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:42.120
They like did the, like worked the best.

29
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:45.060
I was working in the setup for like a month before. And, um,

30
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.140
who told you to not do them? Well, comedy central strongly advised me not to.

31
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.600
They never said you can't. They've never said that to me,

32
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:56.190
which is not true because Caitlyn Jenner heard the

33
00:01:56.191 --> 00:02:00.060
morning of they had a call with her the morning of the roast that she had heard.

34
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.710
Apparently someone's doing jokes about me and my car crash.

35
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.760
And if they do, if I hear the, a single,

36
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.590
that was a very devastating thing that happened to that family and a woman lost

37
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:17.850
her life. And if there's a joke about it, I will walk.

38
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.590
And that's what I told gummy central. That would've been awesome.

39
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.740
Before I heard this, I was like, if she gets upset, cause they were like,

40
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:30.300
if she gets upset, there might be a moment where, you know, she,

41
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.460
the cameras go to the promise.

42
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.580
I was going first and I was doing all the jokes about the car crash. Now,

43
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.260
if I would have upset her first off,

44
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.350
then the whole show is thrown off and it's weird in the room. I said,

45
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.680
bad press is good. Press is going to get written up so much more.

46
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.190
You guys come on, you should have said, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

47
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.190
And just went up and did it. I was going to Josh. I was going to go,

48
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:51.660
just don't put the jokes in the prompter.

49
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.260
Cause then they haven't signed off on it. I'm going rogue, you know?

50
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.500
So go Rogan. So I, um,

51
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.680
so I went up or so that morning I woke up and I was still kind of like,

52
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.690
maybe I'll do a softer version of those jokes. I was gonna, I was gonna mess,

53
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.210
tweak them a little bit. I was going to say Caitlyn Jenner,

54
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:12.430
what a beautiful woman you accidentally killed with your,

55
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:16.390
I was going to add the word accidentally just to like soften it and make it more

56
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:20.410
factual. Yeah. Um, and then see how many center called?

57
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:22.990
And they said that she had said, she'll walk.

58
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.700
And that's when I decided I'm not going to do it.

59
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:27.160
I don't want this woman to walk off stage. I don't want it.

60
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.930
I don't want to really, as.

61
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.710
<v 1>I just think it's so strange that we're calling her a woman. I love it.</v>

62
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.300
I love the chaos of it. Like I love this love this woman. Like, oh yeah.

63
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.313
It's not.

64
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.660
<v 0>I'm so proud of myself when I don't even have to think about it anymore.</v>

65
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.840
Because for awhile it was like, make sure you say woman, make sure you say.

66
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.370
<v 1>The worst example of it because she's such a dummy. Like when, when she talks,</v>

67
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:50.860
it's just like, it's so it's like disappointing.

68
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.380
I go wish you had more insight on it. Like there's,

69
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.770
there's women that transition brilliant.

70
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.050
<v 0>Just like dumb men begin transition to women.</v>

71
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:05.290
And then they're suddenly like these amazing women,

72
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.820
but they were like a dumb guy.

73
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.750
<v 1>Yeah. He was a dumb guy. He was a, he was a male Kardashians.</v>

74
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.740
And then all of a sudden he's like celebrated Marnell grantors, Walmart,

75
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:19.240
vault prime, or wonder woman over the year. You know what,

76
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.200
but the best purpose that he serves, she serves for Kyle Dunnigan,

77
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.810
his Instagram feed. Oh my God. Kyle does it.

78
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.860
That's another thing that comedy central cut-out comedy central was doing a Kyle

79
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:34.390
Dunnigan show where it was all like face swap. And uh, he had a bit where, um,

80
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.080
where Caitlin was Donald Trump and she was on top of Donald Trump.

81
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.960
It was God damned hilarious. He was showing it to me.

82
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.680
I was in the green room of the comedy store crying. I mean crying Latin.

83
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.610
And he's like comedy central cut that I'm like, no, no, these are,

84
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.370
they can't do it. What, what, what are you talking about?

85
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.820
You got a face swap show. No one was naked. It was,

86
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:57.730
she was just on top of Donald Rogers, our war, you know?

87
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.040
<v 0>So it would have been so good. He's genius. He's genius. The, the funniest part,</v>

88
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.450
one of the funniest people don't all ever know.

89
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.200
<v 1>For sure. The funniest ever Instagram feeds. Sure.</v>

90
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.760
His Instagram street feed is a monster. I go to it every couple of days.

91
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.620
Cause it takes a while for him to create those.

92
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.970
<v 0>Oh,</v>

93
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.080
I get so excited when he puts a new one on him and Tim Dillon on there make me

94
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:21.880
laugh a lot. Yes.

95
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.030
<v 1>Some people are so.</v>

96
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.320
<v 0>Funny.</v>

97
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.140
<v 1>And Tim, because Tim is gay because he's like this. He's like,</v>

98
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:31.630
he looks like you'd be a frat boy. But then you find out that he's gay.

99
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.250
It's like, whoa, you can get away with a lot more.

100
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.120
<v 0>Yeah. He really can. He is great. And he's sober.</v>

101
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.020
<v 1>Which is crazy.</v>

102
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.350
Cause he's like this guy's gotta be on hard drugs when he's doing that.

103
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:46.330
Meghan McCain, depression. Like what kind of drugs? This guy on she's on air

104
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.510
breathing. Air drinking water. And he's keto now. Oh yeah. You need.

105
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.500
<v 0>To eat. Oh my.</v>

106
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.130
<v 1>God. He's well, he got freaked out by a couple of people's health.</v>

107
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.580
What? He's got a new one. Oh, what is he doing here? Oh my God. This.

108
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.573
<v 0>Is.</v>

109
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.700
<v 1>Sniffles. I want to thank beach body for making me their spokesperson.</v>

110
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.970
I've been using their products since the beginning. I'm a triathlete.

111
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.100
He's lost a lot of weight though. Yeah. Getting slimmer.

112
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.590
<v 0>Quito. He got scared. You said.</v>

113
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.890
<v 1>Well, yeah. I mean, you know, he's, he's, he's, he's,</v>

114
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.900
he's very heavy and you know, he just was realizing through Meghan McCain.

115
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.213
Me a Meghan. We came.

116
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.110
<v 2>The only gal on the panel who held up a Boston market this weekend.</v>

117
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.510
I'm going to talk a little bit about guns. Okay.

118
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.060
A lot of people in the media have never shot a gun and they've certainly never

119
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:38.900
masturbated with one. They have no idea what the they're talking my guns,

120
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:42.440
not for sale, but my is and the prices PF Chang's.

121
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.290
I called him when his friends used to hunt me in the backyard,

122
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.710
I would run around and they'd shoot at me. And my father said, if we hit her,

123
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:52.340
the only thing that's going to come out is whipped cream. He was hilarious.

124
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.980
The AR 15 is the most popular gun in America.

125
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.820
And it's the only thing that's ever made me come. I liked my.

126
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.940
You don't tell me what guns I can own or what people.

127
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.600
<v 1>He's nuts. And he knows she's seen that. Oh no, no. She's seen.</v>

128
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.630
<v 0>That poor Megan to have seen that. Yeah.</v>

129
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.250
<v 1>Yeah. My God.</v>

130
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.510
<v 0>He, yeah. He's uh, we were talking about, uh, the BR. So anyway,</v>

131
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:20.990
I just decided not to do the jokes because I didn't want to upset her.

132
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.730
And it was, it sucked because it would've been nice to know leading up to that.

133
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.720
Right. Cause I was preparing, but who cares? I just didn't want to,

134
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.490
I don't want to make people feel bad.

135
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.380
<v 1>I'm going to walk. Yeah. Mine. What do you expect?</v>

136
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.071
I mean,

137
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:41.570
you had Alec Baldwins daughter come up and tell jokes about what a horrible

138
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:43.970
daddy is. And you can't,

139
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.140
you can't own up to the fact that you crashed into someone. Yeah. So what did,

140
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.370
did you make any jokes about her?

141
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.120
<v 0>Yeah. Um, I said, uh,</v>

142
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.120
I just made fun of the fact that she was a terrible father at one point and like

143
00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:58.220
abandoned one of her families to go do a reality show.

144
00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:00.890
So I really leaned into that. Yeah.

145
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.540
She had Brody Jenner and a couple others. Yeah.

146
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.150
He's the most famous of her sons,

147
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.660
but she had a whole family before the Kardashians that like,

148
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:15.530
she didn't watch grow up, even though they were just like down the road,

149
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.520
down the PCH.

150
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.860
<v 1>Yeah. Do you know that for a fact? Yeah.</v>

151
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.080
<v 0>Yeah. It was like an episode of the Kardashians where she was like,</v>

152
00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:24.440
I wasn't around for your lives. And uh, yeah,

153
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:28.100
but she was like so nice during the, when I was doing the jokes, she was like,

154
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:31.370
so happy about all the jokes about her abandoning her family. She was like,

155
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:32.204
I love him.

156
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.050
<v 1>Oh, what's the death one that she has a problem with because that was,</v>

157
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.740
it was weird because it happened during the celebration of her becoming a woman.

158
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:39.950
Yeah.

159
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.540
<v 0>She was right in the thick of the transition and they had a</v>

160
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:46.400
settlement. She settled,

161
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.440
I think there was some kind of fault who knows accidental,

162
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.770
but she did not want to relive it. Who would write.

163
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.560
But listen, I had a guy with my car once. Yeah. I almost killed him.

164
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.790
It was terrible. Um, no, he did not walk right after,

165
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.640
I mean on the street when you hit him garbage man picking up,

166
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.580
collecting across the street, jumped out from the car, didn't see him.

167
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:15.750
I was 16 just to got my license and he flew up on the hood and flew into the

168
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:18.300
grass. I thought I'd killed him. And it was terrifying.

169
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:20.100
And he sued me four years later. Right.

170
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.970
Under the statute of limitations and I had to go to court and then it came out

171
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:27.960
on the stand that he was a child molester. And so I won. Yeah.

172
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.120
It was kind of karma. Yeah. Pick the right person. You pick the right.

173
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.000
<v 1>Holy. He's a.</v>

174
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.520
<v 0>Child molester. Have you ever, ever almost killed someone?</v>

175
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.140
<v 1>No. No. Luckily yeah. That's crazy.</v>
