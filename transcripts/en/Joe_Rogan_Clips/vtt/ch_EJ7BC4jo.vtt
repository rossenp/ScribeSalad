00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.790
<v 1>But I'd love the fact.</v>

3
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.230
They said that that it's racist when he calls her Pocahontas it's racist.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.600
I'm like, it's a Disney movie. Well, a lot of people.

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.400
<v 0>So I mean, the moment that I, you know,</v>

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.440
gave up on Elizabeth Warren's political judgment is when she decided to

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.420
publicly go through the DN and the 23 and me or whatever it was to

8
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:28.590
prove that she was in fact partially native American. It was like, just dude,

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.573
back off.

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.450
<v 1>Well, she had to, she had to, Trump, Trump is going to attack her on it forever.</v>

11
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:35.220
Now attack her on it forever. No matter what,

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.020
but now at least it's off the table.

13
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:41.010
She showed the Sloot slightest sliver of native Americans.

14
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.780
<v 0>No, Joe, it's not off the table.</v>

15
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.540
You think that if Elizabeth Warren's not the candidate,

16
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.760
that's not going to be what he hits her with every single time.

17
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.600
<v 1>For sure. Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.900
But it would be more on the table if she had never taken the DNA test,

19
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.840
he would be, oh, for sure. Yes. Yes. Because it would be this,

20
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.920
this hidden thing. Like no, no, no. He knows.

21
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.810
He knows I'm lying about my ancestry.

22
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.860
It's a big thing to lie about because if you look, if you lie about being Dutch,

23
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.150
okay, it's like, you know, it's kind of a cool ethnicity, but it's not that,

24
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.130
but you lie about being native American.

25
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:15.570
It's different because like they're one of the most maligned and

26
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.370
repressed peoples ever in, in recorded history.

27
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.001
I mean,

28
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:25.950
they were wiped off the face of the map and stuck into these little pockets of

29
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:30.360
land that don't have strong natural resources. I mean, I've been,

30
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.800
I'm on my fifth book in the last three months on native Americans.

31
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.030
Wow. Yeah. I became obsessed with empire the summer moon.

32
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.040
It's a book, um,

33
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.840
on the command cheese and it is incredible. It's incredible.

34
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.760
When you realize like that this was going on in this country just 150

35
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:53.190
years ago, and that for hundreds of years,

36
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:55.440
the Comanche has just dominated the west.

37
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.060
They dominated the Plains and until they invented a gun that could shoot more

38
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:02.550
than one bullet, the, the white men were.

39
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.030
The Comanches would just dominate them because they could shoot arrow after

40
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:10.080
hour. And they were just a ferocious people. They didn't that, no artwork,

41
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.850
no bead work. They just, they just made teepees like work.

42
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.720
Really? They weren't, they didn't have like illustrious,

43
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:23.370
like works of art and beautiful. What, what the Comanches were a war people.

44
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.360
Yeah. They, they raided, they hunted, they ate mostly meat.

45
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.150
All they ate was meat. They barely, they didn't farm.

46
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.260
They didn't do any farming.

47
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.120
They just roamed around and killed Buffalo and just dominated the entire Western

48
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:38.880
half of this country for hundreds and hundreds of years,

49
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.310
because they were the first ones to figure out how to ride horses.

50
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.330
They were the first ones to not just figure out how to ride horses, but to,

51
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.060
to raise horses, animal husband, tree, they, they,

52
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.580
they figured out how to accumulate large stables of horses and

53
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:57.960
ride them better than anybody could. You need to read this? It's amazing.

54
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.680
It's it's amazing. It's so good. It's such a good book and horrific.

55
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.110
Do you see the woman out there? That's on the wall,

56
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.860
outside the native American woman. That's breastfeeding woman, a baby.

57
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.710
You're talking about a real woman in a painting. There's a no,

58
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:14.830
it's a photograph of Cynthia Ann Parker. Cynthia Ann Parker was,

59
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.000
she was abducted by the Comanche's when she was nine years old and then became

60
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:23.680
accepted as a part of the tribe and then went on to be the wife of the

61
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:26.740
major chief, one of the major Comanche chiefs,

62
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.270
and then was kidnapped back by the United States when she was 30.

63
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.890
But she didn't want to be in the United States cause her whole life or CA but by

64
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:38.080
the, whatever, the pioneers,

65
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:41.320
wherever the they would call them the Americans that's her right there.

66
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.530
That's the photograph so far. How did you get in,

67
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.640
like what started your interest in this? Uh, read a book by my friend,

68
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:51.790
Steven Rinella, um, called the American Buffalo.

69
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.020
And it's the history of the bison in the United States and the native Americans

70
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:59.530
that would travel with the bison and all these different tribes that would,

71
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.930
they basically co-existed with the bison,

72
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.290
just moving with the bison as they migrated and hunting the bison.

73
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.401
And I was just like,

74
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:11.080
what a strange thing that these people live in this stone age,

75
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.910
but fantastic way with all these myths and legends and stories and so much

76
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:19.750
magic in their life. And then all that's gone, all that's gone.

77
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.740
And now we just like, so when Elizabeth Warren, yeah.

78
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.290
So when Elizabeth Warren lies about being that,

79
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.930
like that's a big deal because they're one of the most mythical

80
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.100
cultures, one of the most magical cultures in a lot of ways, because look,

81
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:37.810
they did horrific things to each other.

82
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:41.230
There's no doubt about the Comanche's were ruthless to each other,

83
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.770
to other native American tribes. They, they went on war constantly.

84
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:48.490
They were raiding each other, constantly kidnapping abducting, murdering.

85
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.150
I mean, there was this there's no like this idea of native Americans being like,

86
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.190
oh yeah, Haas poor, a hundred percent horseshit. That's not how they lived.

87
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.140
But the way they lived was I don't want to say

88
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:06.460
admirable, but fascinating, fascinating,

89
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.840
and powerful.

90
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.210
And th and they had their very strict rules and codes of

91
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:17.020
operating that were very unlike the Western world.

92
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.940
And they were invaded,

93
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.170
they were invaded and dominated and killed off by disease. And then ultimately,

94
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:24.160
I mean, there was, you know,

95
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:27.160
they were shooting Buffalo just to starve the Indians out. I mean,

96
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:31.060
there was a lot of crazy that went down. So when she comes out and says,

97
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.730
you know, oh, I am,

98
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:37.420
I grew up native American that the you did the you did.

99
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.930
And the more books I read now I'm on black elk speaks,

100
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:45.190
which is my favorite one so far because black elk speaks is an actual man named

101
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.500
black elk, who is a glaucoma Sue medicine man, a Lakota medicine man, who, uh,

102
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.140
in the 1930s told his story.

103
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.070
So he was alive when he was there, when Custer was murdered. Yeah, he was,

104
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:01.850
he was there when the, the Sioux were forced into reservations,

105
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.470
he's telling the whole story of them going from living this nomadic life to

106
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:10.130
being forced in these reservation reservations and starving and alcoholism and

107
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:12.950
all the chaos that came with it. So,

108
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.420
and this one is this one's the best because it's literally his words.

109
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.290
So you get a direct translation. He's talking to his son,

110
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.800
his son is talking to the author and the book was written in the 1930s.

111
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.600
<v 0>Do you spend any time.</v>

112
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.620
<v 1>On reservations? No, I have. And other than Indian casinos doing standup,</v>

113
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.840
we're working on it right now, while we're working on that. Right now,

114
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:38.930
we're reaching out to a couple of different native American groups to try to

115
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:43.310
find a good representative representative to come in and talk about w you know,

116
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:47.900
their grandparents and the stories that they had heard. Yeah. It's, um,

117
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.940
it's a crazy subject. And it's, to me look,

118
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.340
pretending you're, anything is not good,

119
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.610
but pretending you're native American to me is like, whoa,

120
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.500
that's because that's one where everybody it's,

121
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.350
there's like a spirituality aspect, native Americans it's implied, like you say,

122
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.710
your native American people are like, oh, that guy knows things. You know,

123
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:10.990
you're allowed to have feathers. You can have an,

124
00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:14.240
an ironic dream catcher on your wall. You know, it's different.

125
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.900
<v 0>That's one thing that like, cost play is yeah, I totally get that.</v>

126
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.360
<v 1>Totally. Yeah. It's, it's, it's a weird one, you know,</v>

127
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:25.400
and you know, maybe someone lied to her. People,

128
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.090
people get the wrong information all the time from their great-grandparents and,

129
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:33.530
you know, people they get. And also the thing about Cynthia and Parker, right?

130
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:36.260
Cynthia and Parker was 0% native American,

131
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.570
but she was 100% Indian.

132
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.970
She still was a native American cause she's abducted when she was nine and lived

133
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:45.770
their life. She wanted to go back.

134
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.780
<v 0>Like she threw in her lot with them and that made her, them.</v>

135
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.280
<v 1>She didn't like the Western world when she was forced to live in cities and live</v>

136
00:07:55.281 --> 00:08:00.260
in towns and she hated it. And you get her words, you know, when,

137
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:02.120
when, when she's describing the difference,

138
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:06.620
like the Comanche world was filled with magic and God's, the water was a God,

139
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:09.560
the sky was a God, everything was, there was magic. Like you would,

140
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.890
there was rituals that would do to protect themselves in combat.

141
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:15.590
And all these things made life fantastic.

142
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:19.640
This is the hunting of the Buffalo and the nomadic way of life.

143
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.110
And then all of a sudden to be locked into these buildings and wearing these

144
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:28.730
clothes and stuck within these rituals that the white men would

145
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.630
live. She didn't want to have any part of that. So even though like, you know,

146
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:35.390
if someone was Cynthia Ann Parker's,

147
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:38.210
if she had sex with a white man and made a white baby,

148
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:42.860
that is not a native American baby, but it kinda is, you know, I mean,

149
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:47.750
in terms of culture she's she was 100% all in Comanche when they

150
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.800
eventually abducted her back. Amazing stuff.

151
00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:56.460
So Elizabeth, Warren. that crazy.

152
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.470
I'm native American talk, Mimi again. No disrespect to Mrs. Warren.

153
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:03.750
Maybe someone lied to her. Maybe someone lied to her.

154
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.650
Maybe she didn't know she was one, 2000th native American.

155
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.580
<v 0>I don't know. I also just think, I don't know.</v>

156
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.590
She's she's an expert and she's clearly manipulative. No,

157
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.760
I was going to say really smart and has like,

158
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.460
she knows what she's talking about. I just don't think,

159
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.870
I just don't think that she sells to the American people in this moment.

160
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:30.180
I just don't. I don't see it. Yeah. I really don't.

161
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.070
<v 1>Well, that she pulled on Bernie,</v>

162
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.550
what she was saying that he had pulled her aside and in private and said a woman

163
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.020
can never be president. Okay.

164
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.570
<v 0>Can you tell me how you saw that moment?</v>

165
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.630
<v 1>Well, the CNN moment was very interesting, right?</v>

166
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.840
When she walked up to him in this very public way and said,

167
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:49.680
I think you just called me a liar on national TV. And he was like, oh,

168
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.330
you want to get into this?

169
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.180
<v 0>You see the video where someone put the curb, your enthusiasm, like, oh my God,</v>

170
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.690
Jamie, you need to pull. It's like Tom Stiers they're living it's.

171
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.620
And it's like the intro music to curve. It's incredible. It's perfect.

172
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.900
It's funny because Tom saw her standing there, like.

173
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.310
<v 1>Yeah, I don't, I think it was a ploy. I don't buy it.</v>

174
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.960
He's been her ally forever.

175
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:17.730
And to me it shows a sign of great disloyalty and great dishonesty.

176
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.580
Like the way she did it, she did it as a, it's a ploy,

177
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.560
like ideally her and him could be allies and she could be,

178
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.140
either.

179
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:26.973
<v 0>Person can win.</v>

180
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.040
<v 1>Right. But maybe she wins. And he's her running mate.</v>

181
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.920
Like some that is a hundred percent possible. Right.

182
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:36.330
So if you're all in the DNC together, you should be allies, right?

183
00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:38.790
He's a powerful force in the democratic party.

184
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.190
She's a powerful force in the democratic party.

185
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.690
Why are you attacking each other?

186
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.470
And why are you attacking each other with some story from like many years ago

187
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:48.450
where he said that a woman's never gonna win.

188
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.940
<v 0>Ha I, I don't know.</v>

189
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:53.310
This is one thing where I can give them both a generous read.

190
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:57.270
I think it's very possible that they had the kind of conversation that people

191
00:10:57.271 --> 00:10:58.680
like you and I have all the time,

192
00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:02.340
which is can a woman win the presidency of the United States?

193
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.240
And I think Bernie gave an answer that probably let a lot of people given those

194
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:09.180
conversations, which is maybe not,

195
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:12.870
maybe the American people are too sexist to elect a woman like that's possible.

196
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.130
And she, you know, and he meant that in an observational way,

197
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.020
not at any judgment on who she is or the capability of a woman to be

198
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:26.160
president. And she heard it in the negative way of a woman can be president.

199
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.820
Yes.

200
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.220
<v 1>Too generous possible. That is possible.</v>

201
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.690
<v 0>I agree that she,</v>

202
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.460
that this was absolutely a strategy on her part, that backfire.

203
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.323
That's why it's.

204
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.163
<v 1>Not a question.</v>

205
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.400
<v 0>Not a question, but I also think that, you know, I am,</v>

206
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.750
I have those conversations every day.

207
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:46.530
Can a woman be precedent like pupil really misogynistic.

208
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.490
<v 1>Sure. Well, they have these ideas about what a president is.</v>

209
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.730
And a president is an older male who is, you know,

210
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:59.260
well-spoken and educated. Who understands. Yeah. There's many factors. Yeah.

211
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.870
<v 0>That's why Pete Buddha judge stern chance too short. Yeah.</v>

212
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.500
<v 1>And a lot of other, there's a lot of other things. Well,</v>

213
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:09.970
there's also a mayor right now and you're why aren't you working? What are you?

214
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.910
<v 0>No, no, man. Andrew Yang is like, are you saying no govern,</v>

215
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.770
like lack of government experience? Are you saying.

216
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:15.581
<v 1>No, no, no, no, no, no.</v>

217
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:19.390
He has a job that he's not doing when he's out there running for president.

218
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.980
Like Andrew Yang is not,

219
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.280
he's not a mayor somewhere where he's ignoring his constituents.

220
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:27.670
He's not ignoring a city like south bend, Indiana. They're freaking out.

221
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.130
They're like, what the are you doing, man? You're supposed to be the mayor.

222
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.950
<v 0>Well, that's on new Yorkers. Felt about bill, bill de Blasio,</v>

223
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:36.760
which is like our feckless mayor is now running for president. I mean.

224
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.710
<v 1>The word feckless is one of my, I never use it. It's a great word, feckless.</v>

225
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.850
He is. It is. It's just, who caught someone called, um,

226
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.680
someone affectless? Who the hell was that? I don't know. God it.

227
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.560
I was, I forget who it was. Someone on the shell,

228
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:58.060
like maybe Samantha bee called someone affectless con Trump

229
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.950
Jesus, but she was feckless. And then condos.

230
00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.660
That was hard. She came hard. She went hard. She came like

231
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.000
came at her heart. Yeah. I, I'm not good with language sometimes,

232
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.790
but the, um, the, the,

233
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:19.630
the Warren thing that was the real problem with it was that it was obviously

234
00:13:19.631 --> 00:13:23.290
calculated. It didn't it, when people are talking, if someone said, look,

235
00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:25.780
if he was like a closet misogynist. No.

236
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.630
<v 0>Obviously he's not, obviously he's not right.</v>

237
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:33.280
But I also think that he had a conversation with her where he said that a woman

238
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.203
can't win.

239
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.830
<v 1>Emmanuel or maybe not, or maybe he said, sure,</v>

240
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.750
she could sure she could be making it up.

241
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.120
<v 0>Could I don't think that she is.</v>

242
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:47.770
And I think what Bernie meant was not anything sexist or misogynist.

243
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.680
I say, sometimes I ask out loud to my friends.

244
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.690
I don't know if a woman can win for president.

245
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:57.730
<v 1>Well, Hillary won the popular vote, right? So no one can win. Yes.</v>

246
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.150
They can win. Yes. The, the, the idea that they can is nonsense,

247
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:03.040
but it's also talk, right.

248
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.430
If you and I were just sitting around having a cup of coffee and we're just

249
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:07.810
talking, we just talk about.

250
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:09.460
<v 0>That.</v>

251
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.770
<v 1>Against. Yeah. You say, this is a statement and I'm like,</v>

252
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:15.010
that's not what I'm saying. I don't know what the I'm saying right now.

253
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.760
Like right when I'm talking, I don't know what my next word is going to be.

254
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.270
Right. Everyone knows that. We, we all know that when we're talking,

255
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.141
it's one thing.

256
00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:26.850
If you're reading a speech or if you have like a very clear doctrine that you,

257
00:14:26.851 --> 00:14:30.700
you like, this is my, this is my idea of the world. Let me let,

258
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.590
I've thought this through very carefully.

259
00:14:32.591 --> 00:14:35.500
I've written it down and I like to share it with you. This is my, okay,

260
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:38.860
well then I'm going to hold you to that. And then if you change that opinion,

261
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.800
I'd like you to tell me why you changed it and tell me why you,

262
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.340
why you were wrong. But that's definitely true. Talk if taught like,

263
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.760
I'm living in camp. When a women can't win a woman, can't win. Can't win.

264
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.760
Maybe he's. That's what he said. You know, maybe he was upset.

265
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.090
And then she's like, he privately told me a woman can never be present.

266
00:14:56.091 --> 00:15:00.590
He's like Dutch and he's all, don't do this now. I'll do this. No.

267
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.510
Do you want to do this now? Will you do this.

268
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.690
<v 2>With the curb music?</v>
