00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um,</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.110
I want to bring it back to when you first started with the NSA,

3
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:11.520
you started as a contractor, right? Uh, what was your initial impression?

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.560
And when did you know that things were really squirrely with

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.940
the programs they were in sort of thing?

6
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.470
<v 1>So I'm not saying this to put, put you on the spot.</v>

7
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.460
I know you've been a busy guy. I know you haven't done, uh, uh,

8
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.910
I think shows recently you're come back from break. Right. Um,

9
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.750
but have you read the book because it'll just help me reframe,

10
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:34.100
if you haven't got a chance to read it, know.

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.530
<v 0>No, I have not read your book or got a copy of it.</v>

12
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.880
<v 1>Okay. Well, I will send you a signed copy brother. Beautiful.</v>

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.330
I hope you'll read it and I hope you enjoy it, but all right. So,

14
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.270
uh, I had a really weird, um, history in the intelligence community. Uh,

15
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:55.220
I grew up in a federal family, um, in the, the shadow of Fort me,

16
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.650
right? All these little suburban communities in Maryland,

17
00:00:57.651 --> 00:00:59.600
where basically the entire industry,

18
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.230
the state is the federal government of all these different agencies.

19
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:06.620
And then all the subcontractors, all the defense industries, uh,

20
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:10.490
that serve that government. And really our kind of our, our war making machine,

21
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:14.810
our, our system of control, uh, for the country and the world broadly,

22
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.380
all that stuff spreads, uh, and you know,

23
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.930
a couple of hundred mile race out of DC. Uh, uh,

24
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.070
my mother, uh, worked for the district courts, um, or rather the federal courts.

25
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.740
And, uh, it's kind of funny because she still works there.

26
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.900
And those are the courts that are trying to throw me in jail for the rest of my

27
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:36.710
life. Now, um, my father worked for the coast guard, uh,

28
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:38.060
retired after 30 years,

29
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:42.020
my grandfather was an Admiral and then he worked for the FBI. Um,

30
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.390
as far back as it goes, my, my family, uh, my,

31
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:50.360
my whole line of family, even generations back, uh,

32
00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:54.560
was working for the government. Um, so it was pretty ordinary,

33
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:58.130
pretty expected for me to, to, to go into the same kind of work.

34
00:01:58.131 --> 00:02:02.120
Now I started now, I wasn't super successful in school,

35
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.220
um, because, uh, it,

36
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.110
I felt, and, you know,

37
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:12.890
this is the most arrogant thing in the world than anybody says. Um, uh,

38
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.370
that I had more to learn from computers than I did from, you know,

39
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.770
biology class. Um,

40
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.550
and so I spent more and more time focusing on technology. Then I got mano, uh,

41
00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:32.500
and I dropped out of high school. Um, and now it's like,

42
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.360
all right, how do I make this up? Uh, I say, drop out of high school,

43
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:39.580
but I'm actually going to community college. Right.

44
00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:42.910
They called it concurrent enrollment where I'm not taking any classes at high

45
00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:47.200
school. Uh, I'm going to community college instead. Um,

46
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.770
and I'm not doing that great. They're either like, it's fine. You know,

47
00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:54.580
I'm enjoying it, but you know, school is school. I, I want,

48
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.150
I can't wait to be grown. You're bored. Um, and

49
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.460
I think a lot of people, um, have, have felt that,

50
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:07.300
but I ran into somebody at the community college who ran their own home base

51
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.860
business, doing web design, and they could see,

52
00:03:10.861 --> 00:03:13.920
I was kind of technical and they went, Hey, do you want to work for me?

53
00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:17.220
And I was like, well, that sounds great. Well,

54
00:03:17.221 --> 00:03:21.810
I started doing web design really, really early on. This is like, uh, gosh,

55
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:26.700
I don't know, probably a 1998, uh, vintage, um,

56
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.640
during the big boom. And then, uh, the collapse, the followed,

57
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.860
and the funny thing is she, uh, she was married, uh,

58
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.730
to an NSA analyst, a linguist, right. Um,

59
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.960
and so she lived on Fort Meade and she ran, uh,

60
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.810
her business out of their home, on Fort Meade.

61
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.350
That's right up the street from the NSA. So yeah, before I'm even working there,

62
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.930
uh, I'm driving past this building all the time, uh, and trying to figure out,

63
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:57.940
you know, what the next step is going to be an, I, I enjoy this. It's,

64
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.520
it's a good thing for me. And like, it, it works well. And I start, uh,

65
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.790
getting trained and certified all these little industry stamps.

66
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:08.160
You've got to get as a technologist to say, oh, you know,

67
00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:11.100
this program or whatever, and just start climbing the ladder,

68
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.430
but then nine 11 happens. Uh, and I'm on. Yeah. Uh,

69
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.300
when nine 11 happens, I'm just going into work. And I tell this, uh,

70
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.310
the book in some detail,

71
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.510
and I think it's very much worth reading for people that don't know this,

72
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:32.040
because this is forgotten history. How old were you at this party? Gosh,

73
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.660
I was a, I was born in 83. Uh, so I was probably, yeah, 18 years old.

74
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.050
Um, and, uh, yeah, uh, yeah,

75
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:46.770
I had, I just turned 18 a couple months it's before. Um,

76
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.140
and what people forget, um,

77
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.210
is who knew what was going on before anybody else? Oh, on September 11th,

78
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.870
the intelligence community. Right. Um,

79
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.760
and what did they do, right. Did they, uh, give out a public morning? Did they,

80
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.190
they tell you guys to evacuate? Did they say do this, that or that? No. No.

81
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.260
I'm not for everybody. Not for long time. Uh,

82
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.300
but at the NSA, uh,

83
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.750
then director of Michael Hayden, he was a general,

84
00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:26.550
he later became a director of the CIA ordered the entire campus,

85
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:29.310
evacuated of thousands.

86
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:33.780
Tens of thousands of people actually just said, go home. Right. Uh,

87
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.520
the CIA did the same thing. They were running on skeleton crews, uh,

88
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.560
at the moment the country needed them more than they ever had. Right. Uh,

89
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.760
and I get a call, um,

90
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.080
who else did I hear a call? Uh, that's from my boss's wife,

91
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.940
uh, her husband to her, he's calling from the NSA and saying, Hey, you know,

92
00:05:56.941 --> 00:05:59.750
I think ed should leave for the day because I'm the only employee of this

93
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:01.670
business besides her. Uh,

94
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.560
because I think they're going to close the base down and I'm like,

95
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:06.350
this is crazy. It never closes down. We don't know what's happening.

96
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:10.640
Then we start checking the news, uh, which is through websites, right.

97
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.080
Because we're, we're doing all this stuff.

98
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.160
And suddenly it's the big story everywhere. Uh, and you know,

99
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:20.810
nobody understands how big it is yet. Um, most of us are like, oh,

100
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:23.330
it's going to mess with our Workday, oh, it's going to mess with our commute.

101
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.460
Uh, but when I'm leaving, I hear car horns all over the base.

102
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:30.650
It's the craziest thing. Cause this is a military base, right.

103
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:31.790
It's right outside the NSA.

104
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.440
And I entered just this absolute state of pandemonium is I go past canine road,

105
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:41.090
which is the road that travels right in pat in front of, uh,

106
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.920
the NSA's headquarters. And it's just a parking lot as far as you can see,

107
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:50.480
they have a military police out under the stoplights

108
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.480
directing traffic, because it's this massive evacuation.

109
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:55.670
And I still have no idea what's happening. Like the,

110
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:58.220
the story is still developing. Um,

111
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.110
but I will never forget that image. Uh,

112
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.820
why did these people have so much power and so much money and so much authority.

113
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.610
And then if at the moments we need them the most,

114
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.050
they're the first ones in the country that are leaving their buildings.

115
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.170
Uh, and you know, later on, um, they said, uh, and this is, uh,

116
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.830
covered in a book I believe. Um,

117
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.890
I think it's James Banford, uh,

118
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.270
who interviewed that director of NSA who gave that order about what was

119
00:07:36.271 --> 00:07:39.030
happening. He was going well, you know, he, he, uh,

120
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.090
called his wife and he was asking where their kids were and everything like

121
00:07:42.091 --> 00:07:46.860
that. And then after that, um, he wanted to, uh, think about, well,

122
00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:50.100
where could these other planes that they knew were in the air that it hadn't

123
00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:55.050
struck it? Where could they be headed? And this sort of shows how,

124
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.370
um, self-centric the intelligence community is, uh,

125
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.030
this is the DC Metro area, right? Thinking at the white house,

126
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.230
they could hit Congress, they could hit the Supreme court. Right. And they go,

127
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.950
oh, they're going to fly their planes into the CIA headquarters,

128
00:08:10.951 --> 00:08:14.120
or they're going to fly their planes into the NSA headquarters. Uh,

129
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:18.780
and of course it was never realistic, uh, that these would be the targets. Um,

130
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.920
but on that basis, they were like, Ooh, let's get our bacon, uh, out of the pan,

131
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.570
but don't say this.

132
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.010
<v 0>Yeah, I'm sorry. But in the end,</v>

133
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.710
just in the interest of why wasn't it possible that they could have attacked

134
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:33.950
those places? I mean, they attack the Pentagon. They, you know,

135
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.880
they knew that there was.

136
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.160
<v 1>Look it's absolutely possible. They could have attacked your Denny's. Right.</v>

137
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.270
You know? Um, but it's a question of, uh, risk assessment.

138
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.440
If you have planes in the air, uh,

139
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.380
if you believe there's an ongoing terrorist attack,

140
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:54.140
that's happening in the United States right now.

141
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.510
And if you have built history's greatest surveillance

142
00:08:59.511 --> 00:09:02.990
agencies, right? The most powerful, uh,

143
00:09:02.991 --> 00:09:06.110
intelligence forces in the history of the species,

144
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.080
you guys are going to take those off the board,

145
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.450
or at least the majority of their personnel off the board,

146
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.600
then in a chance that you have no, uh,

147
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.610
sort of grounds for substantiating,

148
00:09:16.611 --> 00:09:21.410
that they could be targeting you to begin with, simply because they could, well,

149
00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:24.680
somebody else will do yeah. Hit with those. As you say,

150
00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:27.530
it's going to be the Pentagon, right. It's going to be okay. Uh,

151
00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:30.860
the world trade center, it's going to be someone somewhere.

152
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.550
And the more minutes you're in front of that desk, the higher the chances,

153
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.870
even if it's a very small chance,

154
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.690
even if it's somebody who doesn't work on terrorism, right.

155
00:09:38.691 --> 00:09:43.550
Maybe if it's somebody who normally works finance in North Korea, right.

156
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.860
But they go, look, this is an emergency. Everybody understands,

157
00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:49.790
you don't need to explain this. You just go stop what you're doing. Uh,

158
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.630
look at financial transactions related to who purchased these plane tickets,

159
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.650
do this. You just go full spectrum and go anything you can do right now,

160
00:09:57.651 --> 00:10:00.800
if the bills, when it gets hit, we get hit. That's what we signed up for.

161
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.640
Nobody wants that, right. That that's not the desired outcome,

162
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.050
but if they had asked the staff to do,

163
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:13.730
then they all would have agreed. That's what these people signed up to do.

164
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.450
And yet the director goes, no, you know, we're, we're just, just no,

165
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.370
like we're not going to take that. And this is,

166
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.740
I think it's says so much about the bureaucratic character

167
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.560
of how government works, right?

168
00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:31.760
The people who rise to the top of these governments, um,

169
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.540
it's about risk management for them, right?

170
00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:38.660
It's about never being criticized for something, right. This is, look,

171
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.120
if we want to get really controversial, and this is something that'll,

172
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.200
that'll haunt me because people will bring it up. Uh, again and again,

173
00:10:45.201 --> 00:10:47.940
and again, people ask about, you know,

174
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.960
people still criticize me and the book, you know,

175
00:10:50.961 --> 00:10:53.720
I talk about aliens and chem trails and things like that in the fact that there,

176
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.730
uh, there's no evidence for that. I went looking on the network. Right. Um,

177
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.840
and I, I know Joe, I, I know, uh,

178
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.690
you want there to be aliens, uh, uh, duke,

179
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.800
I know Neil deGrasse Tyson badly wants there to be aliens. Uh,

180
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.910
and there probably are. Right. Uh, but the idea that, that we're hiding them,

181
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.710
if we are hiding them, I had ridiculous access to the networks of the NSA,

182
00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:23.600
the CIA, the military, all of these groups. Um, I couldn't find anything. Right.

183
00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:27.500
So if it's hidden and it could be hidden. Yeah. It didn't really well,

184
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.230
even for people who are on the inside. Um,

185
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.020
but the main thing is conspiracy theories, right?

186
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.890
Everybody wants to believe in conspiracy theories because it,

187
00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:37.550
it helps life make sense.

188
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.290
It helps us believe that somebody has control in control, right.

189
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:46.250
That somebody is calling the shots. These things all happen for a reason, this,

190
00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:50.870
that, and the other, uh, there are real conspiracies,

191
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.890
uh, but they're not typically, you know,

192
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.800
they've got tens of thousands of people working on them,

193
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:59.770
unless you're talking about the existence of the intelligence community itself,

194
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.540
uh, which is basically, uh, constructed on the idea that you can get. Uh,

195
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:09.400
I think there's a 4 million or 1.4 million people in the United States who

196
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:13.650
hold a security clearances, and you can get all of these people to,

197
00:12:13.651 --> 00:12:17.500
to not talk ever to journalists or this, that, or the other. Um,

198
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.610
but when you look back at the nine 11 report,

199
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:24.130
and when you look back at the history of what actually happened,

200
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:26.650
what we can prove, right. Not what we can speculate on,

201
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:30.480
but what are at least the commonly agreed facts, right?

202
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.730
It's very clear to me as someone who worked in the intelligence community,

203
00:12:37.731 --> 00:12:40.250
not during this period, of course I was too young, uh,

204
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.740
but very shortly thereafter, um,

205
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.580
that these attacks could have been prevented. Uh, and in fact,

206
00:12:46.581 --> 00:12:49.910
the government says this too. Uh, but the government goes to the,

207
00:12:49.911 --> 00:12:52.310
the reason that they, uh, these attacks happened,

208
00:12:52.311 --> 00:12:55.510
the reason that they weren't prevented, uh, is, uh,

209
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.720
with a cold stove piping, right? There was, there was not enough, uh, sharing.

210
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:04.040
They needed to break down the walls and the restrictions that were chaining,

211
00:13:04.041 --> 00:13:06.110
these poor Patriots, uh,

212
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.170
at the NSA and the CIA and the FBI from all working on the same team.

213
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.070
And to some extent, they're, they're correct on this right there,

214
00:13:13.071 --> 00:13:16.490
there were limits on the way agencies were supposed to play ball with each

215
00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:17.360
other. Um,

216
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:21.080
but I worked there and I know how much of this is and how much of this is not,

217
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.870
um, those are, uh, procedural and policy limits in some cases,

218
00:13:26.871 --> 00:13:28.880
legal limits on what can be shared, uh,

219
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.810
without following a process without doing this, that, or the other without, uh,

220
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.350
basically asking for permission without getting a sign off, uh,

221
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.280
or anything like that.

222
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.320
If the FBI wanted to send absolutely everything they had to the CIA they could

223
00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:45.410
have done. So if the CIA wanted to send everything they had to, the FBI,

224
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.880
they could have done. So they didn't, and people died as a result.

225
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.930
Now government goes, bureaucratic procedural realism, uh, was responsible.

226
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.230
And it's because we had too many restrictions on the intelligence community.

227
00:13:57.231 --> 00:13:59.390
And this is what led to the world. Post nine 11,

228
00:13:59.391 --> 00:14:02.120
where all of our rights sort of evaporated was they went well,

229
00:14:02.121 --> 00:14:06.680
restrictions on what these agencies can do are costing lives. Therefore,

230
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.250
naturally we just have to Unchained these guys and everything will be better.

231
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.450
Right? And if you remember that post nine 11 moment,

232
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.900
you can understand how that actually could come off as persuasive,

233
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.990
how that might be a kind of thing to go. You go, all right, well,

234
00:14:20.991 --> 00:14:24.920
will that make sense? Because everybody was terrified, right? Um,

235
00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.090
there were people quite quickly who got their heads back on their shoulders,

236
00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:32.990
the right way. There were some of them who never lost their heads at all. Uh,

237
00:14:32.991 --> 00:14:36.470
and who protested the Iraq war at the same time,

238
00:14:36.471 --> 00:14:40.460
my Don self was signing up to go fight it, uh, volunteering for the army.

239
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.870
And we're getting into that a minute. Um, but

240
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.870
everything is that his followed in the decades past,

241
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.060
came from the fact that in a of fear,

242
00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.160
we lost our heads and we abandoned all the traditional

243
00:15:00.161 --> 00:15:03.010
constitutional restraints that we put on these agencies.

244
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.950
And we abandoned all of the traditional, uh,

245
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.690
political restraints and just social constraints, idiot, logical, uh,

246
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.390
systems of belief about them limitations that the secret police should have in a

247
00:15:16.391 --> 00:15:21.100
free and open society. And we went, look, you know, terrorists,

248
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.450
we created shows like 24 and Jack Bauer where he's like threatening knife.

249
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.780
People's eyeballs out if they won't tell him this, that or the other. Uh,

250
00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.510
and we entered it this era of increasingly unlimited government as a

251
00:15:34.511 --> 00:15:39.400
result. And now in hindsight, we go, well, we should have been surprised. Uh,

252
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.250
but at the time, uh, everyone panicked, right.

253
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:47.200
But if you go back to you did that help. And we know the answer now is in fact,

254
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:51.880
no, it did not. It made things worse. Uh, I don't think any of that,

255
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.360
the story is going to look at the Bush administration and go this improve the

256
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:58.210
position of the United States, it's in the world. Um,

257
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:04.270
but if you go back, you don't wind back the tape to that pre nine 11 moment,

258
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:05.430
uh,

259
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.290
wind back the tape to those silos and those walls that they said needed to come

260
00:16:08.291 --> 00:16:11.200
down, because that was restraining government, instead of the rules that said,

261
00:16:11.201 --> 00:16:13.840
well, you can share these things, but there's gotta be basis.

262
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.520
There's gotta be a justification. You've gotta go.

263
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.790
Why are we trading people's information like baseball cards and all of this

264
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.713
stuff.

265
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.910
It's super easy as an intelligence officer to justify

266
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.850
sharing information about a suspected terrorist,

267
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.780
who do you think is planning to kill people, or is even just in a country,

268
00:16:31.781 --> 00:16:33.380
they shouldn't be replaced. They shouldn't be,

269
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.420
you're doing something you don't think they should be with another agency

270
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.280
because no, one's going to question that a judge,

271
00:16:39.281 --> 00:16:41.920
isn't going to question that any judge in the world will stamp that warrant

272
00:16:41.921 --> 00:16:46.240
without even thinking about it and then go to bed that night. Um, uh, you know,

273
00:16:46.241 --> 00:16:49.750
without a care in the world, uh, because you're not spying on a journalist,

274
00:16:49.751 --> 00:16:52.960
you're not spying on the human rights defender, right? This is not an edge case.

275
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.230
Uh, this is someone that you believe to be associated with Al Qaeda or whatever.

276
00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.720
Now, uh, this is all a lot of preamble to say that essential fact,

277
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.780
um, government agrees, everyone agrees.

278
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.950
The tax probably could have been prevented, uh, if information had and shared.

279
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.300
So why wasn't the information shared government says no

280
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.510
information wasn't shared, um,

281
00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.650
because of these restrictions and it's half true because every important lie

282
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.370
has, has some criminal truth to it. Uh, and, and there were these barriers,

283
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.350
but the reality is why were those barriers respected in the case of a major

284
00:17:29.351 --> 00:17:33.970
terrorist plot? Why wasn't the CIA sharing information with the FBI?

285
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.160
Why wasn't the FBI sharing information with the NSA?

286
00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:39.430
Why was the NSA sharing information with the CIA in the case of Mary major

287
00:17:39.431 --> 00:17:43.330
terrorist plot? And if you've worked in government,

288
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.070
if you've worked in the trust Allison's community,

289
00:17:45.071 --> 00:17:47.230
if you work in any large institution, you know,

290
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.090
you work at a company that sells batteries. You know,

291
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.200
that every office is fighting the other office for budget,

292
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.480
for cloud, for promotions.

293
00:17:57.481 --> 00:18:01.620
And this is the sad reality of what actually happened. Um,

294
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.060
every one of those agencies want it to be the guy who busted the plot.

295
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.610
They wanted to be the one who got credit for it,

296
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:13.470
and they didn't realize how serious it was until it was too late,

297
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.860
because they were competing with each other rather than co-op.

298
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.690
<v 0>That's exactly what I was going to ask you, if that was the issue,</v>

299
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.210
the competition between these agencies, because they,

300
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:28.040
they are very proud of the CIA accomplishing something or the FBI

301
00:18:28.041 --> 00:18:29.310
accomplishing something and they,

302
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:32.060
they want to be the one to take credit for that.

303
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.900
<v 1>Yeah. And I mean, I think it's important like in their defense,</v>

304
00:18:35.901 --> 00:18:40.400
because nobody else here is going to provide a defense for them. Um,

305
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:45.770
is that that's actually a darkly, uh, human. Uh,

306
00:18:45.771 --> 00:18:48.500
again, this happens in every industry. This happens in every, uh,

307
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.590
sort of big corporate thing because you want to get promoted and, you know,

308
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.130
everybody's putting in their like achievements at the end of the year for what

309
00:18:55.131 --> 00:18:58.220
they did. And if you're the guy who does that, you're going straight to the top,

310
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.920
but there's solutions was the, the.

311
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.100
<v 0>So we, we have a weird delay here for folks that are listening.</v>

312
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.511
So their solution,

313
00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:09.650
instead of having someone be responsible for bridging the gap and providing that

314
00:19:09.651 --> 00:19:13.520
information to each individual agency, their solution was mass surveillance.

315
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.170
<v 1>Well, no, they're, they're, they're different things. This is, uh,</v>

316
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.020
nine 11 is what woke these guys up, right. Um, basically, and they,

317
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.990
they went well, we screwed up and Americans died as a result.

318
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:33.270
Um, we really don't want to take the hit on that. Um, and to be honest,

319
00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:36.510
the government had no interest in putting the hit on them. Uh, to be honest,

320
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:40.680
the public had no interest in putting the hit on them, uh, at the time.

321
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.820
Um, because everybody understood terrorism is a real thing.

322
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.120
There are bad people in the world, and that's true, right?

323
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:50.160
That will always be true. There's always going to be criminals.

324
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:53.640
There's always going to be terrorists. Uh, whether they're at your church,

325
00:19:53.641 --> 00:19:58.110
whether they're across the ocean, there are people out there who are angry,

326
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.480
they're disenfranchised, they're violent,

327
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.500
and they just want to harm something.

328
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.040
They want to change something even in a negative way, uh,

329
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.410
because that's what they feel is all they have left,

330
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.340
which these are criminals, right? These are people that we don't need to pity.

331
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.550
Uh, but if we ever want to stop it, we do need to understand it.

332
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.380
And where those things come from, where there's,

333
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.390
these drives come from in the first place. But, uh, eh,

334
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.790
basically everybody went, all right, how do we stop this?

335
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.110
Because nobody wants to feel unsafe.

336
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.000
Nobody wants to feel like the buildings is going to come down.

337
00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:37.920
Then the next time you go in it. And so everybody just went, um, I don't care.

338
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:42.000
Who does it stop it? And they said this to Dick Cheney,

339
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.850
which is a historic mistake because Dane,

340
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.480
Dick Cheney knows how government works. Uh, he was, uh,

341
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:53.920
the person in that white house who was best placed to know all the levers of

342
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:56.500
government, all the inter-agency cooperation, where we were strong,

343
00:20:56.501 --> 00:21:00.580
where we're weak, what we could do, what we were not allowed to do.

344
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.080
And what he did was he took that little dial on what we're not allowed to do.

345
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:09.100
And he changed it all the way until it broke and snapped off.

346
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:12.750
And then there was nothing that was, he couldn't do anymore. Um.

347
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.170
<v 0>And you were there when this was happening. This was no.</v>

348
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.030
<v 1>I was, I, I was not, uh, again, this is, uh, 2001.</v>

349
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.470
Um, I was, uh, I was 18 years old. I was working on the base.

350
00:21:25.471 --> 00:21:28.080
I had drove past the building, but that was it. This is all hindsight.

351
00:21:28.081 --> 00:21:31.290
This is biography. This is documented history, but this is not, you know,

352
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.400
the gospel of Edward Snowden. I don't know this, right. This is public record.

353
00:21:35.401 --> 00:21:38.760
This is what we all know. Um,

354
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.850
what we have though, uh,

355
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.820
the reason that I bring this up is this is a teachable moment because there's so

356
00:21:44.821 --> 00:21:49.380
many people right now in the Trump administration, uh, who go look,

357
00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.160
this guy has too much power. Uh, he's abusing it against immigrants.

358
00:21:53.161 --> 00:21:54.810
He's abusing it against domestic opponents.

359
00:21:54.811 --> 00:21:58.830
He's doing whatever he's trying to hurt political rivals in the next election,

360
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.250
all of this stuff. And, you know, we can get into this stuff later if you want,

361
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:07.080
uh, in detail. But the bottom line is they're going, this is a guy, uh,

362
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.990
who's in the white house, who's throwing elbows, right? He doesn't really care.

363
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:15.000
He wants to hurt people as long as he can convince the Americans that those

364
00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:17.100
are the bad guys, right? That's the enemy.

365
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.600
It doesn't matter if they're far away.

366
00:22:18.601 --> 00:22:22.530
It doesn't matter if they're close at home, um, whoever he's against,

367
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.393
he's gonna harm.

368
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.260
And the dark thing is this is actually why he was elected,

369
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:33.510
um, in moments of fear where the world starts falling apart.

370
00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.240
And this happens in authoritarian country after country. Uh,

371
00:22:36.241 --> 00:22:39.180
this is why you have Latimer Putin in Russia.

372
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.030
Who's been there for 20 years, right?

373
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.110
Present for basically 20 years. Think about that. Uh, you know,

374
00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:50.790
he sort of skipped in the middle there, uh, because he had to Dodge,

375
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.490
the fact that presidents can only serve so many consecutive terms.

376
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.740
So he dropped down to prime minister and they came back as president.

377
00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:00.270
But I think about that. How do you get that kind of political LUNGevity?

378
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.720
And it's because if you know anything about Russian history, which, you know,

379
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.980
even, I don't know that much about it.

380
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:09.090
The nineties after the collapse of the Soviet union were an extraordinarily dark

381
00:23:09.091 --> 00:23:13.710
time. If you look at Russian cinema, all they had were gangster movies, right?

382
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.430
All they had were the disintegration of society, how things are dark and broken,

383
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.370
no one trusts. Each other pensions were no longer being paid.

384
00:23:20.371 --> 00:23:23.880
Social security is not there anymore. Like there's nothing to buy.

385
00:23:23.881 --> 00:23:28.590
There's nothing to do. There's no job, no one had a future. And so they went,

386
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.570
if there's somebody who can lead us out of this,

387
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.130
if there's somebody who will fix this,

388
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.730
who will find us an enemy and defeat that enemy to restore prosperity,

389
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:40.560
we'll put them in office. We see it happen in Turkey with Irvine, right? Uh,

390
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:44.880
we've seen it happen, uh, successively with bad governments, even in Western,

391
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.340
uh, democracies. We see it happening sadly, um,

392
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:54.260
in places like Poland and Hungary, uh, you can even argue it's happening, uh,

393
00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:58.250
in the United Kingdom, right? And now there are a lot of people arguing.

394
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.430
That's exactly what we're seeing with Donald Trump's white house, uh,

395
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.810
in the United States.

396
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.190
And this is the lesson that we didn't learn from 2001

397
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:12.950
is when we become fearful, we become vulnerable, right?

398
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:16.760
Uh, to anyone who promises, they will make things better.

399
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:18.890
Even if they have no ability to make things better,

400
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.540
even if they will actively make things worse,

401
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:25.490
even if they will make things better for themselves and their bodies by taking

402
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:26.324
from you.

403
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:31.580
But if they tell you that they'll make things better and you believe them

404
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.710
in a moment of fear, uh, that that typically leads to unfortunate outcomes. So,

405
00:24:36.711 --> 00:24:37.190
sorry, let me,

406
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.300
let me turn this back over to you because we got way off track there. No,

407
00:24:40.301 --> 00:24:40.780
that's all right.
