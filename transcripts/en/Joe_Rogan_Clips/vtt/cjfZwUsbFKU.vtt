00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.560
<v 1>Experience. I got, I got an old lady's story, but we lived at the barracks.</v>

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.400
There's 14 comedians living in that place in Howard square.

4
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:10.160
I don't know if you ever came by. Cause it was pretty high.

5
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.980
What was the barracks?

6
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.400
The barracks was an apartment that Mike and I had and we opened this.

7
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.920
Oh God, it was eighties, you know, in the beginning,

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.350
you know when one standable. So it was probably before my day I came in in 88.

9
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.030
Uh, no. So 85 and by Mike you're saying Mike Clark's brother. Yeah. Right.

10
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.110
So we had this house and it was like three or four bedrooms in

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.990
Kenny Rogersons room, which was like a closet with a sheet over. We,

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.043
we referred to it,

13
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.700
the sperm room and Kenny &lt;laugh&gt; and we had the rent was

14
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:43.140
$165 a month. Wow.

15
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:46.380
The landlord's name was wing won and we were working at the ding hall for sh

16
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.580
Lee. So 165 bucks between sometimes 10 guys. We didn't have it. You know,

17
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:51.660
we were blowing it already.

18
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.780
&lt;laugh&gt; so now every comedian who came in from out of town,

19
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:56.500
they didn't have to get a hotel. You just go by the back.

20
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.180
Cause there was a key under the mat at the end,

21
00:00:58.181 --> 00:00:59.940
there was like 11 keys under the mat.

22
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.850
But there was this old lady store on the third floor apartment.

23
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.850
And we would rage all night. I would break windows.

24
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.410
I just love the sound of breaking glass. We had a window guy on call, you know,

25
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.290
&lt;laugh&gt; people say it's freezing Lenny. Oh, call the window guy. You know,

26
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:17.250
I just love to throw things from glass sweet. I sweetie ducked.

27
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.010
And I,

28
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.650
I put a ball through the window and he's laid on the floor and I go sweet.

29
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:23.760
What's wrong with you? I'm just up and funny. He goes, don't talk down to me.

30
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:27.320
I go, were you lying on the floor? Get up. You know? So now this woman,

31
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.840
she older woman, she goes, I said, Hey, I hate Youlen Clark. I hate you. I said,

32
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.200
listen, I'm going to the store. You want me to get you anything?

33
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.680
And she yelled at the top. Let clock. I only lived to see you dead. Right.

34
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.190
&lt;laugh&gt; and all the names every day left. Oh Joe,

35
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.750
it gets worse. So now, you know, I sent the flowers every now and then,

36
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:51.590
and she throw 'em off the balcony. Cause I don't want your fly. I want you dead.

37
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.590
So she ends up getting murdered. Oh no.

38
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.150
Like cut up in like the capitated. Oh yeah. Yeah. So,

39
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.500
so the cops come to the house one day and I, I laying in my bed,

40
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.500
puking in a bucket and Rogerson comes in and he wakes me. Did,

41
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.420
did you murder the lady next door? Last time I go. No, he goes, okay.

42
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:15.620
You can come in. &lt;laugh&gt; the cops come in.

43
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.940
They go Lenny. No, we don't think it was. We gotta ask you questions,

44
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.460
but where were you last night? I go, I don't remember. I go, but,

45
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.130
but I know I got here later, worked out.

46
00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:28.770
I was at the ding and then I hung out.

47
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:31.490
We hung after hours and I don't know where it was, but then I get home.

48
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.730
But you know that woman get there. I don't think they ever saw the case,

49
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.050
but it definitely wasn't me. Cuz I was too lazy to walk three flights of stairs.

50
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.610
We used to, we used to have police cars park in her, her pocket space.

51
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:45.320
She didn't have a, but we'd have the Patty wagon down below being doing ball.

52
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:48.120
It's crazy. So you'd have the cops come over and party with him. Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:50.760
That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Most of 'em got thrown off and forth. They,

54
00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:54.120
they never solved. They never solved that case. As far as I know, you know,

55
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.560
there.

56
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.240
<v 0>Was a guy that I used to train with who, uh, got arrested.</v>

57
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.720
I don't know if you remember this case, but they, they were,

58
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.360
they took this guy and they were breaking his bones with a hammer and then

59
00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:07.920
injecting with cocaine to keep him awake. Cuz he was,

60
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.640
he was blacking out from the pain. Oh. And they cut his hands off.

61
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:14.440
They cut his head off, they cut everything off. And uh,

62
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.880
this dude that I knew got arrested for it. And uh,

63
00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:19.070
when I asked him him about it,

64
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.310
he knew something like it was one of those things where like, you know,

65
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.750
you asked someone like I go, they arrested you. I go, why would they arrest you?

66
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.150
And it was like this, I don't know. I don't know nothing. I was like, oh,

67
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:34.990
you know something &lt;laugh&gt; I was like, holy. I was like, oh my God.

68
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.070
I might know a serious murder. Oh yeah. Yeah.

69
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.300
He went to jail for something else. I forget what he went to jail.

70
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.220
I knew him when I was 16 and he went to jail and then he came out and when he

71
00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:50.020
came out, like all his tattoos, he had scars all over all of his tattoos.

72
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.220
Like apparently he tried to burn his tattoos off in the joint.

73
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.620
And he was like just a different person,

74
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.260
like his time in jail.

75
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.530
And I guess he was in jail for like maybe a five years from when I knew him.

76
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.090
Wow. And he came out five years later and started training again before he got

77
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.810
arrested and um,

78
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.690
just super spooky to be around somebody that you think might have

79
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:14.524
done that. No.

80
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.090
<v 1>I, I, I know a, a few murderers that yeah. Yeah. I,</v>

81
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.640
I didn't know at the time when I met them, but over the years have gone.

82
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.560
Oh my well, the guy who got the, the pass Johnny Manano was in 16 minutes.

83
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.400
He shops at stop and shop in Somerville and people go, you know what that is?

84
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.800
I go, Johnny man, hi Lenny. I went, oh, Hey Johnny 25 murder. And,

85
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.120
and you know, how's he out? Uh, deals, you know?

86
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.070
I mean he did time. He did a time, but he was on 60,

87
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.950
not 20 on you seems like you should be in, send the bull.

88
00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:47.630
How many did send me the bull kill? And he was out,

89
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.350
he was out the met in Arizona. I think he's still out. Yeah, he is.

90
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.230
He's out again. Yeah. I mean, I got no beef for him. I don't either.

91
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.390
So one of my buddies, uh, in high school, his name was Bob good.

92
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:00.990
He was the funniest, funniest person I ever met my life.

93
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.620
Da one day he stole 12 cots, 12 red cots and lined them up outside.

94
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.420
And in one of the cots, there was a briefcase full of cash.

95
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.500
And he went in and he bought the entire lunchroom lunch lunches on me.

96
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.420
&lt;laugh&gt; and high school. Right. Lunches on me.

97
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.300
Stole cots in high stole cots. Oh yeah. And he lined them up outside you.

98
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.650

103
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.850
You're not gonna be released. And I went, oh, let me change my clothes.

104
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.810
So I changed my clothes.

105
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.440
I went in and I did this show and it was really so they would swab you.

109
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.480
And this is like 35 years ago. Right. So, and this was when,

110
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.640
while Paul was still maximum secur, you know, I mean the worst or the worst.

111

So we go in and uh, I'm with DJ and a couple of people, DJ has DJ has it.

00:06:07.081 --> 00:06:11.000
And I think swing how's he doing? I don't, I think there was a cancer thing.

118
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.900
I could that be well, anyway, he gets out and then he,

119
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.220
he murders some guy &lt;laugh&gt; and he goes back and he's in for double life.

120
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.540
Now two murders. And I said to him, Papa, why'd you kill the guy? He goes,

121
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.820
he was talking. You know, &lt;laugh&gt;, he's just a little bit of a guy, but funny.

122
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.620
I mean, he's the type of guy. Someone wanted to kick his.

123
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.140
He can make them laugh. So you couldn't punch him. He was that funny.

124
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.090
And now he's in, he's been in for, I, I wanna visit him. You know, they said,

125
00:06:58.091 --> 00:07:00.170
it's not a good idea, but I'm gonna go visit him. You know,

126
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.970
I'm not look old now, but he's been, he's been over 30 years now. It's.

127
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.690
<v 0>So funny. How, if you're in the nightclub business, like we are,</v>

128
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.570
you're gonna run into people along the way that have done some horrible.

129
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.410
Oh &lt;laugh&gt;.

130
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.703
<v 1>Oh,</v>

131
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.840
I know a guy shot a guy's head off with a saw. I,

132
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.400
I think a sword, you know,

133
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.560
one of those like summarized swords and then threw it on a,

134
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.880
on a guy's lawn. I mean, yeah. Yeah. It was, there was drugs involved. I mean,

135
00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:35.760

136
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.400

137
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.790
free base watching the Spanish crack. That was, that was for people with money.

138
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.310

141
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.510

I mean,

146
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.900
I'm so high I'm passing and all I could hear is what are we gonna do with the
