1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So, uh, the kettlebell,</v>

2
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:05.910
you bring this thing everywhere you.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.550
<v 1>Go. Literally ever. I do. I, I, uh, I lived overseas and I started it.</v>

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.760
You know, I started it. I had a, um,

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.770
696 pound guy come to the farm, uh,

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.500
six years ago and he wanted to,

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.010
he wanted to help losing weight and I helped them, uh, over 18 months,

8
00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:28.010
get down to 265 pounds. Wow.

9
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.050
And one of the methods I used to motivate him was I said, as you lose weight,

10
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.310
I'll carry weight.

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.200
And eventually I was carrying a hundred pound sandbag fast forward,

12
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.820
and we can get into it.

13
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.720
I moved overseas with my family and I tried to carry that a hundred pound

14
00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:48.050
sandbag because I had made that commitment to them and they wouldn't let it

15
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:52.940
through TSA. So when I landed in, in Asia, I asked my wife,

16
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:54.590
I said, Hey, could you order a 20 count?

17
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.290
It's stupid that I'm carrying a sandbag. Can you order a 20 pound kettlebell?

18
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.170
I'll just carry a 20 pound around. So I'm not a complete fraud.

19
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.520
And she confused pounds with kilograms.

20
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.990
And I ended up with a 44 pounder and it just became my shtick, my thing.

21
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.550
So.

22
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.490
<v 0>When you say you carry it everywhere, when you me go everywhere with it.</v>

23
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.740
<v 1>I go everywhere with it. So what were you doing over there?</v>

24
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:19.760
Why were you there for a year? So, um, after I helped that, that, uh,

25
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.430
guy lose that weight, uh, how did.

26
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.760
<v 0>You do that? By the way he lost a fortune, your pounds?</v>

27
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.070
<v 1>Uh, yeah. Close to it. So 18 months, that's amazing. It was amazing,</v>

28
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.700
but you're not going to be, we may be at odds on this, but I went, um,

29
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.410
and I'll tell you why we went raw fruits and vegetables only. And, um,

30
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.970
here's a guy that was eating eight,

31
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.410
eight egg McMuffins a day for breakfast and two, two liter sprites.

32
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.620
Right. So he gets the balloons to 696 pounds.

33
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.750
<v 0>How long did it take him to get that big, to get back to no, as big as he was.</v>

34
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.960
<v 2>Um, he, you know, when he, when he, yeah, when he.</v>

35
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.180
<v 1>Left, he said he was crying. He said to me,</v>

36
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.810
it was a first time as far as I can remember where I fit in one airplane seat.

37
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.040
Oh. So this was, this was over a long period of time, but he, um,

38
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.130
we did raw fruits and vegetables. And then we did it.

39
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.970
We started with a 10 mile hike every day, 10 miles every day, every day.

40
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.200
And then, and then it went to 20, she went to 10 in the morning, 10 at night,

41
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.520
raw fruits and vegetables.

42
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:23.240
And we got to a point where he was losing two to three pounds a day that.

43
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.960
<v 0>10 And 10 is that is, that's a long hike. And a lot of time,</v>

44
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.100
like how much time was that taken?

45
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.100
<v 1>He gave up work. He worked for Comcast.</v>

46
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:35.090
They were kind enough to say you're on leave. Um, I CA I covered the expenses,

47
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:39.050
which was like two stalks of celery and a glass of water every day.

48
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.840
There was not, you know, it wasn't much of an expense. And, um,

49
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.790
and he spent the whole day basically hiking.

50
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.180
<v 0>So he hiked all day. And what kept them motivated,</v>

51
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:49.360
just this idea that he was going to lose weight.

52
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.480
<v 1>At the other end, I took his keys. I took his wallet and he had no plan. Like,</v>

53
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.630
what was he going to do? How was he gonna get out? So he, where was this?

54
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.850
And we have a farm in Vermont. So we, we had them on lock and key.

55
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.590
How did you know this guy before this?

56
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.300
I got a phone call that somebody had just finished one of our Spartan events

57
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.440
that was extremely overweight and showed me the photo. And I said,

58
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.620
get in touch with this guy right away. This is our Jared, this is our subway,

59
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.810
uh, star. I want to say January. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Right. You remember?

60
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.760
So, so, um, got in touch with him and he, and he, and he said, game on. Wow.

61
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.290
<v 0>That's amazing. It was amazing. So he completed the race at 600 pounds. He.</v>

62
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.150
<v 1>Was tricked, he was told that it was a, a 5k walk with, uh, so,</v>

63
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.600
so normally that 5k Spartan would take,

64
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:41.980
let's say 90 minutes for the average person, he took seven hours. So, uh,

65
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.670
tricked into it, fought through. It probably would have never come back.

66
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.400
But then I found out about them, called him and said, Hey,

67
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.280
you're invited to the farm. I want to help you do that. We document it.

68
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.600
We actually, wow. So you didn't know this guy at all before this didn't know.

69
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.440
That's incredible.

70
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.600
<v 0>So you just looked at it as, okay. This is a project.</v>

71
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.590
<v 1>Yeah. I, I tend to, um, I liked broken wingers.</v>

72
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.330
<v 0>So this guy, you find this guy he's 600 plus pounds.</v>

73
00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:10.320
You whittle them down to what'd you say 2 60, 2 65. He's a big fellow already.

74
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.183
Must be, right?

75
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.370
<v 1>Yeah. You got to see that.</v>

76
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.070
I probably could find the photo of the pants that he wore coming in

77
00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:19.260
versus the pants he left with. I mean,

78
00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:20.940
you could fit three people in the pair of pants.

79
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.710
<v 0>How did you organize his diet?</v>

80
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.660
<v 1>So, so, um,</v>

81
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.160
I didn't tell you when I was a kid on one hand was ravioli's granolas and guns.

82
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.640
On the other hand, my mom got into yoga, meditation, health, food. She was like,

83
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:37.350
Bohemian, crunchy. You were working for the mom. Your mom was a yoga. Yeah.

84
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.490
Yo had monks in the living room. Very embarrassing. So,

85
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.710
and the reason that happened was because her mom died of cancer and she walked

86
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:49.140
into a health food store to kind of figure things out.

87
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.510
This is like in the seventies,

88
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.700
it's probably one health food store in New York at the time.

89
00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:54.570
There's no yoga journal.

90
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.960
<v 0>People don't even know what a health food store is. Now. Let's just say health,</v>

91
00:04:57.961 --> 00:04:59.850
food store. They look at you like, what are you talking? Health food.

92
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.930
<v 1>It was, it was incense burning. That's exactly right. So she walks in,</v>

93
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:08.760
there happens to be an elderly Yogi that just landed in JFK from

94
00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:13.560
India in the health food store. She strikes up a conversation with this.

95
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:18.150
Yogi changes our whole life, right. Comes home, throws away sausage peppers,

96
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.310
eggplant, parts, all out of the house. Wow.

97
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.960
Parents get divorced for obvious reasons.

98
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.370
He's going to go on a different direction.

99
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.830
And I am trying my best for the next 10 years to have my friends not come

100
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:32.400
over because I'm embarrassed. Right. There's like Indian pictures on the wall.

101
00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:36.750
There's beads, there's chanting, there's monks, and I want to be a gangster.

102
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.750
And so, um, yeah, so, so anyway,

103
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:45.960
so she maybe through just repetition would,

104
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.760
would just instill this idea that, um, you gotta eat healthy.

105
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.460
You know, you got to get on real foods. We're going to go vegan, all the,

106
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.820
all the things that are somewhat popular now. And, uh, you gotta do,

107
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.920
and you got to sweat every day, cold showers way before Wim Hoff,

108
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:03.440
like she was into the cold showers. Oh my God.

109
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.470
This was like proper food combining, um, uh,

110
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.950
this idea of intermittent fasting. We were fat. My mom,

111
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.960
my mom fasted for 30 days. Okay. This is back in the seventies while meditating.

112
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.810
So, so, um, so anyway.

113
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.160
<v 0>You were at home while she was doing that.</v>

114
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.620
<v 1>My grandfather, her,</v>

115
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.400
her father had to come to the house and rip her out of the room.

116
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.630
Cause he thought she was gonna die.

117
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.390
Like she was getting thin and she sitting and meditating,

118
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.210
she was pretty extreme. And, and um,

119
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.190
and so I had to balance these two things like, like, and so, yeah,

120
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.540
I guess what I do now is, is, uh, a little tough guy, a little yoga,

121
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.920
I guess that's what it is, but this guy's diet. Yeah. So it came from my mom.

122
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.221
<v 0>Right.</v>

123
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:51.310
But you're dealing with a man who obviously has an extreme health condition.

124
00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:52.330
He's morbidly obese.

125
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.530
Like how do you know how many calories to give him what's healthy, what's safe.

126
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.050
Like how, how do you know how to proceed there?

127
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.120
<v 1>There's doctors listening. They're probably gonna, um, say that I'm crazy.</v>

128
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.840
But, and then I'll answer the question more succinctly.

129
00:07:07.841 --> 00:07:11.860
Mom introduced me to a guy named Dr. Fred beachy. You could look him up.

130
00:07:11.861 --> 00:07:12.910
He's 92.

131
00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:17.590
Now he decides 55 years ago that he's only going to eat raw fruits and

132
00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:21.010
vegetables. That's it. He there's an Italian guy that was a weightlifter.

133
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.530
He's only gonna eat raw fruits and veggies. And he's gonna,

134
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.730
he's gonna test on himself like a Guinea pig. Does it work? Or doesn't it work?

135
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:30.490
Is this the best diet or not? I'm just going to test it on myself. He says.

136
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.410
And what he finds is that it feels better. All the things that,

137
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.950
um, people agree or don't agree with. So, um,

138
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.230
I wasn't necessarily knowing that and meeting Dr. Beachy

139
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.430
and seeing my mom and her, I wasn't necessarily into like how many calories.

140
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.990
It was just like, if you eat good, healthy food, that's ultra processed food.

141
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.620
Um, you're not going to starve yourself, meet what you need.

142
00:07:56.621 --> 00:08:00.340
You could eat 40 salads. I don't really care. It was my message to the guy. Um,

143
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.400
but you're not going to, you get tired of salad, right?

144
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.410
Once you're tired or salad, then you want the other thing.

145
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:07.990
Then you want to go to have a cookie. But if you could only eat salad,

146
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.270
you're never going to eat overeat salad.

147
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.220
So all he's eating is fruits and salads, fruits,

148
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.340
and fruits and veggies that says raw, everything, raw, everything we're on,

149
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:20.200
not cooked because, because the theory was, if you cook it, you kill it. And,

150
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.470
um, I don't know how many months into it we are,

151
00:08:23.471 --> 00:08:27.130
but he's probably down to 350 pounds, 400 pounds. And he says to me,

152
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.460
I got to go to the doctor. And I said, what are you, what are you talking about?

153
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.510
I got to get my liver. Liver levels checked. You're not a doctor.

154
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.270
And I'm really worried. You got me on this ridiculous diet.

155
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:42.100
And I looked at him and I said, you stupid. I said,

156
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.960
you were eating eight egg McMuffins every day and drinking two,

157
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:45.761
two liters sprites.

158
00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:48.730
How many times did you get your liver levels checked when you were doing that?

159
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.060
You're worried about eating fruits and vegetables that that's up your liver.

160
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.210
Anyway, I talked him out of it and, and he stuck it out. But we would have,

161
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.310
we would have battles like that. He was in agony, oh, pain, serious pain,

162
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:02.990
and.

163
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.870
<v 0>Losing that much body when your body's probably freaking the out.</v>

164
00:09:05.871 --> 00:09:08.120
Like we can't do this. Think of sustainable.

165
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.760
<v 1>This is like a 300. And this is a 720 degree turn for him from,</v>

166
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:12.530
from what he was. Did.

167
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.920
<v 0>You ever hear about that guy? Um, we, we brought it up a few times.</v>

168
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.790
Was it in the sixties champion or the guy who'd he fasted for a whole year?

169
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:24.470
He did just vitamin drips and he was enormously obese and he just did vitamin

170
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:26.300
drips and fasted for a whole year.

171
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:31.160
But the crazy thing about it was he didn't get stretched out.

172
00:09:31.161 --> 00:09:34.640
His body absorbed the skin. I mean,

173
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:37.640
maybe it's just his personal genetics. You know, like some women,

174
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.280
they get pregnant, they have massive stretch, marks other women,

175
00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:43.820
they snap right back, like a rubber band. It's there's no rhyme or reason.

176
00:09:43.821 --> 00:09:47.930
It seems to be genetic. But this man who was really fat,

177
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.320
he lost all this weight, but he lost it everywhere.

178
00:09:51.321 --> 00:09:54.260
Like his skin came back normal sized.

179
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.850
He didn't have to have any of his skin removed.

180
00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.380
<v 1>I would, I would bet if it wasn't genetic and unique to him,</v>

181
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.760
I've, I've done very long distance races where we had limited food.

182
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.100
And I've read about people that have been stuck at sea.

183
00:10:07.101 --> 00:10:11.870
Let's say for 72 days and their teeth get extremely white and their

184
00:10:11.871 --> 00:10:15.320
skin get, you know, if they're not getting sunburned gets beautiful. I think,

185
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.690
I think I'm speculating. I'm not a doctor.

186
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.610
Your body eats any excess. So I'm making that up.

187
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.750
I don't know if that's, that.

188
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.290
<v 0>Might be it because, I mean, if you, if, obviously we're both morons, but yeah.</v>

189
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.650
If you think about this guy's skin,

190
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.410
that's the thing that always happened. I mean,

191
00:10:33.411 --> 00:10:38.210
I've had friends that lost a ton of weight and they would have these big flaps

192
00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:41.270
of skin. He had it and they wanted to get it removed.

193
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.820
But this guy didn't this guy, um,

194
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.800
his whole body shrunk was this sub Dom D'Agostino T T told us

195
00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:50.630
about this or was this someone.

196
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:55.400
<v 1>I recall them, but I'm looking for pictures to see. I heard about it.</v>

197
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.900
Yeah. I heard about.

198
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.640
<v 0>It. That was the fascinating part of the story to me was a whoa, like this guy,</v>

199
00:11:01.641 --> 00:11:05.270
not only did he live off of his fat and Ivy vitamin drips,

200
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.140
that's what he took for a whole year. So you lived off of his fat,

201
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.640
his body had, you know, hundreds and hundreds of pounds of fat to lose.

202
00:11:13.641 --> 00:11:17.720
He lost it all, but that his skin shrank was fascinating to me. I'm like, man,

203
00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:20.780
if we could convince people to try that. Yeah. But, but again,

204
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.210
I don't know if that's the healthiest way to do it. I mean,

205
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.570
what kind of long-term damage you're doing, if any.

206
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.820
<v 1>So I'm, I'm a believer again,</v>

207
00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:33.770
no scientific that I go back to like ancient times and I say to myself,

208
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.300
we never had an abundance of food.

209
00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:39.590
You and I couldn't walk into a grocery store and have access to if we had food,

210
00:11:39.591 --> 00:11:44.210
we had food. And so, um, I would think our stomachs,

211
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.450
uh, and our digestive system, uh, needs time.

212
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.610
It's not used to just constantly taking food on demand or wake up coffee

213
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.060
doughnut. Like I don't think our stomachs are made for that.

214
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:58.630
So I don't know about fasting for a whole year. That's a different right.

215
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.550
<v 0>Also you have to get to that crazy state to be able to do that.</v>

216
00:12:02.551 --> 00:12:06.210
You've already abused your body to the point where you're hundreds and hundreds

217
00:12:06.211 --> 00:12:10.200
of pounds overweight. I mean that that's not normal anyway.

218
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.540
That's tough one that doesn't even like you,

219
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:15.720
you want to go back to hunters and gatherers that wasn't even possible. No.

220
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.090
<v 1>No. They wouldn't have been able to do that. I mean, uh,</v>

221
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.480
and he was probably laying in a bed and probably not very active. Right?

222
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.050
<v 0>Yeah. So this guy, you just say,</v>

223
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.100
you're just going to eat as much salad as you want and as much fruit as you

224
00:12:29.101 --> 00:12:30.570
want, but that's it, that's it.

225
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.660
And just by doing that and these long walks and how,

226
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.600
how long have these walks taken? You're doing 10 mile hike.

227
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.000
<v 1>Well, in the, in the, in the, in the beginning, as you could imagine,</v>

228
00:12:39.001 --> 00:12:43.080
those were really long hikes, right. And, and probably, you know,

229
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.650
two miles an hour, so five hours to get that done.

230
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:50.490
But as he lost weight and he got more fit, he hustled and, and on the farm,

231
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.210
on our farm in Vermont, it's hilly. So I could either send them on, you know,

232
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.280
through the fields which we did in the beginning,

233
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.550
but eventually now he's climbing mountains too. And, um,

234
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.780
and then I started adding weight.

235
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.110
Now he's gotta carry it the little 10 pound sand bag and a 20 pound sand bag.

236
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:04.891
So, uh,

237
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:09.210
we just kept upping the ante as his body adapted to what we were doing to him.

238
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.290
Um, and he just kept boom kept taking off weight. Wow.

239
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.840
<v 0>Yeah. And so after 18 months to let them have a case, no, they're not let.</v>

240
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.440
<v 1>Him have a cake, but I'll tell you what somebody heard about what I did.</v>

241
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.440
And this guy shows up number two,

242
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:30.240
we'll call him and he's 300 pounds and he wants to get to 200. And I said,

243
00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:33.210
all right, head up the mountain. You're going to sleep in the cabin.

244
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.700
Cause I just went through all that time with the other guy.

245
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.880
And we're going to be much more efficient here. First week,

246
00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:41.160
you're only eating apples and a clean out your system.

247
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.990
I gave him giant bushel of apples, put them on top of the mountain. 30 days,

248
00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:50.940
we had them down to 200 pounds. And what, 30 days, almost 100 pounds,

249
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.920
30 days that seems scary, scary hiking, raw fruits and vegetables. And,

250
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.990
um, here's a guy that was sedentary,

251
00:13:57.991 --> 00:14:02.070
a truck driver and not really moving around much, uh, eating foods. I mean,

252
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:04.530
it's not rocket science, right? You eat food. You're not active.

253
00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:08.850
You're gaining weight, uh, good food. You're very active. You lose weight. And,

254
00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:11.310
and um, his girlfriend picks him up.

255
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.560
It's 30 days and they leave the farm unbeknownst to me and they go straight to

256
00:14:16.561 --> 00:14:20.880
Ben and Jerry's, and he put on like 18 pounds in.

257
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.780
<v 2>A day. Right. So.</v>

258
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.530
<v 1>I mean, there's psychological issues that I, that's not what I'm fixing. Um,</v>

259
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.240
I'm doing the physical part.

260
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.690
<v 0>Well, I got to think that a person willing to do 18 months.</v>

261
00:14:33.691 --> 00:14:36.990
Is that what you said with that gentleman hung in for awhile the 18 months?

262
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.450
Is this just psychologically?

263
00:14:39.451 --> 00:14:42.000
You're building up some pretty spectacular endurance. Yeah.

264
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.890
Just fro raw fruits and vegetables for 18 months and hiking 20 hours a day.

265
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.220
I mean, you're putting some miles on your mind there. I mean, that's,

266
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.800
that's strengthening that,

267
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.610
that muscle of discipline in a way that he probably had never done in this one.

268
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:56.170
He.

269
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.670
<v 1>Got tough. He, um,</v>

270
00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.660
he finished a big event with us was that was like the big moment for him at the

271
00:15:01.661 --> 00:15:06.070
end. And, uh, gotten, uh, gotten a single seat in an airplane when he left,

272
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.820
got a girlfriend, like stuff, stuff started to come together for him.

273
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.550
<v 0>So does he maintained? He.</v>

274
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.670
<v 1>Gained, he was at 2 65 at our best. And, and uh,</v>

275
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.580
my latest understanding is it three 50? He bounced.

276
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.510
<v 3>Back better than 6 96. Yeah. But.</v>

277
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.690
<v 0>A hundred leads to 200. What did he do differently?</v>

278
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.801
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

279
00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:29.620
you come off the raw fruits and veggies and you stop walking 20 miles a day,

280
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.220
but then you slip a cake in here and there. Right.

281
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.751
<v 0>You gotta suck though.</v>

282
00:15:34.751 --> 00:15:37.780
Like you get them down to like this really amazing weight.

283
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:39.940
<v 1>You got to see. I mean, what am I going to do?</v>

284
00:15:39.941 --> 00:15:41.080
I can't keep all these people on the.

285
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.210
<v 0>Farm. Right? No, but still.</v>

286
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.120
<v 1>You get them there. And then they gotta, they gotta fly. They gotta do it.</v>

287
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.790
<v 0>Yeah. That sucks that you, you,</v>

288
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.030
you got that far and then you see him put a hundred pounds.

289
00:15:52.031 --> 00:15:53.290
How long did it take him to put a hundred pounds?

290
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.050
<v 1>I'm sure it was a 90 a hundred days,</v>

291
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.210
but they snap back. I mean, it's that pendulum swing, right? Like, oh my God,

292
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:04.570
I get regular food. Now I don't have to hike as much anymore. I mean,

293
00:16:04.571 --> 00:16:07.210
I'm a believer. I don't know if you are. I'm a believer.

294
00:16:07.211 --> 00:16:11.260
The number one motivator for human beings is the avoidance of discomfort. Right?

295
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:14.320
Because if we didn't avoid discomfort, we'd freeze in the snow.

296
00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:16.060
We'd fall off a cliff. We'd get caught, right?

297
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.170
So we're always constantly even subconsciously avoiding discomfort.

298
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:25.390
And, uh, to be healthy, you gotta be uncomfortable. You gotta train,

299
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.510
you gotta eat healthy. Those are hard things go to bed early, not drink as much.

300
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:33.550
And so, um, unless somebody is holding you accountable or unless you're like,

301
00:16:33.551 --> 00:16:36.550
obviously you're a high performer. I'm a bit of a maniac in that.

302
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:41.080
Like I'm more uncomfortable if I'm not, if I'm not optimal,

303
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.870
if I'm not being my best. Right? But most people that's not,

304
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.273
that's not the goal.

305
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.480
<v 0>Well, you have to kind of make your mind into</v>

306
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.620
your mind, has to seek discomfort.

307
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.280
It has to seek these difficult tasks. You have to enjoy it.

308
00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.610
And you have to figure out a way to make your mind, enjoy those things.

309
00:17:00.611 --> 00:17:03.340
And some people comes easy and some people, it doesn't. Some people,

310
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.750
some people, it takes a long time.

311
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.170
I always tell people the best thing you could ever do is force yourself to a

312
00:17:08.171 --> 00:17:12.490
schedule. Just write it down today. I have to do an hour on the treadmill.

313
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.640
I have to do an hour, no matter what, even if you're walking on it,

314
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.880
what you're doing an hour on a treadmill the next time you do want to do it

315
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:19.990
just, okay,

316
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.260
you did an hour and this is the amount of miles you got in next time,

317
00:17:23.261 --> 00:17:25.260
you're going to add three miles, put,

318
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.230
put an extra three miles in that one hour and just keep doing things like that.

319
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.210
Write down today, I'm going to do 100 pushups.

320
00:17:31.211 --> 00:17:34.270
I'm going to do 100 sit-ups and I'm gonna do a hundred chin-ups that's today.

321
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.950
And then force yourself, force yourself to adhere to a schedule, make a Monday,

322
00:17:38.951 --> 00:17:42.550
Wednesday, Friday, workout schedule, give yourself some time off, you know,

323
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.880
like don't, don't even crush yourself to the point where you can't do it,

324
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.760
make it so that you really appreciate those Tuesdays and Thursdays.

325
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.080
But on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, you're going to get after it.

326
00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:53.070
And this is what you're going to do.

327
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.930
Most people just try to go work out and you're kind of aimless and you show up.

328
00:17:57.931 --> 00:18:00.420
And like, when you pick up the jump rope and you drunk a little rope,

329
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.150
maybe hit the heavy bag a little bit. Maybe you do some curls,

330
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.100
but you don't really have an aim. You know?

331
00:18:05.101 --> 00:18:07.560
And that's why people like to hire trainers because the trainer will tell you

332
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:11.790
what to do. Well, you can tell yourself what to do.

333
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.720
If you don't have money for a trainer, you don't even have to have equipment.

334
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.370
You know, with body weight, squats, sit ups, chin ups, pushups,

335
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.870
you can kick your.

336
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.030
You could give yourself a brutal full body, weight workout,

337
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.210
and you could find these for free on YouTube. There's a ton of them.

338
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.300
There's a ton of these body weight workouts you could do just force yourself,

339
00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:37.170
write it down Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I'm going to do a hundred pushups.

340
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.570
I'm going to do a hundred chin-ups I'm going to do a hundred sit-ups.

341
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.160
Even if it takes me all day,

342
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.790
even if I have to do 10 and 10 and 10 and keep going all day,

343
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.270
just that's what you do. Do 10 pushups. Take a break for 20 minutes.

344
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.470
Do another 10, but get those hundred in. Okay.
