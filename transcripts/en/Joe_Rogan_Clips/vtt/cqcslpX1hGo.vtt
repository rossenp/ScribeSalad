1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Have you talked to Chappelle about, um,</v>

2
00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:05.520
all the he got for.

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.160
<v 1>Now last a little bit, we'll text it back and forth. It's, you know, he's just,</v>

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.920
you know, riding out the storm,

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.160
like he's not a ho homophobic or transphobic person. He makes fun of himself.

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.030
There's a bit in that special about him getting molest it and

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:24.070
jerking off in a man's face. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. I mean,

8
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.910
this is or coming in a man's face that look it's fun.

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.470
It's just making jokes. That doesn't mean hate. This is the problem with today.

10
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.110
If you don't have an enemy, you make an enemy.

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.470
And this is a real problem with people. We,

12
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.620
we would look for things like if there's some people that really hated you and

13
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:48.420
they were the enemy, people that just joked around about stuff,

14
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:50.660
wouldn't be thought of as the enemy. It's like,

15
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:53.420
and as the level of people truly hate you drops,

16
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.020
you start looking for equilibrium and what you're upset about.

17
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.180
And so now you're more upset about jokes. Now silence is violence, and now,

18
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:03.970
you know, you can't just be this. You have to be that.

19
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.730
And it becomes this like weird control level. Where,

20
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.010
what people start to conflate you, you start,

21
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.490
when you start equating jokes with like real feelings. Well,

22
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.530
you they're they're, they're not the same thing. Well, I.

23
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.370
<v 0>Don't think that's what it is.</v>

24
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.450
I think they're trying to put different individuals or groups on a pedestal and

25
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.720
kind of make them sacred.

26
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.440
And you have someone comes along and knocks them up that pedestal.

27
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.520
All of a sudden, you're trying to undo what I'm trying to do,

28
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.560
which is to make this person holy. And now you are my enemy,

29
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.920
cuz your agenda is the opposite of mine.

30
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.240
<v 1>Fully agree. I was getting too bad. Sorry. Okay. No it's no, it's okay.</v>

31
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.480
You're right though. A hundred percent. But it's these, these ideas that,

32
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.510
that you can't make of are dangerous. They're not good for anybody.

33
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.990
They're not good for the people to hold those ideas,

34
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.590
whether it's about who you are or what you do.

35
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.790
The idea that no fun can be had about any of this is crazy.

36
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.950
Cuz the idea is that then all fun is done maliciously and out of hate.

37
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.710
And we know as friends that is just not.

38
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.420
<v 0>True. All my fun is malicious it's well, it's also.</v>

39
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.253
<v 1>Funny.</v>

40
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.660
It's funny if you and I were with each other and we're saying ridiculous to each

41
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:12.860
other, we would both be smiling. Yes. A hundred percent. Why we did it.

42
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.020
This is what roast battles all about my friend, Brian, Moses.

43
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.500
This is what a lot of what killed Tony's about like it's fun.

44
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:24.010
There's fun in making fun of each other and we have to accept. Yeah.

45
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.050
And then I need to know your real feelings about gay people,

46
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.570
your real feelings about trans people, your real feelings,

47
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:34.170
about all religions and all races and all ethnicities.

48
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.370
But we gotta be able to joke around about each other.

49
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.450
And if you get down to Dave, Chappelle's real feelings.

50
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.960
He's a lovely person. He's one of the nicest people I've ever meant in my life.

51
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.920
He loves everybody. He, he's not a hateful soul.

52
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.640
He's beyond jealous.

53
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.000
He's just a guy who loves this art form called

54
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.860
standup comedy.

55
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.680
And he tries to do his best navigating through this world of talking about

56
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.760
things and saying outrageous things that get huge laughs or

57
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.160
placating, really sensitive groups that feel like they're in a protected class.

58
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.800
And then the other people that pile onto that,

59
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:18.200
that also feel like this is a protected class and they equate any

60
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.190
jokes with hate. And this is where they're wrong.

61
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.630
Like I'm telling you that Dave Chappelle does not hate anyone or anything,

62
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.990
but he's not that person. He's his jokes are just that they're just jokes.

63
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.070
And if you really pay attention to what he's saying,

64
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.350
whether you agree with him or not in some of his jokes,

65
00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:38.310
like whether or not they're funny,

66
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.820
just really pay attention to the overall message. It is in no way,

67
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.620
transphobic. It's just not.

68
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.980
<v 0>But this is a way for low status people to try to compete with Dave and try to</v>

69
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:49.814
get on his level.

70
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.540
Because if I'm some kind of random journalist and I take down Dave Chappelle or

71
00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:55.620
Joe Rogan or somebody else,

72
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.050
this elevates my status in my rank and takes out a peg.

73
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.090
And that's used to me from an evolutionary point of.

74
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.530
<v 1>View. You're, you're absolutely right. You can't,</v>

75
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.210
can't be denied if you're a person and you're looking up at a guy like Dave

76
00:04:08.211 --> 00:04:11.650
Chappelle, he's at the highest of high levels. Right? You have, you know, you,

77
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.570
you have to also equate. You have to equate that in anything you,

78
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.610
you think about when you think about a guy like Dave Chappelle,

79
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.680
but then you also have to real realize that the problem is in

80
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.560
listening to everybody,

81
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.880
you're gonna get a certain group of people that want people to not be able to

82
00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:34.240
work anymore. They want to like stop you. They wanna pull things down.

83
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.400
They wanna change. Like what's available. You don't have to like it.

84
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.750
Like here's the thing about a Dave L look,

85
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.430
he's clearly the most popular comedian on planet earth, right?

86
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.493
He's number one.

87
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.950
He he's clearly one of the greatest comedians that's ever lived clearly.

88
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.470
So obviously a lot of people like him and what you want is

89
00:04:57.471 --> 00:05:00.510
people did not have access to him. Right? When you have options,

90
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.060
you don't have to like it.

91
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.260
But if you want Netflix to take it down and you say it's hateful,

92
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.940
this is, this is an incorrect way to do this.

93
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.500
If you wanna make your own special about what was wrong with Dave Chappelle

94
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:15.060
special on.

95
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.980
<v 0>YouTube with your monologue. Like Keith &lt;inaudible&gt;. Yeah, yeah, exactly.</v>

96
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.620
<v 1>Go, go for it. And good luck to you.</v>

97
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.530
And maybe you'll have a point that that person that you're criticizing can take

98
00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:25.570
into consideration and go.

99
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.890
Maybe I could do better at this because if something does bother you,

100
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.530
if someone says something ridiculous about you and it doesn't make any sense,

101
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.010
it doesn't have any effect on you. The things that bother people,

102
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.770
the things that are at least slightly accurate.

103
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.170
<v 0>But I think this just kind of speaks to what we're talking about earlier,</v>

104
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.760
how they're trying to have their be in the same way,

105
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.920
how intentionally or not it's trying to push everyone to be an Amazon or a

106
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.873
Walmart customer.

107
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.720
They are trying to have everyone only consume media through pre-approved

108
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:53.120
sources, right? That's a problem.

109
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.720
If you're not reading the New York times or CNN or the wall street or the

110
00:05:56.721 --> 00:06:00.160
Washington post or whatever, that means you're doing something wrong.

111
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.440
So this is what they're doing that process elimination by trying to funnel

112
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.800
people into certain outlets that they themselves can control.

113
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.880
And that creates uniformity and cohesion among the population.

114
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.440
<v 1>I think the problem is you create a journalistic version of the Streisand</v>

115
00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:15.080
effect. I think that's.

116
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.030
<v 0>The problem. Well, it's encouraging people to watch Chappelle.</v>

117
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.590
<v 1>Yeah. It's encouraging for sure that special's giant. Yeah. Oh yeah.</v>

118
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.390
For and all the controversy's only been good.

119
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:24.550
And then when people and the controversy.

120
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.390
<v 0>Is because it's not like he's Howard stern back in the day.</v>

121
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.910
<v 1>Well, it's not only that what he's saying in this he's telling about,</v>

122
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:34.910
he's telling a story about a real person that he was close with, that that died.

123
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.060
That became friends with him through comedy. There's a whole story to it.

124
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.460
I don't want to give it up cuz I think you should watch it special.

125
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.420
I toured with Dave, we did a lot of shows together.

126
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.620
It's this is his story that he had about this

127
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:54.940
person that he loved that died. It's not a, it is not a transphobic story,

128
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.490
but there's jokes in there. And in those J Oaks, he's poking fun at everything,

129
00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:01.290
including himself. I mean,

130
00:07:01.291 --> 00:07:05.170
this is a part of his act part of any comics act like there's there. It's,

131
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.570
there's a lot of it.

132
00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:09.850
That's just designed to be funny while he's telling a story.

133
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.770
And it's one of the things that Dave does so well,

134
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.290
he's like he tells these stories and he figures out a way to get his point

135
00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:19.800
across while being really funny. But, but when you're gonna be really funny,

136
00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:21.800
you're gonna make fun of yourself. You're gonna make fun of other people.

137
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.080
You're gonna make fun of everything that that's, but that doesn't.

138
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.640
<v 0>Equal hate. And that's not how men demonstrate camaraderie.</v>

139
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.720
Like coming from Brooklyn, you have the Jewish guy, the Italian guy,

140
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:30.600
you have the Puerto Rican guy,

141
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.520
you have the black guy everyone's busting each other's chops.

142
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.120
And that's how you symbolize that. You're comfortable with each other. Yes.

143
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.150
I'm safe with you by saying things that would get me in trouble in other

144
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:40.690
context.

145
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.350
And I trust you enough to know that you're not gonna use that in a bad way that

146
00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:45.230
we're all bros here.
