00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.320
It's harming fiction and harming literature that you can explore the darker

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:09.980
ideas, you know? Oh.

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.490
<v 1>You want to see me crucify myself right.</v>

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.400
<v 2>Now? Yeah. Okay. This.</v>

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.020
<v 1>Is kind of the, uh, career ending moment for, uh,</v>

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.880
for several years, I was in a writer's workshop and, uh,

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.760
the core group of us had been meeting since 1990.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.460
So this is a workshop that was almost 30 years old,

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.310
and gradually people were asking each

11
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:41.180
other, not to use certain words. Uh, first, you know,

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.830
nobody really used the N word,

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.610
but it was definitely a word you could not bring to workshop. And then I,

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.750
in a story, I used the word and a very good friend of mine said,

15
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.540
you're not bringing that word into workshop.

16
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.500
You're not writing anything with the F word. And,

17
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.600
and it just became more and more tightly structured that way.

18
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.940
And so eventually I realized we were kind of writing to make each other

19
00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:12.710
happy instead of, to kind of confront each other. And, uh,

20
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.970
one of the writers in our workshop is a writer named Cheryl strayed, who re,

21
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.510
who had written a book called wild, which was a hugely successful book.

22
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.280
It was chosen as an Oprah book and it will be on bookstore shelves for the

23
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:29.690
rest of history. Cheryl's book wild. But while she was writing it,

24
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.460
she had written a segment about how as a child,

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.560
she would be sat on the sofa with her grandfather and her

26
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.270
grandfather taught her how to him. And so as a child,

27
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:48.740
she would her grandfather until he achieved orgasm.

28
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.440
And then later she would find these featherless

29
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.870
featherless birds that had fallen out of a nest and she picked one

30
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:02.150
up and she knew it would die.

31
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.680
So she crushed it between her bare hands. This is a very small child.

32
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.200
And she wrote how as that bird died crushed between her

33
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:15.890
hands. It it's death rows.

34
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.570
It's spasms of death felt exactly like her grandfather's penis

35
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.480
in her little hand. Whoa,

36
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.590
that was the best thing she ever wrote.

37
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.533
And her editor,

38
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.550
Rick not said that is not going in this book because we

39
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:36.260
want this book to be a big book.

40
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.930
And if we see you jerking off your grandfather and then killing baby

41
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:46.550
birds, that is not going to make Oprah Winfrey happy.

42
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.070
So it was a magnificent piece of writing and a magnificent kind of

43
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:54.980
parallel and awareness for a child to have.

44
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.100
And this juxtaposition of sexual abuse and death, it was magnificent.

45
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.630
Oh my God, it worked on every level, but the publisher said,

46
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.620
this is not going to be in the book. Did she send it to you?

47
00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:10.590
Or did she show it to you? She brought her to work and she read it.

48
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.080
There was even a newspaper reporter, uh,

49
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.880
present there and we all realized it was fantastically powerful,

50
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.850
but then she said, uh, they won't take this, this can't go in.

51
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.400
This is not the first workshop I've been bumped out of.

52
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.680
The first workshop I was in was a very, a lot of very nice ladies.

53
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.150
And I was probably 28 and I had written a scene in which, uh,

54
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.770
a man, a young man has done up an inflatable sex doll.

55
00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:45.600
So it looks exactly like the woman he's obsessed with and during

56
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:48.660
the, the seduction of this sex doll,

57
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.620
he accidentally snags the back of it with the zipper of its dress.

58
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.840
And he realizes during the fornication that it is gradually losing

59
00:03:57.841 --> 00:03:58.674
air.

60
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.510
So he's got to copulate faster and faster to try to achieve orgasm

61
00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:07.260
before this thing completely goes flat. And at the end of the scene,

62
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.020
he standing there with this completely deflated sex doll hanging off of his

63
00:04:13.021 --> 00:04:16.020
erection like this, the surrender flag.

64
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.780
And of course his mother walks into the room.

65
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.750
And after I wrote that scene, the leader of the workshop,

66
00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:26.340
I was in my first workshop,

67
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.240
she took me aside afterwards and she said, ah,

68
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.350
the other writers in the workshop no longer feel safe around you.

69
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.690
<v 2>She really did. She.</v>

70
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.400
<v 1>You said you've written something that really frightens them. Uh,</v>

71
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.610
and they would like you to, uh, politely, uh,

72
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.470
leave the workshop and not come back. Wow. And so that's when I started with,

73
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.940
uh, Tom Spann Bauer's workshop in which almost anything went,

74
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.960
um.

75
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.380
<v 0>That if anybody's going to appreciate that it's going to be creative writer.</v>

76
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.630
<v 1>But it's not my mind. I'm delving into the deep recesses.</v>

77
00:05:03.631 --> 00:05:04.500
If I'm lucky,

78
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:09.360
if I'm doing it right of your mind of something that

79
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.040
they'll like comedians, they'll say, oh my gosh, that happened to you too.

80
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.120
And a lot of times there are things that people have never,

81
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.610
ever talked about. Uh,

82
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.030
I tell a classic anecdote after I'd read the, uh,

83
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.430
the gut story at an event, a woman came up and,

84
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.870
uh, and she was a middle-aged woman. She was about my age. And she said,

85
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.880
I really love that. You read that story about how you,

86
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.180
uh, got your anus prolapsed while masturbating in a swimming pool,

87
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.060
which is not my story, but I'm the one that read it. So that's the one,

88
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.870
I'm the one that they're picturing in this horrendous situation.

89
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.270
And she says, since you tell that story, I'm going to tell you a story.

90
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.420
And she said how, when, when she was seven years old,

91
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.800
she was in second grade and she was in a little organization called the

92
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:10.650
brownies, which is a precursor to the girl Scouts. You,

93
00:06:10.651 --> 00:06:15.080
you wear a brown dress, little brown hat, you get these little merit badges.

94
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.843
And she said,

95
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.060
one day I had a stomach ache and my mom kept me home from

96
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:26.000
school. And we had this heating pad.

97
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:30.410
It must've been in the 1960s and this heating pad had this vibrating function.

98
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.630
And she put me face down on this heating pad on my stomach and I fell asleep.

99
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:39.020
And while I was asleep, this vibrating warm,

100
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.640
heating pad must have slid down between my legs. She says,

101
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:48.590
because I woke up with the most amazing feeling I feeling

102
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:53.180
like I had never felt before, oh my God, it felt so good.

103
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.483
And so

104
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.640
next time it was my turn to host the brownies. I said, brownies,

105
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.620
you've got to try this heating pad. And she says, all the brownies,

106
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.460
they turn the heating pad on the vibrating heating pad.

107
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:14.570
And they wrote it like a pony all afternoon. And she said,

108
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.870
it was like sex in the city for seven-year-old girls.

109
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.240
They could not get enough of this heating pad.

110
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.540
And they were all riding this heating pad and they had a great time.

111
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.870
And she said, and for the first time in my life,

112
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.290
I was the most popular girl in my class.

113
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.770
And I was the girl that all the girls wanted to play with.

114
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.330
And for every brownie troop meeting, it was at my house.

115
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.610
And I was the leader until the day that my mother came home from work early.

116
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.860
And she caught us with a heating pad and she sent the other brownies home

117
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.350
and she whipped the cord out of the wall. She just ripped it out of the socket.

118
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.050
And she started to beat me with it.

119
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.270
And she beat me with that cord and she beat me. And she said, you piece of.

120
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.850
You dirty. What kind of a am I raising you?

121
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.130
And she beat me. She beat me. And she says, this woman,

122
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.710
who's my age. Now she says,

123
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:19.610
I have not had an orgasm since I was seven years old.

124
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.243
And then she goes,

125
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.560
but if you can tell that swimming pool story about how you got hurt,

126
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.470
jacking off under water, she says, I can tell my heating pad story.

127
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.770
And I can tell that story until I can make it funny.

128
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.520
And then maybe somebody I can go back to my mom and I can say,

129
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.620
do you remember that heating pad we used to have? And it'll be complete.

130
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.230
Oh. And so CC, CC, that's what I'm trying to do.

131
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.700
I'm trying to create the opening for, to tell these stories that they,

132
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.640
they never thought that they could tell,

133
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.480
because that's the way in which they're going to resolve these stories.

134
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.020
And they're going to master these stories. It's comedy.

135
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.590
<v 0>If you,</v>

136
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.500
if someone's telling a joke of someone's on stage talking about someone who's

137
00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:13.700
fat and there's a fat person in the front row, that joke will bomb. Yeah.

138
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.230
It just, yeah, but that's because people are good people overall, you know,

139
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.620
they, they recognize that they don't want to cause pain.

140
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:27.470
<v 1>Another really odd comic Davidson Tara's story is that he always told</v>

141
00:09:27.471 --> 00:09:31.130
me, uh, when you're on the road, don't read from your current book,

142
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.540
always read from the next book,

143
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.440
because it's the way of road testing the stories and finding out which ones work

144
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.490
and should go into the next book and in doing so,

145
00:09:40.491 --> 00:09:45.170
he was telling this story about being in this, uh, this forensic, uh, uh,

146
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.990
laboratory as an, as an autopsy was taking place.

147
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.880
And this autopsy table was adjacent to this,

148
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.690
this huge indoor window that separated the autopsy suite

149
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.800
from this lunch room and in the lunch room where the rest of the, uh,

150
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.050
the forensic staff and they're all eating their lunches.

151
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:08.060
They all had tuna sandwiches and cans of Coke and barbecued potato chips.

152
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:14.540
And they were watching through the window as this absolutely perfect

153
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.820
12 year old boy was being autopsied and just hours

154
00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:23.570
before this kid, like two hours before this kid had been riding his bicycle,

155
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.910
he'd fallen over, he'd hit his head on the curb. And now two hours later,

156
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.050
he was dead and dead without almost a scratch on him,

157
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.720
just this perfect naked,

158
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.820
dead 12 year old boy on the autopsy table. And as he,

159
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.100
the, the technicians eating their lunch,

160
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.990
watching it through a window that they watch as the, uh,

161
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.520
as the, uh,

162
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.950
pathologist in sizes around the top of the kid's face at the top

163
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:59.630
of the forehead, the hairline, and then peels the face down like peeling,

164
00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:00.441
an orange peels,

165
00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:05.330
the entire face off of the skull of this little boy and leaves the

166
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:09.560
face around the neck, like a mask, like a rubber mask.

167
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.740
And this exposes this liver colored,

168
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.940
dark red musculature of the child's underlying face.

169
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.950
And this one guy watching it with a mouth full of tuna sandwich.

170
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.530
He points this out and he says, see that,

171
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.940
that there that's the color of red that I want to paint our rec room.

172
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.853
Holy.

173
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.230
And once the Doris told that story in front of 600 people,

174
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:42.260
it was dead silent, and you could hear people, weeping,

175
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.930
people were crying and they were hating David Sedaris in that moment.

176
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.650
And so I had to laugh. I laughed really loud, like a.

177
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.330
<v 2>Donkey. And it was amazing how that hatred.</v>

178
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.930
<v 1>In that auditorium swung from hating David,</v>

179
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.970
who they did not want to hate to hating this over here who was

180
00:12:03.971 --> 00:12:04.960
actually laughing.

181
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.300
And so I threw myself on the sword for David and that story never went in any

182
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:11.134
book.

183
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.780
<v 0>Wow. Did the story not go in any book,</v>

184
00:12:15.781 --> 00:12:18.960
just because of the reaction by the audience or just the uncomfortable moment he

185
00:12:18.961 --> 00:12:20.580
just decided he'd speak to him.

186
00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:25.250
<v 1>No, I didn't. Not afterwards. It was just such an awkward, painful thing.</v>

187
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.180
I would never kind of throw it back in his face, right. To my knowledge.

188
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.070
That was the only time the story was told.

189
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.190
<v 0>Do you have those like, scattered about, are there, there there's,</v>

190
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.820
are there scenes where you wrote and you just sat and looked at him and went,

191
00:12:37.821 --> 00:12:41.960
no, I just gotta put that one somewhere else. Oh, they set that aside.

192
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.790
<v 1>Jokes that I told where I got hissed by 800 people. And, you know.</v>

193
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.650
<v 2>As you can live through those moments, you realize you can live through a lot.</v>

194
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.020
You can be hated.

195
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:59.480
<v 1>By 1100 people at a Barnes and noble on union square. Oh yeah.</v>

196
00:12:59.481 --> 00:13:01.640
You can be hated by your mother. It's. Okay.

197
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.070
<v 0>Now, when those people come to see you,</v>

198
00:13:04.071 --> 00:13:06.740
how many of those people are fans of literature and how many of those people are

199
00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:08.780
specifically fans of your work? Like there's,

200
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.960
there would be a difference like that people were fans of your work would at

201
00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:16.310
least expect some uncomfortable moments. And.

202
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:21.050
<v 1>For the most part that tend to be, uh, more or less just fans of my work, uh.</v>

203
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.210
<v 0>Instill it's still hiss.</v>

204
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.180
<v 1>Oh yeah. But it's, again,</v>

205
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:31.040
they're hissing on behalf of someone than I hissing up for themselves.

206
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.390
You know, I made this horrible cheap shot and they always know a cheap shot.

207
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.810
People always know a cheap shot. I, uh,

208
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.430
I was commenting about how in breakfast at Tiffany's Truman Capote had made this

209
00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:48.290
observation that Americans don't like true beauty,

210
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.270
true classical, natural beauty.

211
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:55.700
They want to see a very plain person who has been so groomed, so exercised,

212
00:13:55.701 --> 00:14:00.560
so made up so style stylized that she can kind of pass as

213
00:14:00.561 --> 00:14:04.400
this, this amazing,

214
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.570
strange beauty.

215
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:10.340
That's what Americans want because natural classic beauty is not

216
00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:13.580
egalitarian. You're either born with it or you're not.

217
00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.810
They want to see a plain person who has been transformed.

218
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.180
And to make my point at the end of the story, I made a cheap shot. I said,

219
00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.880
and that's why we have Sarah Jessica Parker.

220
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.350
<v 2>And I said this in New York and.</v>

221
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:34.760
<v 1>In New York, Sarah,</v>

222
00:14:34.761 --> 00:14:39.650
Jessica Parker is worshiped like a God and that whole crowd

223
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.960
hissed and booed and did everything, but throw excrement at me.

224
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.930
Wow. But then later in line,

225
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.010
half of them came up and whispered that really funny.

226
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.320
Another thing is I I'm really, really conflicted about the nature of my,

227
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.160
uh, creativity, uh, this idea that in journalism school, they,

228
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:07.690
they call the theory seduce in betray that when you go into an interview

229
00:15:07.691 --> 00:15:08.524
situation,

230
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:14.380
your goal is to gain the trust of that person and to get them to reveal

231
00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:19.240
something very intimate that you're going to betray by revealing to the public.

232
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.950
So you're just, you're basically going in there to,

233
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.270
to charm them and then to hurt them. And, uh,

234
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:34.390
and so much of my creative process is that way, because, uh, for example, the,

235
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.870
the, the gut story, the, the, the,

236
00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:41.170
the story in which the guy puts the carrot up his blood,

237
00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:46.540
that was my best friend at the time in like late

238
00:15:46.541 --> 00:15:51.190
twenties. And he got fantastically drunk and he told me that carrot story.

239
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.620
And I honestly believe he had never told anybody the carrot story.

240
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:01.330
And I, I kept that story in my mind for, you know, 10, 15,

241
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.920
almost probably 20 years until I found a way to put it with three similar

242
00:16:05.921 --> 00:16:07.990
stories and make a larger piece out of it.

243
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.530
And the first time I read that story,

244
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.770
I hadn't seen him in maybe a couple of years, this friend,

245
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.300
and I look across this big auditorium. And there he is.

246
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.610
And I'm telling his carrot story in front of hundreds and hundreds of people

247
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.460
and the look on his face, he's just stricken.

248
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.750
<v 2>And he hasn't talked to me sad.</v>

249
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:38.560
And this is why even, even David's use.

250
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.510
<v 3>His name, no, then him.</v>

251
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.560
<v 2>No, but what's wrong with him. People still feel betrayed and.</v>

252
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.870
<v 3>Get over it. You.</v>

253
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.080
<v 0>Need to hang out with more comedians. If he's a comic, you'd be laughing. Well,</v>

254
00:16:50.081 --> 00:16:51.400
you know, David Sedaris.

255
00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:52.301
<v 1>Is, has told me,</v>

256
00:16:52.301 --> 00:16:56.410
he said his family is very reluctant to share their lives with him anymore

257
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.280
because he's kind of made them involuntary public figures.

258
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.850
And they have to deal with the fallout from these stories about them.

259
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.130
And really only his brother and his sister,

260
00:17:06.131 --> 00:17:09.700
Amy have kind of been able to spin this in a good way,

261
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.720
but it alienates a lot of people. Uh,

262
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.650
I had a hired car from Philadelphia to New York once on, on tour.

263
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:22.240
And as we're going past Liberty hall in Philadelphia, this,

264
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.740
this great guy with a Philly accent driving the car, you points at Liberty hall.

265
00:17:26.741 --> 00:17:30.460
And he says that building has stood for, you know, 300 years.

266
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.050
I bet you can't tell me why.

267
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.280
And I just looked. And I said,

268
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.950
because the bricks are laid in Flemish bond.

269
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:44.140
I think that's probably it where the brick bricks are offset in such a way that

270
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.460
they, they bond in the center called Flemish bond. And it guys

271
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.620
so silent nobody's ever answered the question.

272
00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.360
And his father was a bricklayer and he was so proud and he goes, you're right.

273
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.870
Nobody's ever said blemish bond.

274
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.450
That's why it's still stands.

275
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.910
And we were best friends and just talking like crazy all the way into

276
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:13.320
Manhattan. We get into Manhattan. There's two guys walking down the street,

277
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:18.270
the guy goes, oh, Christ. I hate coming to New York. Ah,

278
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.140
the facts. And I said, well, you know,

279
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.610
I'm married to a man. And is pretty much my middle name.

280
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.720
And that poor guy had to do this whole

281
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:39.330
science read juggling of everything that the guy who knew Flemish

282
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.420
bond was also one of them.

283
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.820
Oh.

284
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.560
And it was one of those wonderful kind of a icky but

285
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:54.000
necessary moments. And I know they're horrible,

286
00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:56.580
but you know, things are better afterwards.

287
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.390
You must have loved that moment though. You know,

288
00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:03.630
it was a horrible moment because I felt like I was throwing away any kind of

289
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.470
chatty conversational relationship I had with this guy.

290
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.590
It seemed like just a salt of the earth. Great, funny guy.

291
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.270
And it was just kind of going out on a limb and saying, okay, you know,

292
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.060
he's going to hate my guts after this. Oh yeah.
