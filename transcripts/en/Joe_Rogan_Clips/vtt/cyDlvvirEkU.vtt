WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>And it's a food is a fascinating thing to me because, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.940
I mean, I guess this is a good time to bring it up as any, um, you know,

3
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:13.560
obviously Anthony Bordain took his life last week and,

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.190
um, he was a friend of mine and it was a real, that was real hard.

5
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:21.540
Friday was real hard. I woke up and, um, I got a text from my friend,

6
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.360
Maynard from tool, um,

7
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.130
maintenance said so much for the keen in versus Bordain celebrity jiu-jitsu

8
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:33.900
match. Ah, and, and, and he's like. And I was like,

9
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.040
oh no, what does that mean? Yeah. And so then I Googled it and I saw it.

10
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:42.510
I was like, oh, man. I can't what? Yeah.

11
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.990
Just what, what hung himself? Like what?

12
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.353
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.860
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

14
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.750
<v 1>Did you know his demons?</v>

15
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.560
<v 0>I was friends with them. Hung out with them, got up with them. Did.</v>

16
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.150
<v 1>You get a feeling that he had that.</v>

17
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.570
<v 0>In him? I didn't know that, but what was really weird was like,</v>

18
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.710
he had been saying really recently that he'd never been happier.

19
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.540
He was talking about his girlfriend and saying that it never been happier.

20
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:11.310
Didn't know he could be that happy.

21
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.990
Didn't know someone could make him that happen. Oh man. I'm so terrible. Well,

22
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:19.800
who knows? I mean, they might've, they might've broken up. Who knows?

23
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.200
I don't know. I mean, who knows? I don't know. I don't know. I don't,

24
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.840
I don't know. I mean sometimes, sometimes people,

25
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:27.180
when they say I've never been that happy,

26
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:30.540
you're catching them on these ups and downs. You know, some people, some people,

27
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.710
you know, people get manic. Right. I don't know if he was, but some people get,

28
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.050
they get up and down. I'll tell you what he, he liked to get up. Yeah.

29
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.130
You know, like he liked to drink. Yeah. You know, and he enjoyed it.

30
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.330
It was, it was something that he enjoyed. Yeah. But we, um,

31
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.980
we did an episode of this show.

32
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.710
We went hunting for pheasants in Montana and we cooked

33
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:59.970
over this campfire. He cooked fantastic. And really,

34
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.140
and uh,

35
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.790
then afterwards we drank whiskey and smoke weed and he

36
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:10.710
goes deep. He goes deep. Really? Where I'm sitting down,

37
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:14.130
I'm like, I'm going to just try to catch myself real at the world, spinning.

38
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.500
<v 1>Deep breath, deep breath.</v>

39
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.590
<v 0>He's like, where's the weed. It's like, they just kept going.</v>

40
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.550
He just kept going.

41
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.540
<v 1>Well, I knew he drank, I didn't know. He, he smoked weed. Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.610
<v 0>Yeah. He, um, he had a heroin problem when he was younger. Um,</v>

43
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.500
and he kicked it, but, uh, he didn't feel the need to just be sober. Yeah.

44
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.420
<v 1>That was kind of interesting about them.</v>

45
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.980
<v 0>That's a, that's a thing. Right. When people get sober from a drug,</v>

46
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.030
they feel like they have to get sober from everything that did not feel like

47
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:52.200
that. And he, by the way, like he would drink.

48
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.920
But when he was home, like with his kid and he was homeless,

49
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.990
he didn't drink at all. Like he would only do that.

50
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.610
He would only do that when he be on the road. Right.

51
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.030
So he'd be going to show these stretches of time and he didn't drink at all.

52
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:08.740
And he was addicted. Did you Jitsu? It was, that was a really, yeah.

53
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.580
He was doing jujitsu like literally every day when I was hanging around with

54
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:16.390
him, he was, um, he went, we were in Montana.

55
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.370
He went to Bozeman to find a local jiu-jitsu club and trained with them in

56
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:24.130
the morning. She was trained with everybody. I never,

57
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.630
I hardly ever did that on the road, find a place.

58
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.360
I would just go to the gym and work out. He wouldn't, but he was so into,

59
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.150
uh, learning and getting better at jujitsu.

60
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.790
<v 1>Ah, do you know if he was on prescription for depression or anything like that?</v>

61
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.980
That's what I'm so suspicious of.

62
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:44.710
Like when you heard of like Robin Williams and Chris Cornell.

63
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.640
<v 0>Yeah. There's like he was on anti-anxiety medication, anti-anxiety medications,</v>

64
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:49.474
a big one.

65
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.600
<v 1>Stuff like it even, you know, in there, you know,</v>

66
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.260
in their long list of side-effects, it's always suicidal thoughts.

67
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.020
And then if you mix it with other things like alcohol and this,

68
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:01.120
and I don't know at all who was on what,

69
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:04.900
but it seems what bothers me is that it's not part of the conversation.

70
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.610
<v 0>Well, Robin is a different take because Robin had Lewy body disease.</v>

71
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.550
Um, he had a heart attack. He had significant issues with that. Um,

72
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.410
my friend, Dr. Mark Gordon actually wrote a paper about, um,

73
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.760
long term anesthesia. Um, like when you're an under,

74
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:29.680
not the long-term, but like long duration for things like open-heart surgery,

75
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.330
right. That there's a high instance of depression afterwards. And,

76
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.703
um, uh,

77
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.720
a lot of people coming out of these big time operations where you

78
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:45.070
get anesthesia for long periods of time and have significant dips in their

79
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:48.250
hormone levels afterwards, it's very, you know,

80
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:53.200
it's not like a free ride getting put under and having your heart opened

81
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.860
up. And I mean, your body goes through massive trauma. Your body's like, holy.

82
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.750
We just had our chest plate split open and all your heart gets

83
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.793
worked on.

84
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.360
<v 1>And we're inside of us. Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.740
<v 0>And there's a significant, um,</v>

86
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.240
correlation in Marc Gordon's opinion between depression.

87
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.450
Uh post-surgery post-surgery depression.

88
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.750
And I think it's something that people need to look at. He had that obviously,

89
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.730
cause he, he did have, um, heart surgery.

90
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.590
<v 1>For a long period of time, the depression last after that.</v>

91
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.540
Cause I know people get, I always thought it was just a mental thing of like,

92
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.930
you know,

93
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.880
surviving something like I remember Letterman on a show like weeping and like

94
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:36.490
bringing his staff on and stuff. I always, I didn't know.

95
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:40.420
It was a hormone thing. I was thought it was just the trauma of surviving that.

96
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.800
<v 0>It can be both. I mean, I'm sure. I mean, I'm obviously no doctor,</v>

97
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.750
but he was, I'd say you're closer to a garbage man,

98
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.730
but he was, uh, explaining it to me. Um, the,

99
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.160
that there is an issue with this. Right.

100
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.370
And so Robin had that and he had some serious

101
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.020
neurological disorders and um, and there was,

102
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.250
there's quite a few other things too. Right.

103
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.570
<v 1>They're also complicated.</v>

104
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.380
<v 0>Yeah. And then whatever medications, this is the thing, right?</v>

105
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:15.950
Like what are these meds what's on? You know, you don't, you really don't know.

106
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.930
But, um, Chester from Lincoln park, uh, he was on a load of things.

107
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.190
And uh, he was, but he was very troubled me.

108
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.500
He was a guy that was, he had some real problems,

109
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.970
but he was also very medicated.

110
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.931
<v 1>I mean, look,</v>

111
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:34.640
we have the highest suicide rate among middle-aged people in America than

112
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:37.490
ever like the numbers, the numbers are through the roof.

113
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.440
And there's also this pharmaceutical opioid crisis at the same time.

114
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.840
And I just feel like, you know,

115
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.190
people are on this that's really affects your head

116
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.400
and your mood. And it says right in it, like, you know,

117
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.230
I remember I had a friend whose brother was a depressed and this was, you know,

118
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.800
in the eighties when we were kids and the,

119
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.630
the game, lack of a better word of trying to get the right medicine for him.

120
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.520
Cause when they, when they prescribed the wrong one, things got out of hand,

121
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.890
I mean like really dangerously out of hand.

122
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:16.370
And then they finally find the right med for him. And then he kinda of up.

123
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.950
<v 0>No, there's no like obvious path. Yeah. Like the,</v>

124
00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:24.410
the problem is it's like, say if you have a,

125
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.700
some particular type of infection, they give you antibiotics. If you have,

126
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.080
you know, poison Ivy, they,

127
00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:34.540
they know what kind of cortisone cream to put on you or what have you, when,

128
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.690
when you're depressed.

129
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.410
So there's just so many different factors involved in depression.

130
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:43.910
There's your actual life, right? There's what's going on in your life?

131
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.890
Like, are you taking care of your body? Are you exercising?

132
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.610
Do you have loving relationships with your family and close friends?

133
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.850
Or do you feel distant and detached? You know, do you,

134
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:58.700
do you not have anyone in your life like romantically?

135
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:00.710
Do you not have a job that you enjoy?

136
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.470
All those things factor into the way you feel about life and from.

137
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.420
<v 1>The time you were a kid sure. Your.</v>

138
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.030
<v 0>Whole life, oh, your whole life. And then on top of that,</v>

139
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.940
you have like legitimate mental illness, right.

140
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.420
And then you have depression because your brain is not producing enough

141
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:15.900
serotonin or dopamine.

142
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.510
And there's so many factors and people try to self-medicate and you know,

143
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:23.270
I know a lot of people try to do it with, uh,

144
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.490
extra exercise apparently seems to be as effective or more effective than

145
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.190
most SSRI and antidepressants.

146
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.380
<v 1>I heard that. I don't know if I'm right,</v>

147
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:37.760
but I remember hearing that whatever your body manufacturers or secretes,

148
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:42.710
when you exercise is similar to what a lot of these drugs have in

149
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:42.950
the.

150
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.580
<v 0>Um, well, you definitely get runners high, right? Lenders high, you actually,</v>

151
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.580
um, your runner's high.

152
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.940
I don't know the exact mechanisms involved,

153
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.800
but it has something to do with the cannabinoid.

154
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.360
So it literally gives you a high that's similar to almost like a marijuana hot.

155
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.470
Right. You.

156
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.330
<v 1>Know? Yeah. You get your euphoric.</v>

157
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.200
<v 0>Oh yeah. You get like, I love it. I love it.</v>

158
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.650
<v 1>And just feel even when, even if it's not identified for me as a high, like,</v>

159
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.340
like smoking weed, my whole rest of my day is better.

160
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.180
Like there is definitely, there's a happy little thing going on. That's,

161
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.500
you know, I'm not flying,

162
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.120
but I'm definitely not balled up and anxious the way I was before the run.

163
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.880
<v 0>Balled up an anxious thing. I have my own theory about that.</v>

164
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:29.730
I think the human body has physical requirements.

165
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.460
And I think if you don't just because of the design of it,

166
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:36.420
the fact that human beings have lived for thousands and thousands of years,

167
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.520
either hunting or gathering or running away from danger or your body's

168
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:46.500
like constantly in action back then we essentially have the same bodies

169
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:50.490
as people that live 10,000 years ago, our DNA is very, very similar.

170
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.370
And I think we have all these requirements and we don't meet him.

171
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:56.550
And there's so many people that just sit down all day and that's all they do.

172
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:58.860
They walk to sit down and they sit down again.

173
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.720
And most of their time is sitting down,

174
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:03.600
whether they're watching television or sitting in front of their computer.

175
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.720
And that is terrible for.

176
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.610
<v 1>Terrible. And you feel it, you just feel. You just, you feel bad.</v>

177
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:16.350
I was in, uh, after the, after the Bordain news,

178
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:19.830
I was traveling, uh, outside of Chicago. And, uh,

179
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.990
it just kind of clicked in my head. Like, you know,

180
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.770
you're just thinking whenever you have someone that inspires you and especially

181
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:29.490
if your friends, like you were, uh, you know, it's just,

182
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.760
you can't get it out of your head kind of a thing. And you're balled up.

183
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:34.860
Anxiety is even worse.

184
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.920
And I just instinct instinctually got in,

185
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.780
put on my running shoes and just went for a run because I didn't want to sit and

186
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:46.670
think about all of it so much. And I just felt better. Like I was,

187
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.600
I wasn't euphoric again after the run, but I was definitely better than before.

188
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.800
Yeah. I feel like, especially when you're traveling and stuff like that,

189
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.240
but he did your Jitsu all the time. See, these are puzzles,

190
00:11:00.241 --> 00:11:01.410
these are puzzles we can't solve.

191
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.850
<v 0>Well. Yeah. Who knows? I don't know what was going on. Yeah. No.</v>

192
00:11:05.851 --> 00:11:10.530
And there's no way to ask him obviously. Um, yeah, when I,

193
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.800
when I traveled one of the first things I do, uh,

194
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.780
whether I'm coming home or going there it's work out.

195
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.980
And I didn't this weekend because Friday when I got there,

196
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.030
I'd worked out Thursday. So I'd worked out that day already.

197
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:26.940
I ran that day and then I got there Thursday night,

198
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.810
woke up Friday to that text and I was just like, man,

199
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.620
I didn't want to do anything. I cried. I felt like.

200
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.440
I got a bunch of phone calls from some friends.

201
00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:40.160
And then I had two shows that night and I was like, I just got,

202
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.070
I'm just got to get on the horse for her up. And I was a little worried.

203
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.730
I was a little worried that I was going to be like moody or weirded out. Yeah.

204
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.620
But once I got there, I was fine.

205
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.410
And I was with the Santino and Tony Hinchcliffe. Nice.

206
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.380
So those two guys are great. Yeah. Just out of fun time,

207
00:11:56.381 --> 00:12:00.700
we talked a little bit about it and smoked a little weed. Nice.

208
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.140
Got up there and just had some fun.

209
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.131
<v 1>The energy of that crowd.</v>

210
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:05.800
I saw your Instagram of the crowd and that's such a beautiful theater.

211
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.810
That's an amazing theater. You can't have it.

212
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.920
It'd be tough to be depressed and doing a show there with all those fans and

213
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.080
saying.

214
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.730
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, we did two shows too. They're both gray.</v>
