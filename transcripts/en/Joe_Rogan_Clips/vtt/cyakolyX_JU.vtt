00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 3>Do there's this couple that's getting divorced and they have</v>

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:09.300
$600 million worth of art.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.890
It is the biggest single art collection that's ever going up for auction.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.950
And there's one painting that they have on the wall.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.060
That is a 2007 painting by some person I've never heard of. I mean,

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.530
I obviously don't know much about modern art in particular and it's

8
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:30.060
worth, I think, 40 to $60 million. That's it?

9
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.290
That is 40, 40, 60 million bucks gets a splash.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.920
<v 1>You know what? That looks like. That looks like a good background.</v>

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.740
<v 0>Yes. Well, look at this. It says</v>

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.100
[inaudible] untitled work from 2007 has an estimate of 40 to 60 million courtesy

13
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:49.620
of Sotheby's. What in the are you talking about?

14
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.600
Did you imagine 40 to $60 million is in insane house on a

15
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:56.430
massive piece of land.

16
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.680
<v 2>To say like, what about that is.</v>

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.070
<v 1>This is like the original NFTs guys. Come on.</v>

18
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.050
<v 0>But this is so crazy. Like for 40, $60 million, you should have a insane house,</v>

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.100
a private jet, a Ferrari, a Mercedes,

20
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.660
a crazy game.

21
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.940
<v 1>I would have just a bar.</v>

22
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.040
<v 0>Movie theater, good toilets.</v>

23
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.270
<v 1>House and a one that payment. Nothing else would be nice.</v>

24
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.220
<v 0>Imagine, just imagine that that's worth $60 million,</v>

25
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.290
please don't look at any of the other images.

26
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:30.900
I just want to concentrate on the other one. Chimney. I don't know what that is.

27
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.120
That's Pinocchio. The other one is Pinocchio's head.

28
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.190
They found Pinocchio skeleton scroll down.

29
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.460
[inaudible] billion dollars. That's the actual, what is that.

30
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.560
It's.

31
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.300
<v 2>A flight Marilyn Monroe. And that.</v>

32
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.380
<v 0>The whole thing is so insane. That painting is so insanely bad.</v>

33
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.190
Does it to try to.

34
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.100
<v 2>Explain to you why it's good. Does anybody try to.</v>

35
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.890
<v 0>Say, I can make that? See, I cannot do it.</v>

36
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.730
<v 1>Cause it's a huge canvas. That's it's all about how big the campus.</v>

37
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.580
<v 0>That doesn't make any sense. There's no, there's no sense to this.</v>

38
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.370
There's zero sense to that being worth 40 to $60 million.

39
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.700
I don't give a who made it? I don't give a where he's from,

40
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.750
where he went to school. Who, who he mentored under? you eat.

41
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.030
That's not $40 million being.

42
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.890
<v 2>Worth 35 million net.</v>

43
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.250
<v 0>Worth 3,500. It's worth 3,500 bucks.</v>

44
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.360
<v 1>Steve Martin would be able to tell you if it's good or not. Is he an art?</v>

45
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.530
That's his big thing, right?

46
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.720
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. But it doesn't matter.</v>

47
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.940
This is only worth what people are willing to pay for it.

48
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.670
And I guess some people are willing to pay for it. Cause this gentlemen,

49
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.860
Ty Wombi is a, apparently a very famous artist, which I get. Okay,

50
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:40.440
that's fine. But there's no way I can do that.

51
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.650
Like the whole art thing is such a bizarre status thing.

52
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.360
I was at an agent's house once in an Aspen's mazing house. And uh,

53
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.940
I was over this guy's house. Like, wow. His house is crazy.

54
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:55.620
Like how much the agents make us all those things like shady Robin people and

55
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:57.570
I'm in his house. And I see this thing,

56
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:02.410
that's framed as like this big and it's like tissue paper and like color.

57
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.180
And I go, I go, is this like something his kid made? And he goes, no,

58
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:12.010
that's a blue wall. That's $30,000. I remember going,

59
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:13.540
what the are you talking about?

60
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.760
<v 1>Uh, a buddy of mine is similar. A lot of these guys.</v>

61
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.620
<v 0>My 11 year old can that up. She can do so much better than that.</v>

62
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.080
<v 1>To my friends and artist who started out, you know,</v>

63
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.830
a lot of them saw as graffiti people like in New York,

64
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:33.700
like a boss scout was one of those, a graffiti people that became my buddies.

65
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.010
I didn't realize how much his stuff went for.

66
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.450
Like he offered me a painting and I was like, I just wanted one. And I was like,

67
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.140
I think it's worth like 30 grand. When I looked up. I couldn't believe it.

68
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.003
30 grand.

69
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.700
<v 2>The.</v>

70
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.400
<v 1>Pricing. He's a good artist. I mean, he's really good artists, but I,</v>

71
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.710
I was shocked at like what the art world.

72
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.810
<v 0>Just look at this one, Jamie,</v>

73
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:55.870
that I just sent you and tell me how much you think this one's worth.

74
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.310
This is telling me play.

75
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.090
<v 2>How much is it.</v>

76
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.923
<v 0>Worth?</v>

77
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.350
<v 2>I just want, let's see if Kurt and I can, uh, see what's better at guests.</v>

78
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.920
Take a wild guess. Okay. I'm going to F that's very good.

79
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:07.810
Under boob drawing there and some good hip.

80
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.280
<v 1>Actually. I don't say it's worth a lot.</v>

81
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:13.030
That looks like an art school sketchpad from a art Institute where I went this

82
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.990
$1 million.

83
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.040
<v 0>How much you think it's worth Curt?</v>

84
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.160
<v 1>That looks like somebody's sketch to me from what? I don't think a lot.</v>

85
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.200
I think like $30, 30.

86
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.200
<v 0>10 Million, 10 million, my 11 year old made that.</v>

87
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.143
<v 1>Oh.</v>

88
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.430
<v 0>This is how it's crazy. It is crazy. She's very talented.</v>

89
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.610
An 11 year old girl who drew that off the top of her head. She said.

90
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.190
<v 1>Watches on a thing. That's why I knew it.</v>

91
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:40.330
Wasn't going to be with a lot of money.

92
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.170
<v 0>Well, even like that kind of sketch with the right artist is probably worth a</v>

93
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:47.890
preposterous amount of money. How old is she? She's 11. She might've been 10.

94
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.200
When she made that. She might've been 10 when she made that.

95
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.770
She's really talented. I don't think that said that. But imagine,

96
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.600
imagine that you like that splatter let's show that other image before,

97
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.740
which is probably worth like 50 million bucks. How much is that worth?

98
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.810
Sotheby's how much is that worth?

99
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.600
<v 1>Well, Hey.</v>

100
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.640
<v 0>This guy that is, is that Ty Twomey is dead. I was trying to find his dead.</v>

101
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:14.860
That's why? Yeah. Ty's dead. What's that.

102
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.030
<v 2>20 Million that scribble.</v>

103
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.650
<v 0>Oh, OSI C Y Trombley. Look what he wrote. Look at it.</v>

104
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.990
Imagine making a living doing that. Like you go.

105
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.440
My husband's an amazing artists. Wow. That's cool.

106
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.340
<v 1>I bet you, his name has a lot because first of all, it's a very good name.</v>

107
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:33.730
Cy Twombly. That's a, seems like a catchy art name.

108
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.820
<v 0>This has been explained to me by friends that are artists.</v>

109
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.590
This is what happens when you bring your stuff to a gallery

110
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.830
and then a big time collector buys it.

111
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.180
Someone who comes in and goes, I want, this is amazing.

112
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.510
And this is this incredible new artist. His name is [inaudible]

113
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.510
. He's incredible. And then this, this one person who's in the know decides that it's good. And then other people start buying your stuff too. And then it becomes more valuable because you only have so many pieces. And if they're big pieces, like big, huge pieces. 

114
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.510
Yeah

115
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.510
. Even though it looks like dog, it's worth even more. It's like, that's why that piece is worth 40 to $60 million. 

116
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.343
It's just.

117
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.590
<v 2>It spawned a lot of people in LA to be are probably other places too.</v>

118
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.930
Or I know a couple of hardest,

119
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:27.230
but they have no trend that is scribble like that, but they're not going to be.

120
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.330
<v 0>You never know. Wow.</v>

121
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.060
<v 1>I guess what's their name? Do they have a cool name?</v>

122
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.930
Like [inaudible] cause that's what the is that? Like?

123
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.890
It's the [inaudible]. Oh, it must be like a bit, I.

124
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.920
<v 0>Immediately Kurt Metzger, people are going.</v>

125
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.350
<v 1>To go. It's not, yeah, it doesn't have the same. Right.</v>

126
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.440
Humbly is an amazing scribbled name. It's not.

127
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.050
<v 0>Yeah, but it's like that. Stuff's not good. Like objectively, it's got.</v>

128
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.390
<v 2>Last thing you buy with all your money. I mean,</v>

129
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.240
you would think once you have your stuff, then you go,

130
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:57.500
I have so much money left.

131
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.030
<v 0>That are like these hedge fund that are worth just billions and billions of</v>

132
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:06.080
dollars of nonsense money. They're moving money around and they're making money,

133
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.153
put it in.

134
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.110
<v 1>And don't they have like a place, some airport where it's all. Yeah,</v>

135
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:14.750
it was in that movie. Um, you know,

136
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:18.530
what's the time-travel movie that is intended. They Rob,

137
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.970
they robbed that vault where they keep really expensive kind of paintings like

138
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:25.940
Saudi princes keep. So nobody sees them. They're just in this vault,

139
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.850
I guess there there's some airports, but in tenant,

140
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.630
I think that was a real place. They were where rich people keep their art.
