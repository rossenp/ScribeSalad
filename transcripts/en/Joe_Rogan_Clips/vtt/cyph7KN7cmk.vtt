1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I mean, there's, it's horrific. This is,</v>

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:07.740
they set up this reservation and everybody got syphilis.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.450
Everybody everybody's banging everybody and they all got syphilis and people

4
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:14.990
hair's falling out the ulcers all over their body.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.740
People are going crazy and dying.

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.430
<v 1>Now. What if, what if all that, uh,</v>

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.810
all the Indians had syphilis were like jealous white.

8
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.600
<v 0>No, not the Indians. Everybody that's soldiers had syphilis. Everyone does.</v>

9
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.760
This is what I'm saying.

10
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.120
<v 1>It's got syphilis. You don't want to them. Meanwhile,</v>

11
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.430
the white chicks wanted to the Indians are like, let's go.

12
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.860
Then it's the loony left right now?

13
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.150
All of the top of the loony up the top of the loony left the top of them.

14
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.060
They're all going to go down for some. It's not just a hunter Biden.

15
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.410
It's not just hunter abiding.

16
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.960
<v 2>Polosi they want.</v>

17
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.190
<v 1>World war as they want. You know what happened? Remember, remember nine 11,</v>

18
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.300
the day before nine 11,

19
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:57.950
Donald Rumsfeld makes an announcement that the Pentagon is missing $2.3

20
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.560
trillion. Guess what? That was going to be a lot of investigations going on.

21
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.650
People were going to go down for that, but guess what? Nine 11 happens.

22
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:07.670
And no one brings it up. So if we have a world war right now, uh,

23
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.740
those people won't go to prison. What would you rather go?

24
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.610
Are you ready to go to prison or world war being famous was the greatest thing

25
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:18.530
ever and now being famous. It's not so great. It's like, you're just a target.

26
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.660
You know? It's like, it depends.

27
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.930
<v 0>You still, you have a voice. The thing is, if you can take the heat,</v>

28
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.460
I'm talking about, I'm talking.

29
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.660
<v 1>About being like a famous actor or, or a rock star you're at target. I mean,</v>

30
00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:32.300
look at the news these days, look at the news. Look what they're saying,

31
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.980
but who's watching that over and over and over

32
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.440
the wrong about everything over and over three years of Trump's a

33
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:43.400
Russian agent.

34
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.810
They gave Trump the Russian they gave that's the worst thing you could give a

35
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:50.210
politician. He's a Russian agent. You can get killed flat.

36
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.190
They gave him the worst. They gave him, uh, Russia, racism,

37
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.150
rape. They gave him all that stuck. They can nothing stuck,

38
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.540
but if they could do that to the president, they can have that.

39
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.620
Even if all hate. Trump, think about this. If Trump didn't win,

40
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.200
the person that would be president right now would have a body count.

41
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.000
Think about that. You'd rather have a person with a body count than Trump,

42
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.940
just because he's arrogant and overconfident and all that.

43
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.650
He's a bad businessman.

44
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.800
A con the economy is better than ever better than ever unemployment,

45
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:27.800
better than ever. That's what we have a president here for,

46
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.400
to make our country better, more prosperous. And that's what he's doing.

47
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.390
Would you wear a maggot hat?

48
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.530
[inaudible], that'd be like looking over my, if you will. And it says,

49
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:44.100
make America great. Again. Look how powerful the media is. The,

50
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.410
the media is so powerful that anybody wearing a red hat that says make America

51
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:51.110
great. Again, it can get parts. So for Colby,

52
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.130
it's the immediate to data. Just people's reactions to those hats. It's

53
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.280
been a cat. All the anti-Trump stuff comes from the media.

54
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.050
What we're seeing now is we're seeing clearly now clearly who is

55
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:11.050
above the law. There are people that can do whatever the they want.

56
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:15.460
We're singing. I used to be a myth conspiracy theory, but we're seeing it now,

57
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.730
who is above the law with all this has gone on with Epstein and all that.

58
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.440
And we're seeing how the media is backing them up too. How interesting is that?

59
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.400
If that's all just a distraction to like, uh, get people arguing,

60
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:31.990
make it so obvious that it was it wasn't a suicide. So obvious let's release it,

61
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.430
make it so obvious. Meanwhile,

62
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:36.490
he's still alive and everyone's trying to figure out how he died and,

63
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.590
and all they care about is that he's dead.

64
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.800
There's virtually a media blackout on it for the longest time,

65
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:45.520
but they got to talk about something because the longer the mainstream media

66
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:49.240
doesn't talk about it. The more obvious it looks and it's waking everybody up,

67
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.480
you know, how many people who are super anti conspiracy,

68
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.050
theorists are all into Epstein. Now it's like when nine 11 happened,

69
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.530
that woke up a lot of people, nine 11 woke people up. A lot of people say, well,

70
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.660
it started with nine 11. A lot of going to,

71
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.640
people are gonna say it started with Jeffrey Epstein.

72
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.340
People that hate conspiracy theories are all into a throne.

73
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.600
Michael Shermer I'm so balls deep. And, uh,

74
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.450
there's a guy on YouTube every day. He puts out.

75
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.990
Ali does is he's written books on gangsters and all that. Every day,

76
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.790
he puts out a Epstein video and update and just goes deeper and deeper.

77
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.380
His name is Sean Atwood.

78
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.310
The updated dude will take me two hours to,

79
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.900
to go into it's really all about Ghislaine Maxwell's father.

80
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.060
He was the one who was originally doing what Epstein was doing. Epstein took.

81
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.170
So Epstein started banging just lane. She takes him, she goes, you know what?

82
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:42.730
You're going to take over the family business.

83
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.140
The family business is it's not just blackmailing the elite.

84
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.670
That's part of it, but the man, a big part of it, dude,

85
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.980
it, her father, he's the one Robert Maxwell. That guy was a dude.

86
00:04:56.981 --> 00:05:01.020
He work. He, I think they're just, I don't know. Oh,

87
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:02.070
it wasn't a suicide.

88
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.100
The amount of detail option that we're th that's shoved down our throats,

89
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.290
which obvious. Now it's all out in the open.

90
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.440
So any plausible theory you can't laugh at,

91
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.360
you could easily be alive. Why did they need to show 9,000 jumpsuits.

92
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.170
Look at all this. Come on, man. Dude. It's so obvious.

93
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.410
The craziest thing is like, where's the video footage. Oh,

94
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.230
the cameras weren't well, no, no, no. That's the craziest.

95
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.130
Wouldn't you think it would be a good idea to all get together and say, listen,

96
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.690
every now and then some dudes going to,

97
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.720
we're going to have to sacrifice one of you guys and just fake your death.

98
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:36.060
And you're gonna have to go to one of the islands in Japan or one of the,

99
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.360
they probably have so many spots set up. Wouldn't it be smart.

100
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.500
Go set up some spots.

101
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.570
And in like the Greek islands or somewhere like in off the coast of Norway,

102
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.910
Greenland, Greenland, who knows what's in Greenland.

103
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.740
They can have all these cities for like all these people that like they die,

104
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:55.440
but you never see their bodies. They give you say, you know,

105
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.520
people used to fake their deaths all the time, back in the thirties and forties.

106
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.880
<v 2>It's easier to just kill Epstein.</v>

107
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.640
<v 1>Wazer you don't think he has a kill switch.</v>

108
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.410
<v 2>We know it's tight with the RA family, a trap house to trap house. Try this,</v>

109
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.660
try some of this. Oh, this.

110
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.580
<v 1>Abstain Epstein was tied with the Royal family, uh, Jimmy Savile as well.</v>

111
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.670
So I mean, yeah, absolutely.

112
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.380
See the thing what's going on now is the biggest phenomenon that's going on

113
00:06:23.381 --> 00:06:25.810
right now is with the internet.

114
00:06:25.811 --> 00:06:29.980
The internet is like a backfiring and it's boomerang.

115
00:06:29.981 --> 00:06:34.300
And back at the people, it wasn't, the internet was intended to control us and,

116
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.750
uh, surveil us. And now what's happening. The internet.

117
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.750
<v 0>Was intended for scientists to share information at universities.</v>

118
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.260
<v 2>It was in the university. Why they invented there.</v>

119
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.530
<v 1>Were, it was all funded by the CIA. It was all the way to keep it.</v>

120
00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:49.120
It's always about the new world order.

121
00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:52.540
It's always about the easiest way to control us.

122
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.610
We can go on for five hours with this.

123
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.780
It's almost like the CIA was created as a scapegoat.

124
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.280
Like all cause the CIA ain't going to jail. Where w how do you put CIA in jail?

125
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.520
You can't. And then the directors that are only there temporarily,

126
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.190
and they're in out, everyone goes through it, but it's a read.

127
00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:12.790
Like if you find out some evil, going on, CIA, did it see,

128
00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:17.380
I ain't going to jail for sure. I I'm, uh, in my heart, I'm a hundred. I,

129
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.460
I believe it, a hundred percent that there is some stuff in the Bible.

130
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.490
That's the real. There is the, it comes from the real.

131
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.490
They got a stored it and translate and all that. But the real, like,

132
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.560
like it's a manual on how to live your life. Right. You know what I mean?

133
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.660
These are rules. Like maybe God is the idea.

134
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:39.160
Maybe God is the in Jesus is the frequency you want to get in that frequency of

135
00:07:39.161 --> 00:07:43.480
life. Don't deceive anybody. Don't totally each other up.

136
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.260
Then you will be in that zone. That's what God is. Like.

137
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.190
Maybe the book is a manual. I believe there's a God because, um,

138
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.900
a couple of things, you know, when, when I did DMT, uh, I went into, I thought,

139
00:07:55.901 --> 00:07:59.770
okay, there's more, there's way more to this reality,

140
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:04.390
this dimension that I'm seeing for sure. And then the more,

141
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.080
um, the more I get into, uh, you know,

142
00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:11.200
trying to find out what we're on and what, what this is all about.

143
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.070
And then you look at the main mainstream. I think someone created what we're in,

144
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:18.220
whatever you want, whatever you think this is, it's a simulation.

145
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.190
This is something I don't, I don't believe in simulation. There's no evidence,

146
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.820
but, um, uh, but it could be true. It could be, but there there's.

147
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.820
<v 2>But you know, that even happened.</v>

148
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.760
<v 1>Like the, the theory is billions of years ago, out of nothing,</v>

149
00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:34.000
everything exploded. Well, you know, came up with it.

150
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.670
You become religious on me. You know, you know, it came up with it. Hot.

151
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.910
<v 2>Dude, if you start talking about, Jesus said, no, no, no.</v>

152
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.530
<v 1>You don't come up with a big bang. You can look this up right now. The big bang,</v>

153
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.140
at least from the Vatican, a priest came up with that.

154
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.850
There was a theorist sign.

155
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.840
<v 0>Scientists. Nope. A priest. Are you sure?</v>

156
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.010
<v 1>A million percent, when you look at the history of the Vatican,</v>

157
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:54.880
when you look at the history,

158
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.220
Constantine decided to convert to Christianity because the people were leaving.

159
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:02.430
The people were like, that. So this is mainstream history constantly.

160
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.700
And God's okay. I'm no longer pagan slash Luciferian.

161
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.660
I'm no longer inching Babylonian where we like Christ too.

162
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.110
We're going to do Christ. We're going to do what we got. We got our own, we got,

163
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:15.750
this is mainstream. We're going to start the Roman Catholic church.

164
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.220
We're going to have a Pope. He talks to Jesus.

165
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.990
That's where we're going to have Cardinals.

166
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.600
They'd talk to Jesus like once a week. And then we have the bishops.

167
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.890
They talk to Jesus like once a month.

168
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.490
And then the priest every now and then all of a sudden they created rockstars

169
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.360
dudes with power. The Pope has power. You talked to dudes every day, Cardinals,

170
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.110
bishops priests. Right? So come on back. We got, we got Jesus for you.

171
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.100
They made Jesus. And just like telling us things we already know,

172
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.750
dang is they were never into Jesus. When you look at the Vatican,

173
00:09:41.751 --> 00:09:46.340
they have a lot of Luciferian. And look at, look at the resurrection,

174
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.360
look at the sculpture of the resurrection, pull that up the sculpture.

175
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.630
And you tell me if that's Jesus, that does not,

176
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.330
that's supposed to be Jesus right there let's go. This is oppose.

177
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.520
It looks like a Slayer album cover.

178
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.640
They have a telescope called Lucifer and sweat. It's.

179
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.960
<v 2>The biggest, if not the biggest.</v>

180
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.170
<v 1>Telescope you've gone to you think how crazy is that?</v>

181
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.410
How about it's real? The Vatican has been, uh, is a beautiful place. I love it.

182
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:15.920
How [inaudible] was born Catholic. I was born Catholic and EV you know,

183
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:21.590
for the Catholic church, I love the Cardinals. I love the bishops.

184
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:22.723
I love all of them.

185
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.150
<v 0>The Vatican has an observatory in Arizona.</v>

186
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.330
[inaudible].

187
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.600
<v 2>Yeah. Why did they name it? Lucifer. Exactly. Because it's an acronym.</v>

188
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.150
<v 1>For something, but it just so happens to be lucid for me yesterday.</v>

189
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.943
<v 0>Oh, really?</v>

190
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.930
They picked the L skipped like four letters that doesn't make any sense.

191
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.850
How do they call that? Exactly. That's crazy. It was a coincidence.

192
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.550
I just hope nothing happens with the side. Ranch.

193
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.190
<v 1>Nothing's going to happen. I mean, we talked about this earlier.</v>

194
00:10:52.191 --> 00:10:56.450
What actually happened is when they bombed, when I ran, like they swore revenge.

195
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:59.660
They ran with their red flag and they were going to bomb twice.

196
00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:03.080
They bombed and they killed nobody. But in their media,

197
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.300
they reported that they killed 30 Americans.

198
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:10.100
So it looks like a real retaliation. You see a face, got all about source.

199
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.430
It all comes down. Do we're surrounding around.

200
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.550
Or we got military bases all around, around what are they going to do? Well,

201
00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:20.300
what happened was, is they made a lot of deals while Obama was in office.

202
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.580
And Trump was like reneging and all that. He's like,

203
00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:27.410
who made these stupid deals? So I ran like, you. I thought we had a deal.

204
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.480
I was like. That deal. That deal goes against the United States. So all that.

205
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:37.670
So that's what's going on. So it, the rumor is the rumor is that the, uh,

206
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:42.470
the president of Iran wasn't getting along with Sala Maney anyways.

207
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.270
So Trump said, said, let's take them out. I'll do you a favor.

208
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.410
I look like a bad. And then you say, we're going to get revenge.

209
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.940
You bomb a, that has nobody. You spirited.

210
00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.310
You claim that there's 30 people. And everybody goes, I can see that.

211
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:02.430
And then everybody's fine. There was a, an interview.

212
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.370
And they were asking some jujitsu interview, why are you a conspiracy theorist?

213
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.460
And I said, why isn't everybody a conspiracy? There is,

214
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.790
we all know the government lies. And then you believe it.

215
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.580
Official stories doesn't make any sense. There is two sides.

216
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.630
There's two sides of the polar opposite. One is right. One is wrong.

217
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.660
So it's really easy to figure out which one's right and wrong.

218
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.230
You just got to figure out for sure. Who's full of. Let's see. Who's for sure.

219
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.830
Where's it coming from Hillary? Clinton's full of for sure. Uh, CNN is full of,

220
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.910
for sure. So ju uh, uh, uh, uh, Joe Biden full of, for sure.

221
00:12:32.911 --> 00:12:36.240
Adam Schiff full of, for sure. So you know what out of those four people,

222
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.360
they're all saying the exact same thing, and they're all full of.

223
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.250
And who else is saying the exact same thing? CNN, MSNBC. So we already know.

224
00:12:44.251 --> 00:12:48.040
Okay. So by process of elimination, you know, that can't be,

225
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.700
but you sound like crossing right now. What about Tucker Carlson?

226
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.610
There's two sides. You've got to pick one side, pick a side.

227
00:12:53.611 --> 00:12:58.140
One side is it's Tucker Carlson. And once you pick a side size, two sides,

228
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.660
don't let them get out. No, but there's not two sides.

229
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.640
I don't have to go all the way. There's three. There's three, there's three.

230
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.200
There's three types of people. The first one,

231
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.850
first one people that think Hillary good Trump bat, right? The second people,

232
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.360
the second type of person is people who think Trump good, Hillary bad.

233
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.630
And then there's the third type that the, both of them are bad.

234
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.650
There's also some nuance could people must behave corruptly.

235
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.620
Cause it's an economy, but not all of them, not all of them,

236
00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:27.530
because if they were all corrupt, there would be no,

237
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.170
the reason to suicide anybody. That would be no reason to bribe anybody.

238
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.660
There's good people. Well in there. Yeah. If you up,

239
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.980
someone's willing to kill him on the just to avoid. There's always good people.

240
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.260
You just have to figure out which, who are the good people. You know,

241
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.280
I believe Bob has our believes all that. I believe he doesn't believe it's true.

242
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.890
I believe his was set up. They let him talk too much.

243
00:13:46.891 --> 00:13:48.750
Like how are they going to let them do Netflix?

244
00:13:48.751 --> 00:13:51.810
And they're going to come on JRE. If you're on Netflix,

245
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:56.520
they want the deep state wants you on Netflix. I think he believes it. You know,

246
00:13:56.521 --> 00:14:00.360
just like William Cooper. I think he, he figured out he got set up.

247
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.240
He thought he was being set up into,

248
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.460
he thought they're trying to get us to believe in aliens so they could fake

249
00:14:08.461 --> 00:14:12.210
an alien attack. So that will usher in the new world order.

250
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:16.560
Because what happens if the aliens attack, we all unite and all the movies,

251
00:14:16.561 --> 00:14:19.140
you see them in the movies like let's call China.

252
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.710
China has got this new thing and the Russia. Yeah. We're all together. Well,

253
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.040
y'all unite. That's the whole purpose of everything. He goes,

254
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.300
they they're setting up a fake alien invasion. That's what they're doing.

255
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.003
Okay.

256
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:36.810
I really am happy that the comedy scene is

257
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.380
slowly getting braver with jokes.

258
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.430
It seems like it's a weird thing because in the eighties it was, uh,

259
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:49.470
like the cool thing to be a liberal and I'm Democrat and Republicans.

260
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.850
They just, they're just Christians. They have family values.

261
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.600
They don't want to get high or go to heavy metal concerts, Republicans.

262
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.470
But as you get older and you have kids, and I dunno what happened.

263
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.540
I don't know what happened, but it seems like now the cool kids are Republicans.

264
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.390
Because when I grew up, there were no family values.

265
00:15:08.391 --> 00:15:10.880
And I thought family values as a way to control you.

266
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:14.600
They're trying to control you with the family values in Christ and the older you

267
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:18.860
get. You're like, I was a idiot. Of course,

268
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:21.530
it's all about family. You gotta have values.

269
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.480
A dude with no values is a dude. You can't trust what the. You know what?

270
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.520
Um, I used to think growing up that,

271
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.350
giving into your desires was that your right? It's my right. If I'm horny,

272
00:15:33.351 --> 00:15:36.110
I'm going to. If I want to party, I'm gonna drink.

273
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.100
And these right wing people from Alabama,

274
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:44.420
they're trying to throw Jesus down my throat and trying to push, you know,

275
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.430
push their family values. And, but I swear now, dude, I'm not Republican.

276
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.350
I'm not claiming Republican at all or anything, but I get it. Now I get it.

277
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.600
Cause I have a kid and there's no way anybody is going to convince

278
00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:04.010
me that because some kid with pink hair,

279
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.120
all looped up on pharmaceuticals, shoots up a mall.

280
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.160
That it makes sense that I give up my guns and I can't protect my family.

281
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.430
Explain that what you're saying is a hundred percent correct.

282
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.870
Everything you're saying is right.

283
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.850
The problem in that would what everything up is people getting

284
00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:28.610
blackmailed and people being compromised.

285
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.710
And those are the people that are making the laws and the Lowe's laws affect

286
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:34.640
my family.

287
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.520
That's where it gets all up because everything you're saying is right,

288
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.900
but that's not what these people, these certain people, not everybody.

289
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.600
There's a lot of good people in the government. A lot of good people.

290
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:47.690
And it's amazing. Um, I'm fat. I'm fascinated every day,

291
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:50.410
finding out who they are and then boom, you group them all together.

292
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.960
Like those are the good guys. Those are the bad guys let's watch.

293
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.990
Then you make your popcorn and you watch the show. Hey,

294
00:16:56.991 --> 00:16:59.570
you know what people tell me, you know like, yo,

295
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.320
that's all you do is study conspiracy theories. And I'm like, no,

296
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.240
on the weekends, dude, on the weekends,

297
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.910
I am blue pill and myself on the weekends,

298
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.850
baseball with my son karate.

299
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:15.860
We've got watching the Disney cartoons with all the space. And I,

300
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.990
we, I blue pill with the out of them.

301
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:20.810
I don't try to get my son into conspiracy theories at all.

302
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.010
That's going to be later.

303
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.770
<v 2>I'm like, I just want it to be later. As later I'll get.</v>

304
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:29.030
<v 1>Him when he's like time. But right now he can't handle it. There's no way.</v>

305
00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:33.650
There's no way he doesn't even ask him to. And all his whole life,

306
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:38.630
every minute is happiness. Just love and happiness.

307
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:41.420
And we just, we just want to make him every day.

308
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.860
He loves school more than anything. He loves school more than, he loves school.

309
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:47.690
And then after school, it's all about fun.

310
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.460
And he decides what we're going to do. He calls the shots.

311
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.700
You're going to go to karate. He goes today, we're going to do karate.

312
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.410
And then we're going to cause he's on the baseball team.

313
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.410
And then we're going to go to the batting cages. My boom, that's it.

314
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.140
We go to karate, batting cages. Then I go teach jujitsu.

315
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.960
Then the next day he'll say, daddy, I think we're going to,

316
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.560
I'm going to take a relaxation day. Worked a lot the last couple of days. Well,

317
00:18:08.561 --> 00:18:13.560
let's go get let's order pizza from Dino's in Burbank. Amazing.

318
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.210
And then we'll watch some teenage mutant ninja turtles.

319
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:22.080
He's all about teenage. He decides my dad,

320
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:27.090
my dad had 19 kids and I was just one kid with my mom was like a weird offsite.

321
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.750
Like he had a family with five kids and then he got a bunch of other women

322
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:33.900
pregnant. He was all over the place truck driver. He had 19 kids.

323
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.780
I was one of 19, yet out of eight different checks.

324
00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:41.430
He was banging and he, um, never, I found out I met,

325
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.010
I met a couple of my half brothers and half sisters that were,

326
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.610
were actually part of his real family. And we met one day.

327
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:50.970
We went to the old spaghetti factory in Hollywood and he told,

328
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.760
they told me all about them. And I didn't know. I thought he had five kids.

329
00:18:53.761 --> 00:18:56.940
He had a family with five kids and my mom was some chick. You know,

330
00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:58.830
he was sitting on the side. That's what I thought.

331
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.010
I didn't know he had a punch others because how would they go? She goes,

332
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:05.910
how many? My half sister goes, how many? I was half, half sister, half brother.

333
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.930
Because how many kids do you think your dad has? I said, ah, six,

334
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.140
because try 19. I go. He's like Helio, Gracie. Holy.

335
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.760
Real similar thing that he never told any. He never said the words.

336
00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:23.390
I love you to anybody, to his real family. He never said it to me.

337
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.270
Cause I would see him like once a year that the words never came out of his.

338
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.253
I've never told my mom that.

339
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.220
Apparently he's one of those guys that will never say I love you to anybody.

340
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.570
And I'm the opposite dude. I tell my son,

341
00:19:35.571 --> 00:19:39.860
I look them in the eye every day. It's like, you know, who loves you the most?

342
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.600
You know, I'm in the, I love you though.

343
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.390
And I whisper in his ear and my no I'll kill anybody for you.

344
00:19:47.391 --> 00:19:48.860
Don't you ever forget that?

345
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.050
<v 2>Whoa. Oh, he gets crazy.</v>

346
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.300
<v 1>With them, but it is important.</v>

347
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.280
The funny thing get now it's a funny thing. Like first he's like, okay dad.

348
00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:01.520
Okay. And now it goes, I'm not going to let you forget daddy. I won't forget.

349
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.650
I call you promise. Cause I won't forget it.

350
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.190
I just want to make sure you don't forget. And he goes, okay. And he goes,

351
00:20:07.191 --> 00:20:12.170
I daddy, I won't forget. I promise. And I hug him every day.

352
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.630
I'm living for him. My that's why I shaved my head. I'm like,

353
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:16.520
what the am I doing? Washing my hair. Yeah.
