1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.190
<v 2>And one of the things that I want to talk to,</v>

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.880
cause I haven't talked to you since the pandemic start.

4
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:09.420
Last time I talked to you was screwball, right? Like how long ago.

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.030
<v 0>Was that? Oh yeah. Well, 2019. Yeah, it was.</v>

6
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.040
<v 1>Right before the hit the fan. That was the last time we talked.</v>

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.380
We were talking about that documentary and then when all this happened and so

8
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:21.100
much of the wackiness and the, you know,

9
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.650
the controversies coming out of Florida, like you embrace the chaos of Florida.

10
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.080
<v 0>Yeah. Florida fuckery is our genre and it's our also our top export I think,</v>

11
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.540
is as well. It's really what we provide the rest of the.

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.310
<v 1>And COVID you, I mean, look about how much your work is about Florida,</v>

13
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.960
the cocaine Cowboys series, you know, all the stuff on a rod,

14
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:46.740
like all the there's there's so much of your, your work.

15
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.610
<v 0>The petrifying, I'm a Florida native, you know, a lifelong Miami.</v>

16
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:53.340
And I think the petrifying thing that I've learned through the years,

17
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:56.910
and it's not my theory, uh, TD almond called Miami,

18
00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.520
the city of the future and effectively,

19
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.320
the Florida of today is the America of tomorrow. And more importantly,

20
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.340
the Miami of today,

21
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.310
more specifically the Miami of today is the America of tomorrow.

22
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:11.130
So if you want to know what, uh,

23
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.910
challenges we'll face or calamities will befall us as a nation in the years or

24
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:18.360
even decades to come. And you need only look at the Canary in the coal mine,

25
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.223
which is which.

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.550
<v 1>Florida do you think that's because of it's very vulnerable to climate change.</v>

27
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.050
First of all, right? Like there's,

28
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.860
there's estimates about how long Miami can last. Yeah.

29
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.970
<v 0>But not good. Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.020
<v 1>They don't, they think we got about two decades. Right? Isn't that the.</v>

31
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.240
<v 0>Thought I'm a renter. You put you that way. I've lived there my whole life.</v>

32
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.200
I don't own property in Miami. It's probably a good move. I'm not.

33
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.500
<v 1>Bullish. It does. It seems like it's going to go under water.</v>

34
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.380
<v 0>Right? Yeah. It'll definitely be under water. It's just a question of when,</v>

35
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.310
because it's.

36
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.930
<v 1>All like, they're like the, the ground itself is very porous. Is that correct?</v>

37
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.000
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, you know, we had, uh, uh, reclaimed wetlands, that's Miami beach.</v>

38
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.640
That's where champion towers is reclaim wetlands. What does that mean?

39
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.170
It was mangroves, swamps, swamp. And that we reclaimed,

40
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:10.470
which means we filled it in and there's still poorest limestone underneath that

41
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.560
Champlain towers only had water coming at it from the front,

42
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:16.380
the back above and below. But other than that, it was totally dry.

43
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.160
I mean the tower.

44
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.993
<v 1>Of the collapse.</v>

45
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.770
<v 0>Yeah. Just battered were getting battered.</v>

46
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.660
<v 1>They were on that porous limestone.</v>

47
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.590
<v 0>So it was built on reclaimed wetlands. And so I'll tell you right now,</v>

48
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.330
as we speak, this is the, um, the king tides. You know what the king tides are?

49
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.770
No, they happen every September, October and November, not the entire time,

50
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:37.620
but there's like a week here, a weekend there for those three months,

51
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.420
it is what we call sunny day flooding. So it has to do with the tides.

52
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.590
It has to do with the, the,

53
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.290
the distance between the sun and the moon and the earth.

54
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.220
And it floods in the sunlight. It,

55
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.500
we can get as much as 12 inches,

56
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.780
12 inches above the highest high tide of the

57
00:02:57.781 --> 00:02:58.320
year.

58
00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.590
<v 1>So it just, it's not.</v>

59
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.770
<v 0>From rain. It's not now here's the problem. We're still in hurricane season,</v>

60
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:05.680
which means rain exacerbates it. Inclement weather can,

61
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.690
we're totally when it rains on top of the size, but this is just like a day.

62
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.800
Like you just, if you are in a low lying area or waterfront or ocean front bay,

63
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.890
front, that's just what sunny day. But it's perfectly,

64
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.450
it could be perfectly beautiful.

65
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.870
And you could have as much as 12 inches above the highest.

66
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.810
<v 1>High tide. So it's just an unusual level of the ocean.</v>

67
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.160
<v 0>Yeah. It's just a quirk of, of the tides. It happens every year, uh,</v>

68
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.870
off and on for three months. Yeah.

69
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.810
That's in the D S we call it sunny day flooding.

70
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.980
That's a thing that we have there. I mean, you know, Miami, we make it rain,

71
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.220
but we, now we have sunny, sunny day. Flooding is a thing.

72
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.450
<v 1>And they can do like new Orleans, like put up some sort of, uh,</v>

73
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.610
some sort of a wall.

74
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.980
<v 0>So the, the army Corps of engineers proposed a kind of futuristic</v>

75
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:57.070
post-apocalyptic, you know, after the flood, well,

76
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.320
pre-flood kind of a wall and Miami said, no gaseous. No, thank you.

77
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.040
We don't want that. We'll we'll, we'll we'll fend for ourselves. Did they say.

78
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.560
<v 1>No because it was too expensive? Or did they say no because.</v>

79
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.570
<v 0>No, the army Corps of engineers I think was good.</v>

80
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:12.520
Everything was gonna be federally funded.

81
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.750
They just didn't want this unsightly unseemly kind of a wall in our beautiful

82
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.960
town. But what they did want is they wanted a signature bridge.

83
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:24.070
We're building like this $800 million bridge that we don't need that. But it's,

84
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.580
it's super, it's super pretty. As we say in Miami, it's super pretty.

85
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.150
And somebody.

86
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.960
<v 1>Probably got a good.</v>

87
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.290
<v 0>Deal. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You better believe the contractors. That's the thing.</v>

88
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:35.170
That's why the Miami of today is the America of tomorrow.

89
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:37.690
It's really the corruption dysfunction in non-stop construction.

90
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.820
That's really what it is. It's this,

91
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:43.330
anything goes wild west kind of mentality because, you know,

92
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.690
I said this before on the show, you know, LA is where you go.

93
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.610
When you want to be somebody, New York is where you go.

94
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:50.560
When you are somebody in Miami is where you go.

95
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.000
When you want to be somebody else,

96
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.590
it's always been a sunny place for shady people. The Florida man phenomenon.

97
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.580
It's just like, you know, w w if you have,

98
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.180
it's not new England, it's not, what's your name. Who's your daddy.

99
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.740
Everyone's nouveau reach in Miami. So no one cares where your money came from.

100
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.330
As long as the booze is flowing and everybody's dancing, the music's going,

101
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.463
nobody gives a.

102
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.620
<v 1>And it's always been that place. It's always been that party place.</v>

103
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.570
You were telling me before, about how during, uh, w it, was it the seventies,

104
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:24.470
the eighties, these recording artists would go down.

105
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.770
<v 0>Yeah, well, listen, uh, Miami is just it's America's Casa Blanca, you know?</v>

106
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.640
And so some of the biggest records of all time, um, I mean,

107
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.260
back when that was the business, like you could sell tens of millions of albums.

108
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.000
Uh, everybody went to Miami. Eric Clapton was one of the first Jimmy buffet,

109
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.350
the BGS, the Eagles, Crosby stills, Nash, and young,

110
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.680
um, the almond brothers Fleetwood Mac.

111
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.610
And they were doing all those records that we all still know today from the

112
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:59.420
seventies, they recorded a mixed, or at least in part, um, uh,

113
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.650
uh, uh, Glenn Fry.

114
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.880
And Don Henley wrote the lyrics to hotel California in a rented mansion on Miami

115
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:09.080
beach, where it had, that had been the love nest, um,

116
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.030
of Howard's using Ava Gardner, uh, uh, Winston Churchill used it as a,

117
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.310
a winter home. Uh, and, um,

118
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.820
the Watergate burglars and Howard hunt used it as well. And then, um,

119
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.690
Steven stills used it. He was hanging out there with like Shel Silverstein.

120
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:26.840
They were, it was like a weird scene. And then, uh,

121
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.040
eventually the Eagles came down to do hotel California and wrote the lyrics.

122
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:34.970
They locked themselves, these two guys in a room, and they, they just,

123
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.010
the housekeeper left sandwiches and,

124
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.860
and drinks at the door cause the door was closed.

125
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.480
And they came down in bathrooms one day with, with legal pads, yellow,

126
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:48.950
legal pads, and said, we have it. We have, we have, we have the lyrics.

127
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:52.100
And so everybody, every, and it was a communal scene too.

128
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.840
It's kind of like your place with the, you know,

129
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.730
everybody just sorta like stops by people, stop by to get it.

130
00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:02.840
It was like that because you had all these artists in every route, like,

131
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.760
so there was pickup basketball games outside,

132
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.760
you'd drive up and there'd be the BGS playing the almond brothers,

133
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.580
playing Eric Clapton and a pickup basketball game. And they,

134
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.200
to this day criteria studios, they have a wooden upright piano,

135
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:16.880
and the rumor has it. One day,

136
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:20.240
there was an artist I won't mention the name was playing and had a baggie of

137
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:24.920
cocaine on the top of the piano. And he was playing and the baggy fell open,

138
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.050
fell, boom, puff of smoke on the keys of the piano appropriately.

139
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.840
And he grabbed the bag and salvage what he could.

140
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.730
And then for the next several months,

141
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.620
the people at the studio who worked would stick a straw between the keys on the,

142
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.860
on the piano and tried to say mostly dust. They were probably snorted,

143
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:45.860
but they were just trying to salvage whatever they could for there. So the, the,

144
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.130
the, the joke was that, um, they had, uh,

145
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.900
a line item on the, uh, the bills. Cause that's the thing.

146
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.720
They were away from the watchful eyes and ears of the labels,

147
00:07:56.721 --> 00:07:58.250
which were all based in New York and LA.

148
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.340
So they would go to Miami and no one knew what the was going.

149
00:08:01.341 --> 00:08:05.300
I didn't have publicists or producers from, or executives rather from,

150
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.410
from the recording studio.

151
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:08.770
So they would send them bills to pay for the studio time.

152
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.550
There'd be a line item for cocaine, but you couldn't say cocaine. Um,

153
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:15.290
and I think by the way, cocaine was, at that time,

154
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.770
it was probably part of the appeal of bringing the artists to Miami, to be fair,

155
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.700
probably right. But it was under the category of piano.

156
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:27.110
Tuning was, was the cooking. So you get like some, you know, someone that,

157
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.900
you know, accounts at a record label would call up and say, Hey,

158
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:32.960
I have a question about this, this invoice, um, it's, it's,

159
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:37.400
there's $5,000 here for piano tuning, but there's only one ballad on the album.

160
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:41.540
So what's with all this piano tuning, you have there's, there was an act, uh,

161
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.500
God, I'm not going to say it,

162
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:46.160
but there was a band who came down in the eighties to record a criteria.

163
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.030
And then they came down again in the nineties and the guy who runs the studio,

164
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:52.190
Trevor, his mom was the manager before him.

165
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.890
So he was a little kid running around this scene.

166
00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:56.280
If can imagine a little kid in Miami,

167
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:58.590
in the seventies running around this scene, this incredible place,

168
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.030
Aretha Franklin, did the respect record at criteria James Brown,

169
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.540
did I feel good, recorded that song at criteria. It's a really historic place.

170
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.650
And so he, this band comes in and he says to the lead singer, he says, Hey,

171
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:13.850
listen, I don't know if you remember, you know, you were down here 15 years ago,

172
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.280
whatever, back in the late seventies, early eighties doing this, this record.

173
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.750
And the singer says,

174
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.580
I have no memory of that whatsoever.

175
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.510
Except for one thing, he said, one night,

176
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:30.570
apparently we were done recording here.

177
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.880
And someone took us into the neighborhood.

178
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.610
It's like in a residential kind of area into the neighborhood,

179
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.960
to this woman's house.

180
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.550
And she brought out a brick of cocaine and entire kilos of cocaine heats.

181
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:44.420
I'd never seen that before she put it down on the coffee table,

182
00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:47.550
we're sitting on the couch, she put it down on like, there's a big band. Uh,

183
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.330
they put it, she put it down on the coffee table. She cut it open.

184
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:56.280
And all I remember from my entire experience in Miami is the smell of that

185
00:09:56.281 --> 00:10:00.600
entire kilo of cocaine. Like just what it feels like when an entire,

186
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.520
like an entire kilo of cocaine is opened up before you and it

187
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:08.160
hits and hits you. Have you ever done Coke? Never.

188
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.090
<v 1>Never, but hearing that I want to snip.</v>

189
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.730
I just want to know takeaway. I want to know what that's like,
