00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. But my,</v>

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.220
my interested my interest is more in the sort of intersections of

3
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:12.300
religion and culture where people might not recognize they're being religious,

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.240
even though I would try to make the argument that they are well. I mean, I've,

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.770
I've, uh,

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.620
I've written a book called sacred matters that looks at these different, um,

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.170
kind of arenas where we're religious life, um, can be found in,

8
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:30.900
in cultural forms of activity. So, um,

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.910
like celebrity worship,

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.950
I would call a religious culture that has

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.780
systems of meaning different kinds of rituals, um,

12
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.590
possibilities for, um, discovering your true self,

13
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:50.630
a whole kind of value system that can be tied up. Yeah, that's interesting.

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.320
Celebrity.

15
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.240
<v 1>Worship as a form of religion,</v>

16
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.340
I've always thought of it as just hijacking the human reward system because, uh,

17
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.870
if we lived in a tribe of people, a small tribe, and there was one,

18
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.920
uh, great leader, you know, the battle scarred leader,

19
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.200
who's seen it all and can give us the information.

20
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.110
And he was the one talking we would listen, that would be, uh,

21
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.490
a person of great importance. And we all gather around and listen.

22
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.830
But when you see Brad Pitt in a movie screen and his face is 30 feet high,

23
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:25.550
and this music playing when he talks and a team of writers have carefully

24
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:29.600
constructed all of his words and this perfect sentence. And, you know,

25
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:33.590
it's just like, it's so moving and inspiring. And then we see them in real life.

26
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.270
Oh my God, it's really you. But meanwhile,

27
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:37.760
he hasn't really done anything other than pretend. Right. You know what I mean?

28
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:39.590
He's been pretending, I mean a great entertainer,

29
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:42.440
but he'd given us some wonderful distractions,

30
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:47.270
but it's not that he's led us through battle. Right. It's not that he's,

31
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:50.450
he's figured out how to find the food in the water. You know,

32
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:55.280
this is not what it is, but in our, our hijacked human reward system,

33
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.660
we treat him as though he is the great leader or even.

34
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.980
<v 0>Someone like Oprah. I mean, he was more clearly, you know, in that sort of, um,</v>

35
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:05.420
strange, uh,

36
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.430
middle ground between celebrity and spiritual leader of some kind.

37
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:11.900
So, you know,

38
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.560
obviously it's going to vary depending on what celebrity or you're talking

39
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:20.120
about, but, you know, just in terms of projections, our imagination,

40
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.950
where we invest, um, you know, our energies, you know, celebrities big,

41
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.240
but again, um, I'd like to talk about, uh, other things, uh, you know, as well,

42
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.990
um, that whether we're talking about politics or, um,

43
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.430
consumer culture or things, um, around medicine,

44
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.710
that there are religious qualities that don't have to do with the Bible

45
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.630
or with Mohammad or something.

46
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.690
<v 1>Right. There's religious qualities in that, uh,</v>

47
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.430
there's these very rigid ideologies that are treated like religions

48
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.310
that you have to follow. And there's also, um,

49
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.740
signs that people will hold up that they're complying in there,

50
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:04.120
along with this ideology. I'm one of them that I talk about a lot,

51
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:08.260
is people taking photos with masks on, on Twitter for their,

52
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.810
their profile picture, right? Like I know what you're doing. Right, right.

53
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.350
We all know what you're doing. Well, I mean, you know.

54
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.620
<v 0>And messaging and thinking about, you know, bizarre use, you know? Yeah. It's.</v>

55
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.130
<v 1>It's bizarre when you see these patterns sort of repeated over and over again.</v>

56
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.540
<v 0>Right. Social media too, do the future of, of religion and, uh,</v>

57
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.940
in terms of how it, um,

58
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.800
transforms and moves forward is an important kind of site

59
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.150
for religious activity and investments. And, um, you know,

60
00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:43.350
where we're really gonna see the action what's happening on Instagram,

61
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.780
Twitter. Yeah. So.

62
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.670
<v 1>When you say like religion that these things fall into</v>

63
00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:54.150
sort of religious behaviors or religious ideas, um,

64
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.220
you're not meaning like as handed down from a higher

65
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:04.200
power you're meaning as in people fall in with

66
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:07.620
the same sort of compliant behavior and patterns. And.

67
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.320
<v 0>Uh, not necessarily. I mean, I, it's not,</v>

68
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.730
it's not all just sort of compliance and, uh, it's one aspect, right.

69
00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:16.680
Or conformity or something. It's, it's,

70
00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:21.240
it's just meaning-making is how we try to live our lives in ways that, um,

71
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.830
can carry us on when we have to confront suffering and death and,

72
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:28.230
and as well as, um, you know,

73
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.240
issues around health and what are the sources that are available to people. And,

74
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.180
you know, as I've, I've said in my class many times,

75
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:40.950
I think popular culture is much more of an important kind of teacher

76
00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:45.600
about religious ideas and values than, you know, the local priest.

77
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.720
<v 1>How so? Because people pay more attention to it.</v>

78
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.870
<v 0>Absolutely. And because they're more swayed by it, you know,</v>

79
00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:54.750
because it has more of an impact and resonance, but.

80
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.231
<v 1>It's so, it's,</v>

81
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:59.130
so it's a dangerous way to sway things coming from someone who's involved in

82
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:00.480
distributing popular culture,

83
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.430
because there's so little thought put into the actual impact

84
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.740
of, of what it is and so much thought putting into it. Just what pops.

85
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.020
Yeah. Like what gets people to pay attention, right.

86
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.860
<v 0>And money talks and money is sacred. You know what,</v>

87
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.750
what's a more sacred in our society than making some money.

88
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.480
And that's a dry, you know, again, so there too,

89
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:28.950
we can talk about other religious qualities to capitalism. Well, you know,

90
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.340
there've been a number of, uh, scholars who've written on that topic and,

91
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.340
and made those connections. So, um, again, you know,

92
00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:39.810
the action isn't taking place in the church it's taken place in, you know, uh,

93
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:43.590
music festivals, burning, man, you know, it's,

94
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:46.560
this is where again, I'm not making it.

95
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.360
I'm not trying to kind of over-generalize, but I think very much for, um,

96
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.620
especially younger people. Um, but baby boomers as well, you know,

97
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.200
where, where, you know, where does, where do I get my spiritual juices.

98
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.890
<v 2>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

99
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.040
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

100
00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:11.470
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

101
00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:15.160
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

102
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.180
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

103
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.040
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
