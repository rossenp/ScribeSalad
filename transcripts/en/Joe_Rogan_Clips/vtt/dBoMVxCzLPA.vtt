00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know, with this whole thing,</v>

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.560
I realized I go on too much. I talk too much, like all old.

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.680
<v 1>Women. No, you don't talk too much. Just the, the,</v>

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.880
the problem is not the talking.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.920
The problem is the people reacting to your talking.

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.120
<v 0>I like to see people get lit. Yeah, it makes 'em go.</v>

7
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.270
Woo my as no, I think it goes like this.

8
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.950
Uh, oh, something was off program. Oh,

9
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.070
I'm unraveling, like the wicked witch off program. Oh,

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.150
a bit of water got on you. Oh, it's off program, right? Yeah.

11
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.830
<v 1>Eat it. The problem is not what you're saying. It isn't.</v>

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.020
<v 0>No, it's how.</v>

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.020
<v 1>I say it. Problem is people reacting to you. That's the problem. But.</v>

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.940
<v 0>I'm supposed to get a.</v>

15
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.660
<v 1>Reaction. Yeah. But they're fools the,</v>

16
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:51.620
the ones who are freaking out and canceling this and firing that they're just

17
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.620
fools. They don't understand you. It.

18
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.460
<v 0>Makes me think of that song, which you know, I said, it. I don't care about it.</v>

19
00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:00.900
No more. I'm going to become the rock star that I've always wanted to beat.

20
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.410
And I'm gonna sing that song. And here's a song I'm not gonna sing it right now,

21
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.890
but this was a song that refers to all that.

22
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.530
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good. Oh Lord. Oh Lord.

23
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.730
Please don't let me be misunderstood. Cause yeah. Life has its problems. Yeah.

24
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:17.610
That's my.

25
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.730
<v 1>Share. That's a great quote. Isn't.</v>

26
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.360
<v 0>It? That was great words. Great, Eric. And what a great artist, you.</v>

27
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.960
<v 1>Know, we talked about on the last podcast,</v>

28
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.160
I think was really important that people understand, you know,

29
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.000
I've been a fan of yours forever, and I know your story stories.

30
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.840
And I know what happened to you when you were a little girl,

31
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:37.360
when you got hit by a car and you were in a mental institution for nine months

32
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:40.800
afterwards and how it completely affected the way you think and behave.

33
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.910
And I don't think people you, that mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's one,

34
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.550
it was a really important thing for me to talk about during the last podcast.

35
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.870
One of the reasons why I wanted to get you in as quick as we could was people

36
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.710
need to understand what's happening here. What's happening. There was a,

37
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.790
a genius comic. Who's also on ambient smoking pot,

38
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.870
drinking Alta and has legitimate brain injury.

39
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.540
<v 0>I do. And I have mental health issues.</v>

40
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.860
<v 1>I think a lot of that is from not just I do too genetics, but your brain injury.</v>

41
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.100
<v 0>Well, I, uh, I, uh.</v>

42
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.700
<v 1>The problem is people reacting to you, they're reacting to you. Like you're,</v>

43
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:20.420
you're calling for people to be assassinated or murdered, or you're, you're,

44
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:23.770
you're yelling racial slurs in the streets. You're not doing any of things.

45
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.770
You you're not that person,

46
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.130
the reaction was so overblown and that ABC got so wacky and,

47
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.370
and canceled you. It was, it was so foolish. So fool hearty,

48
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.410
and to try to change who you were,

49
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.050
the reason why the show was successful was because of who you were.

50
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.960
And the fact that other people on the show didn't have your of ideology.

51
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.640
And you would argue with them and fight with them.

52
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:50.560
And it's like real life conflict, like people know in their own homes, right?

53
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.320
That relatable aspect of your show was why it was number one so quickly

54
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.680
and why the old show was so great. You you're that's you.

55
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.440
And they tried to mold you to these woke times and foolishly

56
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.840
reacted to the way you were talking as if you,

57
00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:08.440
you were doing something that was like,

58
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.520
they changed what you were doing and made it this horrific, terrible thing.

59
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.160
It's.

60
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
<v 0>Just, well, it's all because I said that I liked Trump.</v>

61
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.390
As soon as they heard that, you know, a lot of cabals here in Hollywood,

62
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.910
that's all they needed to hear. It's like, okay, destroy. She must be destroyed.

63
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.470
Yeah. And I did hear people say, um, oh my God, I'm afraid.

64
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.110
She's gonna try to humanize Trump. Yes. At the network. They said that, yes.

65
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.030
Do you think that? And it's like, what

66
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.820
you mean Trump voters is that who you're afraid it's gonna get humanized half

67
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:44.100
the.

68
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.900
<v 1>Country.</v>

69
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.580
<v 0>I know it's like such an elitist out of touch view of humans.</v>

70
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.860
It it's always offended me. It always offended me that they, um,

71
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.180
didn't like their audience.

72
00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.210
And I liked the audience cuz I thought I'm from there and familiar to

73
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:03.770
me. And uh, I, I vowed to myself.

74
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.530
I'm not gonna disrespect the audience. Yeah. And I never did.

75
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.170
And I never did sell out neither I, so everybody, you know,

76
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.810
there will come a day. I believe when, uh, you know,

77
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.320
uh, no, there won't, who knows what the will been. Who knows? Nothing.

78
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.280
<v 1>Can happen. Yeah. Who knows what.</v>

79
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.800
<v 0>The gonna happen in inside my own head though?</v>

80
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.320
I've I guess I've made peace with it. It was like the worst,

81
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.880
horrible thing I've ever gone through. Uh, my friend, Tiffany, she says,

82
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.160
she says that, uh,

83
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.000
this might be the beginning of the valuing of an artist rather than the,

84
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.030
because it was the lowest point of ever devaluing an artist and an artist's

85
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:49.190
work. She says, so maybe now it's turned around and, and the artist will be,

86
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.110
you know, better respected for what they bring. I hope.

87
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.910
<v 1>So. Because I mean, they were even pulling your old show off of things. Yeah.</v>

88
00:04:57.911 --> 00:04:59.830
Which is just ridiculous.

89
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.420
<v 0>That's kind of what killed the comedy thing for me is that I was also told that,</v>

90
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.540
uh, one more, one more me getting in trouble. One more time.

91
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.100
I wouldn't have my reruns anymore. And I live on that, you know, Jesus Christ.

92
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.300
So that's kind of what killed the, so that.

93
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.140
<v 1>Killed the idea of you going out and.</v>

94
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.930
<v 0>Doing yeah. I asked for, I asked for it to be defined. I, I said,</v>

95
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:26.850
could I have a definition of what offensive means right. To you.

96
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.370
Right. And they said, you know what? It means that, oh Jesus. I said,

97
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:33.610
could you discuss it with my lawyers? No. You know what it means?

98
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.410
What does it mean?

99
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.250
<v 1>I don't know. No, this is the.</v>

100
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.890
<v 0>Problem. It could mean you fired or something. Sometimes. I mean,</v>

101
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:43.440
these people that think people are rude are the rudes on earth.

102
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.400
They're the most, they're doing the right sensitive.

103
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.440
The people that think they're so sensitive. They're ins. Yeah.

104
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.560
Do you think they think they're doing the right thing? I do too.

105
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.920
I think because I don't think they ever get to hear anybody like me say,

106
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.320
you're not doing the right thing. Well, we live in an echo chamber a bit.

107
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.800
We live in an echo chamber. I know. That's why it's up to us to go. You guys,

108
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.160
um, think things through a little bit more I'm I'm not condemning anybody.

109
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.200
I'm not that kind of person. I think we.

110
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.240
<v 1>Need more conversations. Absolutely. And.</v>

111
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.360
<v 0>We need more, we set the best dinner parties till all these self, right.</v>

112
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.270
progressives ruin that. Starting with my own family on Passover.

113
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.270
When we were celebrating the Jews,

114
00:06:24.271 --> 00:06:28.990
leaving Egypt &lt;laugh&gt; and I had this horrible, uh, cousin,

115
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.950
I can't even remember his name. And he goes, well, maybe. And he had long hair.

116
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:38.580
Well maybe we should, shouldn't be celebrating the death of all Egyptians. Like,

117
00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:40.420
well, that's what the story's about.

118
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.580
And then we'd have like fist bite break out, you know?

119
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.580
And I'd always be the one going, can we just get back to the story?

120
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.500
We just get back.

121
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.960
<v 1>To the story.</v>

122
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.420
Always someone looking to be offended by some aspect of any story I'm offend.

123
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.770
<v 0>Every day of my life of how stupid people are. &lt;laugh&gt; God.</v>

124
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.810
They can't be more offensive to me right now than ever has been before.

125
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.010
I'm about ready to get out there and tell people what in the like that has hit

126
00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:12.210
me many times in my life.

127
00:07:12.211 --> 00:07:16.130
There's been times I got outta my car to chase after a mother or two,

128
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.040
the way I seen her treating her kid. I do it. I boots on the ground.

129
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.960
I I'm, I'm not, no, I I'm not. Uh,

130
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.760
I'm not a trifling.

131
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.640
<v 1>Sort, trifling ISS, a strong word for white person to use.</v>

132
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.640
I've always said that. It's like, it's a next door neighbor to the N word like.

133
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.680
<v 0>Trifling, trifling. No, it's not Jews use it. We use it trifling.</v>

134
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.390
<v 1>But it seems when a guy uses it, that's a white guy. It's Hmm. I don't know.</v>

135
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.310
I think a woman to get away with it better than.

136
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.830
<v 0>A guy came. Well, when I grew up, we lived right next door to African Americans.</v>

137
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.030
You know, we, we lived down where everybody lived together. You know,

138
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:55.790
there wasn't any, nobody had got to the suburbs yet. Got it.

139
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.350
We lived mid city and uh,

140
00:07:58.351 --> 00:08:01.660
we had all kind of people down there at the bus station where we live.

141
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.500
<v 1>Trilon is just a great word. It.</v>

142
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.460
<v 0>Is a good word. It should come back. But.</v>

143
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.140
<v 1>It's just white people use and it always sounds awkward. Does it,</v>

144
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.140
but white I'm trifling women can pull it off for some strange. It's.

145
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.620
<v 0>Like silly what? It's such a good word to just scream. Like, I mean, what,</v>

146
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.180
what else did you say? Wallowing and filth. Maybe that's isn't that?

147
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:22.770
What it does it mean Wal wallowing infil?

148
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.490
<v 1>Well, I think it more means like you're a fool. You're like a, a,</v>

149
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.930
a moron living, a stupid petty life. Right? It's unimportant or trivial.

150
00:08:30.931 --> 00:08:33.210
Trivial. Yeah. Trivial. That's the word? Perfect.

151
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.130
<v 0>Trivial. I called that wallowing. Infil or pandering so.</v>

152
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.963
<v 1>Much better than trivial.</v>

153
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.440
