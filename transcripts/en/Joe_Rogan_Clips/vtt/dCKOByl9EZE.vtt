00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 3>I feel like we should have a drink.</v>

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.030
I think we would be remiss as a professionally obligate podcast to drink.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.410
Yeah. That's nice. We're doing a podcast about drinking. Yeah,

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.060
we should have at least a small,

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.070
so the historically there's been a safety feature built into alcohol.

7
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:24.240
So for most we've been drinking. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. Yeah,

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.143
let's try this.

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.300
<v 0>Whoa. Yeah, that's nice.</v>

10
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.900
Start your Monday morning or Monday as a way to start on Monday morning. Yeah.

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.360
Um, so this stuff is new.

12
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:43.550
So having alcohol that's this strong is something we've only had for a couple

13
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.830
hundred years. Really? So a lot of people don't realize that.

14
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.720
So for most of our history,

15
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:53.100
we've been drinking like two to 3% beers, uh,

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.700
grain to 3%. Yeah, that's it. Historically,

17
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:00.540
it's typically what beers came in at, um, great wines.

18
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.950
You can get up to like eight to 10, but there's a built-in limit to,

19
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.310
for natural fermentation.

20
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:10.170
So the yeast are turning sugars and alcohol, which is a poison.

21
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.680
So they're the Easter slowly poisoning themselves basically.

22
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.950
And we've bred these super Hardy yeast.

23
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:21.540
So like nowadays you can get an Australian Sohrob to like 16%

24
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.710
ABV. Wow. Which is historically really unprecedented,

25
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.030
but that's as high as you can get. Cause then the alcohol shuts down the yeast,

26
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.590
but a way around that is distillation. So you heat, you take that wine,

27
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.120
you heat it up ethanol is really volatile. So that comes off first.

28
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:43.170
And if you could figure out how to capture that vapor and turn it back into a

29
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:48.030
liquid, you've got this, you've got really concentrated alcohol.

30
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.570
Do they do that with wine? They do it with wine or they take,

31
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.690
they'll take something that's naturally for minute. So a week beer or wine.

32
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:55.620
And then they distill it.

33
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.950
And what do they call that when they get it on the other end, distilled liquor.

34
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.570
That's what liquor is. It's just a kind of liquor. So liquor, liquor,

35
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:06.600
or spirits refers to something that's been distilled. So you've,

36
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:10.590
you've basically extracted the alcohol out of the mixture and made it into a

37
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:14.520
pure form. And once you do that, you've got like 90,

38
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:15.810
you can get like some vodka,

39
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.670
it could be like 90 something percent ABV so that's crazy strong.

40
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.650
It's just really, we're not equipped to. So what you're talking about, you know,

41
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:27.690
this, it needs to be modulated.

42
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.010
It was always modulated historically by the fact that we were drinking beers,

43
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:33.030
that weren't very strong.

44
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.530
So there's going to be just volume limit to how much you can consume

45
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.950
is also a modulator by social stuff.

46
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.110
So we're drinking typically historically in a communal situation where

47
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.960
there's really clear ritual restrictions on drinking.

48
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:53.610
So you only drink when someone makes it toast. You're, you're modulating,

49
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.880
you're drinking with other people. And even, you know,

50
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:58.470
you think about just even in a pub,

51
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.500
you don't just drink as much as you want you order rounds, right?

52
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.840
And if you down your, your beer real fast,

53
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.540
you gotta wait until everyone else is ready or another around.

54
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.010
So we socially regulate our drinking and then it's been regulated by its

55
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.320
inherent weakness. If you want to think of it that way.

56
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.740
But then all of a sudden you get this kind of stuff.

57
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.680
You get really strong liquors and, and you can have that in your house.

58
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.620
That's when alcohol gets really dangerous.

59
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.270
And it's only been the last couple of hundred years,

60
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.160
distilled liquors weren't cause the,

61
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.450
the concept's really simple Aristotle described, um, distillation,

62
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.130
but technologically it's really hard to do because you gotta be able,

63
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.580
you have to have metallurgy.

64
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:40.390
You need to be able to heat liquids and keep them at a certain temperature that

65
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:42.460
makes, uh, they're pressurize. It's really,

66
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:46.510
it's actually kind of de prohibition. When people created stills at home,

67
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.290
it was like early 20th century version of meth labs. You know,

68
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:53.410
they were constantly exploding and people were like getting scalded with hot

69
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:55.570
liquid cause it's really, it's dangerous.

70
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:58.120
So it's hard to do so we only mastered it. Um,

71
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.520
I mean I'm telling an evolutionary story.

72
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:05.470
So my story begins 10 million years ago with primate ancestors who adapted to

73
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:09.160
alcohol. And just so 10 million years ago,

74
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.160
about 20,000 years ago and 13,000 years ago,

75
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:18.670
we start making alcohol seriously, not just relying on fruit,

76
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.560
lying around that has some alcohol in it.

77
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.690
And then distillation happens probably around 13 hundreds in

78
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:30.220
China and 15, 16 hundreds in Europe. So that sounds like a long time ago,

79
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:33.520
but it really evolutionarily it's yesterday. We just,

80
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.780
we really haven't had time culturally or genetically to adapt,

81
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:39.490
to access to this kind of alcohol.

82
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.170
<v 2>And a long time ago when people were drinking beer and, um,</v>

83
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.800
drinking wine in particular, like a lot of what they were doing.

84
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:49.570
Like if they were carrying it around with them,

85
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:53.260
they would carry beer or wine when they were going on trips,

86
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.650
because it didn't go bad the way water would. Right.

87
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.340
<v 0>Um, beer and hopped beer. It goes bad pretty quickly.</v>

88
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.290
It's like a couple of days, a couple of days. Yeah. Um, there's a theory that,

89
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.480
uh, beer might've been useful in some cultures because it pure fermenting water

90
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:11.650
purifies the water.

91
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.920
<v 2>So you've got bad water from a pond or something like that.</v>

92
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:16.900
And then you ferment it and make beer out of it. Yeah.

93
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.300
<v 0>Yeah. So that's one of the stories. I mean,</v>

94
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:23.830
the purpose of my book is to try to explain the puzzle of why we do this.

95
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:27.400
Why do we put poisons into our body? Why do we like to drink?

96
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.400
And it's mysterious because it's, so it's really costly. It's,

97
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:33.340
it's damaging physiologically.

98
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:35.740
It's got all these social potential social problems,

99
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.870
and yet we've been doing it forever.

100
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.640
We've been making and drinking alcohol for just about as long as we've been

101
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:47.110
doing anything in an organized fashion. In fact, we, the, it,

102
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.490
it's looking likely that we were doing this before agriculture and that it's

103
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:52.810
possible that the,

104
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.250
the desire to make beer and wine is what motivated

105
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.200
agriculture. So hunter gatherers,

106
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:04.520
hunter gatherers were making beer before they had agriculture

107
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.220
real. Yeah. And.

108
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.310
<v 2>Uh, so they're making clay pots and yeah.</v>

109
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.710
<v 0>There's, um, you know, they're pounding the stuff,</v>

110
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:16.580
they're molting it to up the sugar content. I think that's the effect of that.

111
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.990
And then they're fermenting it. And so we have these sites like, and,

112
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.700
and what's presentate Turkey,

113
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:26.960
the site called go black gay Teppei is this really cool ritual site?

114
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.230
It's um, these huge stone, have you seen?

115
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.500
<v 2>Yeah, I'm super familiar with it because of Graham Hancock.</v>

116
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.040
Who's been on my podcast multiple times and he's obsessed with ancient

117
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:41.270
civilizations and that is sort of the Rosetta stone of ancient civilizations

118
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:44.960
because it's, uh, at least 12,000 years old.

119
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:47.810
And the thought process was at that point in time,

120
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:50.510
no one could build the kind of structures that those people built.

121
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.100
So when they did it, it sort of, uh, it lent credence to his,

122
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:57.230
some of his theories that, um,

123
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.150
civilization has gone through multiple periods of, uh,

124
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.350
Ascension and then resets usually through catastrophic disasters like

125
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:11.120
asteroid impacts. So his theory, um, it, it,

126
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.280
it's not really just his theories,

127
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:17.180
the younger dries impact theory and the younger Dryas impact theory.

128
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:19.670
It's pointing to the end of the ice age,

129
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.750
which coincides with real proof of, uh,

130
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.100
impacts on earth in the sense of, um, they take soil samples.

131
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.900
And when they go down to the same, uh,

132
00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:34.370
amount of time where the ice age ended,

133
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.520
they find this stuff called, um,

134
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.890
it's called nuclear glass or trite night and this stuff, it,

135
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.490
it, it occurs at blast sites where they test nuclear weapons,

136
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.290
but it also occurs at asteroid impact sites and they find it all over the place

137
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.690
at around 12,000,

138
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:59.240
12,000 ish years ago. And so this theory is,

139
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.880
um, that at the end of the ice age,

140
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:06.860
what had happened was we pass through an area in our solar system that

141
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:10.760
is rich with comments, and then we were hit and that, um,

142
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.510
it literally restarted civilization killed off a massive amount of people and

143
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.880
stopped civilizations done dead in its tracks.

144
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.560
And then there's a period of rebuilding.

145
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.110
<v 0>So let's go, [inaudible].</v>

146
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.760
<v 2>Rebuilding. Now. They don't know. Right. It's all speculation. Cause go,</v>

147
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:30.710
Beckley Tampa was for sure covered on purpose somewhere around

148
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:31.880
12,000 years ago,

149
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.960
but that doesn't indicate how long ago before then it was built. Right.

150
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.590
But what they do know is it was made with some pretty sophisticated methods

151
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:43.790
because a lot of the carvings were three-dimensional instead of carved into the

152
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:47.900
stone, the stone around it was carved away, right. To leave.

153
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:50.720
And there's also like animals in it that aren't even supposed to be from that

154
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:53.960
part of the world. They find that pretty fascinating. Yeah.

155
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:56.700
There's some pretty cool to it. And it's huge, you know, they've only uncovered,

156
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:58.170
I think like 10% of it so far.

157
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.760
<v 0>Cool site. So the,</v>

158
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.410
the role it plays in my story is that you they're hunter gatherers,

159
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:05.244
the people that built this.

160
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.550
<v 2>They used to think that, but they're not necessarily sure of that.</v>

161
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.850
This is the theory that guy Hancock is proposing. All right.

162
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.770
He believes that civilization.

163
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.860
<v 0>They were full on agriculture and they were.</v>

164
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.990
<v 2>Just completely theoretical because, and very disputed. Okay.</v>

165
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.010
Because you're dealing with, you know, it's like so long ago, it's hard.

166
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:27.420
Like what, what evidence is there?

167
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.510
And this was always the evidence against something like go Beckley Tappy.

168
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.630
Where's the evidence of sophisticated structures 12,000 years ago.

169
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.650
And then finally they found go back Taipei. So now they're like, okay,

170
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.650
well now we have evidence of sophisticated structures, 12,000 years ago,

171
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:45.360
which should have been built according to our timeline by hunter gatherers. But,

172
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.360
um, they are, they're, they're, they're resisting that.

173
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:53.010
And they're thinking this younger Dryas impact theory may indicate

174
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.620
that there was something that happened that, you know, if you look at Egypt,

175
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:03.180
there's clearly more than one era of, uh, building, uh, styles.

176
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.360
There's like an old kingdom style, a new key.

177
00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:08.730
And a lot of the old stuff is like deep under the sand when they're finding it.

178
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.980
And it's their position that a lot of this stuff is thousands of years older

179
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:14.814
than the period.

180
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.990
<v 0>Okay. So my,</v>

181
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:20.280
my understanding of the site is that it was a hunter hunter gatherers.

182
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.740
Uh, there there's no grain storage locations. They were clearly gathering.

183
00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:29.790
They were coming from all over and they were gathering at this site to build.

184
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.760
So they were working to, you know, rec these pillars and stuff,

185
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.180
and they were having blowout fees. So they have all this,

186
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:40.920
these remnants of feasting and they have these big vats that almost

187
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:45.090
certainly contained beer and possibly hallucinogen lace beer. So like.

188
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.860
<v 2>So these hunter gatherers, they weren't growing the,</v>

189
00:10:47.861 --> 00:10:50.880
the hops or whatever they made the beer out of. They were just finding it while.

190
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.030
<v 0>They're making it out of wild grains. But the argument, so,</v>

191
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:58.200
so the standard story about alcohol is we invent agriculture.

192
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.100
Then sometime after that, we note that, you know,

193
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:05.670
someone leaves or sourdough starter out too long and it starts to turn into beer

194
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:08.670
and they're like, oh, this actually tastes all right, that's the standard story.

195
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:13.590
So we had agriculture and then we get alcohol around the 1950s

196
00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:16.650
or so as an archeologist started to argue, you know,

197
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:20.640
sites like this one and other sites around the world suggest that hunter

198
00:11:20.641 --> 00:11:24.810
gatherers were gathering and making alcohol before agriculture.

199
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.670
And so this is the beer before bread hypothesis is that's crazy.

200
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:33.630
Is that what motivated people to settle down and start focusing on making these

201
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:37.020
grains more productive was they wanted to get high,

202
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.980
not because they wanted to make bread and it it's, it jives.

203
00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:44.760
You see the same pattern in other parts of the world. So in south America,

204
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.980
they make this, uh, beer like substance Chicho out of now,

205
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:51.780
they make it out of maze out of corn,

206
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.120
but they used to make it out of the ancient.

207
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.390
The wild ancestor of corn is called teosinte.

208
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.580
And what's interesting is Teo Sint day sucks for making grain.

209
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.980
Like if your goal was to make tortillas,

210
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.090
you wouldn't even notice this plant because the grains don't make very good

211
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:15.370
grain products to eat, but it makes great beer is really good for making Chicho.

212
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.533
So this plant,

213
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.080
if these early people were looking for something to make food with,

214
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:21.460
they would overlook this plant.

215
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.160
But if they were looking for something to make beer with,

216
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.450
they would focus on it, cultivate it, start making it produce bigger grains,

217
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:30.130
and that's how you would get corn. Okay.

218
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.690
<v 2>It's like, what was the, did they,</v>

219
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.500
do we know what the original thing that they got high with was, well,

220
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:39.460
we have like, uh, like the, the, you know, the first,

221
00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:40.690
the Adam and Eve.

222
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.160
<v 0>Yeah. I mean,</v>

223
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.570
certainly we're getting a little bit drunk on just naturally fermenting fruit.

224
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.090
So not, you know, fruit falls on the ground.

225
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.790
It starts to rot what the rotting is,

226
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:54.700
is some of it's being turned into alcohol by yeast. And so clear.

227
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.970
It's easy to discover alcohol because it's happening naturally in our

228
00:12:57.971 --> 00:12:59.050
environment all the time.

229
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.850
The earliest evidence of deliberately produced alcohol is from about

230
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:08.230
13,000 years ago. So a little bit before, late Taipei. Um,

231
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:12.400
and this is in, uh, modern day Israel. They have traces of,

232
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.670
of beer production. So people are clearly fermenting beer.
