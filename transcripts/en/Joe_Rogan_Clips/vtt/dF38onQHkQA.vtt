1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 3>Floyd defeated it too, but he's not the greatest boxer of all.</v>

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.440
<v 1>Times. Right? It's arguable. He is it's arguable. He is. Don't think so.</v>

4
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.440
Listen, man. He is, he's my favorite. He's been hit hard,

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.240
maybe four times his whole career.

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.280
You stop and think about how many fights he fought against great elite.

7
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.310
Not just great defense, like the best defense of all time. Yeah. Yeah.

8
00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:24.910
You're talking about a guy. Who's fought everybody. You fought everybody.

9
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.510
He fought Canello he fought PA maybe he didn't fight PA when he was in his prime

10
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.310
and maybe he fought canal when he was young and he made him cut extra weight.

11
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.950
He did some &lt;laugh&gt; some smart. But at the end of the day,

12
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.790
that's far beat a fighter though, right? That, yeah. At the end of the day,

13
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.180
the guy's 50, 50, well, 49 in con McGregor. Right? That's what he is.

14
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:44.580
That's what I say. 49 49 kinda. Yeah, because it's kind of weird record.

15
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.340
<v 2>But it's kind weird. Somebody like sugar, Ray Robinson, you know,</v>

16
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:49.980
sugar Ray Robinson different. Yeah. That that's, you know, different time,

17
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:54.220
different time. What's yeah. Yeah. He lost, uh,

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.420
he lost 15.

19
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.260
<v 1>I think sugar Ray Robinson had somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 plus</v>

20
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.970
victories before his first defeat though. What is like how many's his first.

21
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.890
<v 2>Something? His first defeat was the, wasn't it to Jack Lama. Jake.</v>

22
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.770
<v 1>Lamma Jake LA may. How old was.</v>

23
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.770
<v 0>He? Was he out of his.</v>

24
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.570
<v 1>Prime? No, that might have been heed out. Defeat knocked.</v>

25
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.530
<v 2>Out, knocked out. He got knocked out.</v>

26
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.530
<v 1>No, LA I thought he got knocked. Billy con no.</v>

27
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.320
<v 2>Jack Lamma knocked him out. Jake it's Jake.</v>

28
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.120
I don't think me and names is terrible. So it's like.

29
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.360
<v 1>I think he, I think he beat him in a decision in the first fight.</v>

30
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.880
And then Robinson beat the out of him in the second fight. No, no, no, really.

31
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.320
<v 2>They fought six times. They fought six times and uh, Robinson won,</v>

32
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:40.600
knocked him out. Robinson fought him, uh, beat him at the first, first time.

33
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:45.190
And I think in the rematch is when, uh, when, uh, Jake Lamada knocked him out,

34
00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:48.470
knocked him out. I don't remember that. And then, and then in the sixth fight,

35
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.990
uh, he TKO Jake, uh, um,

36
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.430
but it was a standing TKO. Yeah. And he never, you know,

37
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:58.990
he never got knocked off of his feet. Right. And that, that, you know,

38
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.590
and he was, you know, talking to, well, you stopped me,

39
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:04.420
but you didn't never put down. Never put me down.

40
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.980
<v 1>Yeah. That was a, that was the St Valentine's day Maco, right? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:12.340
When he went through the ropes and he was he's like laying, just getting, yeah.

42
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.173
<v 2>Just getting pound.</v>

43
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.860
<v 1>The ropes. Yeah. That guy had a ridiculous chin,</v>

44
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.900
crazy eating shots like that from sugar Ray Robinson. Yeah.

45
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.340
But that wasn't that at middle weight too.

46
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.340
And Robinson really started off at 1 47.

47
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.090
<v 2>Yeah. I think it was lighter. I think he started it even lighter. It was 40.</v>

48
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.690
See a pull.

49
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.450
<v 1>Up 44, his record sugar, Ray Robinson, his.</v>

50
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.290
<v 2>Sugar Ray Robinson boxing record his record's like 200 and almost 200 fights.</v>

51
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.290
<v 0>Crazy. That's crazy. Why can't we get 50? Something like that.</v>

52
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.010
How could we can't get that many fights in MMA? Oh.

53
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.680
<v 1>It's more than that. Well, in boxing, his 200 fight was,</v>

54
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.560
well, I'll do that a hundred seventy three, nineteen six against Joey Archer.

55
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.320
Um, that's his 200th fight. Go, go back to his, uh,

56
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.720
first loss or go back to the Jake Lam fights. He gotta go way back, stop her.

57
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.400
Um, those are all win, win, win, win, win, win, win, Jake Lamona.

58
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.280
So he beat him at 36 and oh, and then he lost, uh, unanimous decision. Yeah,

59
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.800
that was right. Uh, 40. And then he beat him again, unanimous decision.

60
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.760
So he lost unanimous decision to Jake Lomano and then he beat everybody else up

61
00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:21.350
into a jaw, a draw with Jose Bara Beso rather.

62
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.230
So he made it to 40, you know? Yeah. I thought it was a lot more than that.

63
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.110
So his 40, his 41st fight, he lost. That was his first lost.

64
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.870
And it was a decision that Jake Laman, I guess Floyd really is a goat.

65
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.590
I think he's the goat, you know, it's a different era.

66
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.270
Here's the thing it's like, you know, well,

67
00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:40.100
you look at Mike to Tyson when he was in, I, we,

68
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.940
we just had this conversation yesterday on the podcast,

69
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.380
but I think Mike Tyson in his prime, when he knocked out Larry Holmes,

70
00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:48.540
when he was, when he starched Mar Frazier,

71
00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:50.180
like when he was just smashing everybody,

72
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.700
I think he had reached this level that you can only maintain for a certain

73
00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:55.500
amount of years. Yeah. You know, whether, like,

74
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.100
I think the same thing you could say for Fedor when he was,

75
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.650
was in his prime when he was running things in pride. Yeah.

76
00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:04.050
There's a level that you could reach that can only maintain for a certain amount

77
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:08.370
of years. And it's real hard because I think this is what I said yesterday.

78
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.090
I think if Muhammad Ali had been in the same era as Mike Tyson,

79
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.370
he would've been better because Mike Tyson was around you,

80
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:19.450
you get better dependent upon who's around you. And the,

81
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.640
when you war in an era, you're kind of defined by your competition.

82
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.200
Ali was defined by Joe Frazier and defined by Joe Foreman and,

83
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.480
and all the guys that he fought, Ken Norton,

84
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.600
all those guys that he fought in his era, but there's,

85
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:35.760
it's a different era Tyson. It's a different era. You're.

86
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.880
<v 2>Also forgetting that he'd be, yeah. You know, Floyd, uh, uh, Floyd Patterson,</v>

87
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.790
uh, you know, it's like before, you know,

88
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:45.150
like all the fights that he had before he, you know, came back, you know,

89
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:47.870
but those just weren't competitive. Right. You know, he was so fast,

90
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.430
he hit so hard, you know, beating Sonny Liston, you know, Sonny Liston,

91
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.910
you know, he was a murderer back then. Yeah. He's freaking killer. Yeah.

92
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.430
<v 1>It's like he destroyed Floyd Patterson twice. Yeah. Twice in a round. Right.</v>

93
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.870
He was, he couldn't, you couldn't, he couldn't get hit by him.

94
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.380
You just couldn't get hit by him. Yeah. Had giant hands, you know.

95
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.340
<v 2>A guy that was close, close to the mafia, you know, he's like, and uh,</v>

96
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.060
so he beat all those guys, you know, it's like, and yep. You know, it's like,

97
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:16.820
so maybe if he doesn't have that three years off, you know, maybe, maybe, yeah.

98
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.860
Maybe who knows, but he did knows, but he did.

99
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.010
<v 1>And it's also, he was a different cultural figure. Right.</v>

100
00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:25.770
Because when you look at like his impact on society and civilization,

101
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.450
he stood for something, right. He was a guy who was like,

102
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.890
I'm not going to fighting this war. It doesn't make any sense.

103
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.930
They took his title away from him and the people loved him. Yeah. It was,

104
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.210
it's a different, well.

105
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.610
<v 2>It different about 50% of the population hated him. Right.</v>

106
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.410
And then 50% of the population loved him and thought he was the greatest thing

107
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:44.560
ever. Yeah. You know, it's like, I ain't going over there to fight any vehicle.

108
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.680
They didn't do anything to me. It's like, uh, you know, he's a very,

109
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:52.440
very interesting, you know, figure. And then you got somebody like, uh,

110
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.640
you know, Joe Frazier, you know, uh, you know, very, very good fighter,

111
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.120
you know,

112
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.360
won the Olympic gold medal was an alternate going into the Olympics and, and,

113
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.480
uh, and the alternate, you know, I forget what happened over there. Uh,

114
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.880
you know, he ended up not fighting. Joe fought, he won the Olympic gold medal.

115
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.960
They, they actually rematched, uh, as pros and then Joe stopped him. I,

116
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.790
I fourth or fifth round. Wow. Um, and, uh, you know, he was a beast, you know,

117
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.190
and then George Foreman, you know, it's like,

118
00:06:20.191 --> 00:06:22.990
that's the guy that didn't ever put on a pair of gloves still. He was, I think,

119
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.070
19 years old. Right. That's crazy. You know, it's like 19 years old.

120
00:06:26.071 --> 00:06:28.710
Think about that. There's just not that many guys that have, you know,

121
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.910
it's never put on a pair of gloves, Stella,

122
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.270
19 years old and then get to that level. Well, that's.

123
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.710
<v 1>The Deontay Wilder story too, you know, is it yeah.</v>

124
00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:39.860
Deontay Wilder bought for a year and a half before he won a bronze medal in the

125
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:40.860
Olympics. Okay.

126
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.700
<v 2>Uh, George Foreman, George Foreman won the gold medal in the seventies.</v>

127
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.100
You know, when, when it's like, when it was even, I think harder, you know,

128
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.260
when the gold medal cuz because of the Cubans and the Russians, you know,

129
00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:55.940
it's like they, they never went to pro and stuff like that. You had that right.

130
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.660
Um.

131
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.493
<v 1>To Phillip Stevenson.</v>

132
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.130
<v 2>Um, and so it's like,</v>

133
00:06:59.131 --> 00:07:03.530
I think it was the 76 Olympics that he won the gold medal and he was like 24

134
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:07.410
fights as an amateur. That's all the fights. He had never lost that's nuts.

135
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.290
And it's like, you know, and just crazy. Uh.

136
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.210
<v 1>He fought just 20 times as an amateur before traveling to Mexico city for the</v>

137
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.290
19 88, 19 68 Olympic games. Amazing.

138
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.000
<v 2>You know, and never lost. And then, so that like, think about that, you know,</v>

139
00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:24.760
this, guy's walking through guys like Joe Frazier and then he fights, uh,

140
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:28.440
older Muhammad Ali mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, and you know, and then gets,

141
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.000
you know, knocked out in the eighth, you know, it's like crazy, you know,

142
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.720
he believed that he was invincible. You know, he, you know,

143
00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:36.640
arguably the hardest hitter ever. Yeah. You know, it's like,

144
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.840
you know what would've happened to Mike Tyson.

145
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.790
We might not have known who Mike Tyson was if he would've been around in,

146
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.343
in those days, you know.

147
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.710
<v 1>It's like, who knows or Mike Tyson would've smashed him. Yeah. You know,</v>

148
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.590
you just don't know he was faster than everybody.

149
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.310
The thing about Mike Tyson as a, as a knockout fighter,

150
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.870
if you watch like the Mar Frazier fighter, I don't think.

151
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.790
<v 2>Faster. The Muhammad Ali though, I don't think.</v>

152
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.670
<v 1>He was faster. Um.</v>

153
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.500
<v 2>Mo feet were so fast. Cause you, you faster than you gotta think back to,</v>

154
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.020
you know, when he fought Sonny list, when he fought Floyd, pat,

155
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.300
you gotta think of how his feet were then.

156
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.860
<v 1>But the three years afterwards, I think he was faster than I, when,</v>

157
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.780
when he fought, like when he came back.

158
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.380
<v 2>You think that Mike Tyson was faster than that version of yeah.</v>

159
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.740
I agree with that. Yeah. I agree with that.

160
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.770
<v 1>Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Ali was a different animal.</v>

161
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.370
No one had been around before him. There was a heavyweight,

162
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.450
they moved like that. They didn't exist. Well, Andy.

163
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.210
<v 2>Probably the best chin ever.</v>

164
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.290
<v 1>An amazing chin. He wasn't that heavy for a heavyweight though.</v>

165
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.250
<v 2>Right? No, no. He fought, he, he, he, the Olympic gold medal he won was cruiser,</v>

166
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:38.570
right? Wasn't yeah. He didn't fight at heavyweight. Um, yeah. Um,

167
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:41.280
he moved up to heavy for when he turned pro.

168
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.920
<v 1>Who was the English guy that knocked him down and they cut his George, uh,</v>

169
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:50.840
George. No, um, yeah. George, was it George? Yeah,

170
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:51.674
it was.

171
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.080
<v 2>George English guy, George. Um.</v>

172
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.313
<v 1>I'm trying to remember.</v>

173
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.880
He was a British gentleman who had a really good love hook.

174
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.040
<v 2>And he caught him with a left hook and robbed him and had him in all kinds of</v>

175
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:06.200
trouble. And uh, then they, they, there was a tear, his glove tear on his glove.

176
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.960
George starts with an H if I remember right. He tore his glove.

177
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:13.880
Why they tear his glove? Well, he had a small little rip and, and his corner,

178
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.550
you know, what's his trainer's name to the glove a little bit.

179
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.510
And they tried to find a player of gloves and it halted the action of the fight

180
00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:23.390
for about five minutes.

181
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.430
And it gave Muhammad Ali the time to clear his head and then they resumed the

182
00:09:27.431 --> 00:09:29.510
fight. They never found another player of gloves to put on,

183
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.030
on him in the middle of the round. Think about this, this like,

184
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:35.660
wasn't it Henry something. Yeah. Henry Henry. They cornering.

185
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.820
<v 1>Henry Cooper. There it is. There it is. It's good. Cornering. Yeah, it was good.</v>

186
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.300
<v 2>Cornering. And, and it's like,</v>

187
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:44.260
and then he went out there and he stopped him on Angela cuts. Yeah. Yeah.

188
00:09:44.261 --> 00:09:47.660
He stopped him on cuts. And I don't remember if it was the next round or the,

189
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.860
the following round. Yeah. You know, but he, he cut really, really easy.

190
00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:55.100
They said they had, uh, his skin. He'd just get bumped. See if you could find.

191
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.690
<v 1>That when Henry Cooper drops him, cuz it's crazy.</v>

192
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.290
<v 2>He heard him he's but he's like, he, he looks dead,</v>

193
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.290
his hits and he pops back up, you know, it's like,

194
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.330
but it's like when Joe Frazier, when Joe Frazier dropped him, you know,

195
00:10:08.331 --> 00:10:11.610
it's like his hit and, and he pops right back up. He's crazy. Looks.
