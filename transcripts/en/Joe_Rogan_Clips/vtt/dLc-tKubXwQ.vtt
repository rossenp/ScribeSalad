WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.030
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. Boom. And we're live speaking of vacations.</v>

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.560
Tell me about Guyana.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.830
<v 1>Yeah, that was a good segue. You've been there a bunch, you know?</v>

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.600
No. While I was in, no, I I've been to Guyana twice between there.

5
00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:22.250
I went to Bolivia and did like very similar, very similar kind of trip,

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.960
like doing a river trip with Amerindians. Are those.

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.490
<v 0>People weirded out by Americans because of the Jonestown massacre thing?</v>

8
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.541
<v 1>It's so funny.</v>

9
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:34.940
You bring up Jonestown because there's a couple things I've been surprised.

10
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:39.890
Like, uh, the, the, so the,

11
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:43.220
the, the main group I was with in Guyana, um,

12
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.110
is the [inaudible]. And I was surprised one day when I was, they

13
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.110
, they make a dish, they make a dish with a

14
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 cassava, which is a root, like manioc, um,

15
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 they make a dish with that. They make a flower

16
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 from it and make a dish. And I was one day saying, Hey, that's a little, it

17
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 looks like pizza. Right? No. Right

18
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.110
, right. No comprehension, but like, no thought of what pizza is. I remember thinking like, wow, man, like you take like such a, you know, you just consider such a part of everyday life 

19
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.110
it's pizza. Know what it was. Yeah

20
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.110
. And they don't know about Georgetown. Whoa. Even those

21
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 in their own country, they don't know about it at all. No, it's just not, but 

22
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.110
you like, we'll get into this, but you got to

23
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 like realize sort of how insular, you know, and

24
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.943
 the Amerindian communities are, who live in the, in the jungle in Guyana.

25
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.310
<v 0>Did they have communication on any.</v>

26
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.880
<v 1>More and more now? And there was a lot, a lot change.</v>

27
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.580
The two times I went there with her five or six years apart,

28
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.410
they discovered sunglasses.

29
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.620
And I remember the first time I was down there trying to turn them on. Cause,

30
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.060
uh, you know, they, they, they bow hunt for fish. Right.

31
00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:55.220
Which is one of the main ways they get fish is bow hunt for fish.

32
00:01:55.221 --> 00:02:00.140
And when you're looking into the water, polarized lenses are invaluable.

33
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.330
I feel lost without fish, under water. And I kept saying, man,

34
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.230
you got to get on board with polarized sunglasses, not handed to him.

35
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.760
He didn't like it. This guy Rove.

36
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:13.400
And he didn't like anything about having them on his face. He just like,

37
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.460
couldn't do it. But then I go down to five years later and um,

38
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.600
every one of those boys is rocket polarized glasses. So you see changes.

39
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.201
But yeah,

40
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:25.430
that's the thing like I've brought up Jonestown a number of times because in the

41
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.800
us, if you say, Hey, I'm going to Guyana,

42
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.830
all anybody says is don't drink the Kool-Aid. Right? Yeah.

43
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.120
It wasn't really Kool-Aid.

44
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.230
<v 0>It was some like Kool-Aid no, it was a Kool-Aid type drink.</v>

45
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.580
<v 1>No. So when people look at, when we had this conversation,</v>

46
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.580
cause there's a couple of things that are important here, what the poison was.

47
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.140
Right. So we had a conversation,

48
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.750
I looked back up the route. I mentioned that they make a root. Yeah.

49
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.270
So there's a root cassava. And it's like, yeah.

50
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.200
So it's the route that gives all life. They eat, they call it. No,

51
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.180
but I mean they eat fish and game. Okay.

52
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.490
River fish and wild game. And then that's like a staple that they eat every day.

53
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:07.324
And the only thing they,

54
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.950
every day is a half dozen things all produced

55
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:13.150
from cassava,

56
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.200
which is kind of like a yam and it's cultivated with slash and burn agriculture.

57
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.580
And they cultivate these yams. And from it, they make a flower.

58
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.540
Um, they make a, a type of grain. It's like cous, cous.

59
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.790
They make a syrup that's used as a coloring

60
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:35.560
agent and a flavoring agent. They make a non-alcoholic drink.

61
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.760
They make a somewhat alcoholic drink. That would be like an equivalent to beer.

62
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.430
And then they make a much more alcoholic drink,

63
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.420
which would be an equivalent like fortified wine. Wow.

64
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.260
They make all this stuff from this, this route to take grow, um,

65
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.780
in its raw form when you shred the root and squeeze the

66
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.740
shredding. So it'd be like,

67
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.460
imagine you took a yam and shredded a yam and then squeeze the add between your

68
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:05.320
hands and tripped out of liquid. That liquid is deadly poisonous. Okay. Dogs,

69
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.120
chickens, people, anything that drinks that liquid die. Yes.

70
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.040
Jesus and it's cyanide. So wow. The Jonestown massacre,

71
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.890
uh, it was a cocktail.

72
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.503
<v 2>Of.</v>

73
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.980
<v 1>The best people think that it was Kool-Aid flavor, aid</v>

74
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.680
value and potassium cyanide.

75
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.010
My question coming home from Ghana was like,

76
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.390
did they was the cyanide from the root?

77
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.410
Were they like doing homemade cyanide? But, and so when I got home,

78
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:41.370
I looked into this and it's,

79
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.390
and it seems as though that that commune Jonestown commune

80
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.040
had been ordering actual potassium cyanide,

81
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.670
which is used in a number of mining practices and other stuff.

82
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.200
So it's an available,

83
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.290
it's an available compound and that's what they laced the Kool-Aid with.

84
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.360
<v 0>I had heard about this cassava stuff.</v>

85
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.540
And what do they know what the process is like?

86
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.610
Did they know like how people figured out how to make it non-poisonous oh, wow.

87
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:09.690
It's just been done so long.

88
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.143
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.750
Stuff with like different poisons they use to poison that people use to poison

90
00:05:15.751 --> 00:05:17.310
fish. Um,

91
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.350
what strikes me about it is how in the village, like the, the, the,

92
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:26.910
the Macungie village I was in, um, is mostly Macungie,

93
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:29.850
but there's also like wop Ashana, which is another tribe.

94
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.380
Carob is not our tribe,

95
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.890
but it's predominantly a Macungie village and there's about 300 people with a

96
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:39.660
live in this village. Um, and how careless they are with the liquid.

97
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.990
Like if you nowadays like, picture, like,

98
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:46.080
you're like the type of person,

99
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.070
like you and me are married to and raise kids with. Right.

100
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.260
If you had that type of mom and you had a big bowl of a liquid that

101
00:05:55.261 --> 00:05:57.830
would kill you, if you drank a bit

102
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.520
how that bowl would be monitored in your household. TCIs right.

103
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.280
That'd be like barbed wire around it, electrical.

104
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.200
<v 3>Fence, just lazy. They just lay it out. And I said,</v>

105
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.240
I was asked, this guy wrote him, but here, man, uh.

106
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.080
<v 1>I kept returning to this. There's certain things I kept.</v>

107
00:06:16.081 --> 00:06:19.330
I would always ask him just like things that he's struggled to understand my

108
00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:24.130
fixation on it. But I kept saying to this MACUSA guy,

109
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.440
Roven who I should back up to. I got communication. So guy out is the,

110
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.610
it's the only English speaking country in south America. No, no.

111
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.360
The government functions are English. So if you,

112
00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:38.860
if you picture yourself in America,

113
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.870
it's Northeast corner opening out onto the Southern Caribbean

114
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.260
that's guy on it's bordered on the east,

115
00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:51.850
by Suriname on the west, by Venezuela to the south,

116
00:06:51.851 --> 00:06:55.450
by Brazil, it's 90% Virgin rainforest.

117
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.790
And within that, 90% of verge rainforest is only 10% of the population.

118
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.780
So the coastal peoples are like Creole cultures.

119
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.640
People mostly descended from slave trade Europeans in the interior

120
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.390
are the Amerindian groups. And, um,

121
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.230
the government function sort of the power in,

122
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.020
in Guyana is that as the coastal peoples, and there's not a ton of inner inner,

123
00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:26.080
it used to be barely any interplay between the Amerindian communities in the

124
00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:28.330
government, the government's English speaking.

125
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.860
So in you'll find that there's a lot of English mixed in,

126
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.920
in the Amerindian communities, in some people like this guy,

127
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.550
Roven because he's sort of a upping, he's like a,

128
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.950
he has a leadership role in his community and he's learned just standard

129
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.670
English very well. Um, he's had a fascinating life,

130
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.590
just how much stuff has changed for him. Uh, so I, you can just like converse.

131
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.690
Okay. And in a way that you can converse in like an,

132
00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:01.540
a type of the type of English we're talking right now, almost,

133
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.490
which creates this weird tension between the things that you're discussing and

134
00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:08.950
how you're discussing them. Like for instance,

135
00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:13.840
to have a guy just in conversational English, talking about problems,

136
00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:16.900
they're having with neighboring shamans and their own Sharman,

137
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.110
putting curses on each other. And it like creates like,

138
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.250
there's like a strange tension between like how it's being conveyed to you.

139
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.270
You know? Like how so, like, okay,

140
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.190
if you're talking conversational and I guess like a life it's almost like,

141
00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:35.140
you'd want it to be when he's telling you this,

142
00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:38.680
you'd almost want to be reading it in like close caption.

143
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.430
And he'd be saying it in the indigenous language,

144
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:47.350
because it sounds weird to have to have an idea that's so foreign to

145
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:48.184
us,

146
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.870
which would be like a battle of shamans battling over access to wild animals.

147
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.730
Okay. Um,

148
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.500
to that delivered in conversational English just struck me as unusual.

149
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.570
Cause like, usually when you're traveling,

150
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.070
you're getting all of your information, like traveling and Bolivia,

151
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.360
a guy would tell a story and he'd tell a story in, um,

152
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.650
SIM Shan. No one was saying that same Shan Chimani okay.

153
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.910
He tells story in Chimani to a person who spoke Spanish,

154
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.020
the person who speaks Spanish would tell it to a person.

155
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.960
No, no, no. That Yamane guy telling someone who speaks German and Spanish,

156
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.330
then that person telling it to a person who speaks Spanish and

157
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:34.164
English.

158
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.610
And then that person giving you the information when you get it

159
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.410
through that, it takes on a mystical quality. Like you're crossing some space,

160
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:45.330
time thing, right.

161
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.530
Where you're seeing like these ideas discussed in their ancestral tongue.

162
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.660
Okay. Yeah. Remember I sent you a video of a guy talking about killing a Jaguar.

163
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.470
Yes. Right. The language you've never like when he's speaking, you're like,

164
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.000
I've never in all my travels.

165
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:02.820
I've never heard a language that sounds anything like that is a.

166
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.060
<v 0>Video online. Can we play that it's online? Do you know the title of it?</v>

167
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.770
It's uh.

168
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.520
<v 1>I think if you type in like, um,</v>

169
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.100
[inaudible] T S I Chimani Jaguar

170
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:15.590
CTA.

171
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.880
<v 0>See if Jamie can pull it up. It's very cool. The language is really amazing.</v>

172
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.770
Seems so ancient. Yeah. Yes.

173
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.280
<v 1>It's not like, has nothing to do with like the Latin languages just.</v>

174
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.800
<v 0>Sounds so it's, it's very unique.</v>

175
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.620
<v 1>So I guess what I'm getting at is to hear someone talking about something in</v>

176
00:10:30.621 --> 00:10:31.820
conversational English,

177
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.930
that seems so far removed from just our understanding of things.

178
00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:37.490
It takes on a weird quality,

179
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.600
but what's nice about it is you can go to a place where life is so vastly

180
00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:46.040
different than anything we understand and just get like the straight dope right

181
00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:50.960
from the source is why I love. It's kinda like, what's so cool about Guyana,

182
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.650
because you can go and converse with, with people who are,

183
00:10:54.651 --> 00:10:57.500
are very much a hunter gatherer culture today,

184
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.180
but just shoot the with them without ever feeling like you're missing something.

185
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.200
Wow.

186
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.460
This is like the everything's not lost in translation and all weird and garbled

187
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.070
and, and like painstaking to Wade through.

188
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.630
But you can just ask like, Hey, what's up with the local Sharman? Oh,

189
00:11:14.631 --> 00:11:19.070
I'll give you the dope on the Laurel. And so they trade spells.

190
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.170
Yeah. Well, yeah, we'll talk about that. But I,

191
00:11:21.171 --> 00:11:25.850
I feel like I was laying the groundwork for, uh, the Jim Jones poison.

192
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.140
Did you find the video? I,

193
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.820
I lost the word that you were spelling that T S I M

194
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.560
a N E.

195
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.740
<v 0>T S I M a N E. What does that mean? Shamani, that's how it is. You spell.</v>

196
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.540
<v 1>It. I could be, I could be screwing up.</v>

197
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.690
You know how you spell a lot worse when you're not actually writing it out.

198
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.583
Yeah.

199
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.380
<v 0>I don't know how anybody wins a spelling bee ever</v>

200
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.080
Tumani is TSI. Yeah. So if.

201
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.610
<v 1>You type in Chimani Jaguar,</v>

202
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.240
T S I M a N E Jaguar.

203
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.670
<v 2>Wow. The whole.</v>

204
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:05.620
<v 1>Thing is an Amerindian hunter remembers his best dog lost to a Jaguar in the</v>

205
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:08.110
jungles of Bolivia. Right. Here we go. Let's play this because.

206
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.480
<v 2>It's awesome. Here we go.</v>

207
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.313
<v 4>The</v>

208
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.670
following is an interview with a member of the Tumani tribe of Bolivia,

209
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.850
do their inherent difficulties of translating indigenous languages.

210
00:12:20.851 --> 00:12:23.940
Subtitles are at times approximate and the

211
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.050
see mom, that theme

212
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:33.900
[inaudible]

213
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:33.900
. So he's explaining where he's from. He's saying he hunts for food. I always share. 

214
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:33.900
That means I get with the family. I'm a good provider of meat

215
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:33.900
 cutting up the meat and this video. Yes. I also enjoy

216
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:33.900
 the adventure. I love trekking through the jungle. Once I was hunting with my favorite dog and a couple 

217
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.733
of the dogs, they ran ahead barky and they were going after something.

218
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.280
All of a sudden, my favorite dog just went completely silent.

219
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.680
They were about 50 meters ahead of me. When I got there,

220
00:13:10.681 --> 00:13:12.450
the other dogs had gone ahead after something

221
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.390
[inaudible] saying, my favorite dog was laying there dead.

222
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.450
There was a big hole in his right side. Almost looked like it had been arrowed.

223
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:25.681
If we didn't hit.

224
00:13:25.681 --> 00:13:29.520
The first thing I do is pick up my dog and set him where the ants wouldn't get

225
00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.360
in his body. That dog was the bravest one I had.

226
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.180
I'm not going to translate into more, I guess,

227
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.650
just watching the video if you're interested,

228
00:13:40.651 --> 00:13:45.300
but you get a sense of how cool it is. So did we cover the,

229
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.620
did we fully cover the poison.

230
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.980
<v 1>Thing? No, not really. So I got home. Yeah. So it wasn't the same poison, but.</v>

231
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.530
<v 2>Jim Jones, uh, he grew up in like, uh, he was involved.</v>

232
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.260
<v 1>In a Pentecostal church. He's involved in the Methodist church.</v>

233
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.360
Then he kind of became a healer and started his

234
00:14:03.361 --> 00:14:05.310
own cult. And it was funny.

235
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.500
I was reading about him when I was trying to figure out the poison.

236
00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:10.350
I was reading about how he was kind of ahead of his time because the Jim Jones

237
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.580
massacre was 1979 in a 78 or 79.

238
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.860
And one thing that got him sideways with his church was that he wanted to have

239
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.680
an interracial service. Wow.

240
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:27.150
And that caused friction in his church at the time earlier in his career.

241
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.300
And he moved out to the bay area and started this church.

242
00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:33.840
And then he got like kind of paranoid and thought that his congregants shouldn't

243
00:14:33.841 --> 00:14:37.500
be engaging in sexual activities, but he had, he was syring,

244
00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:40.710
illegitimate children left, and right. They go down to Guyana,

245
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.490
go out to the jungle. You know, a thousand of them down there,

246
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.400
people in the U S from the bay area, kind of like,

247
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.930
wonder what happened to their loved ones.

248
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.930
They send a Congressman down there to try to figure out what's going on.

249
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:58.070
He shows up with a bunch of cameras. The Congressman says, you know, he's like,

250
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.130
I'm going to help anyone who wants to go back to the bay area,

251
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:04.700
go back to the bay area. He goes to the airstrip there's was a shootout.

252
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:07.250
The Congress, the U S Congressman gets killed in the shootout.

253
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:12.500
And then they just all start killing themselves with the poison

254
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.810
and firearms and other,

255
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.730
270 some kids over 900 people. Yeah.

256
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:22.460
I remember it's like the defining thing, but then yeah,

257
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:24.980
when you talk to these boys, I'm like, you know, Georgetown,

258
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:28.960
like the Jonestown or the, you know, the Jim Jones, Jonestown massacre.

259
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.740
<v 3>Never drank the Kool-Aid like, no.</v>

260
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.680
<v 0>See, I hadn't heard it was, it was budget Kool-Aid or no, that's the dumbest.</v>

261
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.580
It was. And I.

262
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.870
<v 1>And that's a debate.</v>

263
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.800
And it trying to find like trying to like dig around and find the source of the

264
00:15:41.801 --> 00:15:45.550
Sinai, which became very important to me to learn for some reason. Um,

265
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.510
no, and I think Kool-Aid even tried to distance himself from it probably it was

266
00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:52.480
Kool-Aid, but there there's like some archival stuff.

267
00:15:52.481 --> 00:15:54.340
And I guess in this archival stuff,

268
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.380
images like footage taken around and photographs around people have found out

269
00:15:59.381 --> 00:16:04.150
that they had both aide and Kool-Aid on hand.

270
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.000
<v 0>That's hilarious what it was. Kool-Aid propaganda.</v>

271
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.950
It was trying to pass the buck on the flavor aid.

272
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.850
<v 1>So yeah, no, no thing there. And if you,</v>

273
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:17.080
so if you go up the main river that drains, uh,

274
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.540
the main river, that drains guy on is the Weebo.

275
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.480
And if you go way up the SQE Weebo and, um, you'll,

276
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:25.890
you'll get to in a stream that comes in from there called the roup, a Noonan,

277
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.250
you go up the roof Nooney,

278
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.490
and then you get to the Rewa and at the mouth of the Rewa and Rupa,

279
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.840
Nuni is Rewa village. And in Rewa village, you're,

280
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.293
uh,

281
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:42.310
isolated enough where you don't know about 900 Americans.

282
00:16:42.311 --> 00:16:44.770
And in some other people from other areas night, you know,

283
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.600
dying in a mass suicide.

284
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:51.580
<v 0>Wow. That's that's around the time you were born. That's fascinating that it's,</v>

285
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.990
it makes sense though, that they're just so removed from it. Yeah. Do they, um,

286
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.630
do they use agriculture? Like how are they getting this concept?

287
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:03.690
<v 1>They grow peppers and then they grow the cassava and the cassava, like it's,</v>

288
00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:06.850
it's kind of amazing. Um, you know,

289
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:10.030
we always hear about slash and burn agriculture, so they'll,

290
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.190
they'll go in and do a slash and burn in a spot, out in the jungle. Um,

291
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:16.900
but it's like,

292
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.230
it's like a recycled sort of slash and burn agriculture and I'll break down what

293
00:17:20.231 --> 00:17:20.531
that means.

294
00:17:20.531 --> 00:17:24.400
So they'll go into an area and slash everything and burn it just to clear the,

295
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.410
just so sunlight can make it through to the ground.

296
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:31.120
So they chop the jungle down and burn everything. Then the cassava,

297
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.050
like I said, it looks like big yams. When you grow it,

298
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.410
you just take a stock of an existing plant

299
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.500
and just bury that stock in the ground. And it'll sprout up a new crop.

300
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.120
And so, you know, you're close to the equator, so you don't have

301
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.530
as much, there's some seasonal variation.

302
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.620
They do have times that they do have like, they wet season and dry season,

303
00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:59.580
but it's like, you always get about the same amount of darkness as daylight.

304
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.060
And they don't have the wild fluctuations that we have in the temperate zone,

305
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.840
so they can grow year round and they stage it. So, you know,

306
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:08.520
you have a crop that's coming in,

307
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:10.500
you have a crop that will be coming in in three months,

308
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:12.120
you have a crop that will be coming in in six months,

309
00:18:12.121 --> 00:18:13.500
you have a crop that becoming a nine months.

310
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.140
And once you get a certain number of cycles,

311
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:18.180
I can't remember how many cycles you get off piece of ground.

312
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.610
You let the ground go Farrell,

313
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.270
give it a few years and then come in and burn it again.

314
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:29.280
Also intermittently every time you plant cassava you, before you replant,

315
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:34.260
you make a little fire and burn some debris in that same spot, no irrigation.

316
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.290
You're not watering it at all. Um,

317
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.480
and that's the only fertilize you're giving it is.

318
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:43.980
You're burning some of the surrounding just to try to scraped up from the jungle

319
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:46.500
floor that you burn there and grow it.

320
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.630
