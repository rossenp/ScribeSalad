00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.940
Did your family give you a hard time about wanting to do stand up? Yeah.

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.400
Do there's quite the story.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.010
<v 1>There? It's a feel good story. Let me preface with that. So,</v>

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.450
uh, yeah. Um, my dad was in finance. He hooked me up with that finance job.

6
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.900
And when I was like, I don't know, I just don't want to do this. He was like,

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.340
well, do you have another job? I was like, no,

8
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.610
I'm going to give this standup thing a try. And this was like a year or two in,

9
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.960
obviously I wasn't making any money. Um, so he was very disappointed.

10
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:32.210
He was hoping it was just a phase. You know,

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.720
he doesn't even know what up was old Chinese guy. He just like a talk show.

12
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:39.920
Like he just keeps calling it a talk show still till today. I talk show,

13
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.990
um, just never got it. So I was finishing my last year of school in San Diego.

14
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.310
I got just random jobs. I worked at a used car lot during the day.

15
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.770
I worked at that comedy palace,

16
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.060
collecting tickets and trade for like stage time, uh, in the evening after that,

17
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:58.970
I'll go put another shift as a DJ at a strip club,

18
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.540
just so I was like trying different things, you know?

19
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.180
And I didn't want to lock myself into something.

20
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.360
And then eventually the acting started to do a little better, you know? Um, um,

21
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.540
my first job was two broke girls. I had two lines, you know, and I was so proud.

22
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.330
I was so proud of myself. I was finally making some money. I called my dad.

23
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:20.930
I was like that, you know? Um, why don't you, uh, you know,

24
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.410
watch a CBS tonight, you know, I'm going to be on there and stuff. He was like,

25
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.620
I don't, I don't have CBS. I was like, who does,

26
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.110
who doesn't have CBS. It's a,

27
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.720
you stick a piece of tenfold on the back of your TV.

28
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.750
He gets CBS just really not down. Right.

29
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.260
And then eventually when I got on Silicon valley,

30
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.300
the old man understands what a contract is, a series, regular job on HBO.

31
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:47.360
He's acting, he got it. So he was finally happy.

32
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.580
I was financially secure. So instead of ever giving it up and say like,

33
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.470
Hey Jimmy, um, good job. I'm proud of you. Maybe I was wrong. Good for you.

34
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.680
You know what he said? He was like, oh, it's so easy. You can do it.

35
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.340
I can probably do it. And he started becoming an actor. I was.

36
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.260
<v 2>Like, I was like.</v>

37
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.610
<v 1>Okay, dad, you know what, if you think it's so easy, dude, I was like, dad,</v>

38
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:12.140
if you think it's so easy, crazy.

39
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.170
I was at with a very small agency at the same time. I'm like, you know what?

40
00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:17.600
I'm going to, you know, sign you up with her.

41
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.850
See if she needs an older Asian guy, because he,

42
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.070
there's not a lot of older Asian guys out there competing.

43
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.100
So she signed him and then I was like, good, good, good.

44
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.150
Now you're going to go through auditions and understand how hard my life is,

45
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.180
how all the rejections I face all the nerves I got to deal with.

46
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.800
But then the plane completely backfire because he went to those auditions and

47
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:41.150
killed them. He booked like his first six hours. I had a 10 jobs,

48
00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:44.300
which is like an unheard of ratio. You know what I mean? Like,

49
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.290
you'd be lucky to book like 5% of the jobs, but he was killing it a lot.

50
00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:52.220
Like non-union gigs. He even got on this show. Uh, uh, uh,

51
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.040
I talk about this a little bit of my standup. He even taught,

52
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.640
he even got on the show that shot in San Francisco as a Chinese show,

53
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.520
we thought it was no big deal. Low budget.

54
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:02.950
Chinese show became the biggest show in China.

55
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.290
It became like the modern family of China.

56
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.530
And then my aunt from Shanghai will call the house. Be like Richard,

57
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:11.350
you're such a good actor. Your son must have taken after you. I was like,

58
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.184
what the.

59
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.390
But now I've accepted it. That's who he is.

60
00:03:18.391 --> 00:03:22.650
I'm happy that me and my dad's in the same business in a way that's crazy.

61
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.810
And it's a fun story to tell people, right?

62
00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:29.150
So I was jokingly saying that story to John Malcovich Ben's forts on, you know,

63
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.380
space force. Everybody gets a kick out of this little story,

64
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.420
episode nine and space force comes around. We're doing a table read. And, uh,

65
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.290
it's a China versus America thing in this episode. And you need,

66
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.430
they needed a couple older Chinese scientists that are authentic Mandarin

67
00:03:44.431 --> 00:03:48.240
speaking, Chinese people after the table, read Greg Daniels, the show runner.

68
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.570
He's like, mm. You know, I just, I don't know. It's always the same guys,

69
00:03:51.571 --> 00:03:55.890
you know, just whatever. And John Malcovich was the one that said, Hey,

70
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.770
what about Jimmy's dad? Have you thought about Jimmy's dad?

71
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.990
And I didn't have thick enough skin to volunteer my dad. And,

72
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.070
and then that night I went home,

73
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.120
I cut together an acting reel for my dad and I sent it to Greg.

74
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.750
All I said was like, Greg, maybe give the old man a chance.

75
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:16.320
He's got a good look. I think he fits this older scientist in China.

76
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.180
Just let him come in and audition.

77
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.040
But I guess Greg was so impressed with the tape. He just hired him. Wow.

78
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.110
Episode nine of space force. My dad is in it. He he's great.

79
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.090
He comes in no fear. And a scene is toe to toe with John Malcovich.

80
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.970
<v 2>Wow. And how long has he been acting?</v>

81
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.300
<v 3>I mean, two years.</v>

82
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.200
<v 1>It's never taken no classes. That's.</v>

83
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.820
<v 2>So crazy. Yeah. Wow.</v>

84
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.130
<v 1>I practice with them, uh, on, on Skype, you know, for that scene, you know?</v>

85
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.350
Cause I was like that don't make me look bad. Don't this up.

86
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.700
Make sure you remember your lines. Right. And then he, he was, um,

87
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.040
he was practicing and he's like, can you screen grab me,

88
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:01.170
record me so I can see my own performance. You know?

89
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.530
And actors were all very self-conscious I, I hate to watch myself.

90
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.180
So I recorded him. I sent him that, uh, tape, and then he, he looked at it.

91
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:11.840
He was just like, wow, I'm really good.

92
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.460
Look at me. Like I'm like listening to every this. I was like, sure,

93
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:21.180
go go for it. But it's that blind sense of confidence.

94
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:25.680
And also the fact that he never thought to be an actor. So there's no fear.

95
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.030
Yeah. I was nervous as hell my first day with John Malcovich and Steve curl.

96
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.040
My dad came in with just chilling.

97
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.970
<v 2>That's so funny. It's so funny that it totally backfired.</v>

98
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.520
<v 1>Yeah. Now it's fine. It's a fun father and son story. And.</v>

99
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.550
<v 0>It's a great story. It's so funny that he saw you doing it. He's like,</v>

100
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.270
I can do that. You know, he's could do it. He's a talented guy. You.

101
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.320
<v 1>Know, he, he wants to do standup now. Really?</v>

102
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.590
He was like Jose he's 70 something, 72, 3. Wow.

103
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.500
And he was like, well, Jimmy, you think I can do some stand-up? I was like,

104
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.370
sure. Just go sign up for an open mic at the laugh factory show.

105
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.870
I'll put your name in the hat. How about that? It was like, oh no, no, no, no,

106
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.580
no, no. I'm not doing open mics. Can I do some theater or something?

107
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.480
I was like that, no, he was like, no, I'm not doing for a five people.

108
00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:16.960
I need to do it. If I do it, I need like 500 people. Oh my God. I was like,

109
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.880
that's not how it works, but who knows?

110
00:06:18.881 --> 00:06:21.100
Maybe when he does it in front of 500 people, we can.

111
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.800
<v 0>What if your dad gets a Netflix special next year?</v>

112
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.310
What if your dad just starts murdering and puts together some whole routine?

113
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.770
You imagine.

114
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.990
<v 2>How crazy that would be? If your dad's just a murderer.</v>

115
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.490
<v 0>Just up on stage, crushing punchline, bang, bang, bang. I want.</v>

116
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.670
<v 1>To say I will be happy for them, but there's probably a part of me. That's like,</v>

117
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.960
no, gosh, he did not.

118
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.960
He's always been the funny one in the family though.

119
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.070
He's always a ball Buster and everything. So it kind of came naturally to him.

120
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.570
Yeah. Wow. There he is. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.

121
00:06:55.571 --> 00:07:00.520
Vegan find that a space for scene in episode nine. Um,

122
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.780
but completely fearless. Very natural. Has he.

123
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.590
<v 0>Written standup? Does he have any ideas of stuff he would talk about? You.</v>

124
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.801
<v 1>Know what?</v>

125
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:13.150
I should have them right in the set to see what the materials would be.

126
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.460
<v 2>Yeah. Hm. Hm.</v>

127
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.290
<v 1>I don't know. I, that I got offended. The acting stuff. Cause I, cause I always,</v>

128
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.740
well, like I snuck into acting, I wasn't trained at Julliard or whatever. Right.

129
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.300
So, uh, that was so it's kinda like a similar path. He's not in the acting.

130
00:07:28.301 --> 00:07:31.990
I snuck in the acting, whatever, but the standup thing kind of offended me.

131
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.830
You know? I'm like, I put in 10 years, dude, you can't just go do a theater.

132
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.090
It does he, I mean,

133
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.810
maybe he can open for me one day or my next special. That'll be fine. No,

134
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.130
it's a lack of respect for the arts or is it, uh, overconfident in his own.

135
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.770
<v 0>But is it overconfident if he pulled it off.</v>

136
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.140
<v 1>And so much about acting, is it is confidence, you know, not being shaken,</v>

137
00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:58.120
being yourself. It's I guess.

138
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.790
<v 0>The correct amount of confidence. It is a correct.</v>

139
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.860
<v 1>Did he relaxed? I have a video. I got to find on my phone and show you. Um,</v>

140
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.410
so it's in the hallway between setups,

141
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.800
me and Malcovich is running lines and I'm, I'm nervous, you know?

142
00:08:14.801 --> 00:08:15.970
And Malcovich works hard.

143
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:19.750
Like at his level he still works hard and he's amazing. We're running lights,

144
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.660
you know, in between takes the camera, pans, pans,

145
00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:26.890
a bunch of empty chairs and pants to my dad and an active chair fell asleep,

146
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.420
just dead asleep. So relaxed, chilling.

147
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.530
<v 2>To work with John Malcovich. That's hilarious. No nerves.</v>

148
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.210
<v 0>Wow. Yeah. Does he know who John Malcovich is? He does. Absolutely. Wow.</v>

149
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.710
And he's still didn't give a.

150
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.540
<v 1>No, I think maybe comes with age, you know, when you're 70 something,</v>

151
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:49.540
you kinda you've seen so much. He is such a fan boy.

152
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.090
Like he loves taking selfies with people. It's very,

153
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.620
at first it started off with just

154
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.440
like a crazy rich Asians or like Patriot day,

155
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:00.480
this movie that they will Wahlberg, you know, um,

156
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.090
in the premiere I'll take them to the premiere,

157
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:06.780
my parents and just to kind of finally get their approval, you know?

158
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.260
And he gets it, he gives it up. He was like very emotional.

159
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:13.410
You don't have to crazy rich Asians and all that. Uh, but his,

160
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.180
his goal is not to celebrate with a son there. His goal is to get selfies

161
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.550
and the after party, you know, those Chinese Groman theater premieres, you know,

162
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:28.440
at the Chinese theater, there he is right there, mark Walberg and,

163
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:32.420
and he just keep doing it selfies. And, and like,

164
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.750
I was sitting at a table and then mark has this table and his boys and his

165
00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:39.140
security. And then my dad just leaned over to me and it was like, Hey,

166
00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:42.460
you think, uh, you think we can go get a picture of mark? I was like, well,

167
00:09:42.461 --> 00:09:45.140
I don't, I don't, I don't wanna, I don't want to ask him. Cause I,

168
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.590
I fought so hard to not ask for pictures when people I work with,

169
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.920
I want a picture of mark. I want a picture of Malcovich, but at the same time,

170
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.630
I want to just be a colleague.

171
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.760
<v 3>I don't want to be a fan of course, but.</v>

172
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.980
<v 1>Then might that forces me to do that? He's like, come on, just.</v>

173
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.790
<v 2>Go, just go ask him. I haven't used to that though. He probably just.</v>

174
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.600
<v 1>Exactly it. Yeah. I asked, I think it's still kind of lame, but if it's like,</v>

175
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.490
Hey mark, my parents are big fans. Can they get a picture?

176
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.240
And it's just cute old Chinese people.

177
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.110
So everybody kind of gets a kick out of him.

178
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:19.820
He played my dad in Patriots today. Really? He has a very small scene. Um, it's,

179
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.520
uh, that's an interesting, that's how he got his sad card.

180
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.970
That's hilarious. Talk about nepotism and Hollywood. Huh? That's how it works.

181
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.020
Well, but you know what?

182
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:33.710
I was actively trying to improve that movie because the movie was very serious.

183
00:10:33.711 --> 00:10:38.360
It's about the Boston marathon bombing and I was playing a based on real life,

184
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.400
uh, Chinese person, uh, you know, very, uh,

185
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.240
detailed all stuff. Like he speaks with a Chinese accent,

186
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:51.950
but it's a Swan Chinese accent when he mixes his L's and, uh,

187
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.100
teas. I forget, I forgot what it was, but I studied it for a long time.

188
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.210
It's not just a generic Chinese accent. Right. And then his parents of course,

189
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.051
uh, speaks,

190
00:11:00.051 --> 00:11:04.970
this is fun dialect or at least just a very proper Mandarin and the actor

191
00:11:04.971 --> 00:11:08.360
they first hired to play my dad. It's just a Skype scene, very simple.

192
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.250
The actor they first hired to play.

193
00:11:10.251 --> 00:11:14.720
My dad spoke Mandarin with a Cantonese accent. So I want it to Pete Burke,

194
00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:18.140
the director. I was like, Pete, man, I, I, I got say something, man.

195
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.240
W the whole point of this movie is honoring these heroes and be authentic.

196
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.780
And this guy, you guys might not be able to tell. I know,

197
00:11:26.781 --> 00:11:30.560
and the Chinese audience will know this guys from Hong Kong or from Guangdong or

198
00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:34.460
something. He's not from Sichuan or mainland China, you know? So it's like,

199
00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:38.060
yeah, sure. We'll, we'll, we'll find another guy. Uh, and I was like, yeah,

200
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.400
I'll sit in with you at some auditions and stuff, if you want. He was like,

201
00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:41.420
yeah, sure. I'm in the, you know,

202
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.940
already shooting in Boston might take a long time. I was like, Pete,

203
00:11:43.941 --> 00:11:46.460
why don't you just hire me that? And that was it.

204
00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:51.320
They hired my dad at that's hilarious. Yeah, no, that's hilarious.

205
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.310
But it's, it's for the art. It's for the authenticity.

206
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.770
<v 0>Dude. I'm not so secretly hoping your dad kills.</v>

207
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.130
<v 2>A sticky for you. The best story I.</v>

208
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.450
<v 0>Want to have you back on after your dad has just murdered a few times on stage.</v>

209
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.900
And you're like, what the? Oh my God.

210
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:11.760
<v 1>If he, if he comes on this podcast and he'll be a huge star,</v>

211
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.850
I don't know, am I going to handle that? Cause right now it's very,

212
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.880
very much like I'm hooking him up. I'm still the star, you know,

213
00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:22.260
he's just my dad, but what if I'm starting known as Richard son like,

214
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.260
and acting that will be, that'd be kind of rough.

215
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.030
<v 0>That's going to be hard. He's going to have to really do something special.</v>

216
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.790
Pull that off. Oh, well, we'll see. We'll see.

217
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.670
Maybe he had his own Hannah Gadsby ask special.

218
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.850
<v 1>I mean, and just only talk about me in the special.</v>

219
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.610
That would be funny if like you and Tony or whoever,

220
00:12:44.611 --> 00:12:48.960
a bunch of great writers and great comedians start plotting against me for his

221
00:12:48.961 --> 00:12:50.190
success. You know.

222
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.030
<v 2>Write for him and help him. My God was strategies.</v>

223
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.830
<v 0>For how to, how to kill. Oh my God. He loves it, man. That's great though.</v>

224
00:12:59.070 --> 00:12:59.280
That's so.

225
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.560
<v 1>Cool. It's a good father and son bonding. What.</v>

226
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.750
<v 0>Did your dad used to do for a living? What was his.</v>

227
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.560
<v 1>Uh, always like a really successful salesman.</v>

228
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.230
He had his own medical device company that he sold.

229
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.880
<v 0>Salesmen. Yes.</v>

230
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.200
That's a thing where you have to have personality and you have to know how to

231
00:13:16.201 --> 00:13:17.100
read a room.

232
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.030
And like we were talking about alcoholics anonymous is like a good gateway into

233
00:13:21.031 --> 00:13:24.030
comedy. I think maybe salesmen might be too. Yeah. And.

234
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.150
<v 1>Then when he came to America, he became a financial advisor.</v>

235
00:13:27.151 --> 00:13:30.120
So that's people to people, you got to give presentations.

236
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.660
So he was always a great public speaker. And I think I took after him.

237
00:13:33.661 --> 00:13:38.610
I never really had much stage fright. So that he's a natural. And.

238
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.920
<v 0>You say bus balls. So he's always joking around.</v>

239
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.100
He's the funny one in the family table. Oh my God. Yeah.

240
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.270
I think he's going to kill, right? Yeah. Yeah.

241
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.070
<v 2>I hope he does. I really do. Yeah. Well,</v>

242
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.860
you got to hope he does.

243
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.140
<v 1>Maybe we'll do a two man show for Netflix.</v>

244
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.280
<v 0>Or the odds of him being better than you are. Very slim. Let's just be honest,</v>

245
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.870
but don't you just want him to do well.

246
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.310
<v 1>I do. I really do. I think it's really, I joke about the jealousy.</v>

247
00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:11.580
I really don't care. He's an old man. Let him live his bucket list.

248
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.760
Act with John Malcovich. You know what I mean?

249
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.640
Like I'm just being a good son trying to hook my dad up now.

250
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:22.320
<v 0>Oh man. I can't wait to see how this plays out. When is he going to do stand up?</v>

251
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.550
Do you have a timeline?

252
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.130
Was he going to try it when the clubs get back open again?

253
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.610
<v 1>Well, I think once I told him he can't just do theaters,</v>

254
00:14:29.611 --> 00:14:31.860
he kind of became disinterested.

255
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.540
He doesn't want to do open mics, but you got to.

256
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.790
<v 0>Or maybe doesn't got to, I mean, it depends on how,</v>

257
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.150
how much of a perspective he has if he has like real takes on things that

258
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.770
he could just go on stage with. Yeah. You never know, man, but.

259
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.443
<v 1>Here's the,</v>

260
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.210
if he goes on stage without the context of this is Jimmy's dad and

261
00:14:56.211 --> 00:15:00.950
he just an old man doing a set. I don't know that's a long road,

262
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.710
but if I bring him up and he's my dad,

263
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:06.680
I think people would just kind of eat it up. Give him a little more slack.

264
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.020
<v 0>Maybe, but that might help you accept the fact that he kills.</v>

265
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.460
What if he goes on stage without any recognition of you whatsoever.

266
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.070
Just someone introduces him. He goes on stage and just murders.

267
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.610
That'd be hard to take. That would be hard. Yeah.

268
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.430
Because if you bring him up and you give him a little training wheels and you

269
00:15:27.431 --> 00:15:29.800
push them, you give them a little boost and he'd go.

270
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.530
<v 1>It's like exactly what I was saying.</v>

271
00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:36.280
How you can't immediately be good and stand up. You need to put in that five,

272
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.350
10 years. But if he's just good.

273
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.060
Yeah. I would question myself like I would be like, well, I must be, please.

274
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.390
<v 0>Tell me when he's going to do it, please. Okay.</v>

275
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.950
We're going to tell me when he's going to do it and I want to go, go watch dog.

276
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:54.893
And

277
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.470
[inaudible].
