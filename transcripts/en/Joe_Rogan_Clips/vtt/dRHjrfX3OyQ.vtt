00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.710
You have no idea what I've gone through my life from

3
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:11.850
the fistfights to the arguments, to the Beatons.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.860
I still remember my mother taking me into a restaurant bathroom and holding me

5
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:21.840
in a what's that when they get to the one guillotine and she's punching

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.690
him, she shot you up. Yeah. What? Penicillin? Oh my God. Because.

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.850
<v 1>My, when I was a kid, I was so sick.</v>

8
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.530
She got you in a headlock and shot you up better to me where the needle

9
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.050
listened to me top of his head, Cubans Cuban,

10
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:42.500
doctor Dr. [inaudible]. He made house calls. Okay. Uh,

11
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.333
 he came over. He would come.

12
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.980
<v 0>Into the room and this is very funny.</v>

13
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.930
Cause I'm going to tell you how hysterical red X's hereditary

14
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.820
is crazy. Your kids get what you got now. He would come over.

15
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.150
Now, Dr. Del valley did a bump from time to time. Well, this.

16
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.980
<v 1>Is what I'm talking about.</v>

17
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:08.480
I'm talking about 19 68, 69, please.

18
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.070
This goes on.

19
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.110
<v 0>Well, he come over, I lived on 12, five west, 88th street.</v>

20
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.540
He bring a little thing and him and my mom would talk to my stepdad and

21
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:24.050
then somebody else would be there like a check that would help my mom.

22
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:27.050
And sure enough, he would come over. But at the mom and my,

23
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.740
and then look at me and say, Jose Antonio, I have to give you a needle.

24
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.650
And I go, give me five minutes. Let me think about it.

25
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.580
And he and my mom would go, what's going on? He has to think about it.

26
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.910
I swear to God, you don't take that needle. I'll kill you.

27
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.960
So then they would go on the Paula to put on Cuban music.

28
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:48.530
And I would like put cartoons on, like it was another ever evitable.

29
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.350
And then he would, he would have like two drinks.

30
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.020
Like how old are you doing this? Five, six.

31
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.070
He would have two drinks and he'd come back. And he goes, are you ready yet?

32
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.660
And I'm like, I'm not ready.

33
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:04.280
So for years they call me [inaudible] that means it's got to hurt.

34
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.000
They wouldn't have to cold me down and give me a shot.

35
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.613
So then.

36
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.200
<v 1>My step father, mom.</v>

37
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.800
<v 0>The babysitter and my mom and my mom would be like,</v>

38
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.070
I'll knock you out. Stop crying. You.

39
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.110
<v 1>Be a man. Stop it. But my.</v>

40
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.560
<v 0>I would have an allergy to a certain penicillin.</v>

41
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.170
So the next day my temperature would go up.

42
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.680
So he was such good friends of my mom. He goes, listen,

43
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.140
this is a con continuity thing. Why don't I just leave you with a penicillin?

44
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:40.190
Put in the refrigerator.

45
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.990
I'll give you a couple of syringes and we'll he gets sick. Just stick them.

46
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.150
Wow. We were at a restaurant. I was going to sacred art school for boys.

47
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.540
And my mother was dropping me off at five o'clock.

48
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.160
We went to a fancy white people restaurant next to Carney,

49
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:02.590
New Jersey. I'm talking violins like white people in the seventies.

50
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.380
This isn't like now like, ah, these are very conservative white people.

51
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.520
And um.

52
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.560
<v 1>This is the double whammy of the day.</v>

53
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.950
<v 0>You ready? I don't like milk.</v>

54
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.950
<v 1>And my mother used to look under my eyelids.</v>

55
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.960
I don't like milk till this day. I don't drink milk.

56
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.610
You didn't like the taste of baby? Nothing. I must, I, I,

57
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.850

<v 0>And I just didn't like milk,</v>

59
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.300
but that my Cuban people have this thing that they look on the eyelids and

60
00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:41.640
my mom would go your, your week somewhere.

61
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.930
So she would make me drink milk or whatever for what a restaurant. Okay.

00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:04.350
listen, we don't have that. What I'll do is put a piece of ice cream.

67
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.850
It will give me a milkshake.

68
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.760
<v 1>You know what? This did. He got a glass of milk.</v>

69
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.270

72
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.490
I'm going to drop you off at the school, but you're going to drink that milk.

73
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.110
When a white people restaurant.

74
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.260
<v 1>Do you understand me? And cut 1972.</v>

75
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.350
<v 0>Mum goes, you got about five minutes to drink that milk.</v>

76
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:34.770
I had my little military Sunali, my little Catholic student.

77
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.630
Cause I had to bring you back with a suit. My mom goes,

78
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.970
if you don't drink and I'm going to pour it over your head in this restaurant.

79
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.960
And I was like, I'm telling you right now, I ain't going to drink.

80
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.250
<v 1>My mother took the milk, jumped on my</v>

81
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.250
ice cream and sat on my head. I had milk dripping.

82
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.600
And then the ice cream slowly melted off my head

83
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.220
on my lap. White people were like, what the? Kind of discipline?

84
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.590
So my mom's like wipe your face. So when she wipes my face, Joe Rogan,

85
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:13.650
she goes, do you have a temperature?

86
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.580
Cause I was such a sickly kid. She goes, you gotta.

87
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.500
How long have you been walking around with this temperature? She goes,

88
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:25.080
let's go in the bathroom. You're still at the restaurant.

89
00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:28.220
We're still in the restaurant. I go, she goes, she goes,

90
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.240
she carried it around with her. You had, that was that simply a kid.

91
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.620
I was at the hospital every other week. They knew we had a first name basis.

92
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.940
That is crazy. Wow. She took me in the ladies room, locked the door,

94
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.340
<v 0>HOSA Antonio, please. Don't make me give you a beaten in this bathroom store.</v>

95
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.160
I'm not doing it. And that's when the beating started.

96
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.620
And she got me in one of those things. She unzipped my pants.

97
00:05:57.621 --> 00:06:00.140
She punched me in the stomach. Oh yeah.

98
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.440
<v 1>She wasn't grind the dog. And she was to me that thinking about it.</v>

99
00:06:05.441 --> 00:06:06.640
Now I could get a blood clot.

100
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.920
<v 0>Because my from me tightening.</v>

101

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.680
Like I'm lucky. I'm alive. I'm lucky. I'm alive. God.

103
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.850
Oh my God. I was in Jersey city. One time I fainted. I'm a nurse.

This is my first time ever. No, I the bad guys. I'm you tainted?

106
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.163
No, no, no.

107
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.810
They put me in the hospital at night for a lung infection in the middle of the

108
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.690
land. I was so scared. I the bed and there was a rubber bed.

109
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.070
So the PIs don't go into the mattress. You just swimming in your own pace. So.

110
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.200
<v 1>Finally at five in the morning I get.</v>

111
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.120
<v 0>Out of this juice. And I'm just sitting in a chair, looking out the window.</v>

112
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:56.160
And this lady comes in with a little and she's like Jose Diaz. I'm like, yes.

She's like, I'm here to draw blood. I go, listen. I just the bed.

115
00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:06.550
What are you going to bother me with a needle is shaping me.

116
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.360
And she's talking about, well, the doctor says we have to do it right now.

117
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.720
I don't care what the doctor's telling you. Let's get some pajamas.

118
00:07:13.721 --> 00:07:17.560
Let me take a shower. Let me get battled. Let me eat some breakfast. She's like,

119
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.180
no, we gotta do before breakfast.

120
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.370
She's breaking my balls constantly. Now we got to do before breakfast. I'm like,

121
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:25.360
you want to needle.

122
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.020
<v 1>You want to get me a needle. Let's go.</v>

123
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.670
<v 0>I got so mad. I don't even know where I got at that time. I didn't have balls,</v>

124
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.870
but this aggravated me so much. She wanted to see what I was telling them.

125
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.110
I pumped. I'm going to go down. I'm.

126
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.720
<v 1>Telling you, I'm going to go down. You know what this said to me, she goes,</v>

127
00:07:43.721 --> 00:07:45.910
then don't sit down, stand.

128
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.610
<v 0>Up. It's better. If you stand up, let's go down the hallway.</v>

129
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.800
And the noise will distract you. You won't get that scared feeling. I said,

130
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.370
this is not going to end like this was not leaving without my blood.

131
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.360
So you want my blood? I'll give it to you. I got up. Let's go.

132
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.780
We went outside to the hallway. She put the toolbar on my,

133
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.420
she had a little cart. I'll never forget. 1979. She got a little card.

134
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.280
She put the thing around me. All I know is she stuck the needle.

135
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.360
And next thing you know, I'm hearing sirens. Okay.

136
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.970
Carla's tipped over. I'm on top of the car.

137
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.570
<v 1>And she's under the cart and they've got two aluminum.</v>

138
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.560
Maybe those things they cracked, then they knocked you out.

139
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.440
Saw it my nose directly. Like the wake me up. They couldn't get me up.

140
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.690
They just put them in my nose.

141
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.900
Let me tell you about that 13 day experience.

142
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.140
<v 0>Something. I'll never forget. That shocked me through that day.</v>

143
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.690
I still remember it from September.

144
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.370
They let me out the day Ali lost to Larry Holmes. Oh God,

145
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.150
28, 19 79. They let me out at two,

146
00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.910
I went into that set a party.

147
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.280
<v 1>Fresh from the, with the bracelet.</v>

148
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.860
<v 0>On, you know what I'm saying? Like, I didn't even take the brace off.</v>

149
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.720
There was a party for me, the whole thing.

150
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.940
<v 1>We were up.</v>

151
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.630
<v 0>But one thing I remember about that experience was the third night I was there.</v>

152
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.340
How scared I was and the guy next to me was an old man. And I go, Hey,

153
00:09:16.341 --> 00:09:20.600
what's your name? He's like a towel. He's like Sal, like on Sal.

154
00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:23.420
What's going on with you? He goes, well, I had a stroke.

155
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.160
And the side of my body that had the stroke is decide that develops the

156
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.630
from having a hard time. Shin. I go really?

157
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.610
And I'm blowing the fortune the whole night.

158
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.640
<v 1>It's a two man bed. He's in there dying.</v>

159
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.920
He he's just farting a two man batch, a two man room. Oh.

160
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.500
<v 0>Okay. Okay. And they had a curtain in between. I don't know if his name is Sam.</v>

161
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.670
I'm just making this up. But whatever his name was, he was a very nice man.

162
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.850
And he had a family and they'd come in at night. He goes, yeah.

163
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.890
<v 1>Ooh, Ooh, my stomach or hug, you know,</v>

164
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:00.980
the whole thing. And they tried things on them.

165
00:10:00.981 --> 00:10:03.260
I remember one night they were like, that's it.

166
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.520
<v 0>You really shouldn't tonight. You're doing surgery in the mall. The doc,</v>

167
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.383
I'm listening to.

168
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.850
<v 1>That. You know, you can hear if they're talking to the guy next door.</v>

169
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.730
<v 0>And I'm like, I wonder what the they going to do to this?</v>

170
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.840
They came with like a ghost bus. It's a gun. It was like.

171
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.830
<v 1>A gun. And they had a tube in it and they put him in his hole.</v>

172
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:27.170
I'll never forget this having my little black and white ITV and just sitting

173
00:10:27.171 --> 00:10:27.860
there watching.

174
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.030
<v 0>TV. And you're like, Ooh, all of a sudden they started squirting water in his,</v>

175
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.320
like an animal hose. Jesus. And they didn't have PPE.

176
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.450
The started.

177
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.560
<v 1>Coming up and the was coming out of his and they're like, run, run.</v>

178
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.100
The nurse came and got me. They were like holding me. Like I was,

179
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.850
they thought I was like biggie getting shot. They was smothering me.

180
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.810
That was coming out of the Beverly hillbillies.

181
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:55.790
How the oil come out of the floor

182
00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.900
that they did everything they could.

183
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:02.660
Because I knew they think that like I was on a call, like whatever.

184
00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:06.530
Then that got DACA webinar. Who do you call when they're not cleaning up?

185
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.980
There's somebody you call like, uh, they make code.

186
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.580
Who are the people who make code? Like what would make code? I don't know.

187
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.660
They had like rub my shoulders and PPA.

188
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.910
I'm at a protection agency. Yeah. Whatever the.

189
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.590
They knew that they didn't come in with the right protection. They just came in.

190
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:29.240
Like, we'll try and see if this works. When they stuck in his, his blew up.

191
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.610
They didn't know what was going to work. They were like,

192
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.690
maybe it's not going to work. So, you know, they came in very normal.

193
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.560
And when they shot the cocaine gun with the water up, his

194
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.870
started coming everywhere. It was like a volcano. I'm not kidding.

195
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:49.830
You I'm not see it. The curtain was open the car smell. It was like,

196
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.750
what the going on? And they was shooting him with water up his,

197
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.760
like with a hose. Oh cool. The nurses get towels,

198
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:04.740
get towels. And they threw tiles down. And that night I had my own room.

199
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.413
I'm in there.

200
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.200
<v 0>By myself. Like Mr. Diaz was sorry about that. I'm like,</v>

201
00:12:10.201 --> 00:12:12.690
don't worry about nothing. I won't say nothing. They gave you your own room.

202
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.330
They got me in a single room. Well told him right.

203
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.560
<v 1>Where you smoking? No, he's like this, like a dark. Oh, okay.</v>

204
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.700
I didn't know if they were like this Joey Diaz. Like that's when he wins.

205
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:29.070
<v 0>I had like a bad lung infection and they pretty much asked me to leave</v>

206
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:34.710
13 days. Why'd they ask you to leave because it was too much. What do you mean?

207
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.580
My friends were coming in with cases of beer. Oh, there you were partying.

208
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.190
What did they pack? Whoever would come in with a case of nips,

209
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.490
remember six o'clock. They allowed him to bring beer.

210
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.230
They didn't allow my friends to do anything. They just did it. Oh.

211
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.140
And then one night they got thrown out and they started throwing furniture out

212
00:12:52.141 --> 00:12:54.470
the window at Christ hospital. Oh boy.

213
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.500
Girls used to come in there at night to see me. I was like a stud.

214
00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:00.990
When you were in high school and you get sick, everybody comes to see you.

215
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.820
You know? I can't be Stripe is I knew from grammar school, it was Jersey city.

216
00:13:05.821 --> 00:13:10.170
So the good old days, they just social media. They just drew me the out.

217
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.360
They were like, you know what? It's time for you to go. Yeah, you'll be fine.

218
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.710
Go see your doctor. I never went to see a doctor again. I took acid that night,

219
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.100
September 20. It was late. Larry homeless walk, mom and Ali.
