WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
<v 0>They were 50. It was 50 years ago. All right. We're talking about 1967.</v>

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.360
Nobody knew about diet back then. This is a fact. Right? Okay.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.160
So the people that did live that long and they were living this, it's almost,

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.080
uh, an accident in some ways or inconsequential, like what,

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.360
what is going on today with people's diet and how long will people live today?

6
00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:22.550
The is far more information. Yeah.

7
00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:25.190
In terms of like nutrition and what you should do absolutely.

8
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.150
And shouldn do for your body.

9
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.950
So what I'm concerned with is like what optimizes people today?

10
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.630
I wanna see blood work. Yeah. I wanna see like,

11
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.830
what is going on with your blood lipids? Absolutely.

12
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:38.310
What is going on with your nutrient levels? What is going on with that? And in,

13
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.860
in that case, we don't have, we have J just a few studies from a few people,

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.660
or a few tests from a few people that have done this carnivore diet.

15
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.860
We have some people that have done the vegan diet and have had real hard

16
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:49.900
problems with that diet. Yeah.

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.500
<v 1>But let's just, let me just say one thing,</v>

18
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.820
cuz to throw the word vegan on something that does not make it a healthy diet.

19
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.340
I know vegans that are a hundred pounds overweight.

20
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:00.420
They eat nothing but fried told vegan pizza.

21
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.890
If you an organic whole food plant-based diet, that's what I roll with. Right.

22
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.690
I don't, I don't say I vegan diet can mean anything,

23
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.850
but when you say whole food's in the original sauce, organic, no pesticides,

24
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:17.930
whole food plant-based diet. That's what I roll with. Right?

25
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:20.850
So that's why I don't go nutrient nutrient dense, nutrient dense, mineral.

26
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.160
<v 0>Dense. And this is mineral things.</v>

27
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:24.600
Mineral important with people that live a long time.

28
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.360
One of the things that you get from a lot of plants,

29
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.120
especially like rich green leafy plants, right? You get a lot of minerals.

30
00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:33.320
Absolutely. And, and more importantly,

31
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.160
if these things are raised in an organic environment, you're getting soil,

32
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.640
that's not depleted. And this is a big problem with mono mono crops.

33
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.070
<v 1>Did you see the, the article that just came amount today, that 40 years ago,</v>

34
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.310
an orange was 10 times more, more nutritious? I think it was, uh,

35
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.590
I think it might have been CNN online or something.

36
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:57.550
They posted an article that said the fruits and vegetables from 40 years ago

37
00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:00.110
were 10 times more nutritious than the,

38
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:04.940
than the way they're being grown today is like you said,

39
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.340
rows and rows and rows. That makes sense.

40
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.460
How do they extract the nutrients properly from the soil it's

41
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.313
IM.

42
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.220
<v 0>Well, you know, they have to actually add nutrients to the soil.</v>

43
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.340
Most of the time, they're just adding nitrogen, a few other different minerals,

44
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:21.260
but there's mineral depletion.

45
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.730
<v 1>Pig or pig. Like what, what they do is to get,</v>

46
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.730
how do they get rid of that pig. Yeah. They're spraying it on the crops.

47
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.210
Yeah. And, and you know.

48
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.330
<v 0>Well, you're, you're supposed to rotate crops. Right. You know, I mean.</v>

49
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.930
<v 1>It's crop rotation. What you plant next to each other, right. That are extra. I,</v>

50
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.730
I'm not a farmer composting,

51
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:45.200
but I have a friend that isn't organic farmer and his name,

52
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:48.280
his name is Keith. And uh, he farms up, uh,

53
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.920
up in like New Hampshire mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he knows all about crop

54
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.040
rotation. Keith Leon forte, if you have a, he's a Harry Christian dude,

55
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.760
you can do it. That's what he does. He has a small farm, small farms are.

56
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.760
<v 0>Legit. Like you can have a small farm and be in symbiosis. Like you can,</v>

57
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.240
you could be in harmony with the land, but man, you're starting, you're growing,

58
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.173
you know,

59
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.960
a thousand acres of corn for cattle feed there's you might as well be making

60
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.600
oil. Well, I mean, you're, you're,

61
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.830
you're doing something that's kind of crazy today environment. It's not natural.

62
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.670
<v 1>And, and, and, and listen, you know,</v>

63
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.670
I saw Ted Newgen play with ACD and black Sabbath in 76

64
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.350
at, at Madison square guard. And I went to all them shows, but you know,

65
00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:32.510
when he came on and the that he was talking,

66
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.910
I was just like the GMO crops. Okay.

67
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.700
80% of the GMO crop being fed to animals for slaughter. The,

68
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.340
the, what he called the stupid vegans are not the ones that are eating that,

69
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.740
that most of the crops that are genetically modified because you have these

70
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:53.740
corporations, McDonald's every one of these corporations,

71
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.180
they want every piece of meat to taste the same.

72
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.130
They want every French fry Tato to be the same mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

73
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:05.970
So the only way they can control it is the control of the genetic markers.

74
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.730
So that's why they're using all of the, all the,

75
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.770
a majority of the genetically modified grains and Monsanto, uh,

76
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.210
you know, who just got bought out by bear. Uh,

77
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.400
and they're changing the name cuz Mon as such a big rap.

78
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.280
I don't rep if you don't know it, bear just bought them. Yeah.

79
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.600
Now do you know the history of bear pharmaceutical company? No,

80
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.440
but they make IG Farbin no. Prior to that,

81
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.760
they made the Zyklon gas that went into the Nazi death chambers.

82
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.561
<v 0>Well, that's, you know,</v>

83
00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:41.390
what's funny that that NY Cylon gas was crew created by Fritz

84
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.510
hoer Fritz hoer is also the guy who created the process of extracting nitrogen

85
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:47.310
from the air. Really? So he's the guy,

86
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.950
the reason why we can grow the kind of crops that we have today is because of

87
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:53.390
Fritz hoer they say the 50% of the nitrogen in most,

88
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.270
the nitrogen in most people's DNA comes from the ho method.

89
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.310
He also created Lon a Lon a is.

90
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.460
<v 1>Lon B gas was the.</v>

91
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.221
<v 0>Nazis. Well,</v>

92
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:07.100
he created Cylon a and they added the smell to it so that you could smell this

93
00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:09.180
toxic gas. So you would know it when it was coming.

94
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.620
So you can get outta the way. Wow.

95
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.580
The Nazis switched it to Lon B Fritz Harbor was actually a Jew and

96
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.420
they took his invention and cut out the smell portion of it so that they could

97
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.500
gas Jews with it. Wow.

98
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.690
<v 1>It's dark. I said, Joe's a smart. I'm learning some here today. Right?</v>

99
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.103
My head.

100
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.730
<v 0>It's dark. You know, the ho method, you know,</v>

101
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.090
saved a lot of people and killed a lot of people.

102
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.090
They wanted to try that guy for crimes against humanity while he was winning the

103
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:40.810
Nobel prize for science at the same time. Cause he was also the first people.

104
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.400
He was one of the, the, uh,

105
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:46.480
first people that implemented a gassing program where they used it to gas,

106
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.760
the allied troops in world war I, that was ho wow. Harbor was.

107
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.640
<v 1>A big part of that. I didn't, I did not know that. Yeah, it's.</v>

108
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.040
<v 0>Crazy. So that is how we get nitrogen. Wow.</v>

109
00:05:56.041 --> 00:05:59.400
We get nitrogen from the Harbor method when they're pouring nitrogen into the

110
00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:03.760
plant, into the soil so they can grow plants. That's a big part of it.

111
00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:06.520
When you say genetically modified too, a big part of that is like,

112
00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:09.880
we wanna think about, oh, like labs and science and all this jazz,

113
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.960
but almost everything we eat is genetically modified,

114
00:06:12.961 --> 00:06:16.440
including all of our grains. Like especially all of our fruits and vegetable,

115
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.430
what we were saying about tomatoes or, um, uh,

116
00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:23.990
orange being different than it was 10 years ago. everything's different man,

117
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:27.630
because they want these things to be durable so they could throw 'em in a bus or

118
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.390
a truck rather, and travel close the country, sell 'em somewhere else.

119
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.590
<v 1>Well, here here's the thing. And I know what they do. They take the, the, the,</v>

120
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.700
the, the DNA of a flounder and inject it a tomato. So it can resist the fraud.

121
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.740
How the did they do that? I don't know. Is that real? It's that's real.

122
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.980
<v 0>So if you eat a tomato, does it have flounder.</v>

123
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.180
<v 1>In it now? Vegans, if you're eating GMO, maybe you're not eating vegan food,</v>

124
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.660
you could be eating a fish tomato. Did you ever think about.

125
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.180
<v 0>It? Well, one thing is if you eat plants, plants absorb,</v>

126
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.650
like they've found salmon DNA in some plants because plants

127
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.090
absorb the, the fish, everything that people use for fertilizer. Yeah. You know,

128
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.490
so you're getting some of that animal,

129
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.210
but it's a natural cycle that you're getting it through. I mean,

130
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.490
animals eat animals, plants, eat animals, animals, even eat plants. I mean,

131
00:07:14.491 --> 00:07:16.930
there's crazy plants in south America that it looks like a,

132
00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:19.240
like a V and these rats,

133
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.440
they get attracted this sweet smell around the edges and it's slick.

134
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.480
And they fall into the hole and the plant closes in 'em and swallows 'em and

135
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:27.840
eats 'em. Wow. Yeah.

136
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.320
<v 1>Well, well, the, the, you know, the other thing is this,</v>

137
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.480
you have chemical companies making your food,

138
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.920
their job is not to feed the world. There's a jobs not to keep you healthy.

139
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.790
Their job is to sell pesticides. Yeah. Let's,

140
00:07:41.791 --> 00:07:45.630
let's be straight up about it. So yeah, they created,

141
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.630
what was the other, uh, cross, uh, genetic there's, uh,

142
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.310
there's a, a, a vegetable, I think it was bro. Uh,

143
00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:58.310
was it cauliflower or broccoli? They, they mixed two things and came out with,

144
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.500
uh, it's a different process. What, what they're doing now,

145
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.900
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and really what they do when they can take Roundup and

146
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.980
pesticides and put it in the seed, right. Is what they're doing now. And.

147
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.940
<v 0>So the plant from the growth cycle is resistant to these bugs. Right. And.</v>

148
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.140
<v 1>And all the people that are having the gut issues. I don't know if you listen,</v>

149
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.490
you know, I know you had rich roll on twice. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, he's my boy.

150
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.170
He's a homie. He's great, dude, dude, he's, everyone asked me like,

151
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.610
what's that life in real what's he like in real life? I'm like,

152
00:08:29.611 --> 00:08:34.530
that's the most genuine dude. You know, you ever have anything going on?

153
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.370
He just wrote the forward to my new book. Uh, the PMA effect. I mean,

154
00:08:38.371 --> 00:08:42.600
he's such a, he's a such solid cat, very solid. But uh,

155
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.000
where was I going with that? You took me down to plants. Glyphosate. Yeah.

156
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:49.880
So he just had Dr. Zach Bush, come on, who's a doctor.

157
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.560
This is clinical research. This is not speculation.

158
00:08:52.561 --> 00:08:56.200
This is not vegan propaganda. This is science.

159
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.480
And he proved that glyphosate.

160
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.880
And what's happening now with the gut health of it.

161
00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:03.720
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; gut health is such a huge issue. Yeah. Everything,

162
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.720
the bad disease. It starts in the gut.

163
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.840
And the glyphosate is eating through the stomach wall and causing leaky gut and

164
00:09:11.841 --> 00:09:15.830
all these other, uh, physical, uh,

165
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.830
diseases from happening. Now,

166
00:09:17.831 --> 00:09:21.030
the other thing is you have to realize what these pesticides are,

167
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.150
they're neurotoxins. And then the ones that they're putting inside the seed,

168
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.550
when the bug eats the leaf, it dies.

169
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.270
So you're eating these fruits and vegetables that are completely toxic.

170
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.300
<v 0>Well, here's what happens when they created it. One of things,</v>

171
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.300
one of the reasons why they were able to implement it,

172
00:09:37.301 --> 00:09:40.140
they said it doesn't kill people. It kills plants and it kills bacteria.

173
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.260
So everybody's like, oh fine. Yeah, no problem.

174
00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:45.820
It only kills plants and bacteria. That's totally safe. No,

175
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.980
your body is filled with bacteria, your bacteria,

176
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.500
your gut has more E coli than there's ever been a human being on the planet

177
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:52.861
ever.

178
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:57.530
There's more E coli in your stomach than any humans that have ever lived more

179
00:09:57.531 --> 00:09:59.730
numbers. And you need them. You need the,

180
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.250
the bacteria gut flora gets destroyed by glyphosate. It gets destroyed.

181
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.730
<v 1>By rounding. That's a that's that's. I mean,</v>

182
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.050
that podcast that he did, uh, that episode with Dr. Zach Bush is,

183
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.280
it's unbelievable. And, and I'm surprised like, you know of,

184
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.280
didn't try to take tattoo out at this point. Cause well.

185
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:20.521
<v 0>It's,</v>

186
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:23.000
they're making so much money and people aren't listening and there's so much

187
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:24.960
signal. There's so many noises going on.

188
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:30.200
<v 1>And they used the word that everyone loves to use. The two words, conspiracy,</v>

189
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.680
theorists. Yeah. That's a good one. But here's the thing.

190
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.990
Once you can prove something and there's data and evidence to it up,

191
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.030
it's no longer a theory. It's a fact.

192
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.230
<v 0>So they it's even a conspiracy. It's just reality. And by the way,</v>

193
00:10:44.231 --> 00:10:45.310
when they implemented it,

194
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.790
they probably did think that they could get away with it.

195
00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:48.990
They think it would've been fine.

196
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:52.670
They really probably didn't know as much as we know today about gut biome.

197
00:10:52.671 --> 00:10:56.870
Right. That's all new. That's all within the last couple of decades. Stuff was,

198
00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:57.700
do.

199
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.540
<v 1>You, how about, yeah. Kechi is amazing.</v>

200
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.180
<v 0>Drink a lot. ACHA. Yeah. I drink a lot of kombucha eat a lot of kimchi.</v>

201
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:08.260
That's where I get it from primarily. Yeah. That's.

202
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:08.980
<v 1>That's good stuff.</v>
