<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.680
<v 2>Well with, with Saturday night live was the first time of, uh, oh,</v>

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.440
I also did, uh, I did a pilot.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.080
I was out in LA to audition for one pilot. I didn't get,

5
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:20.440
and then a friend of mine, a comic said, I'm in this pilot, uh,

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.070
you want to come and audition with me for it. I'm already in it. And,

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.630
and I got that. Never it never added, it was terrible. And, um,

8
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.710
that, oh, that one was called the, uh, the adventures of, uh,

9
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.950
Wally brown and the, the, one of the actors, just the,

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.940
I recently, um, Peter Skylar. Oh.

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.660
<v 0>The guy from, uh, Bo and buddies. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.500
<v 1>Wow. Wow. And so he was one of the stars of that. Wow.</v>

13
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.380
And, but that was my first time of, I don't remember how much I got,

14
00:00:57.381 --> 00:01:01.180
but getting a check and going, wow, this is actual money.

15
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.010
<v 0>So was SNL before or after.</v>

16
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.690
<v 1>That? Uh, that was, uh, SNL was after. Yeah. And.</v>

17
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.810
<v 0>Was, you said SNL was terrible?</v>

18
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.330
<v 1>Uh, yeah, the seat. Well, the season I was on, uh,</v>

19
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.810
like the original, well,

20
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.760
Lauren Michaels left and the old cast left. Oh really?

21
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.240
So people hated the show before it even got on the end.

22
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:29.000
Warren Michael's.

23
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.040
<v 0>Left at one point in time. I didn't know that they.</v>

24
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.320
<v 1>Came back. Yeah. Uh, then they got,</v>

25
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:38.200
they got in Dick Eversol was the next one. And, uh,

26
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.160
well Dick saw Dick Eversol was after my season.

27
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.430
My season was gene dominion. And,

28
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.510
but the idea back then of, uh,

29
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.630
Saturday night live with different cast members that just wasn't now

30
00:01:56.631 --> 00:02:00.870
it's like the cast changes every five minutes. Right.

31
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.700
But back then, it was like, no,

32
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.820
we CA it was be like saying like in the middle of Beatle mania that,

33
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.860
uh, oh, we're getting four other guys to be the Beatles or,

34
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.660
or when friends was on were recast friends,

35
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.420
but just watch it same way. And so there were,

36
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.810
there were news stories and article quotes saying, how dare they,

37
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.050
this was sacri.

38
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.930
<v 0>So that's funny. So you were like the second cast?</v>

39
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.850
<v 1>Uh, yeah, we were the second cast and, and it's like, and everybody left. Uh,</v>

40
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.850
yeah. Yeah. All the original people were gone and it was like,

41
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.280
uh, see you, you don't wanna be the replacement.

42
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.920
You wanna be the replacement of the replacement.

43
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.000
Cause then you get one guy that's the sacrificial lamb that they

44
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.360
throw onto the fire. And then next it's like, oh,

45
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.600
well it's better than that other guy. Yeah, yeah.

46
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.120
<v 0>Right. You then you come in after you. Yeah.</v>

47
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.680
And then you could actually be accepted. Yeah. Slightly. God.

48
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.040
Did you enjoy the, like the process at all? No.

49
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.080
<v 1>Not really. And I, I was, uh, nothing new.</v>

50
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.750
I was, is weird. &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;

51
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.750
um, when I was auditioning,

52
00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:29.190
there were a few auditions,

53
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.950
some at a comedy club,

54
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.230
others in their office and it would be like lots of people there.

55
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.100
And I would hear, you know, other people who auditioned, who would say, oh,

56
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:46.380
they were so hateful of everybody else who was against them in their,

57
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.540
and I remember just out of weirdness,

58
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.940
not courage out of weirdness. I,

59
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.580
I didn't take auditioning for Saturday night,

60
00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.180
live as something important.

61
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.290
I don't know why I just didn't and I would go there and do bits and

62
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:08.610
everything. And when I was on it,

63
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.410
I didn't feel like I, well, I mean,

64
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:15.770
there was a reason I didn't feel like a star there cuz everyone was throw to

65
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.930
shreds in the press. But, and then when I got fired from

66
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.640
I, you know, thought, okay, oh,

67
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.600
the way I got fired from Saturday night live there used to be, uh,

68
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.240
a table there that they would throw fan letters.

69
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.200
One that was such thing as fan letters. Now it's, you know,

70
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.030
who writes a fan letter anymore? It, uh, you know,

71
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.710
email and stuff. Uh, and that they,

72
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.070
so I was waiting, they had fired, uh, the producer

73
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.910
and uh, Dick Eversol came in. He said, all right, well,

74
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.110
we're just gonna make changes here. And there nothing major, uh,

75
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.540
come in next week and uh, we'll discuss it.

76
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.660
And they were taking people in one by one and I'm waiting there and killing

77
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.060
time. I see a,

78
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.900
a girl writes a fan letter to me from like Omaha,

79
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.930
whatever. And I open it up before I even get into the office.

80
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.330
I opened the letter and it starts off dear Gilbert.

81
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.050
I'm so sorry about what happened to you.

82
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.170
So I found out from a fan letter from some, uh,

83
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.930
15 year old girl, how did she find out? Yeah, I don't know. But she, maybe she.

84
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.123
<v 0>Saw coming. Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.323
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

86
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.400
<v 0>She started it after the first episode. Oh, the writings on the wall.</v>

87
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.000
Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.

88
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.440
<v 1>Yeah, this guy sucks.</v>

89
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.320
<v 0>Was it the same kind of environ?</v>

90
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.200
Cause the thing abouts live that I keep hearing from former cast members is that

91
00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:56.360
it was like a dog eat dog world over there.

92
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.040
And people would be backstabbing people and stealing their,

93
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.480
their ideas for sketches and yeah, it was Jim brewer had a horrible time there.

94
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.503
Yeah.

95
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.673
<v 1>I remember.</v>

96
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.760
Well I remember like I didn't like the writers and the writers hated me.

97
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.240
And so one time to prove it, how much they hated me.

98
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.230
They wrote a funeral sketch where I was the dead body.

99
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.390
So I just had to lie there in the coffin.

100
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.870
<v 0>That's it? Yeah. Wow. Just to you. Yeah.</v>

101
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.910
Yeah. That it, the, the environment Phil Hartman said the same thing.

102
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.910
He said the environment over there was just toxic.

103
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.060
Like everybody was like at each other's throats and just wasn't fun.

104
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.300
They were always like just hamstring each other. Yeah.

105
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:44.260
Always trying to each other over and ruin each other's sketches.

106
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.540
Not laughing at each other's sketches when laying 'em out. That kind of thing.

107
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.780
Yeah. That there was like,

108
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.420
like a lot of politics over there and you had to learn the politics.

109
00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:58.090
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he hated it. So did Jim brewer hated? Yeah. I.

110
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.210
<v 1>I think, yeah, I didn't have a great time there at all.</v>

111
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.650
<v 0>So those catch shows are just so different than stand up. Yeah.</v>
