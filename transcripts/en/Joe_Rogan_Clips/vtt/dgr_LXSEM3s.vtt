00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.893
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.960
<v 2>What we do, doesn't make sense. And I do it, you know,</v>

3
00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:07.840
like at world strongest man in 2019,

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.480
we had to pull two monster trucks because one was too light. &lt;laugh&gt; like,

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:17.440
come on. Like personally, that me off. Cause I suck at that event. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.960
And it was a slight incline.

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.080
<v 1>Is that a weight event?</v>

8
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:23.830
Like it helps to be like a 400 pound guy versus 280 pound guy.

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.750
<v 0>With that event. Mass moves mass. Yeah. Like, yeah.</v>

10
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.270
So in that year I had Thor in my group,

11
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.550
the dude weighed 4 30, 4 40 when we were competing against each other.

12
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.320
But he's pretty.

13
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.190
<v 1>Light now. Isn't he?</v>

14
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.030
<v 0>Yeah. He's I think three 30. He's.</v>

15
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.430
<v 1>Actually right down the street. Oh really? He was at the honor gym.</v>

16
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.700
He put up his, uh, Thor's uh, Instagram.

17
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.500
<v 0>I knew he was in, uh, I know he was here lately. Um,</v>

18
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.660
I know rain had them in LA and stuff like that. He might even be here.

19
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.500
<v 1>This weekend. I don't know. I think he's here right now. Cuz he,</v>

20
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.660
he was at on it Jim and he put up video of him hitting the pads and I have

21
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:02.570
to say like, he's doing everything right. It looks so he looks really,

22
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:06.130
but it's interesting because he's learning how to box cuz he's having these

23
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.090
boxing matches, but the way he's doing it is very intelligent.

24
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.530
Like he's not just like gritting his teeth and throwing his arms his far and

25
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:17.610
using all his, his physical muscle power. Yeah.

26
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.570
He's learning how to do it correctly.

27
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.600
And everything is like real smooth polished.

28
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.840
<v 0>When you're fighting. Like you do have to be pretty relaxed.</v>

29
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.800
<v 1>Yes. When you're doing it, you have to be able to generate force quickly.</v>

30
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.560
But you also have to be supple. You have to,

31
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:36.240
you have to be relaxed because if you're relaxed, you actually can move faster.

32
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.600
When you really tense up and wind up,

33
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.990
you lose a lot of your ability to close the distant quick.

34
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:44.750
It's gotta be like efficient. Yeah.

35
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.470
And the way you get efficient is by repetition,

36
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.030
with proper technique and learning how to, you know,

37
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.390
hit paths with proper technique. And you know, when I first saw him doing that,

38
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:58.270
I was like, oh my God. Imagine going from being strong man,

39
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.790
and being the mountain and game Thrones to trying to box like,

40
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:06.500
this is a awkward, but not more men. When you see, do you find it?

41
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.780
I don't see it all. At least not at on, oh maybe it's in the, on it gym.

42
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.700
That's I was looking, I switched to that and wasn't seeing it there either. God,

43
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.900
maybe it's one trainers recently. Yeah. Today. Okay.

44
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.540
Maybe it's one of the trainers I follow that posted it, but uh. I,

45
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.700
I really think it was him.

46
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.370
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I know he's in the states right now. Cause he was just in LA. No,</v>

47
00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:27.890
he's in.

48
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.650
<v 1>Austin a week ago. He's in Austin. Um, let's see that,</v>

49
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.890
that right there. See? Right that right there. September 13th.

50
00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:40.210
That's not at the honor gym. That's just him. Yeah.

51
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.610
<v 0>He's lost like training about a hundred pounds. Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.230
<v 1>He looks great.</v>

53
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.280
<v 0>Yeah. No, he looks awesome.</v>

54
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.720
<v 1>It's crazy. It's like a totally different kind of human now. You know,</v>

55
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.760
big time now he looks like a, a big athlete.

56
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.160
I wonder what his like long term goals are in that are. I don't know.

57
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.320
There's a lot of money in like freak boxing matches. I know.

58
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.240
<v 0>You know it's.</v>

59
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.840
<v 1>Crazy. If you could get like Logan Paul to box the mountain.</v>

60
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.520
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; oh yeah. Put Penski. Yeah. He just, he, yeah.</v>

61
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.400
<v 1>He won, but he's been fighting for a long time now. Yeah. Ever.</v>

62
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.960
<v 0>Since he stepped out of world strongest, man, he went into the MMA world,</v>

63
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.630
watched this.

64
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.080
<v 1>This is an interesting, pretty quick he guy watch this. Boom.</v>

65
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.870
Yeah. Crazy. And the guy who fought was a giant too. Yeah, crazy.

66
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.270
But Putin's been fighting in MMA for a long time.

67
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.430
He fought Tim Sylvia who was the former UFC heavyweight champion.

68
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.110
And that was a crazy stupid fight. Like he got his, was it good? No, no.

69
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:38.950
He got his kicked, but I mean like of course he got his kicked. Yeah.

70
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.100
He's literally fighting a former world champion and he's just a really strong

71
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.900
guy learning how to fight. Exactly.

72
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.100
And he was the guy like when he first started fighting,

73
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.260
he could see like he'd hit pads and he'd be like, it would be all arms.

74
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.540
Just Neanderthal. Yeah.

75
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:56.260
But now he's like throwing his shoulders in and moving his hips. He's become,

76
00:03:56.261 --> 00:04:01.090
he's got, he's still big as. But he's like, he's lost some weight in.

77
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.890
<v 0>Gain. I feel like none of us strong men are ever gonna be small. Right.</v>

78
00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:07.690
For the rest of when he gets to this level. Like I think you're just like,

79
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.970
you know, I look at my life and I'm like, yeah,

80
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.530
probably the lightest it'll ever be is like.

81
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.570
<v 1>Two 30 to two 40 people are always coming to you to open the mayonnaise jar.</v>

82
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.210
Always a hundred percent &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Yeah.

83
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:22.600
You're probably, oh, always keep, I mean you, you only lose so much of it.

84
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:26.720
You're not gonna ever be like a marathon runner. I nor do. I want to be right.
