1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.900
<v 0>It just means,</v>

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.930
I don't think the monkeys have a sense of fairness like you and I have,

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.860
but I do think they have a sense of hold on, you're getting more than I am.

4
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:10.230
I can't let this happen. Otherwise I'm screwed.

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.330
And there's lots of great evidence that if you let that happen,

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.340
then you're screwed. But.

7
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.570
<v 1>Do the females have that same sense of competitiveness that they need to have</v>

8
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:20.540
the exact same thing. Those other are having to get angry?

9
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.670
<v 0>Well, here's the thing. Um,</v>

10
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.990
it depends on whether your mating system is going to be pair bonding or not.

11
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.490
So if you're a frog or a, um, lots of different frogs, not all of them,

12
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.480
a laughing tree frog, or if you're a elephant seal or something,

13
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.080
we'll all the females mate with the best male. Cause his job is just sex.

14
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.190
And so every female can add the best one or the either in a situation where

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.840
they've got no choice, like the elephant seals,

16
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:48.440
he controls a rookery or in a situation where they just listen to all the

17
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.900
croaking and then they got you're the best Croker. You're the dad.

18
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.150
But if you're pair bonding like humans or like lots of other animals,

19
00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:57.110
birds, et cetera,

20
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.920
the then what you need is you've got competition on both sides.

21
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.970
So she's always competing to get the best male and he's always competing to get

22
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:05.804
the best female.

23
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.130
Now there's reasons why a male male competition is always a bit more intense

24
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:12.530
than female, female competition, but both of them are there.

25
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.570
And the more monogamous the system gets,

26
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.520
the more both sides can be for each other.

27
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.613
<v 1>Hmm. Interesting.</v>

28
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.060
So what about in the case of like Bonobos where they're so

29
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:24.110
polyamorous.

30
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.150
<v 0>And elbows are super interesting system.</v>

31
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.750
So you've got lots of polyamorous animals, um, but novels are interested.

32
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.220
Their chimps are also, you know,

33
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:34.970
so if you look at one of the great ways to look at our ancestors and what their

34
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:35.690
lives were like,

35
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.140
cause you look in your trousers and the size of your testicles tells you a lot

36
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:42.440
about what sort of mating system your ancestors had.

37
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.870
So gorillas have tiny little testicles.

38
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.620
And the reason that they have such tiny testicles is they use their huge body to

39
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:52.160
drive away. They're the males. And then all the females are in his harem.

40
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.820
So he doesn't need big testicles because he only needs enough sperm in order to

41
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:59.390
inseminate the females. He's got it. Doesn't take much sperm to inseminate.

42
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.780
Anyone, female and testicles are really expensive tissue to make.

43
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.960
And if you own a pair and you land on them, you know, they're uncomfortable too.

44
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.740
Right?

45
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.250
And so then you look at our testicles and they're quite a bit bigger than a

46
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.450
gorillas, but they're nowhere near the size of a Chimp or banaba both, you know,

47
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.760
they're basically in many ways, almost the same beast.

48
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.730
And so although socially quite different. And um,

49
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.120
they have a system where they basically have to wash out the guy who was there

50
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:27.050
before them. And so it takes really big testicles to have sperm competition.

51
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.300
So their competition isn't by fighting each other though.

52
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.380
There's a degree of that too.

53
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.530
They know full well that when she comes into estrus into heat,

54
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.150
there's going to be a line.

55
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.300
And if you're fifth in line and you can wash everybody out before you might end

56
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:39.134
up the dead.

57
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.510
<v 1>Yeah. There's a funny way of putting it. So it's, uh, it's uh,</v>

58
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.380
this, this testicle size is directly proportionate to the number of promiscuous

59
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:49.214
females.

60
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.950
<v 0>Well, that's right. The promiscuity of the mating system.</v>

61
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.810
And so if you look at our mating system,

62
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:57.110
we clearly evolved to be largely monogamous, but not entirely.

63
00:02:57.111 --> 00:03:01.240
Our testicles are unnecessarily large for, for an entirely monogamous species.

64
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.050
And so we're a little bit on the wash. The guy out ahead of us, w.

65
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.210
<v 1>It'd be there's many people that make arguments that are monogamy is socially</v>

66
00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:11.700
reinforced and it's not natural. Look.

67
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.550
<v 0>If you look at hunter gatherers and so the best,</v>

68
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.020
the best way that we get a sense of, well, what,

69
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.250
what did we evolve to do is to look at the remaining hunter gatherer societies.

70
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.580
Particularly if you look at what are called immediate return on togethers.

71
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.220
So there are people who eat today, what they killed today.

72
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.010
And you've got a lot of hunter gatherers. Once they left the equator,

73
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.820
they could store food and everything changed for them. And they actually,

74
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.691
in many of their behaviors,

75
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:35.730
they look a lot like us and we can come back to that if you'd like,

76
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.190
but if you look at hunter gathers around the equator,

77
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.950
they're typically immediate return kill eat.

78
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.690
And so those guys tend to be, tend to be, there's always,

79
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.910
of course human differences where a super variable species,

80
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.950
but they tend to be serially monogamous. And so some people pair up for life,

81
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.720
lots of people pair up for five,

82
00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:57.420
seven years and then break apart and pair up again.

83
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.960
And so you have a sequence of children with the secrets of people, but,

84
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.510
but largely monogamous, not entirely.

85
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.700
<v 1>And in fact, monogamous during those time periods, it's.</v>

86
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.510
<v 0>Largely,</v>

87
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.140
now we know every single animal we've ever described as monogamous when we do

88
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:13.740
the DNA, we now find they're not entirely, but they're mostly.

89
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.730
<v 1>Hmm. Interesting. So, um, do you, have you ever read sex at Dawn?</v>

90
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.230
What did you think of that?

91
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.020
<v 0>Um, no offense, but I think it's total crap.</v>

92
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.760
<v 1>Chris. Ryan, do you hear that? Everybody's rocking on your book, bro. Uh, what,</v>

93
00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:28.080
what did you think is crap about it?

94
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.470
<v 0>I just don't think the system works that way. The, the explain.</v>

95
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.480
<v 1>To people that may or may not know, I haven't.</v>

96
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.480
<v 0>Read that book now since it came out. So let me remind, remind me of the thesis.</v>

97
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.530
You mean, the idea.

98
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.910
<v 1>Is that we evolved in these small tribes of people that</v>

99
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:44.340
essentially shared sexual partners.

100
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.990
<v 0>That's. And so the thing is that, what makes you say that so confidently? Well,</v>

101
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:51.750
I don't know. I shouldn't say it quite so confidently. You're absolutely right.

102
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.430
I believe that's. How's that? Okay. Why do you believe that's? Because, um,

103
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.570
so human beings have very clear, evolved jealousy systems,

104
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.740
and they're not just a product of the world that we live in today.

105
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.560
You can see jealousy among hunter gatherers as well.

106
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.140
Now the thing is they get jealous about different things because of course,

107
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:11.910
men and women have slightly different pressure on them,

108
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.950
but they both get jealous by infidelity.

109
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.330
Now that's not to say that the book is incorrect about some societies in some

110
00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:21.930
places, because one of the interesting things about humans is our flexibility.

111
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.860
And so you can create a system and some hunter gatherers have where there's a

112
00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:27.600
lot of that, a ton of that.

113
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.080
There's some really interesting ones where literally once the woman gets

114
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:31.501
pregnant,

115
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:34.260
she then starts to sleep with all the other males because she thinks her baby

116
00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:36.840
will gain the qualities of all the men that she sleeps with.

117
00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:40.620
So I'm not trying to claim that we're always monogamous because absolutely

118
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:41.454
that's untrue.

119
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.510
But I do think that the dominant system is one of serial monogamy. And I,

120
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.080
the reason I think that that's the dominant system is this is kind of the deal

121
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:53.100
that we made whereby um, the males go out and do the hunting,

122
00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:56.010
the females go out and do gathering. And that's basically universal.

123
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.240
She tends to for him, and that comes back to the fire point you made,

124
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:03.450
which we can come back to. And, um, and so they share resources and,

125
00:06:03.451 --> 00:06:06.380
and he's happy to share resources and do his best to kind of,

126
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:08.960
sort of look out for our kids. I mean, human males aren't,

127
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.810
we don't take as much care as human females do of our kids,

128
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.120
but we're much better than the other great apes.

129
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.910
And so that level of investment is going to make is,

130
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.090
tends to be to the degree that he believes that he's the father of the kids.

131
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.320
Now you have societies where he doesn't know that really all are polyamorous

132
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:25.520
like that by all means,

133
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.910
I don't know what percentage they are and it could even be they're more common

134
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:33.470
than I believe. But when that happens, the systems tend to change a little bit.

135
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.780
And he's a little bit less willing to look out,

136
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.870
try to help out kids other than to do her a favor,

137
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:40.580
unless the kid looks at all that himself.

138
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.130
<v 1>Now, what about why having a system,</v>

139
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.630
a biological system where jealousy comes up,

140
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.370
what makes you think that,

141
00:06:51.371 --> 00:06:56.350
that somehow or another negates the idea of polyamorous relationships?

142
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.490
<v 0>Well, it does suggest that they're not our default because it doesn't more.</v>

143
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.300
<v 1>Likely suggest that it encourages competition, which is just natural.</v>

144
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.440
<v 0>Well, now you think about envy instead of jealousy. And so if I'm jealous,</v>

145
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.130
I'm upset that my wife slept with somebody else last night,

146
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.560
he could be a lowlife. I don't envy a thing about him.

147
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.040
I don't want anything he owns, but I'm jealous of her behavior.

148
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.820
I'm protective of what she's done. And so there's a wonderful experiment.

149
00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:23.920
David bus has run at the university of Texas.

150
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.400
<v 1>They're the, of course, jealous of the man as well.</v>

151
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.290
You're not just jealous of her behavior.

152
00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:33.340
You're jealous of this other male that gets to have sex with your wife and could

153
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:38.020
not possibly encourage competition and encourage men to be more

154
00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:40.990
aggressive or more ingenious,

155
00:07:40.991 --> 00:07:44.890
or just create encouraged creativity and courage,

156
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.120
better hunting skills. So you attract more women. I mean,

157
00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:50.380
all those things seem to be.

158
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.530
<v 0>Yeah, I would agree with all that, but I'd phrase it a little bit differently.</v>

159
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:57.370
So this is a wonderful study out of the Philippines where they, uh, measured.

160
00:07:57.371 --> 00:08:00.190
Men's huge number of men's testosterone when they were single.

161
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.280
And then they waited a few years and measured it again after they were,

162
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.890
they were still single or now they're married or now they're married and they

163
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:07.060
have kids. Okay.

164
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.810
And I'm sure it wasn't a psychology study cause we can't afford to do that.

165
00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:11.950
It was probably some medical thing,

166
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.370
but they used a to answer this interesting psychological question,

167
00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:16.204
which what's happened.

168
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.420
Who's most likely to get the girl by their original testosterone levels.

169
00:08:19.421 --> 00:08:21.400
And what happens when you do well,

170
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.440
the guys who got married in the intervening few years had higher testosterone

171
00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:28.630
than the guys who didn't. So yeah, you're absolutely right.

172
00:08:28.631 --> 00:08:31.690
We're out there competing with other males in order to get the girl.

173
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.110
And there's lots and lots that goes on there. Tons of really interesting things.

174
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.590
But what's interesting is once we get the girl, our testosterone drops.

175
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.110
And so if we, once we partner up and if we're in a monogamous relationship,

176
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.300
not polyamorous, but in a monogamous relationship,

177
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:48.610
our testosterone drops and then it drops again.

178
00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:52.750
If we have kids and testosterone is a great hormone for getting out there and

179
00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:54.220
being competitive with other guys,

180
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.000
it's not a hormone for being nurturant for your children.

181
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.850
And it's not a great hormone for being faithful to your partner.

182
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.960
And so I think that we evolved to compete with other males in order to get into

183
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.380
the meeting game. So if you look at our ancestral DNA,

184
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:11.040
you know how you can track our ma male and female ancestry through mitochondrial

185
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:12.390
DNA on the mother's side and wine,

186
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.270
you'll see that we have far more female ancestors than male,

187
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.030
not quite two to one, but I think it's close to that.

188
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.710
And so what does that tell us? Well,

189
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.340
lots of guys are getting left out of the mating game entirely and lots of guys

190
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:24.900
are inseminating lots of different women.

191
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:28.680
So all those things that you said are absolutely true and all that pushes us for

192
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:29.514
competition.

193
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.390
But part of what I believe goes on as part of that competition that we engaged

194
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:36.690
in was in order to get the girl to get into that relationship in the first

195
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:37.430
place.

196
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.330
<v 1>Could I stop you there?</v>

197
00:09:38.331 --> 00:09:42.530
Because I think that if you're going to have a study on testosterone

198
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.300
and you, you have to have a study on lifestyle. I mean, if you,

199
00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:49.310
if you get married and you have children,

200
00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:52.190
one of the things that happens is you become less active. You you'd be,

201
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:54.590
you don't exercise as much. You don't sleep as much.

202
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.980
All those things have a pretty radical effect on hormone production.

203
00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.900
<v 0>Absolutely. And it could well be that, you know,</v>

204
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:03.380
you always have to have a proximal mechanism whereby evolution plays its game,

205
00:10:03.381 --> 00:10:08.030
right? So the distal cause is, um, as, as an evolved species,

206
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.300
we testosterone super important to get us into the mating game.

207
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.720
But it's less useful once we're in it. Well, all you could, what you could,

208
00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:17.660
all you have to do is have a system whereby those things tend to down-regulate

209
00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:19.730
testosterone. Exactly. Like you said, cause you know,

210
00:10:19.731 --> 00:10:23.450
those things are gonna happen once you get partnered up. And so, but mind your,

211
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.600
when our ancestors partnered up, they're still out hunting every day. You know,

212
00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:27.434
we may be.

213
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.850
<v 1>We don't have studies on, we don't.</v>

214
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.210
Unfortunately we don't w the issue is that I'm having with this is we have

215
00:10:32.211 --> 00:10:37.100
studies on the general health and testosterone and hormonal

216
00:10:37.101 --> 00:10:39.740
health of sedentary humans. Yeah. I mean,

217
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.900
I would like to know what their lifestyle is.

218
00:10:41.901 --> 00:10:45.350
I would like to know what they're doing. Doesn't seem to make any sense to me.

219
00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:49.760
Because one thing that everybody knows is that you get dad bod, right?

220
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.880
That's dad bought what his dad bought. Dad bought a guy who works all day,

221
00:10:52.881 --> 00:10:56.780
comes home, sits on the couch, probably eats food. You probably shouldn't eat,

222
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.350
hangs out with his kids. Doesn't get a whole lot of exercise works,

223
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.910
probably doesn't sleep as much as he should. That that's a, to me,

224
00:11:04.911 --> 00:11:08.540
that's a symptom of poor health and fitness.

225
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.030
<v 0>Right? And it's not a symptom our ancestors ever experienced.</v>

226
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:11.751
<v 1>Because it's not,</v>

227
00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:16.670
this is not necessarily an indication of any sort of evolutionary benefit

228
00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:18.170
of having low testosterone,

229
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.970
because we've demonstrated for sure that when people don't get sleep and when

230
00:11:22.971 --> 00:11:25.490
they don't get exercise, their testosterone drops.

231
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.620
So those are two things that absolutely happen when you get married and have

232
00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:28.160
children.

233
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.580
<v 0>Right. And the only thing I would say is the F times, uh,</v>

234
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.580
the time span of this study was only over a few years.

235
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:35.690
<v 1>Even worse.</v>

236
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.590
The thing about having this kind of a study and making these kinds of kind of

237
00:11:39.591 --> 00:11:43.190
conclusions based on, I mean, we see,

238
00:11:43.191 --> 00:11:45.410
we know these mechanisms are in place.

239
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.400
We already know that there's natural effects of sedentary lifestyle,

240
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.800
lack of sleep. And the,

241
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.990
the effects are your hormone production drops. Your body suffers.

242
00:11:55.991 --> 00:12:00.580
You become less healthy. And this is, this is not in indicating monogamy.

243
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.740
This is just indicating poor health.

244
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:07.390
This is not like an evolutionary advantage to having low testosterone,

245
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:08.560
because it helps you raise children.

246
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.310
You can have high testosterone and still be a good dad and raise children and

247
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:14.790
still have the theme. Of course, all these things are bell.

248
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.010
<v 2>Curves, right? The higher you are, the harder it gets.</v>

249
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.450
<v 1>I would say, yeah, the problem I'm having is,</v>

250
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:23.700
is drawing conclusions on this one study and stating them as if they're facts.

251
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.800
<v 0>You're absolutely right. I, I, if I say as a fact,</v>

252
00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:28.920
it's certainly overstated because we only know the problem with almost all of

253
00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:32.140
our studies is the exact one you point out we've got them on us. Right.

254
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.670
We don't have. And so, like the sex studies are a perfect example.

255
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.730
Like things like female orgasm, what role does it play? Well,

256
00:12:38.731 --> 00:12:41.700
you need really good data on a hunter gatherers to know the answer to that

257
00:12:41.701 --> 00:12:44.880
question. If you look at hunter gatherers, they don't have dad bod, right.

258
00:12:44.881 --> 00:12:46.020
They're all running.

259
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.380
And whether their fathers are not because they're out there hunting every day or

260
00:12:49.381 --> 00:12:52.860
gathering every day, very physically active. So if I, if I oversold that,

261
00:12:52.861 --> 00:12:54.150
my apologies, because you're absolutely right.

262
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.330
I suspect though that you'd find the same thing. I don't know it.

263
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.340
It's all we got right now. Can you suspect it? I mean, it just, there's no data.

264
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.170
Yeah. There is no data. It's.

265
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.500
<v 1>Just, when you look at these guys, I've, uh, I have a friend of mine who, um,</v>

266
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.960
he was, it was it,

267
00:13:09.961 --> 00:13:14.070
how do you say the name that Yanomami in Bolivia, Bolivia,

268
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.770
Venezuela, Brazil. Yeah. And, uh,

269
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.280
he spent some time with them and you see these people and the lifestyle they

270
00:13:20.281 --> 00:13:22.740
live, they're all barefoot wandering through the jungle.

271
00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:26.580
They have these crazy looking feet where their toes splay out,

272
00:13:26.581 --> 00:13:29.070
because they're just constantly gripping the floor with their toes when they

273
00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:30.720
probably get choke you with their feet, you know?

274
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.000
And these people just look so fit and healthy and they're in their fifties and

275
00:13:36.001 --> 00:13:38.790
sixties and seventies, and they have their shirt off and they're ripped.

276
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.330
<v 0>Yeah. They're super fit. Same holds. If you look at the Hudson Tanzania,</v>

277
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.260
any of these groups,

278
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.020
the Yanomamo are interesting because they're a hunter horticulturalist.

279
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.010
So they're actually doing a little bit of gardening as well, but they're,

280
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.480
they're, they're ripped and strong and they don't have obesity problems.

281
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.310
And so all I would say is that the same thing holds the one thing that we've

282
00:13:56.311 --> 00:13:58.020
found in humans in our modern culture,

283
00:13:58.021 --> 00:14:00.870
where we have these data is if you're married and have kids,

284
00:14:00.871 --> 00:14:03.690
but you're still looking around your T hasn't gone down as much.

285
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.910
Now you're going to point out quite rightly that, well,

286
00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:09.120
maybe that's a different kind of person than the person who marries and isn't

287
00:14:09.121 --> 00:14:09.954
looking around.

288
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.920
And so it's all confounded super hard to do experiments on these things.

289
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.590
And we'll be a lot better off when we've got, as you know,

290
00:14:16.591 --> 00:14:19.380
we're losing the world's last hunter gatherers are disappearing,

291
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.350
and it's not easy to collect these kinds of data,

292
00:14:22.351 --> 00:14:25.080
but they're doing lots of genetic work with these people right now,

293
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.970
all over Africa. Cause you know, there's,

294
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.980
we've got tons of genetic data now on European descent and east Asian descent,

295
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.280
but almost none on Africans. And so that's a huge project underway.

296
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.730
And so for all I know they're working on hormones and other things as well.

297
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.890
<v 1>Yeah. That's I mean, the reason why I'm asking about this is you're you were so</v>

298
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:49.050
readily dismissing. You were so willing to dismiss, uh.

299
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.350
<v 0>Dawn, but yeah. Well the,</v>

300
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.070
a lot of the facts that are laid out as facts in the book don't really hold up

301
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:57.380
and um, I wish I'd read it more recently.

302
00:14:57.381 --> 00:14:59.000
And so I could go through the details with you.

303
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:03.110
There's some really good reviews by anthropologists and by people who work in,

304
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.800
you know, sexual studies and stuff like that, going through the details,

305
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:07.670
we read it as a,

306
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.420
we haven't this evolutionary center center for psychology and evolution and we

307
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:15.770
read it and went through it and we weren't convinced I'm embarrassed to admit.

308
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:16.604
I can't remember. The.

309
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.440
<v 1>Chris is a very smart guy and he's a good friend of mine, a really great Pam.</v>

310
00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.260
It is a great book. I would love to see him debate one of those folks.

311
00:15:23.261 --> 00:15:24.100
I'm sure he probably has.

312
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:25.690
<v 0>He probably has. And look,</v>

313
00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:29.470
I know that all these things that we're talking about are heavily debated,

314
00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:30.820
right? So my colleague,

315
00:15:30.821 --> 00:15:34.120
Rob Brooks is a wonderful evolution biologist in Australia loves that book.

316
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.190
So the fact that I think it's is obviously one person's opinion where I'd I

317
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.200
dismiss that argument. Other people might say, well, look,

318
00:15:41.201 --> 00:15:44.770
there's a lot of cultures that do have much more like the system I told you

319
00:15:44.771 --> 00:15:47.410
about where they have sex with lots of men after they have their baby. Right?

320
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.380
You see humans are so flexible. We can do all those things.

321
00:15:50.381 --> 00:15:53.260
We just change the nature of how we do things. Um,

322
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.550
the social leap that I'm arguing about is not this pair bonding thing.

323
00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.640
It's about how our groups came together to engage in collective action.

324
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.040
So in principle, I'm agnostic on this issue.

325
00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:05.800
I just happen to disagree with that. I happen to feel like, no,

326
00:16:05.801 --> 00:16:07.210
I think we made these deals.

327
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.270
And so to come back to that study that David buss did that.

328
00:16:10.271 --> 00:16:14.650
I was starting to tell you about, so bus has this, um, he's got,

329
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:15.663
when he came along,

330
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.170
people thought that the two sexes had similar levels of jealousy for infidelity.

331
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.990
And David was like, well look, inseminations internal.

332
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.980
And so men should be a lot more worried about, uh,

333
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.970
her sleeping with somebody else than women should be because he men never know

334
00:16:30.971 --> 00:16:34.300
for sure if they're the father, they can't see it happen. Whereas, you know,

335
00:16:34.301 --> 00:16:37.390
if you're a salmon, you can say, okay, I'm the debt. I just watched that. But,

336
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.380
um, females that inseminations turtle, but they know they're the mother.

337
00:16:41.381 --> 00:16:45.250
That's not their concern. They should be more concerned about things like, um,

338
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.490
his giving her resources to help her raise the kid and things like that.

339
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.940
And so what BAS found is if you ask people this question,

340
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.350
what would bother you more?

341
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.490
Imagine your wife having sex with somebody that she just met for the first time,

342
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.120
having this great time and doing all these different funky things with them and

343
00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:05.980
then never doing it again. Or your wife develops this, you know, ongoing,

344
00:17:05.981 --> 00:17:09.250
emotional connection with somebody. She never touches him. He never touches her,

345
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:09.910
but she,

346
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.910
they talk and have shared their feelings and stare deep in each other's eyes.

347
00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.180
What would bother you more? And you ask men and women that question. Hmm.

348
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.560
So what would, in your case,

349
00:17:17.561 --> 00:17:20.200
what would bother you Martin to have your wife to know she had this one-off

350
00:17:20.201 --> 00:17:21.190
affair, fling,

351
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.780
sex only didn't care about the guy or she develops a sort of emotional bond with

352
00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:29.590
somebody never touches him. That's a good question.

353
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.330
I'd really have to think about that.

354
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.430
It's not an easy one cause nobody likes either of them.

355
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:38.290
<v 1>No. Yeah, because, uh, it's a matter of time before that dude gets in,</v>

356
00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:40.120
that's a Fox chick.

357
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.490
<v 0>In this case, it's a guarantee, right?</v>

358
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.230
<v 1>It's a guarantee that they never, never touch.</v>

359
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:49.000
Never as long as he doesn't talk about me, that's the problem. Those guys go.

360
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.020
They said that, well, I would do so much better. It was a treat. Right? Right.

361
00:17:54.021 --> 00:17:55.190
Well, here's the thing. Weasels.

362
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.970
<v 0>On average, men are more bothered by sex.</v>

363
00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.480
The one-off sex and women are more bothered by the emotional,

364
00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:03.530
emotional connection. Cause.

365
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.370
<v 1>That's the biggest thing. Transaction could lead to him leaving her. So.</v>

366
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:12.020
<v 0>If it's him living our direct in his resources elsewhere. And so, so it's,</v>

367
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.540
it's mind you, every time we talk about gender differences,

368
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.360
it's super important to keep in mind, they're heavily overlapping bell curves,

369
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.060
right? So it's never a hundred percent this way. And except like,

370
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.350
do you have this organ or something,

371
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.610
but psychologically it's always overlapping, but this is a big effect.

372
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.720
Men on average are much more bothered by the one-off sex and women on average

373
00:18:29.721 --> 00:18:32.630
are much more bothered by the emotional connect.

374
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.440
<v 1>Yeah, that's fascinating. Cause I was reading something about inappropriate,</v>

375
00:18:36.441 --> 00:18:41.330
emotional relationships that people have at work and that this is an issue

376
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.230
with the people that work together. They develop these, you know,

377
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.150
office friendships that lead to inappropriate

378
00:18:50.151 --> 00:18:54.140
emotional relationships. And I was like, whoa, this is a, you know,

379
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.960
I've never worked in an office. So I'm listening to this,

380
00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.970
reading this rather than I'm like what a, what a strange world that is like,

381
00:19:00.971 --> 00:19:02.810
I get it though. I get it.

382
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.140
Like if there's a guy and he's married and a gal and she's married,

383
00:19:06.141 --> 00:19:09.500
but they meet at work and they stare at each other's eyes all day and they go to

384
00:19:09.501 --> 00:19:12.830
lunch and maybe they even hold hands every now and then. Well they,

385
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.680
because that's where it crosses the line.

386
00:19:15.681 --> 00:19:18.050
Like you're allowed to hug people when you hold hands. That's,

387
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:23.230
so that's intense. That's skin, skin. It is serious. It's.

388
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.370
<v 0>Going to concern you have your partner,</v>

389
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.850
but what's also going to concern you as a mere fact that you see this kind of

390
00:19:28.851 --> 00:19:32.270
thing, this deep conversation happening and all that, because think about it.

391
00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:35.540
If we evolve to basically partner up for a while,

392
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.810
then there's always going to be the chance that that next person along is going

393
00:19:38.811 --> 00:19:40.130
to be the one that wedge is years away,

394
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.600
serial monogamy and both males and females gain from not putting all their eggs

395
00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:47.540
into the same genetic basket. So if my part,

396
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.040
if my wife partners up with you for a while,

397
00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:52.190
she'll get a certain kind of offspring and then maybe that'll be a great thing.

398
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:56.960
But maybe when the situation changes or the, um, you know, in tomorrow's world,

399
00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.690
some smaller wimpier guy would be handy in some way.

400
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.850
And so maybe she's better at partnering with me next.

401
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.320
<v 1>Interesting. Yeah,</v>

402
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:07.970
it is fascinating when you break it down that it really does become,

403
00:20:07.971 --> 00:20:12.950
there's a biological reason for these behaviors and

404
00:20:12.951 --> 00:20:17.150
these, the, the motivation for the jealousy and all these things that there's,

405
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.880
there's a history, a biological history to all this.

406
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:20.431
<v 0>And,</v>

407
00:20:20.431 --> 00:20:23.990
and we don't know what hunter-gatherer is how they would answer that question.

408
00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:27.620
So we can, we're only just assuming that the answer we're providing is general,

409
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.640
but for me, those kinds of things suggest that we involve,

410
00:20:31.641 --> 00:20:35.720
we evolved in a lot of long-term monogamous circumstances that may have been

411
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.140
serial and there was certainly fooling around. But if we were polyamorous,

412
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.760
like the book says we'd have bigger balls. Why our balls are so big though,

413
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.620
compared to a Chimp they're small. Yeah.

414
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.840
<v 1>But chimps are, I mean, everything's big with them. Well, no, our peanuts.</v>

415
00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.320
<v 0>Are way bigger than theirs. They got a tiny little.</v>

416
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.670
<v 1>They've large Paul's smaller penises puppies would probably get in the way.</v>

417
00:20:56.671 --> 00:20:57.600
Right? Well, no, here's.

418
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.260
<v 0>The thing about,</v>

419
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.280
so human beings copulate for an extraordinarily long period of time. And,

420
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.290
and we also have this cryptic ovulation, you know,

421
00:21:04.291 --> 00:21:06.030
where she's not showing you that she's in heat.

422
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:11.070
So male chimps aren't interested unless she has that enormous swelling on her

423
00:21:11.071 --> 00:21:13.770
vagina. And then they're like, oh, that's super attractive to me.

424
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.320
<v 1>But what about Bonobos? Because they.</v>

425
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.710
<v 0>Well, they do this funky sex thing all the time, right? Yeah. They have fun,</v>

426
00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:23.940
right? Yeah. They're all sorts of funky orgiastic kinds of things we use.

427
00:21:23.941 --> 00:21:24.774
There's a,

428
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.710
when I taught at Ohio state university that the zoo there has a great bone and

429
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.800
bone exhibit and you bring your kids through and there's a serious orgy going on

430
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.900
and the kids are like, came on and she's like, you know.

431
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.230
<v 1>Yeah. There's a lot of zoos that won't happen Nobles because of that. Right.</v>

432
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.640
<v 0>Yeah. They're pretty interesting.</v>

433
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.420
And so the thing is that those kinds of things just show you that it's

434
00:21:42.421 --> 00:21:45.120
complicated. Right. Any kind of straightforward answer,

435
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.220
it's going to have some wrinkles in it. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

436
00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:52.650
And I apologize if I get some earlier. No worries. And so anyway, the, um, the,

437
00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.210
uh, but back to this issue,

438
00:21:54.211 --> 00:21:58.440
so if we had a total bonobo Chimp kind of system,

439
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.350
I don't think we'd evolve those systems to jealousy because what's,

440
00:22:01.351 --> 00:22:03.810
what's to be gained by that. We're not making these longterm partners.

441
00:22:03.811 --> 00:22:04.920
Why would you get these differences?

442
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.400
<v 1>And whenever I bring Chris's book up in,</v>

443
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.800
I have to defend it because it has having a couple times a, the last year. Um,

444
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.140
I haven't read it in at least two years.

445
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.500
I'd have to go back and I read it back over five years ago,

446
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.220
but when it came out, when, um, my friend's wife got ahold of it,

447
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.510
my friend got it. And my friend's wife got all of it and she threw her right.

448
00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:28.680
In a trash, she read like a paragraph or two and she's like, this book.

449
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.680
<v 0>Uh, a lot of women react that way. And, and I can't remember why. Yeah,</v>

450
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.300
I'm sorry. I just don't have it loaded up whatever.
