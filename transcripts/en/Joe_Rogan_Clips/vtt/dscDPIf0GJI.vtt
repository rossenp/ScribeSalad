00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.520
There's psychological needs that are just as valuable and important as physical

3
00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:10.480
needs. Like we know we have needs for nutrients. We know needs for water.

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.200
We have needs psychological for, for all sorts of different things.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.040
Our communities are incredibly important. Love is incredibly important.

6
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.870
Family is incredibly, you know,

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.310
I know some people that are older men that, uh,

8
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:29.750
have been bachelors their whole lives and they're childless. And now they're,

9
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.070
you know, they just,

10
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.350
they don't have a deep connection with anybody and they get to this very weird,

11
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.870
strange place where they're like,

12
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:41.660
is this it now I'm 70 years old and I've never really, uh, had children.

13
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.820
And I don't know what to do. And this is, this is my life now. And it's, they,

14
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:50.740
they they've, all their friends have had families now and their families.

15
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.420
A lot of times the kids are grown up and it becomes very, very strange.

16
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.180
<v 1>You know, I thought about that a lot interviewed this guy, um,</v>

17
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.620
professor John Cassio at the university of Chicago,

18
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.770
who's the leading expert in the world alone in the, this.

19
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.530
And he said this thing to me, that it's,

20
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:05.730
so it's a bit like what the woman in said what a lonely way to.

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.130
<v 0>Live your life. He studying.</v>

22
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.530
<v 1>Quite actually, but the, uh.</v>

23
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.850
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; but he had.</v>

24
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.890
<v 1>This really interesting, this very simple point, but he just said,</v>

25
00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:16.810
if you think about the circumstances where we evolved, right?

26
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.970
If you got separated from the tribe, if you were alone, right,

27
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.850
you were depressed and anxious for a really good reason.

28
00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:24.000
You were about to be eaten. Yes. But you were in terrible danger.

29
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.520
If you got injured, no one would help. You would die. Right. So all the, he,

30
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:30.640
he showed. So when, as you know, when we're, when we're stressed,

31
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:32.640
we release a H hormone called cortisol.

32
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.680
He showed this interesting experiment that I wrote back in the book being

33
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.880
acutely lonely is as stressful as being punched in the face by stranger,

34
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:41.520
when it comes to cortisol release, right.

35
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.030
That's how deeply we are resistant to loneliness. Right? Right.

36
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.910
It's a signal telling you to get back to the tribe. That's why we bought,

37
00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:51.910
it's a really important signal. If humans hadn't had that signal,

38
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.990
we wouldn't be here. Right. Um, and I think you're right.

39
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:58.190
So when you look at these, these men, if you have an isolated,

40
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.710
there was this woman. So I covered this incredible,

41
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.700
this movement that happened in Berlin on a big anonymous housing project where

42
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.980
no one knew each other. And they came together to protest.

43
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.900
It was a woman who was about to kill herself, cuz she was about to be evicted.

44
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.020
And the whole housing project came together to say,

45
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:17.700
she should be allowed to stay in her home and they should have a rent freeze.

46
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.420
And it's an amazing story. I tell it in the book,

47
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.930
but there's something one of the women said to me that I, I never got,

48
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.050
she's called Neman. She'd grown up in Turkey and she'd come to Germany.

49
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.810
I think when she was 17. And she said, when I grew up in Turkey,

50
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.570
what I called my home was my village and everyone in it.

51
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.010
And then I came to live in the Western world and I learned that what you're

52
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:41.330
meant to call home is just your four walls. And if you're lucky your family

53
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.440
and then this protest again,

54
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.200
and we all got to know each other and this whole place became my home.

55
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.840
And I think of everywhere here is home now. And, and, and she realized that,

56
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.840
that we are homeless in some sense in the Western world,

57
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.760
that our humans have a need for a sense of belonging.

58
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.960
And our sense of home is too small to meet our sense of home, belonging,

59
00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:05.520
belonging. There's a wonderful, uh,

60
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:08.640
Bosnian writer called Alexander Hayman who said, um,

61
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.280
home is where people notice when you're not there. Right.

62
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.600
And a lot of us like these guys,

63
00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:17.120
you're talking about these older guys who notices if they're not there. Right.

64
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.910
Probably no one, probably they are in, in a sense homeless. Yeah. Right.

65
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.230
They are spiritually homeless. And um, I say that as I'm not a religious person,

66
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.790
I don't mean that's. I go.

67
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.630
<v 0>Through what you're saying. I hear.</v>

68
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.910
<v 1>What you're saying. It's very powerful. Did you know what I mean? Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:30.510
It's and so I think it's about, and,

70
00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:32.870
and this comes back to think about how different that is,

71
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.390
what everything we are talking about.

72
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:38.590
Think how different our conversation has been to what my doctor told me when I

73
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:41.860
was teenager. And I go in and I say, I'm in real pain.

74
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.180
And I feel like pain is leaking out at me and I can't control it. And he says,

75
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.340
you've just got a malfunction in your brain. Right?

76
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.260
What are the worst things about that? There are many things wrong with that.

77
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.180
Firstly, what he said to me is not true. Um, uh, I'm sure he believed it.

78
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.580
I think he was misinformed. I don't think he was deliberately lying to me,

79
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.460
but what he said was not true, but also to me,

80
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.010
biggest problem with just telling this exclusively biological story about

81
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:05.770
depression and anxiety, there's some real biological factors, of course,

82
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.050
is it cuts us off from having this conversation, right?

83
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.290
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; all those people you were talking about who are so

84
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.490
insistent as I was that their depression is just the result of a chemical

85
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.130
imbalance. If you think that it disconnects you from the source of your pain,

86
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.281
it, you,

87
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:24.160
you are just biologically broken and presumably always gonna be biologically

88
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:27.640
broken. When the conversation we are having, which is a different conversation,

89
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:31.520
it's a difficult conversation. It's a nuanced conversation. It's not simplistic.

90
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.520
It's not one problem, one lever to solve it. It's a much deeper and more,

91
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.190
uh, textured way of thinking. That is the conversation we have to have.

92
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:43.910
That's what the best scientists in the world are telling us the world health

93
00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:47.550
organization. And my worry is, um, we're just being pushed in the,

94
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:48.390
like you said, that, that,

95
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:51.710
that very good metaphor about driving 37 miles in the wrong direction, right?

96
00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:53.750
Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, we're just driving in the wrong direction.

97
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.910
We're driving away from the sources of our pain rather than towards it,

98
00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:58.790
where it can be understood and solved.

99
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.830
Of course it's always gonna be some pain in human life.

100
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.820
But the fact that we have this one in five people taking a psychiatric drug,

101
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.700
you know, uh, I think the figure is one in 10,

102
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.620
13 year old boys is taking a stimulant drug to make them focus.

103
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.740
I think the figure is 30% of old people in,

104
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.420
in retirement homes are being given antipsychotic drugs to shut them the up,

105
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.370
cuz they're rebelling against the way they're being treated in between one in

106
00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:25.010
four middle aged women in the United States is taking a chemical antidepressant

107
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.130
at any given time in four in, in four one in four. You're talking about the,

108
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.770
a society that, I mean the figures about how many children it's much lower,

109
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.330
but it's so much more extreme. The number,

110
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.410
the number of toddlers who've been given antipsychotics in the United States is

111
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:41.610
just off the scale. Right?

112
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.480
What I think Dr. Sammy to Mimi has written about this.

113
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.920
There's some extraordinary figure. I'm not getting the figure slightly wrong,

114
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:51.040
but it's something like a majority of children in foster care in the United

115
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.640
States are being given stimulant drugs basically to shut them up. Yeah. That's.

116
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.800
<v 0>That's a disturbing one,</v>

117
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.160
the Ritalin and various stimulants that they give to children. Um,

118
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.040
what's that about? What's the cause of that?

119
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.360
<v 1>Well, I think it's related,</v>

120
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.160
I I've researched this much less than the other things we've talked about. Okay.

121
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.160
But from, it came up a lot in the conversations that I had,

122
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.950
there are many things going on here. One of them is, um,

123
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.510
a lot of the, so a lot of the, not all of them,

124
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.430
a lot of the causes of depression and anxiety that I wrote about I couldn't

125
00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:24.551
help,

126
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:28.910
but notice reading all the research into being the scientists also can lead to,

127
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.670
um, decrease in focus and attention. So for example,

128
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.430
if you are dead end at work and you, you feel controlled all the time,

129
00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:40.340
you have to yourself to get through it. It's harder. Attention's a muscle,

130
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.170
right?

131
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.580
It's harder to bring your brain back to focus like Joe wanted to just go and

132
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.380
collapse and watch, you know, watch whatever was on, you know,

133
00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:48.180
the bachelor or whatever.

134
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.500
I don't think Joe would've watched the bachelor actually,

135
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.420
whatever would've been on the tell on the TV, um, that one.

136
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.380
<v 0>In his full state of depression, the bachelor, I was a line.</v>

137
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.090
<v 1>To, I can't do it. It was prepared to take Oxy,</v>

138
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.730
but not to go to that level of self harm. Right. But the, but the, or,

139
00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:04.090
or think about loneliness, right?

140
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:07.650
There's really professor caspo was showing this. If you are lonely,

141
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.490
that triggers what's called hypervigilance. Right. Again, for very good reason,

142
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.250
if you're on your own in the Savannahs of Africa, right?

143
00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:16.370
You wanna be hypervigilant. Of course. So you find it.

144
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.840
One of the things that was most challenging to me is this evidence that the

145
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:25.280
people with the lowest levels of attention problems and depression and anxiety

146
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:30.040
in the United States are the Amish. Right? And I am a atheist gay,

147
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.960
liberal. So the idea of going,

148
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.640
like learning something from the Amish was initially challenging to me.

149
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:37.800
And I've gotta admit, I felt really humble by going to spending time in,

150
00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:39.830
I went to this village called Alhart Grae,

151
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:44.110
which is just outside Fort Wayne in Indiana. And you know,

152
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.990
there's still a lot I disagree with about the Amish, probably wrong,

153
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.510
not least cuz I just re-watched witness. But uh, the, the &lt;laugh&gt; but,

154
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.390
but you know, they, I could see that they've got,

155
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:57.750
so there's very interesting about the Amish. As you know, when you turn 16,

156
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.683
if you're an Amish,

157
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.020
you got to leave and go and live in what they call the English world, our world,

158
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:02.301
right.

159
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:05.220
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then you decide whether to come back about 80% decide

160
00:08:05.221 --> 00:08:06.060
to come back 20%.

161
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.780
Don't it's one of the reasons why the Amish is never counted as a cult cuz no

162
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:10.660
cult would do that. Right?

163
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.820
No cults gonna tell you to leave for two years and then decide whether to come

164
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:16.900
back fact the exact opposite. So they have lived in our world,

165
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:18.340
they know our world really well.

166
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.970
And having this very challenging conversation with, um, what's his name?

167
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.250
Lauren beachy. His name is an Amish guy there who said there was so beer,

168
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.450
it goes back to the weight conversation we had. He said, um, look,

169
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:32.050
there's loads of things I miss. He talked about missing that seventies show.

170
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.530
He said, I used to love driving in trucks cuz they obviously don't drive.

171
00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:39.810
They don't use altity off the grid. And he said, but you know, if I kept those,

172
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.400
I wouldn't spend time with my family. I wouldn't spend time with my children.

173
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.040
I wouldn't, I wouldn't know who my neighbors were. And he,

174
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.000
he said this very challenging thing. He said, you know, weight Watchers.

175
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.280
And I said, yeah. And he said, well,

176
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.200
the idea of weight Watchers is you can only lose weight together as a group.

177
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:54.320
Right. It helps or not only,

178
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.160
but it helps you to lose weight together as a group that you would find it

179
00:08:57.161 --> 00:09:00.680
harder on your own. This is like that. And I said, what are you saying? Right?

180
00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:03.920
The Arish is like weight Watchers for the problems of Western and civilization.

181
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.720
And he's like, yeah, that's what I'm saying. And to me that was so challenging.

182
00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:09.560
The idea that you've gotta give, cuz we,

183
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.080
it comes back to what you're saying about junk values in our culture.

184
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.920
We're told the solution is always to get more.

185
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.350
And the idea that the solution is to have less and be present more is really

186
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.910
challenging.

187
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:20.140
<v 0>Right?</v>

188
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.350
Well don't I don't even think it's about having less it's about what they're

189
00:09:23.351 --> 00:09:26.990
doing is look, think about what the Amish are doing. First of all,

190
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.870
massive sense of community, right? They're very connected.

191
00:09:29.871 --> 00:09:32.030
They're not using cell phones. They're not using email.

192
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.860
So the community is also based on one to one real social cues,

193
00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:38.580
real social interaction, which is critical.

194
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.580
It's a big part of being a human being.

195
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.940
And it's one of the more absent things in modern society. Two physical labor,

196
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.820
they're involved in a lot of physical labor because they don't use electricity.

197
00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:51.940
They don't use power tools. They there's so many things that they don't do.

198
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.850
So because of their culture, they're making their own homes or right.

199
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.810
So they have a, a vested interest in helping each other,

200
00:09:58.811 --> 00:10:00.090
working together as a community.

201
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:04.770
And they have a deep sense of satisfaction of constructing each other's homes.

202
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.490
You construct my home with me. I help you build your home.

203
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.730
They take care of their animals. They take care of their crops.

204
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:16.320
They take there's, there's a real connection with where they get their food. Um,

205
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.560
a real connection with where they're they live their community.

206
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.240
The sense of just that, the whole,

207
00:10:22.241 --> 00:10:26.040
the sense of belonging to something that's bigger than you. It's a,

208
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:31.040
there's so many factors involved in their happiness that you can kind of

209
00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:33.680
see where, yeah, there's a lot of wacky with the,

210
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.790
the cult aspects of being an Amish person. And,

211
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.950
but what you get out of it,

212
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.030
it's almost like if you had a self-help group that subscribed to all the

213
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.990
positive benefits of being Amish and they just called it like regrounding or

214
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:51.190
something like that, you just go out there and you become a part of nature.

215
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.270
And I mean, that's,

216
00:10:52.271 --> 00:10:56.430
that seems like a co-op that seems like some sort of a farm based co-op right?

217
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.340
Yeah. I build each other's houses. Stay together.

218
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.180
You don't have to wear sexy clothes. Let's just all wear the same.

219
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.220
It's no big deal.
