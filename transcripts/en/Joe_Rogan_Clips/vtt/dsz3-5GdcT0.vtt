00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 1>Well, I'm happy you're back,</v>

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.100
but I'm not happy that it was a motivation to bring you back based on the

4
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:11.640
violence, you know, the violence that is going on between, uh,

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.210
the cartels and it was the Mormons. And then it was,

6
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:16.890
we were just talking about this, uh,

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.490
other person that got shot because they ran. What would you explain that again?

8
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:21.780
They were ran a cartel roadblock.

9
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.640
<v 0>Yeah. Basically in Tama, Lipa is a lot of the cartel groups actually make, uh,</v>

10
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.540
uh, they build their roadblocks in the, on the, uh, state and local roads.

11
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.460
And according to what I've heard from some of the people that I know there, uh,

12
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.340
this family, uh, ran one of those roadblocks.

13
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.020
They didn't know if it was cops or not.

14
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:43.890
And they apparently decided to run the roadblock and the cartel guys shot.

15
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.670
<v 1>Hmm. What should someone do they encounter a cartel roadblock?</v>

16
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.830
<v 0>Uh, slow down. Um, I mean, if, if, uh,</v>

17
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.920
if anything, I would probably avoid traveling through those areas.

18
00:00:55.921 --> 00:01:00.240
That's the number one wins. Um, usually, you know,

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.470
and I've actually gone through some of those myself really. Yeah. And it's, uh,

20
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.680
it's all about, they're all, they're all,

21
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.480
they're looking out for the four rivals moving through their territory.

22
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.650
They're looking for government personnel, maybe spying on them. And, uh,

23
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:17.880
usually it usually they'll just shake you down for some money and they'll let

24
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:21.480
you go on your way, unless you have a four by four truck that can use for their,

25
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.340
you know, their own purposes, which is.

26
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.480
<v 1>Where they might take your truck.</v>

27
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.820
<v 0>Yeah. Uh, uh, specifically in Tama,</v>

28
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.910
Lipa is a four by four trucks ever commodity for them.

29
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:32.460
They use them for their ongoing tour for.

30
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.390
<v 1>Oh, right. Especially someone else's that they don't mind getting shot up.</v>

31
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.180
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, most of the trucks that you see that are arm up armor,</v>

32
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:45.630
or they have the rifles on top are usually stolen vehicles. Um,

33
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.420
all of them are stolen vehicles and a lot of them are, you know,

34
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.040
Americans crossing into Mexico.

35
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:53.940
Some of them are Americans crossing into Mexico and just getting the trucks

36
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:54.774
stolen.

37
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.550
<v 1>Is that that's a real common thing.</v>

38
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.240
<v 0>It's, it's, it's, it's starting to be pretty common. Um, uh,</v>

39
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.880
I recently saw a case of an, of an apparent abduction, uh, in, uh, in,

40
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:06.360
in Tamaulipas. Um,

41
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.080
you see the video in the cartel guys come out of the car,

42
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.490
they grabbed the, the, the, the owner of a, of a pickup truck.

43
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:16.290
They'd get them out of the car. They take a cell phone,

44
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.780
leave it on the sidewalk because they are,

45
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:22.290
they're aware of all the SOS technology and they take them inside and inside of

46
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:26.670
another car and they take the truck. And you thought you would think, you know,

47
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:30.360
it's because he did something or he's, he's involved in something the,

48
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.370
let him go a few blocks later and just took the truck.

49
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.000
It was all about the truck. Wow. Yeah. It's the resources, you know,

50
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.050
they're just acquiring resources for their, for the war, basically.

51
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.310
<v 1>Nice of them to let them go.</v>

52
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.030
<v 0>Nice of them to let them go. You know, it's not always the case.</v>

53
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.710
It's not always the case, but it's pretty. Yeah.

54
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.900
<v 1>I think most people in America are just now waking up to the chaos</v>

55
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.120
that's going on down there. I think that, uh,

56
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.660
the Mormon assassination was a real wake up call, but I think, uh,

57
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.530
people are paying much attention now. I mean, we've, we talked about this.

58
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.380
When was the last time you were on, it was like five months. Yeah.

59
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.280
<v 0>I've got a lot of the stuff we talked about those five months ago. Uh,</v>

60
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.340
kind of that's how things progressed.

61
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.340
We actually did mention the Mormon communities down there,

62
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:18.860
which was kind of eerie. Yeah. And, uh, uh,

63
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.400
we talked about the possible designation of cartels as terrorists, uh, uh,

64
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.273
terror groups.

65
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.000
<v 1>Yeah. You, you had an interesting take on that. So, uh,</v>

66
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.540
Trump was saying that they were going to designate them as terrorist groups and

67
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:34.810
that they were gonna have military action against them. Yeah.

68
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.040
And then there was some sort of negotiation with the president of Mexico.

69
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.063
What do, what do you think went down?

70
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.140
<v 0>So, I mean, this is just, you know,</v>

71
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.550
from what I see and from how things traditionally happen down there,

72
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.050
Mexico is currently, uh, has a current, currently a, a leftist president.

73
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.610
Now there he's very, to the left, uh, so much to the left that he, um,

74
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.630
he recently gave Evo Morales, the deposed leftist, uh,

75
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.610
president of, uh, uh, Bolivia, uh, asylum in the country. Um,

76
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.920
and there's been a lot of, you know,

77
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.480
pro left political stuff going on in Mexico, basically.

78
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.913
Um,

79
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.810
as soon as the designation threat by the U S came down,

80
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.680
there was some sort of negotiation. And a lot of things happened after,

81
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.850
after some us officials went down there and talked to the government among them,

82
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.150
Evo Morales is out he's, uh, he went to Cuba apparently,

83
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:32.620
and then went to Argentina. So he's not going to stay in Mexico, uh,

84
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.740
former head of, uh, of, uh,

85
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.280
public security under the Calderon administration,

86
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:42.070
which is two administrations past the president.

87
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:45.370
Calderon is the one that started the drug war. He was, uh,

88
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.640
arrested for cartel involvement. And, uh,

89
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.210
basically we're seeing money from the cartels. Um,

90
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.630
he was going through his immigration process and he was actually asking for full

91
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:58.900
citizenship and they got him online through the authority,

92
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.070
the immigration authorities.

93
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.830
And he said that he never received money from the cartels.

94
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:07.210
And apparently he did a lot of it. Right. So all these things happened after,

95
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.290
after they walked back the threat of, uh, of, uh,

96
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.930
designating cartels as a terrorist organization.

97
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.120
<v 1>So there has been some action.</v>

98
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.750
So they must've made some negotiation where trumpet said, listen,

99
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:22.720
we're going to do this. And he'd say, hold up, let's talk.

100
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.280
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, the main thing is, uh, Mo uh,</v>

101
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.610
one of the things that this current president, uh,

102
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.170
undressed Manuel Lopez over a ran on was, uh, creating a national police force,

103
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.440
right? Like, uh, national guard as is what he calls it,

104
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.030
which had already kind of been done before, but, you know, change the name,

105
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.110
change the uniform, changed the packaging, and it's a new thing, right. Uh,

106
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.610
he wanted, he wanted the army out of the drug war because the casualties, uh,

107
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.840
were mounting on both sides. And he said, it wasn't a military. Uh,

108
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.210
it shouldn't be a military operation. And he ran on a platform that was called

109
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.860
[inaudible], which means hugs, not bullets. Right. So basically he's crossed

110
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.860
 amnesty for the cartels was basically kind of the main theme of that. Um,

111
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.860
 so you got into power. The first thing he did militarized police forces and 

112
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.693
create a national guard and dissolve and try to dissolve the federal police.

113
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.140
Uh, and most of that, uh, national guard, uh, force was, uh,

114
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.780
designated to border patrol duties on the Mexican side.

115
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.680
So some of them went to the south of the border, um, uh,

116
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.910
south Southern Mexican border.

117
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:35.150
And some of them went through the Northern Mexican border basically to stem the

118
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:39.410
whole illegal, uh, immigration crisis with the caravans.

119
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.490
That's what kind of happened.

120
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.530
And it was a kind of a collaboration between the U S and the Mexican government.

121
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.580
Um, so that was one of the key points of collaboration that they had.

122
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.680
And when this whole designation thing went up,

123
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:55.280
that was kind of like a bargaining chip that the Mexican government had with the

124
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:59.900
U S and the rest of the things that kind of transpired afterwards. You know,

125
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:02.520
it's pretty interesting how a lot of things happened after that,

126
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.540
a meeting down there, uh, and how they walked back the, uh,

127
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.670
the terrorist designation. So the terrace.

128
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.140
<v 1>The terrorist designation would mean that Trump would have some sort of</v>

129
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:13.850
incentive to invade Mexico.

130
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.530
<v 0>It would, it would,</v>

131
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.120
it would open up the possibility for military direct military action against

132
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:23.750
strikes strikes without permission of the,

133
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.540
of the nation that these strikes were going to take place.

134
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.420
Also targeting finances, uh,

135
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.020
or anything related to cartel activities would be targeted. We have,

136
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:37.410
where did the cartels keep their cash? Well, um, it's, it's,

137
00:07:37.411 --> 00:07:42.350
it's a it's right now. It's a myriad of things. Um, they diversified long ago,

138
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:45.390
so it's not like they're keeping, uh, buried cash in a, in a,

139
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.020
in a contained container, somewhere in the, in the jungle,

140
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:50.930
like Escobar you to do. Right, right. They're still finding some,

141
00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:55.700
some like rotted cash from the eighties. Um, they're,

142
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:59.120
they're putting their money in cryptocurrency. Uh, yeah,

143
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.190
they're diversifying their, uh, their, their, uh,

144
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.820
investments in actual companies like legit companies with a clean,

145
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:09.530
their money that way, um, real estate hotels,

146
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.050
uh, property on the U S side.

147
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.740
So they're also investing on the us side of the border as well. So, you know,

148
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.280
monies it's, it's not, you know, it's not under the mattress or, you know,

149
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.710
giant stacks of cash in the room. So what kind.

150
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.650
<v 1>Of banks do business with the cartels? How do they.</v>

151
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.570
<v 0>Negotiate that I'm not going to say names,</v>

152
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:30.350
but there's been a few cases of pretty large banks that have been involved in,

153
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:32.660
in, in, uh, money-laundering for the cartels recently.

154
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:33.920
And people can look that up easily,

155
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.580
but you would think you would have a designated cartel.

156
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.740
You would have cartels designated as terrorists.

157
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:42.560
So now they're banks involved in funding, terrorism.

158
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.770
So that would change things. That's, you know,

159
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.810
there's a lot of things that would happen. You know, some,

160
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.980
some of these consequential people talk about designating them as a terrorist

161
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:53.480
and central and down there,

162
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.900
things that they kind of talk about is that if a terrorist designation does

163
00:08:57.901 --> 00:08:58.734
happen,

164
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.450
most people seeking asylum in the U S from Mexico now have the claim of, uh,

165
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:05.930
of running from terrorists in, in Mexico.

166
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.990
So now they can claim that as far as, uh, uh, you know,

167
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.430
asylum seeking people can claim that. Now it's a different thing. Um,

168
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.451
you know, the,

169
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:19.020
the main argument that a lot of people say is that cartels aren't, uh,

170
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.640
can't be considered a terrorist,

171
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.300
a terrorist group because they don't have political aspirations.

172
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.790
The problem with that theory is that we have a lot of political killings by

173
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.020
cartels in Mexico,

174
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.320
where they shoot the candidate of one side of the political spectrum,

175
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:37.800
because it's not good for them. So they influence politics.

176
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.690
They also pay off a lot of politicians down there. Um, and they also, uh,

177
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.980
examples of the new generation cartel from Guadalajara giving out, uh,

178
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.060
Christmas gifts or groceries to the poor,

179
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.830
basically doing hearts and minds type tactics in the area are clear political

180
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.700
movements, right. So, you know, how does it,

181
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.740
why is terrorism happening connected to politics? Well, that's,

182
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.740
that seems classical. The classical definition of that is a terrorist group.

183
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.120
That's what they're basing it on.

184
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.350
I think the cartels and narcoterrorism is a thing in and of itself.

185
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.370
It's a new phenomenon.

186
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.110
It should be terrorism should be reclassified to include it. I think, you know,

187
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.560
most people that live through that type of situation in that type of, in,

188
00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:27.090
in that type of area in the country facing some of these cartel threats that

189
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:30.720
have flooded, we'll call it what it is. Yeah. It's terrorism, terrorism.

190
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:33.090
They're terrified. Yeah. I mean, that's literally, I mean,

191
00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:36.180
who's more terrifying in the cartels, so.
