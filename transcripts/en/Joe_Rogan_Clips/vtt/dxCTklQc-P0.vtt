00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 1>Speaking to current events is the president going to jail?</v>

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.210
We're trying to figure this out. Is he going to jail? It seems like,

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.670
it seems like some serious is going down. It sure feels like it is.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.010
And you know what? It feels like. It's really interesting. It's like a,

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.600
it's like you're watching a show.

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.300
<v 0>It's a really entertaining show. Yeah. I mean,</v>

8
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:25.920
I don't mind that house of cards is in production. Cause this is a good show.

9
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:26.754
We're watching it.

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.120
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, it's ramping up whatever, whatever is going on.</v>

11
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:33.960
It's like they're building towards an event and it seems like they have been

12
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:34.830
planning this,

13
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.420
like they're systematically attacking different parts of his administration,

14
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.230
getting people to fold, getting people to turn state's evidence,

15
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.120
getting people to, you know,

16
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.690
to plead guilty and they're slowly chipping away.

17
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.170
<v 0>There's no way that the end result could be like, eh, that's it we're done.</v>

18
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.310
This is as far as we got,

19
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.210
it feels like there's definitely a shoe's going to drop. Right. I mean.

20
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.010
<v 1>Crazy thing is they're going to get them for campaign financing because</v>

21
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.940
of his attorney paying off stormy Daniels.

22
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.150
<v 0>I think that the thing that I read and I could be getting this wrong is that</v>

23
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.930
it's that payoff within a certain number of days of the election, right.

24
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.140
That starts to break a finance law, I guess,

25
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.670
because they said that that payment was within a certain number of days of the

26
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:21.504
election.

27
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.770
<v 1>What it means is that it's affecting the re the election.</v>

28
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.350
<v 0>Potentially is what yeah. What the accusation.</v>

29
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.360
<v 1>Could be. Isn't that an interesting, it's like,</v>

30
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.840
you're paying someone to affect opinion.

31
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.610
And so that's like, it's a campaign finance violation. Yeah.

32
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.010
<v 0>It's also amazing that I don't know. I mean,</v>

33
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:43.950
I guess at the time somebody comes to you with that check and you're like, sure.

34
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.150
But in retrospect,

35
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.930
think of how much leverage she would have had if you go back then and, and,

36
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.370
and she gets to say, you want me to keep this thing silent? No problem.

37
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.530
But you need to up that check.

38
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.630
<v 1>Well, how about bill? O'Reilly bill O'Reilly paid one lady 32 million. Whew.</v>

39
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.250
Nuts. What did he do?

40
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.150
<v 0>No, that's not, that's not squeezing an cheek. Right?</v>

41
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.380
<v 1>Did he do, what did he do? First of all? How much money does he have?</v>

42
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.350
32 million. He's like, just pay it, just pay it off.

43
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.810
Write it off as what is that? A year salary.

44
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.890
<v 0>A lot of, uh, settlements. Roger Ailes. Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.230
<v 1>And have you seen the bit I'm doing on Fox news? No.</v>

46
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.020
It's one of my favorite bits. Oh, I love doing this. It'd be in the new one.

47
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:29.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.470
<v 0>No, I look forward to seeing.</v>

49
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.070
<v 1>You there. So it's such a fascinating little place over there. Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.390
And right now they're what they're doing for the most part. Not every show,

51
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.720
but most of the show, other than Tucker Carlson,

52
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.770
I think is one of the few guys over there that is,

53
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.080
he seems, he seems the most reasonable. Really?

54
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.943
Yes.

55
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.040
<v 0>You think he's more reasonable than like shepherd Smith?</v>

56
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.350
<v 1>Wow. I never watched that guy. Well.</v>

57
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.590
<v 0>That guy is like, I'm saying.</v>

58
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.700
<v 1>Has a he's there, but he seems to have like a little more bat,</v>

59
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:07.030
like unbiased balanced. If you are doing ecstasy with Shepard Smith,

60
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:08.410
he tried to kiss you. I hope so.

61
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.130
<v 0>I think you would. I've been losing weight. Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.130
<v 1>But the red and the rest of it,</v>

63
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:19.540
my point is the rest of this show seems like state-run propaganda.

64
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.980
<v 0>And here's the thing he it's, it's also, when it's not a secret,</v>

65
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.090
it's kind of fascinating, right.

66
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.860
That it's not a secret that he has real relationships with

67
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.490
multiple on-air talent. Like the president is like, I'm friends with Jeanine.

68
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:38.260
Pirro I'm really good friends with Sean Hannity. I'm really good. I watch, yeah.

69
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.010
Every day I watch a morning show called Fox and friends.

70
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.960
And as they report things,

71
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.760
I tweet out like policy change based on this morning show.

72
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:52.480
And it's not secret. Like, it's just it, you see the segment.

73
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:56.050
And then he's like, like there was like this aired at six 30, at 6 30, 2,

74
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.360
he's like, we're going to have to do something about this.

75
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.550
And they just did a segment on it.

76
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.680
And then that also throws his aids and his staff, uh, curve balls.

77
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.080
Because there'll be not expecting that he's going to bring this up. Right.

78
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.610
He sees it on TV and there, and then they have to go like, yeah,

79
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.960
of course we're going to do that because from the TV, yeah. It's nuts.

80
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.360
He watches a lot of cable.

81
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.130
<v 1>TV. They say watches eight hours a day.</v>

82
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.200
<v 0>He doesn't like to go to the office early.</v>

83
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.140
And that's one of my other favorite ones. Like they had like,

84
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:29.230
John Kelly has been like, you've got to get here earlier.

85
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.470
That's hilarious. I said, I set out for a while.

86
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:39.970
He was showing up at 11 and that they were trying to get him to come at nine.

87
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:42.460
And then I think they settled on 10 or something. Yeah.

88
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.660
I want to get there at nine. That's ridiculous.

89
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.760
<v 1>Yeah. It's so interesting. I really think if he doesn't get us into a war,</v>

90
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.810
having him as the president will be very beneficial. Yeah. Yeah.

91
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.880
Because I think that we're going to realize how crazy it is to give one person

92
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:03.370
so much power based on a popularity.

93
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.570
<v 0>It, it, it does kind of highlight the absurdity of not just of him,</v>

94
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.010
of the presidency. Right.

95
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.590
<v 1>Completely absurd. Yeah. We'd never do it that way today.</v>

96
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.660
If we had no government at all,

97
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.960
if we lived in some sort of bizarro universe where a government had never been

98
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:21.040
established, we decided enough is enough. We can't live with anarchy anymore.

99
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.230
We need to have some sort of a system of rules,

100
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.840
checks and balances and putting we'd never say, all right,

101
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:29.980
let's have a popularity contest. See one dude. And let's let,

102
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.250
let him get financed by giant group.

103
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.170
<v 0>No, that all, it's ridiculous. It's so. I know this.</v>

104
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.950
And then it seems like everybody, you know, agrees, that's fine,

105
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.140
but then never changes. Yeah.

106
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.060
I've been hearing for a decade plus about campaign finance reform and stuff.

107
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:53.880
And then it's still, you know, powerful, super packs, you know,

108
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.491
collect them all.

109
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:56.860
We'll just find a loophole and then we'll get the money that way. I mean,

110
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.703
nothing changes.

111
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.140
<v 1>Well, the, just the amount of money and influence,</v>

112
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.320
it's all tied in together to try to completely shake that off.

113
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.500
You'd have to get people to be 100% ethical. They would have to say,

114
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.870
you know what? This is just not the way to run the government.

115
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:11.060
It's not right for the people, but they're not going to do that.

116
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.470
There's just too much influence.

117
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.100
It just shows you how the sneaky and snaky the whole thing is.

118
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.930
But it's also really interesting too,

119
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:22.610
because we're going to be forced with this guy B because of all this chaos,

120
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.130
we're going to be forced to like, re-examine how we do things.

121
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.530
Maybe it be a little change for the next president with that.

122
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.000
I agree. I'm sorry.

123
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.070
The real worry would be that he would get through eight years.

124
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:35.390
Then one of his sons would take over.

125
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.860
<v 0>I guess it's not out of the realm of possibility. Not even a little,</v>

126
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.320
I have this theory that I think he actually,

127
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.550
in a way will really relish and enjoy, um,

128
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.270
the midterms in November going Democrat,

129
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.750
because that totally feeds into his,

130
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.980
like just their attacking. Yeah. And like being able to be like, of course,

131
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.880
nothing gets done cause he's concept or an office now.

132
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.540
And I think that he would really actually almost enjoy cause he loves combative

133
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.030
things, you know, like, like a combative relationship.

134
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.940
I think he's actually going to, if it goes that way,

135
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:13.550
I think he will like really enjoy it. I.

136
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.640
<v 1>Think so. But I also think that he likes winning though. He does.</v>

137
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.500
<v 0>Like winning, of course he likes winning and it's, it's a, it's like compulsive,</v>

138
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:24.380
you can tell that when they'll, you know, they'll ask Oprah,

139
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:26.780
you're going to run. She's like, no, he's like, I hope she runs kick her,

140
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.910
but he can't help himself. You know,

141
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.570
he has that kind of competitive side to him. Yeah.

142
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.400
<v 1>No, he definitely does. Well,</v>

143
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:37.160
they say they don't want him to testify because they know they're going to catch

144
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.640
them lying. They're like, you can't do it. I can do it. Don't worry.

145
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:41.474
I'm not going to lie.

146
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.570
<v 0>All his lawyers have said like a hundred percent, don't do that. And he's like,</v>

147
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.590
oh, I'll think about it. Which means that like he, you know, cause he,

148
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.090
he says that a lot with, uh,

149
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.650
you can tell when they have like those off the cuff, um, you know, press,

150
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.410
when he lets the press in, they'll ask him something, he'll be like,

151
00:07:57.411 --> 00:08:01.370
we'll see what happens, which is totally like, I might do it. I might not.

152
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.050
But you know that everybody in his side is like, please don't say anything.

153
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.920
<v 1>Uh, at this point they might not even be, they might be like, go ahead.</v>

154
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.010
Do you want to, yeah, go ahead. Tough guy, go dark.

155
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.830
<v 0>GoTalk who knows, man. I'll get another job.</v>

156
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.660
How amazing would it be to watch that deposition or, or, you know, uh,

157
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.913
interview.

158
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.520
<v 1>Do you remember when bill Clinton was grilled about Monica Lewinsky and the.</v>

159
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.530
<v 0>Word is yeah. Yeah.</v>

160
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.220
<v 1>It was amazing. And just the, the term sexual relations.</v>

161
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.840
Not as I understand it the way I understand the word,

162
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.880
that's not it. Yeah.

163
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.530
<v 0>No, I mean, that was fascinating. Eight he's so shameless.</v>

164
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.720
<v 1>Well, not just that, it's just, it seems so strange. Yeah.</v>

165
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:52.340
Back then in the 1990s, to be able to watch the president in video,

166
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:56.010
get grilled and clearly they wanted to release this videos to humiliate them.

167
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.340
Of course, you know, but it was just bizarre. It's like, I've never,

168
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.760
we'd never seen anything like this. You've never seen a sitting president,

169
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.170
like getting grilled by people and especially about sex.

170
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.860
<v 0>And the shift mode. Like, uh, you know, we knew him as this,</v>

171
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.190
obviously you'd see him on the campaign trail or meeting people.

172
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:17.340
He's like this super charming, right? Like personable guy,

173
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.050
really good at being basically a celebrity. Not really good at that.

174
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:26.670
And he's like, you know, knows how to be a politician. But in that deposition,

175
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.040
I mean he switched onto lawyer mode and, and like, I'm not here to charm you,

176
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.110
because he was spin on is what does is mean is

177
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.600
like, uh, I remember just, I mean, I'm a kid.

178
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:41.250
I think I was in high school watching that and be like,

179
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.240
how does anyone struggle with is like, is this, you know, I didn't know.

180
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:48.600
He was like playing a game with them too, you know? Oh yeah.

181
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.790
<v 1>Well they were playing lawyer games.</v>

182
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.230
<v 0>Yeah. Total war games.</v>

183
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.970
<v 1>Yeah. Trump can't do that. He's not smart enough to do that. No more.</v>

184
00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.090
He's not a lawyer. So he's not, I wouldn't say he's not,

185
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.530
I don't think that Trump is not smart. I think he's smart.

186
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.350
I've I've especially when you listen to interviews of him from the past,

187
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.530
like he's like there's some interviews I'm in the past,

188
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:13.620
very articulate and obviously been very successful in business.

189
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.540
But I don't think he's an interested in expanding his horizons

190
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.780
mentally. I don't think he's interested in reading. No, I don't think he.

191
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.780
<v 0>I think that he really, 100% does the,</v>

192
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:29.700
did run his business off of instinct and, and like.

193
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.530
<v 1>Gut and relationships and loyalty and all this stuff that he's promoted.</v>

194
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.890
<v 0>When they say like, you can't do that here. He's like, check-in.</v>

195
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.640
<v 1>No, why can't I I'm the president off. That's the people want it.</v>

196
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.503
Do you want to read it?

197
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.690
<v 0>Need, uh, this briefing? No, I don't like to be briefing.</v>

198
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.970
<v 1>I like to read. He doesn't like to read.</v>

199
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.210
They say they put the word Trump in his briefings a bunch of times just so that

200
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:55.440
he reads it. Screwed ahead. What was it about me? What's what else about me?

201
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.940
I'm amazing. Oh my God. I'm amazing.

202
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.890
<v 0>I don't know, man. It does feel like it's going to get star report.</v>

203
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.670
This is what.

204
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.260
<v 1>Yeah. Blood to a 10 star. Yeah. This would be like Mueller's report.</v>

205
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:09.750
That would be coming out maybe later this year or something like that.

206
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:11.040
Is that the equivalent? I don't know.

207
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:16.080
<v 0>Uh, yeah, I guess if they, if they get to a special council report. Yeah, sure.</v>

208
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.270
<v 1>The Mueller thing is so strange because technically can he fire Mueller?</v>

209
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.050
<v 0>Well that's there was a big article about whether or not.</v>

210
00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:29.700
So the white house said that they believe that he does have

211
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.720
the power to do that. And you don't know if that's, I mean,

212
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.170
you would think that that means that they're sent,

213
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.260
he just wants to put that signal out that like, I can't do this,

214
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.390
but there was other legal minds that said that he couldn't do it.

215
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:50.280
That he would have to get a raw because sessions has recused himself

216
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:54.940
from this, uh, the, the deputy attorney general rod Rosenstein, is it?

217
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.530
And yeah, that he would have to get him to do it. And then they, they said that,

218
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.970
you know, that he would, would not do that unless, I mean,

219
00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.340
Rosenstein said he wouldn't do it unless, uh,

220
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.190
Mueller had done MIS misconduct. Right. So, and,

221
00:12:10.191 --> 00:12:12.790
and that if the president tried to get him to do that, he would resign.

222
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:15.430
In which case they would have to get another person,

223
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:18.550
either appointed to do it or whoever's below him to do it. So it's a,

224
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:21.370
it's a really, it's a good episode.

225
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.700
<v 1>It really is. Yeah.</v>

226
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.620
I can't remember a time where I felt like there was nobody at the wheel more

227
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:30.790
than I do now. Yeah.

228
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.100
<v 0>It does feel like chaos.</v>

229
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.200
<v 1>Like it's, there's all people that are in positions. You know,</v>

230
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.590
there's the secretary of state, there's the chief of staff. There's all these,

231
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.380
there's all these different people that are in positions,

232
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.480
but it feels like a little.

233
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.540
<v 0>Make-believe and you know what happens because this happens everywhere.</v>

234
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.590
We get lost in our experience of it because we live here.

235
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.960
I'm really fascinated by how it looks outside of here.

236
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.880
Oh yeah. Am I, it must really seem like an even crazier show. Oh, it's God.

237
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.953
<v 1>Too.</v>

238
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.710
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
