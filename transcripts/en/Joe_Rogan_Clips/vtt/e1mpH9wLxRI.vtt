WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 2>Yeah. The reason why I brought that up is cuz Camaro's definitely talking about,</v>

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.480
he just wants a big money fights now. Yeah.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.200
<v 0>So I get that. Well, he's probably like a year away from a knee replacement.</v>

5
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.960
Yeah. I mean, if you watched him walking down the stairs like that,

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.270
I know Michael Bisping had both his knees replaced once he retired.

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.830
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, same and his, I, well, his eyes not replaced,</v>

8
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:27.580
but it's fake.

9
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.270
<v 0>Yeah. He has a, well, he has like a contact that he puts in that makes it look.</v>

10
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.190
<v 1>Yeah, looks good. Yeah. But I've seen him pop him, pop it out. I have too. It's.</v>

11
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.630
<v 0>Carly.</v>

12
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.150
<v 1>Smartly. I mean, yeah. So I mean,</v>

13
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.740
my point was if cam starts,

14
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.060
I was wondering if he's thinking about like the money. So you, you,

15
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.460
you know that what's a saying is the Wolf climbing,

16
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.340
the hill is always hungry in the Wolf on top of the hill. Mm.

17
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:55.740
Something like that. So, I mean, you know, Colby's still trying to get up there.

18
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.740
Camaro's been up there. Do you lose that hunger a little bit?

19
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.370
<v 0>I don't think so. I don't think so. Not with that guy. Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.930
I think at the championship level,

21
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.370
like the true champions and I think tomorrow is like a champion of champions.

22
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.890
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I think, I think he's in this all time. Great category.

23
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.130
Like, like let's imagine this fight is not taking place right now and you're not

24
00:01:18.131 --> 00:01:19.090
comparing him with Colby.

25
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.840
You just look at what he's done so far and his skill level.

26
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.120
I think you got a real argument that he is right now,

27
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:27.800
the best pound for pound fighter in the sport.

28
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.080
If you look at what his accomplishments are,

29
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.040
one loss ever in his entire mixed martial arts career has run through everyone

30
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.293
in his division.

31
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.680
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; including winning the title over a dominant Tyron Woodley,

32
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.480
five round route just destroyed him. His B,

33
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.550
he beat him pillar to post every round mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

34
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.710
And then you look at his fights with, um,

35
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.550
masal you look at his fights with Colby.

36
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.390
You look at his fight with Gilbert burns. Gilbert burns is a dangerous man.

37
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.070
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he put him away and Gilbert heard him.

38
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.470
He heard him in the first round Camaro recovered and smashed him,

39
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.660
knocked out masal with one punch. And then in the second fight, mm-hmm,

40
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.100
&lt;affirmative&gt;, he's a real argument that he's the best guy in the sport. Yeah.

41
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.500
But if you wanted to see him challenged,

42
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.020
you would want a guy who's got killer wrestling. That's Colby, amazing gas tank.

43
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:19.580
That's Colby unstoppable mentality. That's Colby,

44
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.580
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and a guy who's been in there with him and knows what

45
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:25.130
adjustments to make. Right. You know, I think,

46
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.650
you know, when masal took that first fight,

47
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.890
he took the first fight on short notice. Yeah.

48
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.770
Six days he had some good moments in the fight mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but

49
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:39.010
ultimately he fell prey to Oman's conditioning and, and,

50
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.970
and Usman had said the reason why he was willing to fight me then was cuz he had

51
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.520
a built an excuse. Yeah. I saw that. Which is interesting.

52
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.560
Cause that would've with a man's head. Yeah.

53
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.240
You call him a journeyman and you know, that with a guy's head.

54
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.320
Like the difference in the accomplishments of the two are very different.

55
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.160
Like masal obviously has that giant Ben ASIN knockout,

56
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.120
and you beat up Nate Diaz in that fight and S a bad and

57
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.280
a very clever fighter.

58
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.000
He's one of my favorite guys to watch fight mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; cause he's so

59
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.920
intelligent, but Usman just demolished him in that second fight. Yeah.

60
00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:11.760
Demolished him. Yeah.

61
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.120
That's what separates like very good fighters from all time greats.

62
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.350
<v 1>And he had a full camp that time MOS all did.</v>

63
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.070
<v 0>Didn't help. No, he actually helped him less. Like he was better,</v>

64
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.990
but I think Oman's better than he was before. I think he's,

65
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.030
he continues to get better. And he's training with Trevor Whitman. Like he,

66
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.830
he moved camps, you know,

67
00:03:33.831 --> 00:03:38.270
he used to be down in south Florida and then he made his way. Yeah,

68
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.180
he was, it was originally the black zillions and it was Stanford's.

69
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.060
But he's now with Trevor Whitman, who's a, like a real striking genius.

70
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.060
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know, Trevor Whitman is a brilliant guy. Yeah.

71
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.020
<v 1>I always, I I've always loved what he's done. I mean,</v>

72
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.380
cuz with Gache and with rose it's like, man.

73
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.140
<v 0>He's got three fighters in the main card. That's that's pretty crazy.</v>

74
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.290
That shows you how good Trevor Hitman is. Yeah.

75
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:04.970
He also makes the best gloves in the business. Yeah. His gloves are fantastic.

76
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.010
Yeah. You've.

77
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.690
<v 1>Been lobbying for those. Oh my God. They're.</v>

78
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.850
<v 0>Well, not just his glove, his boxing gloves. I, I use his gloves to hit the bag.</v>

79
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.130
He makes the best shin pads. He makes the best equipment.

80
00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:20.880
Like it's crazy that you gotta coach who is also designing

81
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:24.840
equipment. And he was explaining to me that the foam that they use,

82
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.840
the foam that most people use is not the best foam.

83
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.280
It's like the best cost effective foam.

84
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.400
So he uses like the best top of the food chain space,

85
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.800
age technology foam. And like,

86
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:41.270
you really feel the difference when you like hit things with his gloves.

87
00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:43.310
Like it's better protection for your hands.

88
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.790
<v 1>No. Yeah. I know. I've I've seen, I've watched some stuff on him and uh,</v>

89
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.030
I'm a fan. He's a.

90
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.270
<v 0>Wizard. I'm a fan. He's a fun guy too. And they have a good,</v>

91
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.190
he has a good relationship, a good rapport with his, uh, his students, you know,

92
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:01.700
which is so important. Cuz he's a, he's a good guy to get with, you know,

93
00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:04.500
he's a fun guy. And so like watching him,

94
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.380
coach these people and seeing like three top flight fighters on the's incredible

95
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.450
card.

96
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.620
<v 1>It's incredible. I'm I'm pretty intrigued too.</v>

97
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.540
With the coaching changes for Usman and Colby. They both changed camps.

98
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.040
Yeah.

99
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.460
<v 0>So what happened with Kobe? You're friends with Kobe mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he?</v>

100
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.210
What was, uh, what led him to switch camps? Cause he was with ATT forever.

101
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.610
It.

102
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.170
<v 1>Seemed like, I mean, I don't know.</v>

103
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.170
It seemed like there was a bunch of drama down there, you know,

104
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.610
cuz I think ER's down there and, and uh, I don't know.

105
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:37.810
It seemed like he's he said that or for what I'm seeing on interviews, um,

106
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.850
you know, there's drama going into train and,

107
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.320
and he just wanted to get away from that. Didn't wanna deal with it. Yeah.

108
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.720
And it it's a, that's a big organization down there basically.

109
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.560
It's a lot of fighters. And so then he switched to this,

110
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.080
I think it's MMA masters and mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know, small gym.

111
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.680
They give him the full attention. So yeah.

112
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.160
<v 0>I don't know. Well he brings the drama. He shouldn't be shocked. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean,</v>

113
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:05.600
who the causes more drama than Colby? I know. Yeah. Still though. Good stuff.

114
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.720
That's how he's so popular. It's it's both things, right? Yeah. Which is rare.

115
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.360
Like he has incredible skill level.

116
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.320
He's as tough as they come and he talks a lot of. Yeah.

117
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.790
<v 1>Yeah. That's.</v>

118
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.990
<v 0>Good. And most people don't know that he got forced into talking.</v>

119
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.270
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like the UFC was about to cut him.

120
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:25.390
They didn't like his style. They told him. Yeah.

121
00:06:25.391 --> 00:06:29.470
And so then he fought Damia may in Brazil and then called him a bunch of filthy

122
00:06:29.471 --> 00:06:33.110
animals and you know, and said a bunch of crazy. Places is a dump. Yeah.

123
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.190
They went crazy.

124
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.990
<v 1>They took exception to that. He.</v>

125
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.300
<v 0>Went pro wrestling heal. Yeah. And it changed his, it worked,</v>

126
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.300
it changed trajectory of his career. What people don't know about Colby,

127
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.660
what you know about Colby's when you're with him in person. Super nice.

128
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.380
<v 1>Guy. Oh, he's actually soft spoken. He's a great guy.</v>

129
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.540
He's he's had dinner at the house. We had elk and uh, just polite,

130
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.820
soft spoken. Yeah.

131
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.130
My wife and daughter everybody's there just being as nice as can be.

132
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.170
He's a gentleman. That's.

133
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.370
<v 0>That's who he is. That's the real guy. Yeah, for sure.</v>

134
00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:07.290
This other thing is like a character that he does, which is so fascinating.

135
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.130
<v 1>It works. I mean I watched to interview him in DC.</v>

136
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.930
Just did just a couple days ago. And uh, and I mean,

137
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.280
DC gave him every opportunity. He's like, do you ever get tired?

138
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.960
Do you ever sit at home and say, I, you know, could,

139
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.640
could give it a rest and just be, and he's just like, no, &lt;laugh&gt;, he's like,

140
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.200
I'm always, he's something like he's always on. Then he is like, you know,

141
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.960
DC said, do you respect Zeman? You know, I'm like as a fighter, he's like,

142
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:40.270
no &lt;laugh&gt; so he wouldn't even, I mean,

143
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.030
he's sticking to the script.

144
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.430
<v 0>Yeah. Well he's got that pro wrestling heel character down.</v>

145
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.390
And if he ever decides to leave the UFC and go to pro wrestling,

146
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:53.150
he would have a giant career in pro wrestling. Yeah. If he wanted to probably,

147
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.430
oh my God. If he, if he decided, if he fi you know, let's say,

148
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.180
you know, whatever, been with his career, but like five years from now,

149
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.860
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; if he decides to go to pro wrestling, my God.

150
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.220
Well that guy, I have a career over there. Yeah. He's talked so much. Oh, I.

151
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.580
<v 1>Know. It's good. I can't wait.</v>
