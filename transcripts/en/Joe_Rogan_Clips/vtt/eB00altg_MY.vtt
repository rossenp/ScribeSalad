00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.310
<v 1>Steep a D C. That's a great fight too. That's a super fight. Yeah. That's a,</v>

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
super fight. We talked about all these super fights. That's a legit super fight.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.973
Yeah.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.980
<v 2>That is a super fight. Right? It's such a close.</v>

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.903
<v 1>Fight.</v>

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.680
Undefeated at heavyweight was a former world champion from strike force.

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.950
<v 2>It's also, when you see DC Resser Volkov and you go, oh,</v>

9
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:28.290
there are levels to this kid.

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.440
<v 1>You got time, you got time. You got time.</v>

11
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:38.610
Now you got time to work on your wrestling. I'm just kidding. I love Ivanka.

12
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.650
But the thing is funny though. It's funny, but he actually looked really good.

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.060
Like really good. I've been in that clench with DC and that is no picnic.

14
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.630
He threw me around like a ragdoll.

15
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.000
<v 2>He did real good until he didn't do good anymore.</v>

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.000
Then DC did exactly what he said. He was gonna do it by the end of the round.

17
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.100
He had his neck and he just was saved by the bell.

18
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:58.230
And then when we went to the second round, you know,

19
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:01.650
you could tell what was coming off. His D C, D C is amazing. He's amazing.

20
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.200
That just shows you how great Jon Jones is.

21
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.860
That's that's the whole top of the pyramid. If you're talking Jones,

22
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.550
the top of the spear and you go, what? Jesus.

23
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.640
<v 1>What is this guy? And John and John train for one week. He was high off his.</v>

24
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.770
Yeah, listen, how good he.

25
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.690
<v 2>Is. He's a wizard. He's on another.</v>

26
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.530
<v 1>Level. Best of all, time, PDs things phenomenal. However, with these,</v>

27
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.390
if you're John, you're sitting at home right now in your underwear,

28
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.940
think about the bad decisions you've made in your hope, your hope,

29
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.280
hopefully that you're going to get back in the UFC.

30
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.410
DC's taking your career path because John always wanted to go to heavyweight,

31
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.860
wanting to fight Steve. They want to do all the. DC goes, oh, cool,

32
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:40.520
hold my beer. And then just does his thing. You know.

33
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.800
<v 2>Can you imagine how big DC will be Dick pills? John,</v>

34
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.540
John comes back a DCP to Tim. Do you know, big QP?

35
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.420
Do you know crazy? That would be, that'd.

36
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.190
<v 1>Be crazy about the fight.</v>

37
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.023
<v 2>At heavyweight.</v>

38
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.430
<v 1>Well, they're going to fight at heavyweight. You think so? Yeah. Decent.</v>

39
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.980
<v 2>Cow. There's a 95% chance that John Jones fights in the UFC in 2018.</v>

40
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.600
So you're saying it a chance.

41
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.760
<v 1>There's a chance. That's his agent though. You know what I'm saying? Jim Carey.</v>

42
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.110
So you're telling me there's a chance. You can't really listen to agents.

43
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:16.620
You know what I'm saying? Yeah. That guy, first of all, don't be the next rock.

44
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:18.960
He's full of. You know, if you talk to him on the greatest thing,

45
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.980
walking this earth.

46
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.400
<v 2>It is entirely possible that he accidentally took.</v>

47
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.740
And people were saying that I'm being paid to say this,

48
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:27.150
and I'm gonna tell you right now, UFC,

49
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.900
UFC's never paid me to say anything other than the truth.

50
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.310
The reality about it is they don't know what he took.

51
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.430
They don't know what happened. They don't know why, how he got it.

52
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.180
And the theory that I talked about is just a rumor that was going around,

53
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.200
that someone was trying to explain one way it could have happened.

54
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:47.700
And it's through tainted creatine.

55
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.990
<v 1>That was backed up by Novitzky the golden snitch. Who's his actual employee.</v>

56
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.180
Do the see, but also when you say you're not paid,

57
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.290
why do UFC does not pay to say anything on this podcast? No,

58
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.100
you're a commentator. Yeah. They're not.

59
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.150
<v 2>But here's the thing to their credit. They've never tried. They've never, ever,</v>

60
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.230
ever tried. Well, they know better,

61
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.020
but if they ever talked to me about something, it's something we all agree with.

62
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.170
Like, you know, like maybe Dana and I have conversations about like,

63
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:13.750
this is a big fight. Um, are you pumped for this? I'm like, dude,

64
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:18.250
I can't even wait. Are you kidding me? Kept putting, like, he might have,

65
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.380
dude, I've talked to him about it in the past.

66
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.670
Once you start insulting him and with him and he's like, I'm busy,

67
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.160
he's forgiving. No, you got to talk to him. He.

68
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.480
<v 1>Paid me.</v>

69
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.990
<v 2>More. No, he does. I hope he doesn't. He probably think if we can do,</v>

70
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.260
if Ben and him sat down and I could be there, maybe I could help.

71
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.820
That'd be the middleman I would do that.

72
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.100
I would a hundred percent be willing to do that when I was.

73
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.000
<v 1>Going through the Reebok there.</v>

74
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.950
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. I think Ben is, uh, under</v>

75
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.000
underutilized and not understood and under appreciated.

76
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.540
<v 1>That's what I think it's a real shame too. Cause th th the father's time,</v>

77
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.250
you know, you can't wait that long.

78
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.560
<v 2>Did you see what he did to Korskoff you see what he did to Lima?</v>

79
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.060
These are top flight, super powerful guys. He ragdolled them.

80
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.870
<v 1>And cubby once gives us 5 55 and go to 70 what's up.</v>

81
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.550
<v 2>And, you know, he had that interesting conversation, uh, about when he fought,</v>

82
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.050
um, Jay Huron, which is his toughest fight in Beltour split decision.

83
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.690
But he said he wasn't wrestling. He said, he up. He said,

84
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:20.710
he's just trying to work on striking. And his wrestling was off. And I was like,

85
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:25.000
that's incredible that someone is good as him still needs to be constantly doing

86
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:26.170
it to stay sharp. I forgot what.

87
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.130
<v 1>Got you to.</v>

88
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.770
<v 2>The dance. I'm like, that's amazing. And so ever since then,</v>

89
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:32.470
he's concentrated on his wrestling and she's taking everybody down.

90
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:35.580
Like when he concentrates on his wrestling and he's constantly doing it.

91
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.400
<v 1>That's the way to do it. And even, even a Curtis blade, I text you. I'm like,</v>

92
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:42.130
dude, this Australia card is ridiculous. Yeah. It was eight on it.

93
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.420
Get it over with, but the card was amazing, but Curtis blade goes, listen, man,

94
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:49.330
you guys want to Boomi hate tell you I don't enjoy getting punched in the face.

95
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.510
I'm not trying to get punched in the face. Now I'm just trying to get by anyone.

96
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.003
I'm just trying to get paid.

97
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.990
<v 2>How good is Curtis blades chance? The beard dude, he took some shots,</v>

98
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.880
Mark Hunt, put it on.

99
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.370
<v 1>Him and lasted him. He was almost out of it.</v>

100
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.580
<v 2>And he gets the double like. Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do.</v>

101
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:08.320
This is fighting. That's exactly what yeah.

102
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.530
<v 1>We're supposed to do. And I'm biased as as Curtis from my, from my old camp.</v>

103
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:14.260
And I see those guys, I talked to him and tell him how much of a monster is.

104
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.630
And I love mark. I didn't want anyone to lose that fight.

105
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.350
When I see Mark Hunt taken down, it's Mark Hunt to me is like the white rhino,

106
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:22.690
the last white line. Now, you know what I'm saying?

107
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:25.540
He's the last remaining white rhino. We got to protect this guy.

108
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.770
Don't give him the, just wrestler. He's a legend.

109
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.520
Don't give him that guy. Give him Francis. Let's see how that plays out.

110
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.330
Give him Jay, you know, not JDS, but you know what I'm saying? Yeah.

111
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.890
How dare you give him a Juco national champion and send it to Australia. Huh?

112
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.430
<v 2>Jerry. He almost won by knockout though. In Mark's hard to take down.</v>

113
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.520
I think it was a good test. I think it was an important test. Look,

114
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:51.400
they tried to do the same thing with Derrick Lewis. They gave Derrick Lewis,

115
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:54.700
a tested Mark Hunt, Mark Hunt, shut him down and stopped him. Derrick Lewis,

116
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:57.920
one of the best heavyweights in the division. Bet. One of the best heavyweights.

117
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.570
<v 1>Not one of the best wrestlers. Right?</v>

118
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.340
<v 2>But he still is one of the best guys. One of the he's a knockout artist and a,</v>

119
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.300
a promising up and coming guy. They given the mark on. He cannot get past mark

120
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.160
[inaudible]. But if it happened in Australia with all his fans, they're

121
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.160
 from New Zealand, dude, that's a big fight for him. It's a smart fight. I fight 

122
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.160
for who? For both guys, Mark Hunt one

123
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.160
. If he connected with a couple shots, more or of

124
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.160
 Curtis, was it wasn't as tough and as good as he is. He could have

125
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.993
 knocked at anybody at that night for.

126
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.350
<v 1>Curtis. It's a smart fight, right? For Marcus smart.</v>

127
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.363
<v 2>Fight. Really?</v>

128
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.510
<v 1>He's already a legend.</v>

129
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.400
<v 2>Like buddies, but if he wins the way almost won by nine in Australia, it,</v>

130
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.250
it jumps you up even further. Not really he's right. Fifth.

131
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.881
You know what I'm saying?

132
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:48.290
But the excitement of the Perth crowd you're as good as your last fight.

133
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.560
If he had two Kaos in a row like that, to be.

134
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.520
<v 1>The degree to.</v>

135
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.220
<v 2>Me stylistically, I understand what you're saying,</v>

136
00:06:55.221 --> 00:07:00.170
but he's 40 and he's legitimately one or two big wins away from another title

137
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:03.590
shot. Think about what you have, right? You have DC versus steep.

138
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:07.370
A whoever fights that who they're going to fight next, Mark Hunt knocks out,

139
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.080
hold on a second. He knocks out him and then he knocks out someone next.

140
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.230
Like who could it be? Okay, well you could try Overeem again.

141
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:18.590
But the problem with Omer him fighting for the title again is he just lost his

142
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.280
deep bay by knockout. And then he just lost a Francis by down there as.

143
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.113
<v 1>Well. Yeah.</v>

144
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.270
<v 2>You've got some real interesting fights,</v>

145
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:29.780
but all it would take was Mark Hunt to beat one of those top guys.

146
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.670
And he's in consideration. Again, there's a small pool. They're super so small.

147
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:38.120
That's why Overeem keeps getting shuffled back to top as tough as he is.

148
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:40.730
And it's not taking anything away from him. There's not a lot of,

149
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.210
there's not a lot of lies being fed into the top tiers of the group. There's no.

150
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.103
<v 1>New blood really.</v>

151
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.500
<v 2>Well. It's hard. It's a hard division to find talented guys.</v>

152
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.810
I think have the most difficult division or heavy.

153
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.000
<v 1>I think heavyweights better off than light heavyweight.</v>

154
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.770
Look at light heavyweights like Jesus Christ.

155
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.940
<v 2>That's a shark tank. Light heavyweights got a lot of crazy going on right now.</v>

156
00:07:58.941 --> 00:08:02.480
Right? Like what happens if DC loses our leaves rather do seem to get a.

157
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.673
<v 1>Wind Belton.</v>

158
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.513
<v 2>Bounce.</v>

159
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.600
So if he goes to heavyweight and stays in heavy winds bounces and think of that,

160
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:12.980
man, this is crazy, right? Imagine Kane going to tool five.

161
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.950
<v 1>That's not happening. Maybe he's too old. He's going to find a heavyweight.</v>

162
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.450
<v 2>Boy for them. Tacos. Come on, Kane. I've seen that. I see that show.</v>

163
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:22.610
That dude eats. He gets down with that Mexican dinner.

164
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.510
<v 1>I don't blame a man. He's earned it. However, Cain or fight or what?</v>

165
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:27.830
He's not going to fight for the title right away.

166
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:30.470
He's going to fight once this year and then hopefully a title fight.

167
00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:35.450
But then I think what they're planning on is DC beats, Steve bay,

168
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.890
vacates the belt and then in or fight for the interim belt towards the end of

169
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:41.570
the year or be in the early next year.

170
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.570
<v 2>Steep aide is not wanting to hear that kind of talk.</v>

171
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.500
People just loves to overlook. [inaudible] it's funny.

172
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.330
<v 1>The heavyweight division though. It's land of the dinosaurs and then like.</v>

173
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.660
<v 2>Heavyweight. Well,</v>

174
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:57.780
Francis is terrifying for everyone on the planet other than steep Emile chick.

175
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.590
No.

176
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.030
<v 1>No, no. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.</v>

177
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.820
So Francis woods would lose I'm back off the train.

178
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:06.750
So Francis you're off the and laugh that train. I didn't know.

179
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:09.840
He can't wrestle at all. I think he was, he was like,

180
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:13.140
how do you spell wrestling? Listen. So Curtis blades smokes them.

181
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.550
Cain Velasquez smokes them.

182
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.460
<v 2>Smokes. Who? Francis? Yes. All day. Really?</v>

183
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:19.800
So you think Curtis blades when they fought the first time,

184
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:20.634
just wasn't ready for them.

185
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.210
<v 1>But remember they got stopped via doctor. Stop it right in the second round.</v>

186
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.940
I think he goes, hold up, you have zero rustling.

187
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.750
You just hit myths and lift weights and talk to the employees at the USC

188
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:33.630
Institute. Yeah. I'm going to wrestle your.

189
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.890
<v 2>I want to point out that I do not agree with that assessment.</v>

190
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.980
I'm sure he trained his wrestling. I'm sure he was in the best shape.

191
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:41.880
He could be snow.

192
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.833
<v 1>He told me nothing.</v>

193
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.450
<v 2>I think he burned down the first round. I mean, I've watched it.</v>

194
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.560
He's definitely need some water.

195
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.400
<v 1>There's no technique is wrestling there from the very get go. If his,</v>

196
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.890
his sheer strength got him through some of those take downs,

197
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:56.370
but you look at his hand placements, hips. It's not there. Now. It can come.

198
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.610
It's it's a tough business to be in and try and pick that those skills up.

199
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.450
And you look at the list. You know, Derek Lewis, he can, he can double it.

200
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:06.930
Your are handoffs. A good matchup. Curtis blades nightmare came last year.

201
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.010
Nightmare for Bree silver doom, nightmare, Al Stover, him can wrestle.

202
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:14.220
If he wants to Steve bay, obviously nightmare. We saw what he did to him.

203
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.470
<v 2>The thing is he's so powerful that every</v>

204
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:23.730
one of them could get 90 knighted with one shot, a sports evolve. My.

205
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.980
<v 1>Sport is Debby world champion to be world.</v>

206
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:26.370
<v 2>Champion.</v>

207
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.940
But you're looking at it through the eyes of someone who fought steep Emile

208
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.420
chick, right? He fought steep, Emile chick steep, a figured him out,

209
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.020
Steve bay beat him. Right? But Steve bay is a very,

210
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:39.030
very unusual character.

211
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.960
And there's some shots that he got hit with hit with in that fight that a lot of

212
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:45.060
dudes would not have been able to take. I agree with that.

213
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.940
<v 1>However, if for RESO gets you on the ground and I promise you,</v>

214
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:51.090
if you get him down that often he would have choked Francis unconscious.

215
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.790
<v 2>That's a different animal on the ground. So his cane.</v>

216
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.900
<v 1>Though, [inaudible] On the ground. He, you know,</v>

217
00:10:57.901 --> 00:10:59.580
he's not a big finisher he's going to do,

218
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.100
he's going to you up and he's gonna wear you out, but he's not a huge finish.

219
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:05.970
You don't look for submissions France or I'm sorry for doom will get ahold of

220
00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:08.460
your neck permission. And then think about Kane,

221
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:10.000
his ground pounds for Roche Roche.

222
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.120
<v 2>Yeah, super accurate. And the, the re the, the reps he puts in, bang, bang,</v>

223
00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:16.770
bang, bang. You know, he breaks you.

224
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.710
<v 1>Yeah. We're, [inaudible] very controlled. He's going to take you down.</v>

225
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:20.544
He didn't give a.

226
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.380
<v 2>Yeah. Kane has a crazy output. Like his outputs disturbing nuts. You know,</v>

227
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.660
you w you watch the, the,

228
00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:30.660
the sheer volume and the pace of the takedowns and chaining takedowns together

229
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:34.920
and beating you up on the way down. You're like, wow. Um, uh,

230
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.840
Javier Mendez said this once we were,

231
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.820
were in the back and it was him and crazy Bob cook. And I was like, dude, I go,

232
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.500
I think he was just, he was, I forget who it was that he fought. Uh, but I said,

233
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.550
I think he was just expecting to ride the storm out, you know, like,

234
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.310
cause he just couldn't keep up with Kane. And uh, Javier goes,

235
00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.080
this storm doesn't ever go away. However, he goes, that storm is there forever.

236
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:00.970
Like you don't understand, there's no ride in this stuff.

237
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.270
<v 1>You better just tear down and try to match it. And he's like.</v>

238
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.150
<v 2>I mean, they even talk openly about it. Like he's a freak,</v>

239
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:12.040
like he'll take three weeks off, come back. He just runs through buddy nuts.

240
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.840
There's something going on. There's something going.

241
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.750
<v 1>On unless you fly to Mexico. Yeah. There's something going on. Wow. That was a.</v>

242
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.440
<v 2>Mess, man. Nobody could do that. Nobody even cardio Kane,</v>

243
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:23.290
can't go to 7,000 feet without being there for awhile. It's just.

244
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.340
<v 1>It's just not thinking about that. Relentless.</v>

245
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.100
I don't mean to interrupt you so about the real relentless approach in DCS

246
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:34.240
fights. Very similar against Steve bay. And that to me,

247
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:37.720
that's where I look. I see when it first came out. Oh my God.

248
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:40.540
It's a super fight. Let me think about this. One more of my initial thoughts.

249
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:42.730
I always go, what's my initial thoughts. What most people are going to think?

250
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.910
Well, Steve bay has knockout power. His wrestling's good.

251
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:50.050
He puts everything together well, but the cardio of DCS, give me an issue.

252
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:53.160
If DC can get past that third round, that's a big, you know.

253
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.370
<v 2>Because that's tremendous cardio,</v>

254
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:57.700
but so does Steve bay and here's the other thing, does he think about steep?

255
00:12:57.701 --> 00:13:00.700
A what we was able to do with Francis? Right?

256
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:04.780
He caught Francis who is the most dangerous kind of division standing up and the

257
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:07.600
most dangerous guy in terms of making mistakes, hands down.

258
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.830
He caught him with some strong shots, tagged him several times.

259
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.540
And now think of the difference than size, which is steep bay in DC.

260
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.810
You got a guy who he's, he's finding out it doesn't hit as hard.

261
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.820
DC's definitely formidable on the feet. And he showed that in the,

262
00:13:22.821 --> 00:13:26.500
the Volkan fight. He cracked Vulcan he's his standup is very good,

263
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.430
but he's not absolutely terrifying with his punches technician. Right? Well,

264
00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:32.560
he is a technician. I think he gets away with it.

265
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.310
<v 1>[Inaudible] leave his hips and a pull back heavy.</v>

266
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.740
We're going to be a little trouble now saying that he is on the field as the

267
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:39.574
heavyweight side.

268
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.400
<v 2>Well, I was, I was very impressed with his hands in the Volkan fight.</v>

269
00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:46.300
He was the one that was landing shots. So he played that game. Yeah. Right.

270
00:13:46.301 --> 00:13:50.010
Invokana is dangerous. His standup is very, very dangerous.

271
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.890
So I was I'm impressed with him. I think he is a technician,

272
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.210
but he's like five 11 steep,

273
00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:01.060
a six for Steve Bay's long.

274
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.940
And he's very good at knocking out heavyweights.

275
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.460
I'm thinking the way Steve bay knocked out for doom,

276
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.510
the way Steve bay was able to crack Francis Overeem dude,

277
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:15.100
he's a beast when he does Santos, what he did to him, what he did to Mark Hunt.

278
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.160
Yes. Our Lawsky what he did to our Lawsky to it. He's a beast.

279
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:18.850
The guys heavyweight.

280
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.780
<v 1>Of all time in the UFC.</v>
