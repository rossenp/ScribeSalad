00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>Here it is. ADA Lovelace has been called the world's first computer programmer.</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.610
What she did was write the world's first machine algorithm for an early

3
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.820
computing machine. That existed only on paper. Of course,

4
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:16.020
someone had to be the first, but Lovelace was a woman and this was in the 1840s.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.360
Suck it, suck it.

6
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.440
Stupid people suck it. ADA,

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.420
ADA was rock and in the 18 hundreds. She's figuring it out. Imagine you've,

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.910
you'd be like, look, one day, they're gonna be able to do this right now.

9
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:31.740
They don't want to do it. But if one day,

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.840
if they just figure out how to do this, this, this, this, and that.

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.840
And we're gonna have computers and the computers will operate on this algorithm.

12
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.080
And people are looking at you like pitch, what the are you talking about?

13
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.550
Computers like imagined how, what a hell? It would be to be a super,

14
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:47.910
super genius living amongst the cave. People you like, you.

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.300
We could be flying around. If you knew how to melt the aluminum,

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.980
can you guys get me some glass?

17
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.180
You don't know glass Shatz do you have any wires? You have no wire. Okay.

18
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.860
Where do you get your metal? You don't have metal. What

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.390
you imagine? If you like, we're looking at metal in the ground, like,

20
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:08.430
why don't they just pull the metal out and make things out of that?

21
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.340
And they're all like, and you're like, what's the point?

22
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.470
What's the point in making a house? What's the point?

23
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:17.340
What's the point in having glass windows that look out at these cave,

24
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:21.720
people each other and stabbing mastodons in the deck with Flint tips,

25
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.710
tools. Imagine what a hell that would be.

26
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:27.990
That would be like the worst thing you could do to somebody.

27
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.530
Like imagine if one day they come up with a time machine. And, uh,

28
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:34.380
one of the punishments for people that were real pieces of,

29
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.530
as you throw them in front of Gingiss,

30
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.180
con's hoard in like 1200 a D you would just like,

31
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:44.490
take your underwear. You're in your underwear.

32
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:46.680
Everybody knows it's going to happen. You have a chance to live.

33
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.420
If you just might get lucky,

34
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:53.160
Mike teleport into the right spot and not get slaughtered and eaten by the

35
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:54.960
Mongols as they come over the top of the hill.

36
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:57.390
But we're gonna put you right in front of them and you know,

37
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.740
good luck you piece of and transported with time machine.

38
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.450
I mean, if they do come up with, uh, the ability to do that to people one day,

39
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.820
like an actual time machine,

40
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.930
that would be the biggest hell ever take a person from 2018.

41
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.570
Who's used to driving around in his Tesla,

42
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.810
checking his texts every five minutes. And no, you we're going to let you live.

43
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.520
We're going to let you live, but you're going to live in 1200. A D no doctors,

44
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:27.240
no doctors. What the is a doctor? What are you talking about, man?

45
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.420
You gotta run. You gotta run. They're coming over the hill. You know,

46
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:33.390
you smell that. Yeah. That's people burning. You smell people burning,

47
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.190
like candles run, just run. But you're alive.

48
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.770
That was the punishment. Yeah. That'd be fun. Now that would be crazy.

49
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.860
Imagine if somebody raped you and you get to decide what year they come back,

50
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.290
where they have to go, just send this back to the dinosaur era. Good luck you.

51
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.090
And then they they're there.

52
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:59.740
They're going to be by themselves 65 million years ago.

53
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.950
How many people would say yes to that? Like how many people said yes, well,

54
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.240
we could do one thing. Bernie Madoff.

55
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.500
We could either put you in jail for the rest of your life, or you get freedom

56
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.530
in prehistoric central Asia. What would you do?

57
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.050
I'd take the death by prehistoric central Asia all day. You got to live day.

58
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.900
Throw me in Siberia there. I die there,

59
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.010
but at least I'm not in a cage until my heart stops beating a hundred percent.

60
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.250
I'd take that all day. I'll roll the dice. I'll roll the dice. It'll suck.

61
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:37.900
I'll die for sure. But I'll dive, running or trying to get away or,

62
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:42.070
you know, break a leg. You know, I'm not going to die in that box.

63
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.490
That's the craziest thing about you. Don't you,

64
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:50.260
you just decide when someone has crossed some line that you're going to take

65
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.850
you out of circulation. And we're just going to cool you in this little cage,

66
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.100
and we're going to hope you get better when we let you out in 15 years,

67
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.870
like what a stupid idea. It's not working. That's how you know,

68
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:05.440
it's a stupid idea. It's not, it's not working for anyone.

69
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.030
You want to protect people from violent offenders. That's primary,

70
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.420
right? Violent offenders.

71
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.220
People who want to Rob people or murder people or rape people or

72
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:21.630
assault people. That is the number one thing is we want everybody,

73
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.480
everybody to be safe. I love Jamie. I don't want Jamie to have to worry.

74
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:27.130
When he walks down the street, that this guy,

75
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.550
they locked up 10 times going to jump out of the bushes and take his knees out

76
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:33.760
with a baseball bat for no reason other than he's crazy. Right?

77
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:37.720
You don't want that. Nobody wants that. So we all agree.

78
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.750
You got to lock up rapists and murderers and all that. But after that,

79
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.040
after you get to, after you get past that, it's like, Hmm, what,

80
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.250
what good does it do to get that guy that cheated on his taxes?

81
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:49.990
Why do you put him in a cage for a year?

82
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.960
Why don't you let them work and pay you back? Like,

83
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:54.760
why is he in a cage for a year? That seems,

84
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.600
that seems like you're punishing them. Like you're, you're, you're,

85
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.070
you're just trying to torture them and steal a year of his life.

86
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.650
But he'll just owes you money. He doesn't know you a year of his life.

87
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:07.210
How much is a year of your life worth? It's worth billions of dollars a year.

88
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:11.950
Your life, you, man. You can't take a year of someone's life. That's crazy.

89
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.390
But if you owe taxes to go, I'd like a year of your life, sir.

90
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.900
Or if you're selling plants, selling plants or worse,

91
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.140
you're one of those people that didn't, uh, send the envelope.

92
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.170
And you're trying to bring some of that 4,000 pounds of cocaine over

93
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.420
what would be a good deterrent for some firm to stop. So I don't think there's,

94
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.600
I think education is the real determine. You have to catch them.

95
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:37.330
And there has to be punishment. I give you owe people money.

96
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:39.520
There should be reparations. You should like, if you,

97
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.030
if you were involved in some sort of a banking scheme and you rip people off,

98
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:45.310
you should have to pay those people back. Period. You should have,

99
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.880
you should be responsible for that after that. Um,

100
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.820
you're assuming that someone's capable of growing.

101
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.230
And sometimes we don't like to do that.

102
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:56.230
It's very convenient to assume that someone is in a static state and they're

103
00:05:56.231 --> 00:06:00.050
never going to grow, oh, this old banker. He's just a ritual.

104
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.260
And this is how he's going to die. him. There's there's that thing.

105
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:04.460
But he's a human being.

106
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.290
And even if he lived his life people over on those, uh, you know,

107
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.680
those weird mortgage situation loans that were going on,

108
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.120
what were those things called? Those, um, the adjustable arm. Yeah,

109
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:21.260
the adjustable mortgages that people got on because they signed up for them and

110
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:22.340
they were really low rate.

111
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:24.560
And then all sudden the rate jacked up through the roof and they were just

112
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:25.790
inevitably going to lose their house.

113
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.070
And this was like something that people knew about it before.

114
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:31.670
And even the people that organized that kind of, even knowing they can grow.

115
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.720
It's a horrible thing they did. But they used to say that they're done,

116
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.120
lock them up forever. My grandma lost her house.

117
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.770
It's terrible that your grandma lost her house and whoever the benefited from

118
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:45.560
your grandma, losing the house, they should all have to give that money back to,

119
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.463
we should figure out the.

120
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.820
How the did they allow these banks to weasel people like that?

121
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:52.730
You're not looking out for anybody's best interest when you do something like

122
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:55.520
that. And obviously they didn't know they were going to,

123
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.120
the rates are going to get as high as they got where people were. Oh,

124
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:00.620
they should have situations, but they should've,

125
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.240
they should've known something was coming.

126
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.630
You hit the point though that they should have been paid back. Yeah.

127
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:07.810
They should've been paid. None of those people got paid back.

128
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.940
Doesn't matter how long you lock them up for like, nobody got their house back.

129
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.890
Yeah. Everyone got over.

130
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.580
And even people that were involved in the organizations that were probably

131
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:19.970
responsible in part for the recession, which everything up. They,

132
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.280
all those people, all got bonuses when there was bailouts.

133
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.460
The whole thing is the bailout should've been for the everybody who lost their

134
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:29.030
home. For sure. For sure. It shouldn't the bailout.

135
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:30.980
Most certainly shouldn't have gone to.

136
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.740
I know that they have to pay these people, these bonuses,

137
00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:37.580
because these bonuses are in their contract, but that's still crazy.

138
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.550
It's still crazy. Even if it's in the contract, I mean,

139
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.640
the government's going to bail you guys out, you guys are a failed business.

140
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.290
It's banks have failed business,

141
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:49.580
and you're still going to try to claim that you guys did so well that you need a

142
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:51.080
bonus. Like this is great.

143
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.200
And you're going to take that taxpayer money and apply it to your bonus.

144
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.260
So all those poor people out there working $50,000 a year,

145
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.310
you're going to just take a giant what? What's a good one for one of those guys.

146
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.380
What's a good one. What's a good bonus.

147
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.040
What do you think is like the biggest bonus that one of those banker guys got

148
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.750
during the bailout? If you get 300 million. Oh, is it that high?

149
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.220
I don't think it's that high. I got it. 30 minutes. 30 minutes. At least.

150
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.820
That's what the JP Morgan guy got last year. 31 30 last year. Yeah.

151
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.160
But wait a minute. No, we're not in a recession though.

152
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:27.020
Like they were getting it at the end of uh,

153
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.040
bushes term, right? So that was 2009, eight.

154
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.070
He got 16 million, someone got 16 million guy

155
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.490
got 16 million during the bailouts. Well,

156
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.160
in his worst year he got 20 million baller.

157
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.880
We think his house looks like it's probably made out of cocaine.

158
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.900
It's probably like an igloo

159
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.950
walks by and licks the walls.

160
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.290
Here's the real question you give the average person, 25 billion bucks.

161
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.870
They don't have to work again ever. You know,

162
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.340
this guy's making 20 million bucks every year or more probably with all these

163
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.270
bonuses. Right? Like what, what, when do you get out?

164
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.240
Like how much do you have to have in the bank before you go, you know what?

165
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.930
I'm just going to live frugally and never work again.

166
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.870
<v 1>That guy does not need to live frugally. He doesn't even.</v>

167
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.970
<v 0>Any, but I mean, for most folks,</v>

168
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.330
like what's the number that you'd have to get to where you're like check please.

169
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:25.440
Yeah.

170
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.400
<v 1>I don't know what the D th whatever that driving forces though, to attain that,</v>

171
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.190
that doesn't just magically go away. You know,

172
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:34.710
it's not like you get to that point. And you're like, alright, now I can retire.

173
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:39.090
Like, what are you doing? Retirement. Look at the people who continue to work.

174
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.990
You have a thousand things you love to do. Right. And you're good at them.

175
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.170
And you're obsessed with them. Other people don't have that.

176
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.980
All they know is their job. All they know is to work. And they don't.

177
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.070
They have a hard time integrating when they come out of that. You know,

178
00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:56.070
you have to have something that gives your life, meaning and purpose.

179
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.730
<v 0>Yeah, that's true. Um, it's hard for people to take up new hobbies too,</v>

180
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.200
but really fun. That's the thing about learning stuff, getting good at stuff.

181
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.690
When you suck, there's a little, you know,

182
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.850
there's a period at the beginning of it's frustrating, but once you,

183
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:12.240
if you do do like anything, no matter what it is, especially physical stuff,

184
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.570
something about getting good at things. It's very rewarding. You know,

185
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.410
not enough people go through that, not enough people, I think try new out.

186
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.530
And I think there's also new pathways that get opened in your brain.

187
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:24.870
The more you try something new that you suck at,

188
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.370
and when you start off from that beginner phase and try to like put it together.

189
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.510
And I think the little journey of the beginner phase getting better,

190
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.500
I think we should try something new once a year. I really do. I mean,

191
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:38.820
maybe more, but for me,

192
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.180
it can't be more than once a year because I get too crazy about stuff for me.

193
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:42.991
Once a year. It's like,

194
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:45.720
I might be able to squeeze something in once a year and try it out for a little

195
00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:50.100
while and not let it overcome all the things I'm already crazy about. You know,

196
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.510
how often do you go hunting? Well, uh,

197
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.050
it's usually in the fall for elk,

198
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.980
and then usually we do something in the

199
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:07.410
early spring. Uh, we go to Lanai and we, uh,

200
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.280
hunt for access.
