00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.680
<v 2>I wanna talk to you about this, this, when you're talking about authenticity,</v>

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.920
I wanna talk to you about, have you ever seen the movie IOUs?

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.640
<v 1>I have dabbled I'm honestly,</v>

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.800
I don't wanna watch it entirely because I would be so angry afterwards.

6
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.790
It's crazy because I've lost to Russians and some of the biggest

7
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:23.790
matches of my career.

8
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.230
And I know if I saw that I would be so off because

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.430
they have changed my life in terms of being Olympic champion,

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.270
being a multiple winning more world titles, more golds,

11
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.180
they've taken money out my pocket, notoriety and fame away from me.

12
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.660
And it has, it'll really upset me. So that's why I've decided not to. It's a.

13
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.020
<v 0>Good thing to watch, just to understand the sophistication, just to be upset.</v>

14
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.700
Let, let me explain to people that don't know what we're talking about it. Uh,

15
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.220
Iris is a documentary by Brian Fogal and Brian was, uh, a cyclist.

16
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.930
And what he did was he decided to race and it was for, for the documentary.

17
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.930
He did a race, completely natural recorded his results.

18
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.090
And then he hired this Russian gentleman who was a part of the Russian,

19
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.210
supposedly their anti-doping association, which meant got the anti. Okay.

20
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.890
Well he, eventually as time went on, it got exposed.

21
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.400
He just completely lucked into this,

22
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.800
this situation where he hired this guy to tell him, what should I do?

23
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.520
His name was Gregory Chenko Chenko thank you, Jamie. Good man. Jamie, um,

24
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.560
he is a man, um,

25
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.320
and Gregory told him exactly what he should take

26
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.550
and when he should it and do this and do that, and this is how,

27
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.190
and then he was gonna do the same race again the following year,

28
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.030
but juiced up and see what the difference in performance was along the way

29
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.710
the Sochi Olympics gets exposed that the Russians had cheated.

30
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.150
And what they had done was it was a super sophisticated scandal where they cut a

31
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:05.060
hole in the wall and they were like transferring the,

32
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.980
the dirty through one hole and, and giving 'em the, the clean sample to replace.

33
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.100
So they had found that there was microscopic scratches and these supposedly

34
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.220
impossible to open bottles. Yeah.

35
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.940
So the Russians had figured out a way to open theses to reopen those.

36
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.220
<v 1>Things. And it, have you seen the real ones?</v>

37
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:24.050
Have you ever seen one of the real bottles? No, I haven't in the flesh.

38
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.050
You cannot open them. Yeah, you can.

39
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.970
You will break them if you open them impossible.

40
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.850
They like have this sophisticated system in there where it's locked into the

41
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.210
interlocks with the glass. So once you close it as tightly as possible,

42
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.250
you cannot reopen it.

43
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.930
<v 0>Well, they somehow, or another figure to work around,</v>

44
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.050
to get in there and open it. And when they did that,

45
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.560
they achieved an press that did number of gold medals. I mean, they just,

46
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.760
they dominated the Sochi Olympics in Russia.

47
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.813
<v 1>I'm, bro.</v>

48
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.240
I'm hot because I'm hot and you, we know it.

49
00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:59.040
Like we know it pull up the, I don't even want to get into this.

50
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.280
Please get into it. So pull up the,

51
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.640
I lost in the quarter finals of the Olympic games in 2016,

52
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:06.160
there's a guy named Anne. We good.

53
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.320
Doya I just want you to see a picture of this guy. You tell me, was this in Rio?

54
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.080
He clean, this was in Rio, in Rio.

55
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.800
<v 0>Weren't a lot of the Russians of they were kicked out of Rio because of.</v>

56
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.230
<v 1>Sochi. They, so they did, uh, the most Russian,</v>

57
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.630
the most failed test by Russia and all Olympic sports.

58
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.030
First was track and field. Second was weightlifting. Third was wrestling.

59
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.350
Wrestling was number three out of all Olympic sports,

60
00:03:33.351 --> 00:03:35.870
however many programs there are. I'm sure there are a ton of sports.

61
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.750
You've talked about it. Wrestling was third.

62
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.940
They prod date,

63
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.300
all these samples. So they're getting popping guys from oh eight,

64
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.220
2012. And they're saying, you know what?

65
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.100
This guy was on a substance. He was on, you know,

66
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.420
some sort of performance enhancing drugs. So we're going to,

67
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.770
to strip of him, him of his medal.

68
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:05.050
And we're gonna give the guy that took fifth place, the bronze medal instead.

69
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.610
But at that point it's such a different experience.

70
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.010
You never got to stand on the podium.

71
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.850
You never got to travel the world and tell everyone about your medal.

72
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.450
You never got to get that check that was associated with whatever success that

73
00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:19.890
you had. That's sponsor someone taking.

74
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.280
<v 0>Away someone's gold medal.</v>

75
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.560
<v 1>And then giving it to you is not the same. It's not the same. It's not the same.</v>

76
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.081
So it's,

77
00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:29.160
it's life changing experience that you miss out on because these guys are being

78
00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:32.480
unhealthy and just straight up cheater. So like

79
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.120
I let I, there's a certain amount of disdain that I have for Russia.

80
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.790
I respect them cuz they are tremendous wrestlers. Not everyone cheats,

81
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.190
not everyone cheats,

82
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.150
but there are those who do and it's well known in the wrestling community.

83
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.750
And so at this point we have had to just accept

84
00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:55.790
it and try to beat 'em you just like,

85
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.990
you just gotta beat 'em because it doesn't matter that they are so powerful.

86
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.460
That IOC is powerful.

87
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.740
That regardless of what they do,

88
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.100
Thomas Bach and the IOC will never make a stance in which they will

89
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:13.620
completely ban Russia. So they've banned Russia from the Olympic games,

90
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.980
but the athletes that test cleanly can still compete under a different flag.

91
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.330
So ultimately it'd be like the independent Republic of Russia

92
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.890
that they can still compete in.

93
00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:29.850
But the Russian flag will not be visible in Tokyo or in

94
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:31.770
Paris in 2024. Really?

95
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.370
You cannot compete under the Russian national flag really done.

96
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.650
Wow. I didn't know that. So it's, they've been banned from the Olympic games.

97
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.240
They're governing body Russia itself.

98
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.520
So all Russian athletes will have to go through a testing process and then they

99
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:52.520
will be able to compete on as independent athletes, um, under a different flag,

100
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.240
but not the Russian flag. That's and that's how far we've come, bro.

101
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.680
And like I've seen so many athletes in track and field and weightlifting and

102
00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:03.480
wrestling that have seen other athletes get stripped and then have been given

103
00:06:03.481 --> 00:06:07.960
their medals years later. And all they get is an Instagram post. Yeah. It's not.

104
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.240
<v 0>Bro. Like you didn't.</v>

105
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.880
<v 1>Get a chance to win. It's not cool. It's not the same. And it's,</v>

106
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.040
it's sad because it, it, it it's the butterfly effect. Right.

107
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:20.910
Because messes up the, the, the ripple of the entire bracket, right?

108
00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:24.190
So it's like you beat this guy and then all he loses here and this guy goes here

109
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:26.390
and this guy retires, or he changes weight classes.

110
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.950
Like there's just so many things that just happen because of this.

111
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.910
So it doesn't make me happy. It doesn't sit well with me. But at this point,

112
00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:36.310
like what do you do? Like, I mean, you blow the whistle enough times,

113
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.900
but you just gotta do what you can to, to avoid it.

114
00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:42.620
And that the only way to do it is beat 'em. I think in wrestling,

115
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:46.540
we have kind of like the biggest margin of error because just because someone's

116
00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:48.660
in great shape, doesn't mean you can't beat 'em in wrestling.

117
00:06:48.661 --> 00:06:52.540
There's so much precision and technical skill that's associated with it that you

118
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:55.220
can still overcome that steep hill.

119
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.490
<v 0>But that's a problem with the Russians as well, because very proficient.</v>

120
00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.170
They're.

121
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.690
<v 1>Freaking they're very good. They're freaking good. So technical, the,</v>

122
00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:05.690
the wrestlers in these, you know, provinces and caucuses are insane,

123
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.090
insane at the sport. Like they from birth,

124
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.970
they are competing and training at the highest level. It's unlike re like here,

125
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:17.450
you got youth sport and you play games and you know what I mean?

126
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:21.200
You play tag with your buddies at practice and you do a couple of rope climbs.

127
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:24.120
You're done. Like these guys are training like Olympians at eight years old,

128
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.560
they're doing Brack bridge, kick overs, and they're learning five point throws.

129
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.400
And they're just technically savvy at a much earlier age because they're

130
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:35.480
bred for this. We think we have it hard here.

131
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:39.470
Like poverty here is nothing like poverty in other countries, especially,

132
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.070
you know, on like Ceia or Chenia and all these places like it's,

133
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.910
it's just a different vibe there. So they, they have some amazing.

134
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.470
<v 0>Wrestlers, an amazing motivation too, with that poverty.</v>

135
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.230
<v 1>Oh, it's life changing. They're tied into the government.</v>

136
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:57.950
The us is the only country that their Olympic team is not government

137
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:58.784
funded,

138
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.740
only country in the world where really our Olympic team is funded privately

139
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.620
by donations, corporate sponsors, that's it,

140
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.300
we're only country in the entire world. Every,

141
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.260
every country and the world has the government funding,

142
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.340
the way that they operate in making sure that they are competing at a high

143
00:08:17.341 --> 00:08:17.860
level. That's.

144
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.530
<v 0>Gotta be an incredible disgrace for Russia to be eliminated from the 20,</v>

145
00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:24.690
20 and 2024 Olympics. Yeah.

146
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.210
<v 1>Well, when you stand on top of the podium, bro,</v>

147
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:29.410
there's a certain amount of pride that comes with seeing your flag raised above

148
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.370
all else. That is a special moment. And so for them,

149
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.930
I don't know, because is it pride or is it, is it financial?

150
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.840
Is it just be an Olympic champion? Let.

151
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.680
<v 0>Me ask you this. What if a guy wins in 2008? Okay. And, and,</v>

152
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.680
and pops like they, they retroactively test the samples. Yeah. And then he, he,

153
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.480
is he still capable of competing in the future or is he eliminated forever?

154
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:58.743
Well.

155
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.960
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; that, it depends. I mean, if, if you pop from a few years ago,</v>

156
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.640
then maybe, I don't know, maybe they prod date, your suspension and say, okay,

157
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.760
every let's say, if you got suspended on that day for two years, post that day,

158
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.990
all of your results in that period of time would probably be eliminated.

159
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.030
But I don't think they.

160
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.591
<v 0>They would say that argument,</v>

161
00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:19.590
but I've also heard the argument that if you're cheating,

162
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:21.590
you should be eliminated for life for life.

163
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.110
And that that's the only way to stop cheaters. Is that like,

164
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.990
if you wanna stop someone from doing something it's prestigious as the Olympic

165
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:30.310
gold medal, that's a death sentence. I don't know games.

166
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.430
I know it's death sentence, but I mean, you, you are, you're cheating. Yeah.

167
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.060
You're repeating.

168
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.860
It's a thing like the whole reason to win the Olympics is for glory and for the

169
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:43.460
opportunity for sponsorships, for Americans. And, but that's why.

170
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.540
<v 1>That's why they're doing it, man. Like.</v>

171
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.100
<v 0>Well, it's political glory. And when Russia had it in the Sochi Olympics,</v>

172
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.540
that it's not like coincidence, they're.

173
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.740
<v 1>Following that medal closely, bro.</v>

174
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:58.610
Don't let anybody fool you that count every year at every Olympic games is

175
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.370
something that us in the village as athletes and the presidents of each

176
00:10:03.371 --> 00:10:06.490
particular respective country, they're following that. Of course they wanna win.

177
00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:09.250
They wanna be the best. Of course, that's, that's big to them.

178
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.090
So above all else,

179
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.760
some people are willing to take some crazy answers to be successful

180
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.480
because they know the incentives that will follow them,

181
00:10:22.481 --> 00:10:24.400
getting their hand raised. But yeah, you know,

182
00:10:24.401 --> 00:10:27.520
some people operate with character and they're like, you know what? Win or lose.

183
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.760
I'm not doing these things. I.

184
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.920
<v 0>Think though, with Russia, and this was pretty clear because of this doctor,</v>

185
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:33.280
they don't have a choice. They don't have a choice. Yeah.

186
00:10:33.281 --> 00:10:35.840
They don't have a choice. What was this wrestler that you wanted to say?

187
00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:36.650
What was the video?

188
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.910
<v 1>It was, uh, an wire Gado. Just pull up a photo. There's like a very,</v>

189
00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:44.270
there's a photo of him. He's like super vast. How corre.

190
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.910
<v 0>I mean, Carren's one of the craziest examples ever.</v>

191
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.110
His parents were tiny little folks. They were like five, five.

192
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.670
And he was built like a human Panther. That guy, that's a big fellow.

193
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.300
That's a guy that's achievable naturally with superior genetics. I mean,

194
00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:00.380
it is possible superior.

195
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.500
<v 1>But if you look at any other,</v>

196
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:03.860
look at all the other Russians that I've wrestled over the last,

197
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.380
over the last decade, none of them have that,

198
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.940
that level of stature. But it's, it is whatever, man. That's like,

199
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:16.580
we've exchanged matches. He's beaten me. I've beaten him. Um, but he beat,

200
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.850
he beat me when it counted at the Olympic games.

201
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.330
And so he does look pretty stacked. He's uh, he's tough, man. He's a stud.

202
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.490
<v 0>And this was in Rio. This was in.</v>

203
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.250
<v 1>Rio. Um, this was, is a, a game changer.</v>

204
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.530
<v 0>So, and you are suspicious.</v>

205
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.490
<v 1>I'm a little, yeah. Yeah. I am. I'm gonna be honest.</v>

206
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.170
I'm I'm a little suspicious. I probably get a lot of heat for it.

207
00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:38.920
And Russians probably won't be how happy with it. But even.

208
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.320
<v 0>If he didn't test positive,</v>

209
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.360
then the odds of him using steroids up before then or

210
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:46.880
using some sort of performing. Yeah.

211
00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:51.680
Whether it's EPO for training to get to where he got to like physically.

212
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.600
Yeah. You know, you keep a lot of the gains, no.

213
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.320
<v 1>Matter what that's the, the hard part about it is within that space.</v>

214
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.840
If you don't have a choice fine. Right. You know, Joe, listen,

215
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.040
if you wanna be on a podcast, you have to right.

216
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.760
<v 0>Do this. Right. If the government tells you, Hey,</v>

217
00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:10.920
you want to compete for the Russian team, you have to take.

218
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.390
<v 1>This or you can go be a Russian worker for the rest of your life making minimum</v>

219
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.870
wage. You're like, eh, I'll take that podcast. Give me that. Right.

220
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.830
So I think it's, it's a very different vibe there.

221
00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:24.390
Like they don't have opportunity outside. Like they can't go to university.

222
00:12:24.391 --> 00:12:27.350
They don't go to school. Russian wrestlers, don't go to college.

223
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.350
They don't go to universities and get four year degrees and get masters and go

224
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:32.750
on to the corporate world. They don't do that.

225
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:37.500
It's either you are an Olympic champion or they will choose a job for you.

226
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.660
And it's probably not one that's super enticing or you will work in some sort of

227
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.300
organized, you know, syndicate. Yeah. It's just different.
