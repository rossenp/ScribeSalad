00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. If you become president, excuse me,</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.590
when you become present, sorry.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.650
And you do get to change the way we spend

4
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:16.560
money and stop spending money on these regime change wars,

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:18.750
what would be the first thing you invested in,

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.640
in this country and how would you.

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.650
<v 1>That's a good question. I think there's, um, I'd want to give that some thought,</v>

8
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:29.460
because there are a whole host of challenges that we're facing. You know,

9
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:32.670
I mean, healthcare is, is among the top of the list. And, you know,

10
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.160
we've talked a little bit about that. The last time I was here,

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.660
our crumbling infrastructure continues to be something that's not only just

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.890
uncomfortable. Every time we're driving over potholes, it's actually, uh,

13
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.700
threatening people's lives. And well-beings, uh,

14
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.560
I was in Iowa a few weeks ago and we visited this a few communities that were

15
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.940
completely inundated and devastated by the flooding. Um,

16
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.830
that took place there. Gosh, about 3, 3, 4 weeks ago. Now, uh,

17
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.500
many of them have not been able to return to their homes.

18
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.510
We went and helped out one family.

19
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:09.990
We were tearing down drywall and ripping up the floors and underneath the wood

20
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:14.100
and the floors, there was still like tons of water, uh, in place.

21
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.720
And they were talking about how even with, you know, the aid from FEMA and,

22
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.150
and SBA loans, that they,

23
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.220
they are unwilling to put a single dollar back into rebuilding their

24
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:29.730
homes because they're hearing from the government and the army Corps of

25
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:30.564
engineers,

26
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.670
that it may take two to four years to fix the levies that broke

27
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:37.770
down and caused that flooding.

28
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.900
So why would they go and try to pour their life savings back into

29
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:47.370
rebuilding their homes when they could get flooded again in a year

30
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.810
or in two years,

31
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.830
because we're not making the kinds of investments in our infrastructure that we

32
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:55.710
need to make. Uh, so there's, you know, education. I mean,

33
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:57.840
there's a whole host of issues, um,

34
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.590
that I think we need to look at how we can best provide the resources that are

35
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:06.240
necessary to improve those services, uh, to the American people.

36
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:09.060
And also look at how, how we're doing business and,

37
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:12.240
and fixing the problems that exist within those different agencies.

38
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.100
<v 0>W there's always been a call to help countries in need in the world.</v>

39
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.090
There's always been a call for the United States to step in and, you know, and,

40
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:23.070
and, and do something.

41
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.780
But yet there's problems in this country that are, that never change.

42
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.190
There's bad communities in this country that are impoverished and crime Britain

43
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.280
that have been the same way for decades.

44
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.630
There was a former Baltimore police officer named Michael Wood who came on my

45
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:44.040
podcast and he was talking to me about the time when he was in the Baltimore

46
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:44.701
police department.

47
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:49.080
They found a piece of paper that was documenting various crimes from the

48
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:53.040
1970s for someone one of the years from 1970 something.

49
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.660
And it was the same exact crime in the same exact

50
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:01.510
area that they were having problems with. Now, whether it's homicide,

51
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.090
narcotics, whatever it was,

52
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.210
they were having the exact same issue in the exact same places.

53
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.960
And then he realized like, well, this is there's no effort put to change this.

54
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.280
Yeah, there's no, there's,

55
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.110
if you're talking about decades and decades and decades, why wasn't there,

56
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.600
uh, money funneled into this community?

57
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.600
Why isn't there some community centers that help children?

58
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.540
Why isn't there an emphasis on better education?

59
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.940
Why isn't there more police officers,

60
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.530
or at least some sort of civilian presence that

61
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:36.580
helps out people and stop some of this crime and gives people a better place to

62
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:39.130
live and then fix a lot of this.

63
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.110
What you're seeing decade after decade. Yeah. If we want to make America better,

64
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.710
the best way to do that is to fix the weakest parts,

65
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.340
the weakest parts of the people that are born in a situation,

66
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.730
they don't get a good break. They got a bad break.

67
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:56.920
They're born in a crime ridden environment.

68
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.340
And then they have to figure out how to be a better person while dealing with

69
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:03.910
all this. And then you've got people that are aloof to this that are like, Hey,

70
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.830
figure it out for yourself. I did. Yeah.

71
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.430
Like as if we all start from the same spot in this crazy game called life,

72
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.100
because we don't know those people are in the worst spot.

73
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.020
Why can't we fix the worst spot? It seems like we could, if we can help Iraq,

74
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.730
if we can invade Syria,

75
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:22.270
if we can do some of the things that people either want us to do,

76
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:24.640
or we have done, why can't we do that?

77
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.420
<v 1>Yeah. And that's, that's what I often remind people is that right now,</v>

78
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:32.710
today we spend $4 billion every month in Afghanistan,

79
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.610
$4 billion every month, every single month,

80
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.500
imagine what could be done with those dollars in those resources in

81
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:45.040
communities like Baltimore in communities like Flint, Michigan,

82
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.550
where people are still being poisoned by their water,

83
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.960
where they're being lied to and cheated by their leadership where the governor

84
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:56.890
sent in these inspectors and cleared the water saying, Hey, everything's fine.

85
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.910
What he didn't tell people was that when those inspectors went in,

86
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.310
they turned the faucet and let the water run for five minutes before they tested

87
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:10.390
it to clean all the crap out of the pipes and create this false

88
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.730
conclusion that somehow the water is clean.

89
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:16.030
When the people who live there know that it is still not safe to drink.

90
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:19.930
And for some folks, they can't even take a shower in their own homes.

91
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.280
And so that's why you're not going to hear any other presidential candidates

92
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:28.960
talking about the cost of war and where our

93
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:32.380
money is going and how it is counter to our national security.

94
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:33.580
It's making us less safe.

95
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.760
It's counter to the interests of our people and the people in those countries.

96
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.380
But this is why I talk about this everywhere I go, because it's central,

97
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.420
it's central to our ability to address these domestic challenges that

98
00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:50.590
we are facing. We in this country are facing in communities across the country,

99
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:52.870
dealing with healthcare affordable housing.

100
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.860
There's a homeless crisis in both urban cities and rural

101
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.800
people who are not able to afford to put a roof over their heads.

102
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:02.390
People who are working, full-time maybe one,

103
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.320
maybe two jobs even still can't afford to put a roof over their heads.

104
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.900
There's serious issues that we need to address here,

105
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:13.310
but to think that somehow we'll have the resources to do so without

106
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:16.940
addressing where trillions of our dollars have been going now for the last

107
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:20.630
several years, uh, is a lie. It's just not true.

108
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.260
<v 0>When you talk about people that are working full-time jobs and they still don't</v>

109
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.980
have enough money to get by. What could you do to change that?

110
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.950
<v 1>Well, I think there's, uh, we, there's not one single action that can fix that.</v>

111
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.620
Uh, you know, I'm pushing for a living wage. I think it's important that, uh,

112
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:42.080
it's, it's going to be different in different places. You know, I've,

113
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.390
I'm a co-sponsor of the, uh,

114
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.100
congressional legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 at the federal

115
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:50.690
level. Um, you know,

116
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:55.040
there has not been an increase in the federal minimum wage for a very long time.

117
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.730
Uh, and I think that's, that's a step that can be taken, but, you know,

118
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.590
Los Angeles is like Hawaii where a $15 an hour job

119
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.160
is not going to be enough to pay the rent. Cause you got high cost of living.

120
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:08.600
So living wage is going to be higher.

121
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:12.500
And in communities like ours than it is in smaller communities or

122
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.970
Midwest.

123
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.490
<v 0>What would you suggest for Los Angeles, $20 an hour?</v>

124
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.040
<v 1>I don't, I don't know what the answer is here. It would have to be more.</v>

125
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.611
<v 0>I think,</v>

126
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:23.720
so the argument against that would be that small businesses would go under or

127
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:27.890
hire less people or that somehow or another, it would be bad for business. Yeah.

128
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.210
<v 1>I think there's a, you know, I mean the cost of living here is higher.</v>

129
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.380
And so what we are paying the employees who work in these industries in these

130
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:38.750
service jobs has to match that.

131
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:41.900
It has to correlate with that higher cost of living. It costs more to go out,

132
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:46.490
to eat here than it does to go out, to eat in a restaurant in, I don't know,

133
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.700
Alabama, for example. So I think we've got to,

134
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.490
we've got to recognize people who are doing the work, um,

135
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.230
that correlates with the higher cost of living that we're seeing already. Um,

136
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.770
I'm, I'm really looking at the universal basic income, uh,

137
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.220
and seeing how that could be a tool to, um,

138
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.390
help deal with a lot of these poverty stricken communities and people who've

139
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:12.680
been struggling and still unable to dig themselves out of a hole there and

140
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:17.270
seeing how that potentially could replace a lot of the bureaucracy,

141
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.360
a lot of the money that we're spending on bureaucracy and a lot of social

142
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:25.340
welfare programs, perhaps to both save money and to provide support directly,

143
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.500
uh, to people who need it. Uh,

144
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:29.810
so I think that's an option that we've got to consider. There's it's,

145
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:31.190
it's not simple.

146
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:34.760
And so I'm doing the research and figuring out how exactly that would work and

147
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.630
how exactly we'd pay for it. Uh, but we also have to look at affordable housing.

148
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.070
I think not accepting the fact that the high cost of housing is what it is,

149
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.630
um, is, is not the solution. Um,

150
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.960
there's a lot of money that goes into our housing and urban development

151
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:51.794
department,

152
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.770
but is it really having the effect that we needed to have to it so that,

153
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.410
you know, whether it's cops or teachers or firefighters,

154
00:08:58.411 --> 00:09:01.380
people who are working in these public service jobs are able to afford to live

155
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.240
in, live in the communities where they're working. We were in Malibu yesterday,

156
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:10.110
we had a town hall there yesterday and took a tour with the mayor city council

157
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.070
members, community leaders,

158
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:15.450
around a lot of the areas that were completely devastated by the

159
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:16.284
fires.

160
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.980
And that was one of the things that they mentioned is that they pointed out a

161
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:22.170
trailer park, um,

162
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.590
traditionally where a lot of those first responders live,

163
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:29.580
that's where the workforce in Malibu have lived in that trailer park.

164
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.020
And they said that it's not unheard of that.

165
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:38.850
One of those trailer homes go for a million bucks, a million bucks,

166
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:41.280
and you don't even get to own the land that your trailer sits on.

167
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.120
And so this is a real problem that they're facing is people who are teaching in

168
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:47.550
that area, the firefighters who are working in that area,

169
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.550
they're not able to afford to live in the community that they serve.

170
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.090
<v 0>How could that be fixed? That's a supply and demand thing.</v>

171
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:55.170
There's not that much beachfront.

172
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.560
<v 1>Communities. I mean, you know, there's, there's land in the valleys and,</v>

173
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.880
and other areas, but some communities are dealing with this, uh,

174
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.390
both in the private sector, there's, there's hotels in Hawaii, for example,

175
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:10.650
who are recognizing that they can't attract workers to work in the hotels

176
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:14.100
because they can't afford to live near where they work and they're starting to

177
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:18.600
buy it properties to actually provide that workforce housing at an affordable

178
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:21.510
cost to be able to attract those workers. Uh,

179
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.500
some communities are doing the same thing for, uh, for first responders,

180
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:29.550
for firefighters and others. So this is a problem that, that a lot of, you know,

181
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:33.420
city councils and local communities are trying to, to deal with and solve.

182
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.520
But I think it also points to a bigger problem that we have, uh,

183
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.970
nationally, that there's just not enough affordable,

184
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:44.970
truly affordable housing for working people in the country.

185
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.220
<v 0>But a place like Malibu is always been this exclusive community,</v>

186
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.700
because there's just not that much Malibu. Right. It's right next to the water.

187
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.160
So it's more valuable. Yeah. Like if, if,

188
00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.450
is there a way to do anything that would change that?

189
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.780
<v 1>Well, this that's what I was asking the mayor about. And that, and that was,</v>

190
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.380
that was one of the things they said that has been, um, you know,

191
00:11:07.381 --> 00:11:08.880
people look at Malibu and they're like, well,

192
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:11.550
that's where a bunch of multi-millionaire rich people go and buy their beach

193
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:15.870
homes, but there has always been a, you know, the,

194
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:19.650
the basis of that community was really founded on those who worked to build the

195
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.300
community, uh, you know,

196
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.590
middle middle-class middle-class people who are increasingly being pushed out.

197
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:28.410
If you're not living in the home that, you know, your grandfather,

198
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:30.060
your great-grandfather built,

199
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.860
then you're not going to be able to afford to stay there. Uh, so, you know, he,

200
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.220
we didn't get into the, the details on what they're looking at,

201
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:42.720
but this is something that the city council and the mayor are grappling with now

202
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.370
to be able to attract workers who want to work in the area,

203
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.850
but who don't want to have to drive two hours or three hours just to get to

204
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:51.684
their place of work.

205
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.680
<v 0>Yeah. I just don't know how you would ever.</v>

206
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.360
<v 1>Do that. Yeah. Especially with all those fat cats that are living in Malibu.</v>

207
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:00.010
I mean, it's a crazy place to live. Yeah.

208
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.250
Those houses on the beach are like ridiculously expensive. Yeah.

209
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.570
And that's where a lot of, I mean,

210
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:08.050
a lot of the folks we were talking to yesterday, they live, uh, you know,

211
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.910
up on the mountain or in the valley.

212
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.350
<v 0>That's a better spot. Anyway,</v>

213
00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.640
the thing about being by the beach is people can just kind of hang out in your

214
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:18.820
backyard, like right there, like right where your bedroom is,

215
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.570
that could be people that are cooking out four feet away from your head. Yeah.

216
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.800
<v 1>That's so much privacy.</v>

217
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.050
<v 0>You got none. It's the beach.</v>

218
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.530
It's everybody's like people have tried to kick people off of it too,

219
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:30.640
which gets really strange.

220
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.240
There's been a lot of those cases where they hire private security,

221
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.630
but it's like trying to kick someone out of a park because you decided to have a

222
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:40.600
picnic. That's true, man. This beach has everybody. Exactly.

223
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.660
<v 1>That is got to stay that way. It has to stay. It's got to stay that way.</v>

224
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:46.840
I have a problem with this. This is a personal problem with,

225
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:51.760
with municipalities that charge you to go to the beach crazy.

226
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.370
So if I have no money in my pocket,

227
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:58.210
you're going to bar me from going and putting my feet on the sand and running

228
00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:00.790
for a surf in the ocean. That's just wrong.

229
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.730
<v 0>It's insane. Wrong. It is wrong. Right. I mean,</v>

230
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.530
I could see if you had a donation box to help people

231
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:11.390
clean up the beach. That's all I could say. Donations.

232
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.940
That's all throw some money in there.

233
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.880
<v 1>Yeah. I'll pay for my parking. Sure, sure. You know,</v>

234
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.490
but don't stop me from coming on the beach. Like, I'll catch a bus.

235
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:20.680
If I don't have any money, I'll get you a bus to the beach.

236
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.110
<v 0>You've got to like, that's the whole reason we have these national parks,</v>

237
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:30.280
national wilderness areas. It's anybody. Yeah. Anybody can get in there. Yeah.

238
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:34.110
That's the beautiful thing about one of the best things about the,

239
00:13:34.111 --> 00:13:38.290
the system that we have in place in America is that there's so much public land

240
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.980
and people don't understand that they've never been to other countries where

241
00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:44.980
that's just not the case. Everything is private in many, many countries.

242
00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:49.390
You can't just go camping. You can't just take a raft and go down the river.

243
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:50.224
You can't just.

244
00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.000
<v 1>And, and what happens when those public spaces are lost,</v>

245
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.030
when they're lost, they're lost forever. When you pave over them,

246
00:13:58.031 --> 00:13:59.920
when you develop them, you know,

247
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:04.510
when your beaches become trash with pollution and others like that,

248
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.160
it's a treasure. It's a treasure. That's like.

249
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.870
<v 0>Well, we have our forefathers to thank for their foresight.</v>

250
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:15.400
Like Theodore Roosevelt saw this in advance and met with great

251
00:14:15.401 --> 00:14:17.800
resistance from a lot of big businesses.

252
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.280
It just wanted to put apartments up everywhere and start building factories.

253
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.480
And we created this incredible system of public land in this country.

254
00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:29.260
That's unprecedented. Yeah. I mean, only Canada has something that rivals us.

255
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.740
Well, I guess it was Australia has got a lot of public land too, but it's just,

256
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.550
there's other countries that have it, but it's amazing what we have here.

257
00:14:36.551 --> 00:14:40.120
And in terms of our diversity of scenery and,

258
00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:41.830
and where you could go to, I mean,

259
00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:45.550
you could go to the desert or you could go to Idaho and, you know,

260
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:46.960
go to quarterly, a volcano.

261
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.620
<v 1>In Hawaii.</v>
