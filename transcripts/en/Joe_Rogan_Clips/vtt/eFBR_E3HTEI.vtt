WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.500
<v 0>So this has been a wild ride for you, huh? Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.720
<v 1>It's been a long road, you know,</v>

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.860
nobody could have imagined basically from, uh,

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.360
looking back from my life that, uh, we're going to get here, you know, to the,

5
00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:21.310
I have to talk with, uh, great people around the war,

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.380
you know, such as you and, uh, be the biggest port podcast ever.

7
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.500
<v 0>You know, and to be about,</v>

8
00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:33.250
to fight for the UFC heavyweight championship of the world to suck on time.

9
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.270
<v 1>For the second time.</v>

10
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.780
<v 0>Yeah. The redemption, the redemption. Well,</v>

11
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:39.070
what was the first time like for you? What was,

12
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.800
was the feeling of the first fight like for you?

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.020
<v 1>Oh, um, I had two different feelings, uh,</v>

14
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.670
from that fight first. Uh, obviously I was very, um,

15
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.500
upset and disappointed that I didn't win the fight. And,

16
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.920
you know, I, as everyone was fighting for the title,

17
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.930
you want to get out there as a victorious. But, uh,

18
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.790
to be honest, I always look in that fight. And since, uh,

19
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.620
defy day, just after the fight, I look at it and I'm like, this is good.

20
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.390
Like, um,

21
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.610
I learned just to mush in that fight because

22
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:26.140
I I'm, even though I was in the level of fighting for the, uh,

23
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.640
war title, you know, but I still have some,

24
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.960
some missing part in my game. And in my experience,

25
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.040
I remember I was asking my question in myself, like, okay,

26
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.690
how did it look like to go into three rounds? Basically,

27
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:48.520
I'm going to a potential five rounds that I never been in three rounds.

28
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.770
How did it look like how is it to prepare for this kind of fight? And,

29
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.960
uh, I had this fight like six week, six weeks, um, earlier.

30
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.060
So I was having a lot of question then after that fight that

31
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:06.310
night, I'm like, okay, I get it.

32
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.570
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah. So a very big learning experience, right?</v>

33
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.230
Because you were smashing everybody, everybody, you were knocking everybody out.

34
00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:16.540
So you had these very quick fights.

35
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.270
<v 1>Very quick, very pig rice. And, uh,</v>

36
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.550
didn't spend enough time in the octagon to like have those experience.

37
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.920
Even though I was almost like, uh,

38
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.240
he was almost four years, three years and half things.

39
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:35.320
I'd be four years that I'd been doing the sport, but, uh,

40
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.090
didn't spend enough time in the octagon to have that experience. I think, uh,

41
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.200
in one night I have a, uh, it,

42
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.270
I cover more than what I been spending in the octagon from the rest of my

43
00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:50.200
career. Now.

44
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.180
<v 0>It's, um,</v>

45
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.770
it's gotta be a difficult thing to figure out how to pace yourself for a five

46
00:02:56.771 --> 00:03:01.540
round fight when you've only been knocking people out quickly before that. Yeah.

47
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.520
<v 1>Uh, also, you know, some people, uh, get your,</v>

48
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.870
why they're being proficient when, where they been having, uh, at least,

49
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.030
uh, lives for a long time, maybe wrestling,

50
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.890
maybe doing some different sport at school or at college. But,

51
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.680
uh, I never get into that stuff. You know,

52
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.910
growing up our just like finding my way to survive. Then I ended up,

53
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.040
uh, finding myself in some way that, uh,

54
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.050
I never been there. You know? So the experience was just crazy.

55
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.570
<v 0>How old were you when you had your first training,</v>

56
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.460
your first martial arts training?

57
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.080
<v 1>That was in, uh, summer, October, 2013. That was my first.</v>

58
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.263
<v 0>Eight years ago.</v>

59
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.530
<v 1>Yeah. And two years after that I was fighting my first fight in the UFC.</v>

60
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.800
And I remember basically, like at first, when I went into Marshall,

61
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.890
he was just for fun to a curiosity. I'm like, oh, he's fun. Oh, he's good.

62
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.830
I like those, uh, kick, you know.

63
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.023
<v 0>But.</v>

64
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.980
<v 1>I didn't like seeing myself being a, um,</v>

65
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.080
um, USC fighter and people was like, oh, if you put yourself into this,

66
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.130
you can become a UFC fighter and a UFC champion.

67
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:25.480
You can have a UFC belt wrapped around your waist. I'm like, whatever,

68
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.190
you know, care about it until I have the USA contract,

69
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:32.680
like two years after that, I'm like, okay,

70
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.820
this may be the opportunity that I have been looking for.

71
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.860
So it's time to capitalize and showcase my

72
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:44.260
talent, unsure the war and shook the world.

73
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.980
<v 0>How many fights did you have before you fought in the UFC? Six fights.</v>

74
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.050
Six fights. And did you have them on front?

75
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.440
<v 1>A few fights in France? Uh, just before in France, uh,</v>

76
00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:58.750
at forefront, a fight in France and you know, in France,

77
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.250
the crown and pound is not allowed when he goes, that was back, uh,

78
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.990
back then, because MME was the illegal. So when he goes on the ground,

79
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.460
he's just turned into gripe, grappling game game. Really? Yeah.

80
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.870
So I had four fights in France,

81
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.730
one in Switzerland and one in Bahrain, Bahrain, Barbie.

82
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.540
<v 0>So when did they find out about you? How do you FC find about you? Um.</v>

83
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.820
<v 1>That was, um, that was my coach Phantom by the time was working with, uh,</v>

84
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.900
a manager named, uh, Tiago, uh, a Brazilian guy.

85
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.860
So they kind of like push, uh, uh,

86
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.550
Tiago has a connection with the, I mean he was a manager.

87
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:47.500
So for now was all the time sending him a text message

88
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.820
and, um, uh, videos that you were, uh,

89
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.070
forward to the UFC on to, and they'll say like, yes, but, uh,

90
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.090
he hasn't fight nobody tough yet. Yeah. He hasn't get tested, uh,

91
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:06.830
a real test yet until, uh, I fought this guy in, Bahrein named,

92
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.930
uh, William by guilty and, uh, knock him out in the second round.

93
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.620
Then I get my UFC contract right after that.

94
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.630
<v 0>What was it like the first fight in UFC? Was it different? Whoa.</v>

95
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.370
<v 1>Uh, that was a crazy experience. You know, I didn't,</v>

96
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.710
I didn't even know the rules back then.

97
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.400
I remember I was in Orlando and I'm like, man,

98
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.360
this is the time like I'm going to fight, uh,

99
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.460
to be seen in the whole world. Um, so this is my,

100
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.070
the time to take my opportunity to showcase my talent, to prove that, uh,

101
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.570
I can do something then I'm like, okay, so what is this, uh,

102
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.160
what it is about MME? What, how MMA works, what is the rules,

103
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.720
how it goes, and I couldn't get it, like didn't know the rules, but.

104
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.470
<v 0>Because you got used to no ground fighting punching on the ground,</v>

105
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.530
cause there's no ground and found in France. Yeah.

106
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.020
<v 1>Oh, I was just doing it for two years.</v>

107
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.950
And remember at first it was just for fun. Right.

108
00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:16.580
So didn't really was there to become a professional fighter, you know?

109
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.440
Uh, or I care about, uh, at the time was boxing then, uh,

110
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.750
I found out, I found myself there in two years then I'm like, okay,

111
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:30.980
what is the rules again? Uh, how it works. Okay. Uh,

112
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.530
if you try to take me down, I cannot do this.

113
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:38.390
Like trying to figure all those out. It was very stressful. And I'm like,

114
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.250
guess what? At the end of the day is just fine. I mean, uh,

115
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.720
I don't know if this guy's doing some Khufu, he's just fighting.

116
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.820
We're gonna figure it out. You know, it's just men between men, you know? Right.

117
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.510
Yeah. We're going to figure it out. I mean, you know, I'm a tough guy, you know,

118
00:07:56.511 --> 00:07:59.570
so, uh, I can handle it. Why.

119
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.840
<v 0>Did you transition to MMA and not, not go into boxing?</v>

120
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.650
<v 1>It's not like your transition and I didn't have a choice. You know,</v>

121
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:10.730
I was proud I was doing MMA, uh, because when I get in,

122
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.920
when I went in France, I was, uh, uh, I didn't have a,

123
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.030
uh, paper, so I was illegal, so I couldn't work. And, uh,

124
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.920
I wanted so bad to do a sport and I

125
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.660
was doing boxing in an MMA,

126
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.580
but the MMA was the one that was more open and giving me opportunity, like,

127
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.950
uh, having a UFC contract as a MMA fighter was a big deal. And, uh,

128
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.850
didn't have much, you know, like books in war is kind of like a,

129
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.250
a very complicated business. You have to know somebody,

130
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.370
they have to like line you up. It's very complicated.

131
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.300
But MMA was just easy, you know, people out then I'm like, who's that guy,

132
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.110
we want that guy. It was pretty, pretty easy. Mme.

133
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.943
Wise and.

134
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.380
<v 0>Doxing. You have to be connected to the right motor.</v>

135
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.880
<v 1>Yeah. And that takes time. Yeah. And, uh, basically, uh,</v>

136
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.860
regarding my situation back then, uh, I had a lot of oats,

137
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.690
you know, uh, coming from nowhere. Nobody knows me with my accent.

138
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.670
And you know, uh, in French when you have accent is not a good thing. It's.

139
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.460
<v 0>Not, what's it like over.</v>

140
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.540
<v 1>There, it's frustrating because the way that they look at you,</v>

141
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.250
when you speak with your accent, you know, you don't feel comfortable.

142
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:35.700
You can like, let, let yourself express yourself.

143
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.050
You just feel bad about yourself. You know? Uh, just seeing people react.

144
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:43.110
Some people reactions sometime, and, um,

145
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.750
you didn't have a resident card. You was like, uh, uh,

146
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.460
migrant. So it was kind of together was a tough situation to deal with, uh,

147
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.450
basically in the books in business, because they're gonna go see this promoter,

148
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.320
talk about you, but who is that guy where it is come from?

149
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.100
You know, it's hard to have created from someone.
