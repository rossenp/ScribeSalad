00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience . This business has always been weird like that.</v>

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.240
<v 1>No, that's why you're the king dude because you got outside of it,</v>

3
00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:11.720
but you're totally in it and they can't, they can't get you. They can't get you.

4
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:12.650
I, I, you know,

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm piling up some stories here being in the matrix. I won't get into them,

6
00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:19.460
but it's the same.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.390
It's just the same old corporations.

8
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:25.490
Only know how to do business one way.

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.150
<v 2>They pushed their advantage. They pushed their advantage.</v>

10
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.450
They have their leverage and they want the biggest pie slice of the pie.

11
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.490
That's that's what the, a problem.

12
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.821
<v 1>With that.</v>

13
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:37.850
It's when they go beyond that and they just straight up steal or they stealing

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.740
from you, right. Everybody does every floor.

15
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.320
Every time you get in business with like corporate guys, this is how it works.

16
00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:45.980
It's like the check, okay. We're in business to make money from them.

17
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:47.060
And then you get in business with them.

18
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:48.800
And then the check goes to the corporate guy,

19
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.940
and then you get your cut off of his checkbook. So right there,

20
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.630
I am immediately in a situation where there's no way I can steal from him,

21
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:58.370
but he can Rob me blind.

22
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.550
<v 2>And can add a bunch of expenses on the things that front.</v>

23
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.270
<v 1>End load expenses to make it look like they're losing money and yeah.</v>

24
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.900
To Hollywood accounting. Yeah, no, it's stealing it. Stealing is what it is.

25
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:12.100
They just call it Hollywood accounting, but it's not Hollywood accounting. It's,

26
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
it's corporate accounting. It scumbag accounting. That's just,

27
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.710
and it's how they do it. And they sleep at night and then they always ask, oh,

28
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:22.070
that's over in the accounting section of the building, not over here,

29
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:27.020
where me and my yacht are. I'm like artists friendly.

30
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:29.990
You know, I majored in liberal arts in college.

31
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.800
<v 2>It was really interesting when podcasts started to take off,</v>

32
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.450
they started to try to get in with the old model and weasel into

33
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.560
podcasts and buy pieces of podcasts. And like,

34
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:43.670
if you come on your deal.

35
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.080
<v 1>Your deal is going to,</v>

36
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.010
if you think the industry is going to sit back when they didn't get to wet their

37
00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:51.740
beak on that thing, I'm going to tell every young comic,

38
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:55.070
when we get back to this is what they're going to do now is what the music

39
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:56.260
industry did. Well, they cited,

40
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.670
it started signing straight across the board deals.

41
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.150
They're going to get some young kid. Who's got no power in the business.

42
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:05.420
And it's just like, you know, we'll help you create a podcast. You know,

43
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.980
we signed with so-and-so blah, blah.

44
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.110
And what they're gonna do is they're gonna own the podcast.

45
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:13.280
The advertising money is going to go to them and they're going to Rob them blind

46
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.390
percent. They're going a hundred percent, 100% going to steal from them,

47
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.520
Rob them blind.

48
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.550
And then when they get audited and they get caught stealing,

49
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.970
they're going to label that kid, that young comic, difficult to work with,

50
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.890
meaning difficult to steal from that's it's already happening. Yeah. Uh.

51
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.590
<v 2>I know guys who, young guys, I won't name any names,</v>

52
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.450
but they've come out to me and go, Hey, um,

53
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.840
I'm signed to this management company. They want to sign me,

54
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.970
but they want a piece of my podcast.

55
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.430
Now they want a piece of this and they want it.

56
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.440
<v 1>The reason there's no reason. Yeah. You got to tell people that you got to tell,</v>

57
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.240
oh, I tell you, I tell people do not give up.

58
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.580
<v 2>Anything. Don't give up anything don't ever. It's all.</v>

59
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.670
<v 1>You. So they're not going to do anything for you. They get,</v>

60
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:58.400
what they're going to do is move the ball quicker. That first two years,

61
00:02:58.401 --> 00:02:59.890
and then the rest all going to be you.

62
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:03.900
If you just hang in there and see and struggle a little bit like, Ugh, you.

63
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.300
<v 2>Got to grind. You just gotta hang in there and keep going. I mean,</v>

64
00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:10.410
I got a lot of offers to buy half of the podcast or to buy P and I,

65
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.740
nothing, I wouldn't, I won't, I won't do it. I will, I'll never do it.

66
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.670
But then Spotify came along and they said, we'll give you a licensing deal.

67
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.030
So just put it on our network for three months, but you still own it. Like,

68
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.300
all right, when, and that's why we did it that way. But this,

69
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.020
this comic that I won't name, he was telling me that this management company,

70
00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:31.650
they wanted to sign them. They wanted to own a piece of his podcast forever.

71
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.000
And I'm like, what is that?

72
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.560
<v 1>Eventually it will become. Yeah,</v>

73
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.900
because what they're going to look at it is they're going to make it,

74
00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:41.580
like if you started a podcast while you were with this manager or Y with this

75
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.420
agent will be like back in the day when you booked a sitcom. Exactly.

76
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.410
And then if you left the agency of the manager throughout the lifetime of that

77
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.120
sitcom, you owed the commission to them.

78
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.460
But back then that you needed them to do that.

79
00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:55.770
You don't need them for the podcast, but they're going to do that.

80
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:59.670
So then you're going to leave this manager and then for the rest of your life,

81
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.390
you're going to be paying this never-ending alimony. I mean, there'll be guys,

82
00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:06.930
eventually they'll try to take 50, 60. I own your podcasts.

83
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.490
Managers will start.

84
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.740
Agents will start podcast networks because there's nobody regulating them to

85
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:15.000
not do that anymore. I got.

86
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.260
<v 2>An offer just five years ago from a company that was a radio company.</v>

87
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.470
They wanted 50% of the podcast. They were going to give me no money.

88
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.860
They want 50% of the podcast just to be associated with them. And they're like,

89
00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:29.070
we're going to pull together all these advertisers and it's going to help your

90
00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:30.750
revenue now, 50%.

91
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.440
<v 1>So that's and they never deliver with what they say they're going to.</v>

92
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:38.280
And then they come in and they just, they just, they got the thing. The.

93
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.270
<v 2>Beautiful thing about podcasts is podcasts. All get big on word of mouth.</v>

94
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.390
Like I've never advertised this podcast. I never did anything with it.

95
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.530
I never bought billboards or put ads up anywhere. It's just from word of mouth.

96
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.750
And the way other podcasts grow is people get on people's podcasts and they say,

97
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:58.320
Hey, you listen to bill Burr's podcast, Monday morning podcast, hilarious.

98
00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.370
And then it just.

99
00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.880
<v 1>Grows.</v>

100
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.360
I think it's the job of people making money in podcasting to let new podcasts

101
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:03.691
there's no,

102
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:08.550
do not sign those deals ever do not let the Fox into the henhouse

103
00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:12.630
because they are going to Rob you blind and you don't need,

104
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:16.770
and I saw this documentary one time on this heavy metal band Advil, right?

105
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.190
Just crazy thing about this band that just was around forever and never quite

106
00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:22.920
made it. And there was a, I think it was, I think it was that one.

107
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.710
It's one of those ones about an old, like metal band from the eighties.

108
00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:28.440
And this guy said, like the truest ever,

109
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.330
when he was talking about the music business,

110
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:32.310
and this goes straight across podcasts, everything, he goes,

111
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.510
you're better to own something a hundred percent and only sell 20,000 copies

112
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.640
than you are to, uh, not own it at all and sell 20 million.

113
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.600
Like you're literally going to make more if you just sell 20, 20 crazy. Yeah,

114
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.070
no, the. And then another thing that they done, oh my God, dude.

115
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.320
Now the thing that they do is then that all the people that they lose on,

116
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.400
they dump that on you. Yes. Yes. Like I remember one time,

117
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.170
I forget what I was with this network.

118
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:02.090
And I had a CD that was already made.

119
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.280
I already made it and I just wanted them to put it out on their label and they,

120
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:11.660
and they wanted to own the CD. And I was like, no, I'm not, no,

121
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.690
I don't want you to own it. I just need you to, to, to like distributed.

122
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:17.540
I need you as a distributor. And the guy said to me, he goes, well, you know,

123
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:21.500
ownership, shouldn't be that big a deal for you. It should be about exposure.

124
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.420
And I said, all right, well, let me ask you this.

125
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:25.940
If ownership shouldn't be that big a deal to me,

126
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:29.360
why is it such a big deal to you? And he started like stammering.

127
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.290
And then he basically said, well, you know, we get in business with something.

128
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.310
He named a couple of the comics who CDs didn't sell and we have to recoup those

129
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:39.800
losses. It's like that. Ain't my fault. That's hilarious.

130
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.030
I could have told you not to sign that jerk off. What is your sound? My fault.

131
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:47.390
You didn't do the work. So that's the way

132
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.581
I had another one.

133
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:52.790
One time I signed with this is back when I made like CDs and I did one and I had

134
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:56.030
a 60, 40, you get, you know, I was getting 60 and they were getting 40,

135
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.880
but are 40 was off the gross.

136
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:03.080
Mine was off the net and all expenses for the album was on me. It's like,

137
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:06.800
I thought we were doing this together. Every thing, the artwork printing it,

138
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:11.210
all of that, all of those expenses came to me. And in the end that 60, 40,

139
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.660
60 net 40 gross, they made way more money than I did.

140
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.700
It's just how they knew like, oh, okay, well I'm getting $6 on every 10. Yeah.

141
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.200
Plus, but anything.

142
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.150
<v 2>It's hilarious that they would come up to you and tell you that we did some</v>

143
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:26.230
deals with some other comics.

144
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.260
<v 1>You know, I get in business one time to make this TV show.</v>

145
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.280
And the guys sends this, the bill for the whole thing. I shouldn't be saying it,

146
00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:34.480
but this is a while ago. Right?

147
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.620
The guy was going to bill is 2,500 bucks a month to use this copier machine.

148
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.120
And then another, I don't know, 4,500 bucks to use his editing. It's like, dude,

149
00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:45.310
we have both of those things. We don't need those.

150
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.550
Let's take that money and put it on the screen.

151
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.120
We're trying to get this thing to go. And the guy like he, oh,

152
00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:53.500
it was the funniest ever. He goes like,

153
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.080
I'm insulted by those questions is something like that.

154
00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:59.680
Which is my favorite thing ever. The, the, the offense, like the, uh,

155
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.900
what is the, like the, I dunno,

156
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.180
you're a thief and you actually have the audacity to be like taken

157
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:09.580
aback, like, like fanning yourself. Like, I can't believe you. It's such a,

158
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.680
it's like how many shows you charging 2,500 bucks a month to go, you know,

159
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.100
you use your copy machine. A lot.

160
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.960
<v 2>Of money. That's rent for a nice apartment.</v>

161
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.690
<v 3>No thieves.</v>

162
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.480
<v 2>PV. She'd how much does it cost to use that copy machine? Really? First of all,</v>

163
00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:30.850
the copy machine probably doesn't even cost 2,500 bucks.

164
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.870
<v 1>It's probably renting it,</v>

165
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.190
probably rents it for a couple of hundred bucks a month. But even to buy a car,

166
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.730
he probably has nine shows paying 2,500 bucks a month from the guy heavy.

167
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.760
<v 4>That's it a really big one, one.</v>

168
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.910
<v 2>Of those commercial grade copy machines, what does it cost? 10 grand. I mean,</v>

169
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.290
how much could it cost?

170
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.030
<v 1>I mean,</v>

171
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.900
I think he's bought a couple of houses off of owning that copier machine.

172
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:54.610
And I just, I just love telling these,

173
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.080
because these are the things that you like, what's great about podcasts.

174
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.970
And you can say this, this is for every person out there who has a business.

175
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.200
And you know, there's that thing where you want to take it to the next level.

176
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.620
And then these, these guys come in and then they're all just like, yeah, well,

177
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:14.160
Hey, we're going to take a piece of it. And they take a big chunk out of it.

178
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.580
And what they do is their risk is all the way down here. Yours is up here.

179
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:21.270
And then somehow they just, I'm telling you, like, you're better.

180
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.550
You better to sell 20,000 copies on and a hundred percent than 20 million and

181
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:28.410
not own any of it because you're going to make more money.

182
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:32.460
That's just how the game is played. And those guys who steal from people,

183
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:33.990
they sleep very comfortably.

184
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.450
<v 2>But it's also just podcasts.</v>

185
00:09:35.451 --> 00:09:38.870
Just the stress of dealing with other people's eliminated.

186
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.190
Just the stress of dealing with production, people down, it slows it down,

187
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.200
slow it down. It's awful. Yeah.

188
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:50.120
I mean the only thing spot Spotify has ever done so far is ask,

189
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.870
do you know who the first guests will be? And already I'm like, oh.

190
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.240
<v 3>Yeah, they're going.</v>

191
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.760
<v 2>To be who they're going to be. You know, they're going to be great.</v>

192
00:09:58.761 --> 00:10:00.980
I'm going to try and get called best friend called the funniest people.

193
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.790
<v 1>That's them justifying their desk. Like, I can't just sit here.</v>

194
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:06.380
Like Joe knows what he is.

195
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.540
<v 2>Any idea? Well, I'd like to start a.</v>

196
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.140
<v 1>Email chain and we could maybe circle back later and have a conference call.</v>

197
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.360
And they're just trying to fill up there.

198
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.390
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. They're just having to use time. Yeah. But they have Spotify.</v>

199
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.060
People have been great. They literally said we don't want to do anything.

200
00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:25.940
We want you to just do what you're doing. Just do what you're doing. Oh.

201
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.580
But even asking me who the guests going to be, I was like, oh no,

202
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.100
please let this with you. Yeah. I'm never available.

203
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.650
And that's nothing though. That's nothing. I mean, they're great.

204
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.200
But could you imagine if you were doing that with a network where you imagine if

205
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.840
you were in business with ABC or something like that,

206
00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:43.700
and there they were helping produce your podcast.

207
00:10:43.701 --> 00:10:47.210
You'd have to go in for meetings. You'd have to go in and sign into the office.

208
00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:50.360
Bill you sign in here and you'd go and sit down and waste your afternoon.

209
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.010
Having some dopey conversation.

210
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.960
You kind of complain a lot when you read these letters, bill, um,

211
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.840
do you have to, when people are signing the emails, maybe it should be.

212
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.060
<v 1>Can we get a read on the blah, blah, blah.</v>

213
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.740
<v 2>Um, what do you think, how do you feel about product placement?</v>

214
00:11:06.741 --> 00:11:09.770
Because we've got a, got a great deal. Wow.

215
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.581
<v 1>I just wanted to,</v>

216
00:11:13.581 --> 00:11:16.250
I just wanted to tell a few of those for younger people out there,

217
00:11:16.251 --> 00:11:21.050
because it actually really bothers me that people do that to people.

218
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.820
It really bothers me and I love comics and I love seeing new comics coming up

219
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:28.790
that have talent. And I hate seeing them get over.

220
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:31.820
So hopefully people listen and they do it,

221
00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:34.220
but they're worms, man.

222
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.330
<v 2>If they're worried worms,</v>

223
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.030
there's a lot of worms out there and there's a lot of worms to try to grab

224
00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:41.210
comics real that they're talented, but real raw.

225
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.590
And they try to lock you up to some enormous lifetime management deal.

226
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:50.390
And when you take off and you have something to say, if you're good, I remember.

227
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.770
<v 1>Back in the day, when everyone, when,</v>

228
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.050
when companies were like shooting specials before comics started shooting them

229
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.360
and the amount of guys that got that, yeah.

230
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:02.170
We only got enough money for him to shoot one, you know, to only,

231
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:04.330
you can only shoot at one time, but you're going to crush it, man.

232
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.171
You got this hour down,

233
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:08.020
we only got enough in the budget and then they'd show up early and they'd be

234
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:10.810
shooting another comic special off their money.

235
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:13.150
The deal to double them as a management company,

236
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:17.860
what they would get or an agency, the amount of times that that happened with.

237
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.720
<v 2>The same audience army. Yeah. Do you want me to be the best one I ever heard?</v>

238
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.650
Jim brewer was filming a special sold out this theater and the,

239
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.000
the people that were filming the special told him that the money for the ticket

240
00:12:30.001 --> 00:12:34.500
sales was theirs because it was all about the production

241
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.640
because the money that people were paying for the production,

242
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:42.120
he's like the are you talking about, this is my audience.

243
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.230
Like that's my money.

244
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.510
His management tried to steal the money from ticket sales and

245
00:12:48.511 --> 00:12:50.130
say that it went towards production,

246
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:53.760
went all the way to court with it.

247
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.020
As managers on the way to court has a panic attack, goes to the hospital.

248
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.510
Like the whole thing's a nightmare.

249
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.340
<v 4>I think she won.</v>

250
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.800
<v 2>He won boats, thievery, thievery. Like these are tick.</v>

251
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.020
People are paying to see Jane. I have.

252
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.610
<v 1>A million of those stores, but this is the thing.</v>

253
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.360
This is what kills me about a lot of this

254
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.710
there's rhetoric. That's going on out there, which I agree with 90% of it.

255
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.740
But if you, if you agree with a hundred percent of it,

256
00:13:25.741 --> 00:13:28.290
like you and I are not supposed to be having stories like this,

257
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.350
we're supposed to be the ones doing it. And it's just like,

258
00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:35.160
you have to mean like, as far as the, uh, the whole, you know, oh,

259
00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:37.620
you're a white male, heterosexual, you know,

260
00:13:37.621 --> 00:13:41.040
doors just fly open and people like, Hey, what are your dream? They like,

261
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.480
I'm not saying, and I'm not obviously not, but I'm just saying that like,

262
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.400
like people will you. It's all about money. They talk about,

263
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.420
they don't give a. And they, and they, all those people that do that really?

264
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.630
Yeah. There's a long history of Hollywood.

265
00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.430
<v 2>Accounting. There's a long history of that. I mean,</v>

266
00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:03.480
there's been so many stories about people who made killer hit movies and never

267
00:14:03.481 --> 00:14:06.030
got paid because Hollywood's like, look, you know,

268
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.900
we had this much had to go to advertising and this was the production got bad.

269
00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:12.420
Elvis got. Oh yeah. Elvis.

270
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.720
<v 1>Got so bad. And then one of the main ways he got on the road,</v>

271
00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:19.320
he only did one out of the country date. I believe he did Toronto.

272
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.520
And he never traveled the world because his manager had something going on with

273
00:14:23.521 --> 00:14:26.490
his visa. And he was worried if he left, he wouldn't be able to come back.

274
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.290
So that kind of like, him, Elvis,

275
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.900
a ton of money and seeing the world or whatever the he might've wanted to do.

276
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.060
Keep doing these movies Elvis.

277
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.350
<v 3>You want to go on the road. That is hilarious. Well, the, you know, the best.</v>

278
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:45.270
<v 2>Version of breaking down, how corrupt the music businesses was by Courtney love.</v>

279
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.420
They said she had a ghost writer. I don't know, but she did, but it was, it's a,

280
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.090
it's a great article that she wrote exactly how

281
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:57.560
much you get paid versus how much money gets generated and where it all goes and

282
00:14:57.561 --> 00:14:58.394
how they you.

283
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.680
<v 3>Yeah, no, it's, it's.</v>

284
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.850
<v 2>I've always done it that way. I mean, that's always the way they've done it.</v>

285
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.280
That's the young people. That's the answer.

286
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.800
<v 1>To it as well. I mean, that's how, that's how it's done.</v>
