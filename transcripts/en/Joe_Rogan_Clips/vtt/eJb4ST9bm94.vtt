00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.640
<v 1>Experience, which at Sage, which.</v>

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.600
<v 0>Which she got here, you.</v>

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.040
<v 1>Smoking in this show. No, bro. No,</v>

5
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.320
you lighted up to kill the demons in the room. &lt;laugh&gt; this? Uh,

6
00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:12.600
native American lady gave me this. Oh yeah. She came in to talk to us about,

7
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.120
I got in this, uh, long kick of, uh,

8
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.400
reading about native American history. Yeah. They actually,

9
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.830
a lot of 'em referred to themselves as American Indians, but uh,

10
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.870
and then this lady came in and was educated me on a lot of the issues and

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.670
brought me some Sage to clear out all.

12
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.390
<v 0>The bad spirits. Yeah, no, I, I I've, uh, I, I believe in a lot,</v>

13
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.070
I believe in a lot of these rituals, one actually not too long ago,

14
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:37.030
I was actually with, uh, with uncle Mike. Yeah.

15
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:40.830
You told me that with Mike Tyson and uh, getting rid of demons right now.

16
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.900
Yeah. Demons be gone. Don't start, don't start shaking back there, man. No.

17
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.780
<v 1>We'll be all right. Jamie's no demon. Never. You never know.</v>

18
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.980
<v 0>Yeah. But I was able to, uh, cuz you know, as you know, Mike,</v>

19
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:57.540
Mike has always talked about the toad, you know? Yes.

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.460
And I believe you've done the toad too.

21
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.620
<v 1>Yeah. What the toad is,</v>

22
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:05.530
what you're referring is five meth Oxy dimeethyltritamine that's excreted by

23
00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:10.370
the toads skin. Um, they, they take this, uh,

24
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.730
type of toad. I forget the name of the toad, but they, uh,

25
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.250
get it excited and excreete this stuff from its skin onto glass.

26
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.280
And then they leave that glass out in the sun and it dry eyes that excretion

27
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.860
eyes.

28
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.360
And then you scrape it up with a razor blade and then you smoke that stuff.

29
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.080
Or you could just get a synthetic version of it, Colorado river toad.

30
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.160
That's what it issorin desert to it'ssorin. Yeah. And uh,

31
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.600
you can find the center of the universe through the excretions of this toad. Oh.

32
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.270
<v 0>My, my God. It's a, a trip. Crazy Joe. It's a trip. So.</v>

33
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.030
<v 1>Had you, you done anything before this, before you did this,</v>

34
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:51.310
did have you any experiences with psychedelics? Yeah, I've.

35
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.950
<v 0>Done. Like I've I've, you know, I've done mushrooms and obviously high smoke,</v>

36
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:58.510
which I don't know where all the Mary Jane is, but um, from here bro,

37
00:01:58.511 --> 00:01:59.344
you want some.

38
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.580
<v 1>Come on. You're retired. Yeah. Why not man? Come on Jeff. Nevitzky alone.</v>

39
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.900
&lt;laugh&gt; navvinsky actually wanted everybody to be able to.

40
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.980
He's the one of the first guys to say it's nonsense.

41
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.540
It's not a performance enhanceer although with Nick Diaz, I think it might be.

42
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.700
Yeah.

43
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.580
I think with Nick Diaz it might actually be a performance enhancer &lt;laugh&gt; I

44
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:21.140
really think so, man, when he fought gomy they said he,

45
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.820
he had to have gotten hot.

46
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.730
He had much weed in the system when they tested him that he had to have gotten

47
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:28.570
high right before the fight. Yeah.

48
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.610
<v 0>Light that up. Joe, you puff, puff, pass or</v>

49
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.730
&lt;laugh&gt; of course.

50
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.330
So I'm gonna share my story with you, Joe.

51
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.210
And I want you to share yours with me. Okay.

52
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.880
What type of.

53
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.560
<v 1>Leaf is this? Well that's um, tobacco on the outside. So it's a blunt, you know?</v>

54
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:53.960
And then the inside it's the weed. I get this from speed weed.

55
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:55.080
Shout out to my man. Geno.

56
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.880
<v 0>Geno is to check this out. You imagine you imagine doing the toe with, uh,</v>

57
00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.480
with somebody like Mike. I.

58
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.560
<v 1>I get high with Mike and I got nervous just when I'm nervous. When I meet him,</v>

59
00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:10.160
look, he was one of my heroes when I was a kid.

60
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.440
Mike Tyson was the man. I mean,

61
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.550
in a way that it's hard for people to convey today to understand what a

62
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.350
cultural figure Mike Tyson was in like 1986.

63
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.950
It's hard to convey. You're not gonna, no,

64
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:30.070
one's gonna understand youngest ever heavyweight champion, you know,

65
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:33.270
knocks out Trevor Burick when he's 20 years old. Yeah, he was.

66
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.310
<v 0>I was the same guy that beat Ali, right? Trevor bur.</v>

67
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.950
<v 1>Beat Ali, beat Ali late in his career when it was real sad. Who was,</v>

68
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.980
was a real sad fight. Yeah. It was a real sad.

69
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.380
<v 0>Fight. But it's touching. Remember when Ali went in the ring and gave,</v>

70
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.900
gave Mike like a little pet talk. Yeah. You know? Yeah.

71
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:51.260
And then Mike and then Mike went out there and knocked that dude on the fish

72
00:03:51.261 --> 00:03:51.540
runm.

73
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.540
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Muhammad Ali's like, this dude up for me. Will you? Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.680
Yeah.

75
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.450
<v 0>But anyways, to get back to that Joe soul. Yeah. You know, so, you know,</v>

76
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.000
I I've been,

77
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.130
I've actually been shadowing Mike for like the Mike Tyson for like the last I'm

78
00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:07.210
I'm good friends with, uh, with his manager, Rob, Rob Hickman.

79
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:10.250
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and just the stuff that they're doing at Tyson ranchman is,

80
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.810
uh, it's pretty cool, man. Yeah. It's really cool. Right? Yeah.

81
00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:14.370
They're they're bringing medicine to the world.

82
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.730
So Mike I've been on his podcast cuz he's always talked about the toad.

83
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.880
I was like, all right. You know, so I became him good friends with,

84
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:23.880
I call him uncle Mike man, cuz he's just, you know, he scares me a lot.

85
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.240
Every time he sees me, he's always, you know, he'll compliment,

86
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.480
but then he'll school me at the same time. So he always talked about the,

87
00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:32.320
to I'm just like, well let's, let's do it then Mike let's do it, uncle Mike.

88
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.800
So he is like, man, dude, you sure you I'm like, yeah man,

89
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:38.960
you've been talking about it for a minute. So, you know, so we go out,

90
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.480
we go on this, uh, you know, the,

91
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.510
they have this whole real nice settlement with rituals or whatnot.

92
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:47.350
And we go out to, uh, to Antigua, which is an island off the, off the Caribbean.

93
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.870
We have a, I forget what they're called, uh, the person at, uh, shaman. Yeah.

94
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.670
Shaman. I'm sorry. And uh, he's out there and you know, Mike goes first,

95
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.630
so Mike, imagine this Mike Tyson does it, you know, Mike,

96
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.860
Tyson's Mike Tyson's he's he's doing and he's, he's going,

97
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:04.260
he's going a bit crazy man. Cause a lot of what, what that,

98
00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:07.260
what that does is it brings out a lot of your, as you say, you know,

99
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:08.860
you open up the stage, a lot of your demons,

100
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.700
a lot of things that you've probably been holding onto for a minute mm-hmm

101
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.860
&lt;affirmative&gt; so I'm seeing, I'm seeing Mike over here,

102
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:17.700
twist and turn and kind of, you know, talk about a lot of,

103
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.380
I don't wanna share that stuff, but you know, talk about a lot,

104
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.690
a lot of his pastment &lt;affirmative&gt; you as me, as you said, he's, he's an idol,

105
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.770
he's a legend, you know, that's the way I look at Mike too. So I'm over here,

106
00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:29.970
here, you know, I'm just like, I'm almost like tripping out,

107
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:33.490
but at the same time intrigued, you know, because,

108
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.050
so then I go up and I do it and uh, Amanda took me to, uh,

109
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.690
especially out of retirement here, man. Like I, I, I would,

110
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.800
I almost kind of somewhat wanted answers.

111
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.720
I was hoping that it would give me okay, man, this was like the path of whatnot.

112
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.480
And uh, it took me, it took me to like,

113
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.240
it took me to my mom's like your mom's like first love man. You know?

114
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:56.760
And it showed me like in a store almost like in a movie,

115
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.400
you know how I was born, how my mom had me, how I, how,

116
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.880
by the time I was eight years old, like I had my sister.

117
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.160
So I was no longer the youngest. How my mom kind of like, you know,

118
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.080
in all fairness, kind of somewhat pushed to the side,

119
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.720
leaving home at the age of 17. And, and,

120
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.710
and substitud my mom's love for self-fulfiment wrestling,

121
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.230
uh, mixed martial arts. And it brought me back to a little kid when I was,

122
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.190
uh, maybe four or five when I would cry to my mom.

123
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.510
Cuz I remember as a kid we would go, uh, we would go from LA to New Mexico,

124
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.350
like in greyhounds. And I remember stopping at McDonald's and things like that.

125
00:06:34.351 --> 00:06:37.740
But to me, you know, as a kid, you don't know, know you're poor,

126
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.420
but what that did is that brought me back to the person that created me.

127
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:43.820
That brought me back to my mom's love man. So it like,

128
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.940
it like resurrected something in me and I was crying.

129
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.700
I was asking for like forgiveness. I was speaking in Spanish, like mom,

130
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:54.420
forgive me. Wow. It was something, uh,

131
00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.330
it was something scary, some ways because it does it, it takes you out of your,

132
00:07:00.331 --> 00:07:01.530
your body. Like it's, it's,

133
00:07:01.531 --> 00:07:04.930
it's almost like you're in judgment day and you're the one that's being

134
00:07:04.931 --> 00:07:08.210
convicted and you're the judge too. Mm. And it's telling you,

135
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.970
but it's giving you this certain peace. It's like,

136
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:15.810
you're so dead that you're alive. Whoa, it's a trip,

137
00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:18.800
Joe. I don't know which ones you had, but this is what I can share. What,

138
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:21.600
what I can experience like it was, it was cool man.

139
00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:24.200
Cause I was able to do it with special people. I did it with Kelvin.

140
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:25.520
Like we all did, like, it was,

141
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.360
it was already formally planning on my brother back there.

142
00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:31.720
My mentor probably at me cuz they look out for me a lot. But man,

143
00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:35.000
it was something that, you know, as an adult, you know, you have the rights to,

144
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:38.480
to make these decisions and, and sheriff it's good. And I,

145
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.350
I felt like the toll was probably one of the best things that's uh,

146
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:44.030
that's happened to me like honestly, cuz it,

147
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:47.230
it makes you realize and reflect on what truly matters.

148
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.550
<v 1>I think there's a fear of it just because it's illegal.</v>

149
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.070
I really think that's it. And it should be respected.

150
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:56.110
It's very dangerous in that sense that it could not,

151
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.820
not that it could do harm to you physically, if is the real deal,

152
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.820
it's not gonna do harm to you physically. Your body has it in it.

153
00:08:02.821 --> 00:08:04.140
Your body knows what to do with it.

154
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.180
It's one of the reasons why it's such a quick trip,

155
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.820
your body knows how to bring that stuff back to baseline very quickly.

156
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.860
That's why it's only like a 15 minute trip. Yeah. Um, but it's not,

157
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.890
it's not bad for you all the time. I think it's like it,

158
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.930
it's a really powerful thing. That's it's gotta be respected. It could you up.

159
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.823
If you're not ready.

160
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.770
If you have some distorted versions of the world that you're operating under.

161
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.810
For me, one of the things that made me feel like right away,

162
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:37.690
one of the first things was realizing how much of like the way I talk

163
00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:41.600
about things is like how you related. I was like,

164
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.160
I was trying to figure out,

165
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.880
like I would say things in a way that I wanted people

166
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.360
to say, Ooh, he phrased that cool. Like I would,

167
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.240
I would try hard to impress people with the way I was saying things.

168
00:08:55.241 --> 00:08:59.840
And I was realizing that as I was trying to describe the trip after it was over,

169
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.600
I was like, that's interesting. Like,

170
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:06.760
so that probably leads to a disconnect between me and

171
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.120
someone who's listening because it's not a hundred percent what's going on in my

172
00:09:11.121 --> 00:09:13.400
head. It's at least a little bit showmanship and.

173
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.990
And it made me realize it in that moment.

174
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:18.110
Like I think it probably made me a better,

175
00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:19.870
everything probably made me a better comedian,

176
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.310
probably made me a better podcast or everything. It been a minute. When's it.

177
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:24.750
When, when did you do this for the first time?

178
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.590
The first time I did it was early two thousands. Okay.

179
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.510
So I guess we're looking at like 2002 ish somewhere

180
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:37.020
around then. Yeah. That was like first time I did it last time I did,

181
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:40.580
it was about two years ago, but the last time I did it, I did the other kind,

182
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.060
the N N dimeethyl treat actually maybe a little less than two years ago.

183
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.420
A little less than two years ago. Um, it was N N dimeethyl Tripp Tomine,

184
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.660
which is, um, that's the different version. That's the version of it.

185
00:09:53.661 --> 00:09:55.420
That's in iwaka, that's the version.

186
00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.330
There's a bunch of different snuffs and different ways that people try to,

187
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.410
uh, to get that stuff into their system.

188
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.090
But smoking it is the quickest smoking. It gets you free,

189
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.250
you vaporize it and it gets you right to the center of the universe immediately.

190
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:16.640
And um, all those things, you know, I think man,

191
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.720
one of the cool things about life,

192
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.720
like what you're talking about in your journey, your journey, uh, as a, as a,

193
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.840
as a man, your journey as a champion, your journey to become better and to,

194
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.480
to show what you're capable of this,

195
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.080
all of this is because no one gets it, right? You don't just get it right.

196
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.910
You it up and you try to do better and you, you fail.

197
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.910
And then you figure out what went wrong and you,

198
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:50.110
you just constantly analyze whatever you're doing and obsess

199
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.430
on it and you can become better at that thing. And through that,

200
00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:55.190
you can understand that you can be better at anything.

201
00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.660
And I think when you any kind of psychedelic

202
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.660
where you have an opportunity to look at yourself,

203
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:08.420
just really look at yourself accurately. You're not gonna like it.

204
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.380
&lt;laugh&gt; but it's gonna give you great benefit because it's gonna give you,

205
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.540
you're gonna be able to see yourself honestly and see whatever those flow it

206
00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:20.050
does. Don't get that you have all these flaws, just fix,

207
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.010
'em just fix, 'em do your best to fix 'em and you're not gonna get it right.

208
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.730
Cuz ego's still gonna come creeping back in your life.

209
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.130
And ego's still gonna hold onto your legs and drag you down while you're trying

210
00:11:30.131 --> 00:11:34.090
to run. &lt;laugh&gt; you know, that's what it is. Ego's like hanging on your ankles.

211
00:11:34.091 --> 00:11:36.930
Are you trying to run like, come on, stay the same. Yeah,

212
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.600
but you can't stay the same to get better.

213
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.840
The way you get better is to relax and to,

214
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.360
to realize that you know, all, all your fuckups, all the fails,

215
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.680
all the that's not you just cuz you lost a match. Doesn't mean you're a loser.

216
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.830
You just lost.

217
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.880
Like you should be happy that you got this opportunity to feel terrible.

218
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.640
Cuz through that opportu opportunity to feel terrible.

219
00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.640
That's where all the growth comes from. If you can survive it,

220
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.800
some people can't survive it. Right. You all know.

221
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.880
We all know those guys that were really good in the gym and they had like one or

222
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:10.880
two matches or one or two fights and they just couldn't handle the pressure for

223
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.910
whatever reason they couldn't handle the,

224
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.110
the things that went wrong and they just didn't wanna do it anymore.

225
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.910
But they could have been like a world beater. You know you, you,

226
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.030
everyone knows that guy. Yeah. Right. And what is wrong with that guy? Well,

227
00:12:23.031 --> 00:12:27.590
that guy's got one aspect of your two part thing that you were talking about

228
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.390
heart inability. Right? He's got one aspect. He's got the ability,

229
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.300
but this it's, he's got a missing part and he doesn't wanna look at it.

230
00:12:36.301 --> 00:12:39.420
Cause if he wanted to look at it, he would concentrate entirely on that. Yeah.

231
00:12:39.421 --> 00:12:41.740
And he would get better at that, but it's hard. Yeah.

232
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.420
It's hard to look at yourself. Psychedelics, let you look at yourself like,

233
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.980
Hey stupid. &lt;laugh&gt; look at you. Remember the last time I did DMT, there was a,

234
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.900
a, a string of jokers,

235
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:56.250
like gestures with the bells on dancing in front of me going like this.

236
00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:01.610
you just openly mocking me. And I was like, oh,

237
00:13:01.611 --> 00:13:05.770
that must be what I need. I must need that. I'm like, that's good. That's good.

238
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:09.450
<v 0>To see. Yeah. It's it's definitely a, it's definitely an ego check man.</v>

239
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.290
Big times that dissolves it, man. Like, like with Mike, like he loves a dude.

240
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.000
Yeah. &lt;affirmative&gt; he's you know, he, he owes it to the, to the, to,

241
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.840
you know what I'm saying? Like that said that he,

242
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.640
he said that's been a big reason why he's changed his life. You know, Mike,

243
00:13:22.641 --> 00:13:26.040
wasn't doing so well until, until he tried this and he, you know,

244
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:29.800
it talks about it all the time on his podcast. So he gives.

245
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.480
<v 1>You an opportunity to shift it's.</v>

246
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.360
<v 0>It's hailed drug addicts. I mean,</v>

247
00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:36.110
drug addicts have gone from doing all kinds of crazy when they tried the toe and

248
00:13:36.111 --> 00:13:38.350
they completely just left everything guys that they left.

249
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.750
Like almost like a dead man walking to a he's alive again. Mm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

250
00:13:41.751 --> 00:13:42.310
He's here with us.
