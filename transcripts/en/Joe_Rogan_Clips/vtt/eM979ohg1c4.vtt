00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.680
<v 1>2 0 5 Is kind of popping these days. It was a little sad.</v>

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.360
It struggle city about a year ago.

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.040
<v 0>A lot of killers, a lot of killers,</v>

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.360
but no one that is a real promising threat to John Jones

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.200
Santos put on a show, put on Santos.

7
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.800
<v 1>Blew out with the one leg. Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.950
<v 0>Yeah. And I knew it was neg was blew out early on. I, I.</v>

9
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.110
<v 1>Didn't. And then when they told me Tores, ACL cl Menis, everything I'm like,</v>

10
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.670
and he still competed.

11
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.310
<v 0>Like that.</v>

12
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.230
I could tell early in the first he threw something early in the first,

13
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.550
you could see his leg going. Yeah.

14
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.750
<v 1>I could you, you said something about it, right? I, something was going on,</v>

15
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.430
although I will say this as Santos is bad as. And then before that,

16
00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:43.580
Anthony Smith, both amazing fighters, John's getting little older,

17
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.140
John's getting older. And, and I think there's a guy and you know,

18
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:49.380
I think John's the greatest of all time, hands down, no argument. But he,

19
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.300
I think there's starting to be a little chin in his armor. Maybe.

20
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.740
<v 0>You think so? Yeah. What makes you well.</v>

21
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.780
<v 1>With Santos there, there was some, Santo's.</v>

22
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.620
<v 0>A Savage man. Santo's a Savage for sure.</v>

23
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.370
And John fought him standup for some strange reason. I was surprised,

24
00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:06.210
especially with Santos's up leg that John didn't take that performance.

25
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.730
<v 1>Didn't blow me away by John. No, by no means. No. And sanls had one leg.</v>

26
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.010
<v 0>I didn't understand that performance. Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.730
<v 1>I don't know why he didn't take him down. Right. I felt like.</v>

28
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.770
<v 0>John is one of the best wrestlers in the sport. He took down Daniel Cormier.</v>

29
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:17.604
He submitted.

30
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.610
<v 1>Little macheita. Yeah. I mean, uh, viorbell for, uh, rampage Jackson,</v>

31
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.360
the Ryan badder. He's amazing.

32
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.000
<v 0>He, yeah, he could take him down. I wonder what was going on there?</v>

33
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.080
And the guy's got one knee. I mean, he can't even.

34
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.440
<v 1>Walk. Right? It's very, the game plan was very strange,</v>

35
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.960
but I saw that went well.

36
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.640
And here here's where I was thinking with that is will John go on defeated?

37
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.080
Probably. I bet a good amount of money on that, but there's a guy like, like a,

38
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.320
I don't think you can sit on the outside and beat John,

39
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:43.990
like a res like a super technical and long.

40
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.630
You're not gonna outsmart John on the outside. It's not happening.

41
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.190
I think it's gonna come from a guy like Johnny Walker who throws like a spinning

42
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:51.024
heel kick.

43
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.070
<v 0>To catches John. And he is fighting someone. Good. Who's he fighting? He's.</v>

44
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.110
<v 1>Fighting your boy. He was just on the wrestler. The, the black dude. Oh,</v>

45
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.070
Corey and Corey Anderson. They were talking to each other. That' in,

46
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.710
that's in New York. Ooh.

47
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.660
<v 0>That's a good has Corey has crazy cardio. That's a great fight. Crazy.</v>

48
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.300
<v 1>Cardio. Let's see what if Johnny walkers? Cause if you beat Corey,</v>

49
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.140
you're ready to go. Yeah. You beat him. We're going Sizzler. Yes.

50
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.420
<v 0>Yes. Or if Cory beats him, he's going Sizzler. Corey Walker.</v>

51
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.020
<v 1>Corey's already there. Corey. Corey's already a elite.</v>

52
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.220
<v 0>Guy. Well, he is an elite guy,</v>

53
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:22.700
but he's not being talked about in terms of a title shot style.

54
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:26.370
That's very frustrating to him. Yeah. But that style is hard to handle, man.

55
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:26.890
He doesn't.

56
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.690
<v 1>Matter. They're not in the business of that. But.</v>

57
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.210
<v 0>Look at look at Kobe Covington. It's a similar style. Just constant pressure.</v>

58
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.490
Yeah. You're right. And you know, but he talks.

59
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.250
<v 1>A lot of Kobe did to get.</v>

60
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.250
<v 0>There. Yeah. Well Corey's a really nice guy and his nice.</v>

61
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.250
<v 1>Guy's finished last don't.</v>

62
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.800
<v 0>They? Oh. Sometimes they win you really? Yes.</v>

63
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.320
<v 1>Can the win in the no, he, he can win for sure. He's the dark.</v>

64
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.960
He's gonna take a lot of work though. Yep. To get there, like you like, let,

65
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:55.120
let's say you have a guy, like, let's say you have a guy who's um,

66
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.720
like a con McGregor.

67
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:59.760
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he's gonna catapult to the front before a guy.

68
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.880
<v 0>You're talking about personities yes. Yes. Catapult.</v>

69
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 1>U of season go rocket ship go.</v>

70
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.360
<v 0>Isn't that crazy though? That that's like part of the sport,</v>

71
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.680
part of the sport is how much money can you generate?

72
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.400
Because it's not just about how well you perform as a fighter.

73
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.320
It know it's about how many people are interested in you fighting. It's crazy.

74
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.020
It's crazy.

75
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.910
<v 1>But that 's the nature of the beast in it. But.</v>

76
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.750
<v 0>That's why I hope that having a guy like Corey on my podcast,</v>

77
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.310
or you having him on your podcast, lets people know what a great guy,

78
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:30.790
this is like, this is a guy to root for. He's a great guy. I agree.

79
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.310
And he can fight his off.

80
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.750
<v 1>I agree. But the casuals don't for whatever reason,</v>

81
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:36.150
they don't gravitate towards it. Well.

82
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.030
<v 0>If he wins, they will.</v>

83
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.260
<v 1>Well, you just gotta become onto yes. Which he's he's.</v>

84
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.061
<v 0>Slowly getting there. Yes.</v>

85
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:44.180
He's slowly getting there and he's got one of the best trainers in the world.

86
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.460
You know, Mark Henry is the and the best. Yep. And his camp is fantastic.

87
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.540
It's got Marlon and Frankie and oh, get a title shot. Oh, get shot. I,

88
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.740
I think so too. And you know, who's another nice guy. Bring a lunch.

89
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:58.820
You better pack a lunch if you're fighting Corey. But.

90
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.250
<v 1>He here's where nice guys don't finish last.</v>

91
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.730
If the guy they're fighting is down to play the game via DC, John Jones.

92
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.770
Mm-hmm DC's as nice as they come. Yeah. Doesn't talk.

93
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.530
HIMS steep a especially the first fight. Not,

94
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.610
but that sells just off their talents.

95
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:17.050
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but if you can get a guy like josealdo con McGregor. Yeah.

96
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.520
Joe' as nice as they come. Yeah. They get as Irish tie wave and everyone's like,

97
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:23.880
I'll watch that. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then Jo do,

98
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.760
even though he's one of the greatest of all time at 45,

99
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.760
everyone tuned in and then he, he kind of took a lot of fans with him. Even,

100
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.360
even though he lost, he was this huge star. Yep. That could happen for Corey,

101
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:39.000
with John Jones. Yeah. Although Jones John Jones, doesn didn't really talk to.

102
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.870
He's just a bad guy who 's outsides DC though. Him and D him DC hate each other.

103
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.950
Yeah. That's interesting. John Jones, DC for the heavyweight title.

104
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.070
<v 0>I think that's the future you do. And if steep a wins in this, uh,</v>

105
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.990
in this fight, that's next weekend. Next week, I think that steep a fights.

106
00:04:56.991 --> 00:05:00.070
John Jones' heavyweight and John Jones moves up to heavyweight and tries to win

107
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:04.500
the title. Agree. Then DC fights John Jones for the heavyweight title.

108
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.620
When John's a champion,

109
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.900
if John could beat steep a or if steep a can beat DC

110
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.020
and then steep a could beat John Jones. And they have a, I mean,

111
00:05:15.021 --> 00:05:19.940
depending on how the fight goes, look, the bottom line is DC nots steep,

112
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.850
a senseless one, or knocked him out cold for the title. It wasn't.

113
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.610
<v 1>A dominating fight. I matter, he did not.</v>

114
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.370
<v 0>Him out. Doesn't matter. Boom. How goes the lights? A hundred percent champ.</v>

115
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.330
Not cold. If he can beat him again, man. And, and say John Jones.

116
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.290
<v 1>He's going too HES. Smarttogether.</v>

117
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.250
<v 0>Yeah. If he does that. Oh dude.</v>

118
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.210
<v 1>Biggest fight. You'll see history. Yeah.</v>

119
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.200
<v 0>At heavyweight it'll be enormous. What is this pound for pound Daniel.</v>

120
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.880
Cormeier number two. Cabib number three. John Jones. Come on, settle.

121
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:52.440
Down's folks. Settle down. Whoever's doing that. Come on. But also John Jones,

122
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:56.560
listen to me. They fought John, but they fought beat him twice. He's undefeated.

123
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.080
He's beaten every human being he's ever competed against in real life.

124
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.600
Okay. Every single one. There's one loss in his career. It's a nonsense loss.

125
00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:07.480
They're trying to reverse.

126
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.120
I'm 100% support reversing that loss a hundred percent at the very least make it

127
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.910
a no contest. John dominated that fight. Smashed him. There's no way.

128
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:17.950
That's a loss. If I was.

129
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.070
<v 1>The UFC, I'll just mark it as he' is undefeated. In fact,</v>

130
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.830
I wouldn't even acknowledge that undefeated. Yeah.

131
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.663
<v 0>Wouldn even acknowledge it.</v>

132
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.150
<v 1>Your athletic commission. Ask Matt Hamel. His night went, watch the fight.</v>

133
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.590
Did you see Matt Hamel talk to John. He's talking. Let's.

134
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.350
<v 0>Have a rematch like wow bro. Are you.</v>

135
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.310
<v 1>Crazy, bro? You wanna lose your vision to what he doing?</v>

136
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.900
&lt;laugh&gt;&lt;laugh&gt; dude, just stop.

137
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.460
<v 0>You some for that. Just stop all that. Hey dude.</v>

138
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.420
<v 1>Ham. Stop. Be cool though. You don'tm be cool. Even John went, come on bro.</v>

139
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.380
He was even mean to him. Listen, John just goes, come on bro. I'll never fight.

140
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.900
There's.

141
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.380
<v 0>Even, even a conversation about who's the light heavyweight goat.</v>

142
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.380
He is no convers. No it's.

143
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.810
<v 1>No. What are we talking about? No, John, anytime you talk pound for pound,</v>

144
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.250
John's clearly been.

145
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.210
<v 0>That it's like the only one who was challenging for pound for pound was mighty</v>

146
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:06.170
mouse and mighty mouse. You know, the,

147
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.450
the caveat was that he never beat anybody like John Jones beat it.

148
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:12.730
Wasn't the same caliber a fighter. It wasn't a DC.

149
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.770
And then when he lost a Henry, Sahuto he go well, and by the way, super close,

150
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.400
decision loss. They're close could have gone either way.

151
00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:23.560
They're close could have gone to mighty mouse. So you loss is a loss.

152
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.400
Loss is a loss. It's like I see Demetrious Johnson and mighty mouse and,

153
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.160
and uh, and John Jones as being an argument for number one. But after that,

154
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.480
there's no argument.

155
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.390
And especially in light heavyweight there's no argument's John Jones.

156
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.910
Everybody else can go pound sand. There's not is no one even close.

157
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.470
<v 1>I think John goes to heavyweight. Everybody's too.</v>

158
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.430
Although him him's DC at heavyweight is so much more interested than light

159
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:52.110
heavyweight. Cause DC knocks due to out man.

160
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.110
<v 0>Right. And John Jones, if he goes up,</v>

161
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.990
who knows if he will have the same cardio, who knows? If you have the same,

162
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.500
if he'll be as fast, there's something about guys going up like, look,

163
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.700
Luke Rockhold same, same story.

164
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.140
He goes up to light heavyweight and he's got all this extra bulk on him now.

165
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.380
See, I don't think John's.

166
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.540
<v 1>Gonna go up up to like two 40.</v>

167
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.340
I think he's gonna come in at a lean mean 2 25, 2 30.

168
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.140
Doesn't cut any weight. That's the way he dranked out anyways.

169
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.570
All he just does work.

170
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.091
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

171
00:08:22.091 --> 00:08:25.330
Maybe he just comes in and looks just like John Jones at light heavyweight.

172
00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:26.330
He just doesn't cut any weight.

173
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.850
<v 1>And that's all, I mean, I don't know about now, but he,</v>

174
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:30.610
especially back in the day when I was at Jacksons,

175
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:33.530
all he really did is go with heavyweights and raged.

176
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.050
<v 0>All 'em raggged Allem I'll tell you what, when he fought OS P I talked to, uh,</v>

177
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:39.970
Jackson afterwards and Greg was saying,

178
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.280
and I don't like the fact that he is been doing all this power lifting and,

179
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.720
and he goes, and I feel like that played a part in this fight. He got so jacked.

180
00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:50.160
He did get giant, but I, I didn't think that I felt,

181
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.400
I felt that it was OSP.

182
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.520
I feel like OSP rose the occasion. He's a dangerous guy.

183
00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:02.080
He's a super athletic guy. He's big. He's got a powerful left kick, you know?

184
00:09:02.081 --> 00:09:05.240
And he's an awkward fighter. OSP fights awkward and you up.

185
00:09:05.241 --> 00:09:06.240
And he catches you with a left.

186
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.120
<v 1>Hook. Paul explosive, impossible to take down. Typically he's a strong.</v>

187
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.160
<v 0>Joke guy, man. And.</v>

188
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:12.961
<v 1>You know, I don't know.</v>

189
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:15.950
Maybe we're just not giving these guys enough crew that's because I think cuz we

190
00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:19.030
think so high of John. Yes. Whenever it's close. I'm like, ah, God,

191
00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:21.670
John had an off night that's or maybe these guys are really.

192
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.750
<v 0>Good. I think OSP rose the occasion. I have a lot of respect for OSP.</v>

193
00:09:25.751 --> 00:09:28.630
When I look at that fight, I was saying, OSP fought a great fight.

194
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.390
And he fought with a broken arm. Okay.

195
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.910
He fought the entire last round with a broken arm and never even said,

196
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.500
had a thing about it. He was fighting with a broken forearm. He's a beast man.

197
00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:42.620
He's a beast. And that's why I think John didn't look so good in that fight.

198
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.580
I disagree that he didn't look good because of the weightlifting,

199
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.580
but I don't know him the way Greg Jackson.

200
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.900
<v 1>Is. He's the only caveat to that. And I don't wanna open this can of worms.</v>

201
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:53.780
That was also the first time he's been on a strict testing.

202
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.010
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that's what the nayayer of saying.

203
00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:59.570
Well that is the first time maybe little Pico wasn't around.

204
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.930
I don't know here. Here's my defense of that. Being a John Jones, Dick sucker,

205
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.690
even with P you can fill up anyone who he fights on whatever PDs you want.

206
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:12.090
He's still beating him. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; whatever he's doing. If,

207
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:13.490
whether he' is taking things or not,

208
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.560
you could give his fricking opponents &lt;affirmative&gt; as much as they want to.

209
00:10:17.561 --> 00:10:19.200
They're not beating him. That's a tough argument though.

210
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.680
<v 0>I don't know that test think. Yeah. I don't know if that's necessarily true.</v>

211
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.200
You fill up chiiago Santos full of antidrol 50.

212
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.880
He might run right to talking about the.

213
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.800
<v 1>Brazilian outside. Yeah, you might be right. He might might kick his head off.</v>

214
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.920
<v 0>He might throw some that pdoorbell.</v>

215
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.720
<v 1>Force spinning kick.</v>

216
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.720
<v 0>Yeah. Who knows man?</v>

217
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.190
<v 1>Who? I still think John, he just he's too smart, too technical. I don't know.</v>

218
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.630
I don't either look, but we don't and we don't have to know.

219
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.950
We don't have to know. Cause that testing is strict.

220
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.253
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

221
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:50.390
I think I legitimately believe that what he got was through tainted means and

222
00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:52.310
I don't even know if it was supplements. You know,

223
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:56.470
the big theory was that he got cocaine that was laced with creattine hope his

224
00:10:56.471 --> 00:11:00.420
cocaine get creatine. Apparently according to someone who I know,

225
00:11:00.421 --> 00:11:04.580
who really knows their, it was D I mean, this is not an ex, this is an expert.

226
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.420
He said, this is very common that when you buy cheap creatine, um,

227
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:14.340
cheap creatine often has other in it because you're buying it from China and

228
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:17.220
from other places that have unscrupulous mixing thing.

229
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:20.970
And I listen as one of the owners of on it. I know that this,

230
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.530
we never had our stuff test positive or steroids.

231
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.690
But what we did have is when we looked at the early batches of alpha brain,

232
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.610
we had it independently tested. You know, when we first,

233
00:11:30.611 --> 00:11:32.930
when Auby and I first opened on it,

234
00:11:32.931 --> 00:11:34.810
we didn't know what the we were doing in terms of,

235
00:11:34.811 --> 00:11:37.050
we hadn't run a supplement company before.

236
00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:38.640
And there was a lot of learning to do.

237
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.560
And one of the things that we learned was that when you're buying stuff and then

238
00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:45.200
you're having stuff mixed, the people that are mixing it,

239
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.400
if you don't get the very best people,

240
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.440
you're getting people that mix stuff that don't clean out their vats.

241
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.040
So you might get winds straw in there. You can get anything in there.

242
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.800
We never got that. I want, we never got steroids in ours,

243
00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:00.920
but probably cuz with the stuff we're buying is netropics, which are just, uh,

244
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.400
nutrients that enhance brain function. So the,

245
00:12:04.401 --> 00:12:06.920
the people that were selling stuff were selling similar things,

246
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.160
vitamins and the like, so,

247
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.950
but we did get our stuff tainted in a sense with other nutrients

248
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.590
that weren't supposed to be in there.

249
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.150
So then we had to do some investigation and then we figured out what the problem

250
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:18.770
was.

251
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.270
And we adjusted our methods and we changed the way we changed the people we work

252
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:23.870
with. And we, we did a lot of different things,

253
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.630
but if you're buying cheap creatine, that's what, that's what Coke dealers use.

254
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:31.590
Joe, why is he buying cheap? Creatine? Are you saying the Coke from Coke?

255
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.180
A shady dude. Yeah. He's by I New Mexico Coke.

256
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.100
I'm not saying he is you're you're a millionaire dude might be listen,

257
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.820
I've smoked some weed from some shady people preach and I'm a millionaire too.

258
00:12:41.821 --> 00:12:44.700
Preach people. Bring me some weed. If they're my friend, I'm like, all right,

259
00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:46.220
bro, we'll smoke some weed. You ain't lying.
