00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.480
The eighties and the fifties were the worst time for movies ever,

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.120
cuz it was just this kind of politically correct time.

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:11.560
Now in the fifties it was different. Cause that was just was society.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.440
Was that in the eighties it was self, it was, uh,

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.000
self censorship was going on. What started that? Well, it was just the, the,

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.150
the rise of political correctness after the seventies where everything was just

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.150
go as far as you can, then all of a sudden, uh, everything got watered down.

9
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.310
Uh,

10
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.670
in the seventies you had movies where it's like characters weren't necessarily

11
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.150
the hero. They were up,

12
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:39.070
but they were interesting characters and you sit down and you followed them,

13
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:44.060
whether it be Travis Bickle or Charlie rain and rolling thunder or Joe,

14
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.380
Peter Boyle's character and Joe, they weren't the heroes,

15
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.140
but you could even have heroes and they could die.

16
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.500
Meaninglessly at the end that that was actually considered a, a commercial, uh,

17
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.740
a commercial ending back in the seventies, cuz it just shows how, uh,

18
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.650
you can't win. Everything's. You just can't win. It's just the way it is.

19
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.970
You go and you fight in Vietnam,

20
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.490
you survive Vietnam and you get shot in a liquor store during a holdup. Um,

21
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.610
everything was cynical then all of a sudden in the eighties,

22
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.210
all that was washed away.

23
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.370
And the most important thing about a character was that they were likable and

24
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.840
that was the, every character had to be likable.

25
00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:27.840
And the audience had to like everybody and even a movie that pushed the envelope

26
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.720
and tried to do Chancey things. Well,

27
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.320
it could do it for about an hour &lt;laugh&gt; then the last 20 minutes would be them

28
00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:39.720
literally going back on everything they did the first hour apologizing it and

29
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.080
you know, making everything fine.

30
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.910
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and just I'll give you good example of that. Okay.

31
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:45.470
It's just like, okay.

32
00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:50.110
The critics always really preferred bill Murray movies

33
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.150
to Chevy chase movies. However,

34
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.030
it does seem as if the point of all the bill Murray movies is that he's this

35
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:03.660
kind of hip cool curmudgeon smartass guy who

36
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.620
in the last 20 minutes gets a transformation and

37
00:02:08.621 --> 00:02:12.340
becomes this nice guy. Yeah. And we're and,

38
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.060
and almost apologizes for who he was the entire movie,

39
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.180
you know, the whole rest of the movie before, uh, before that happened,

40
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.380
the Groundhog day stripes, stripes, Groundhog days,

41
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.930
SCR mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know the whole thing. I mean, when like,

42
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:31.210
like for instance stripes, how does he go from where Warren OS kick his kicks,

43
00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:33.050
his deservedly kicks his.

44
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.970
He deserves to get belly punched by Warren OS in that movie.

45
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.170
How does he go from being this incon classic? I don't give a about anything.

46
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.200
I get beat up by Warren OS to now he's ING the troops &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

47
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.160
And now he's getting their he's, you know,

48
00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:50.800
he is getting their army on during the, the parade.

49
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.480
And now he's like leading a secret mission and same thing with like, with,

50
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.360
with like with Groundhog day. I mean,

51
00:02:57.361 --> 00:02:59.600
does anybody really think a less sarcastic bill?

52
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.480
Bill Murray is a better bill Murray. I mean,

53
00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:06.280
maybe it's better for Andy McDowell, but not for us as the, as the viewer yet,

54
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.693
yet

55
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.080
Chevy chase movies don't play that.

56
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.760
Chevy chase is the same super silliest at the end of the movie

57
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.870
that he is at the beginning. He never changes in his stuff.

58
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.750
He's always like a bit of a Dick and is always completely sarcastic. I mean,

59
00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:29.830
unless they cast him playing a dope, like he is in the, the net, uh,

60
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.190
the vacation movies. But when he is playing like a Chevy character, he's uh,

61
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.390
you know, he never apologizes for who he is,

62
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.100
stays that way throughout the whole film. Even if there is a slight change,

63
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.180
that's not the whole point of the movie. Yeah.

64
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.220
Is like turning him into a nice cuddly guy. Have you ever worked with him? Nah,

65
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.420
I, I would. I'd love to.

66
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.020
<v 1>I'm a gigantic fan of his early work, like the fledge stuff.</v>

67
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.340
Interesting and Saturday live. And so.

68
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.180
<v 0>Muchs yeah. Oh, the whole first season is Saturday.</v>

69
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.130
I like pretty much all those early movies except for heavenly dog,

70
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:00.970
all those early movies.

71
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.090
<v 1>He seems today to be this like really uncomfortable person.</v>

72
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.610
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he seem, it's almost like, I,

73
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.370
it like too many people paid attention to him for too long mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

74
00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:13.650
and it freaked him out. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, I don't know him. Yeah. Yeah.

75
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:17.010
But when I see, you know, stories about him or interviews with him, I, or,

76
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.530
you know, any, any weird controversy that happens with him,

77
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.920
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, I'm a, almost like, I think the guy just got overwhelmed.

78
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.440
Yeah. And now he is just like, get the away from me, get the away. You know,

79
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.720
like everything is, get the away from me. It seems like. Yeah.

80
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.880
<v 0>Exactly. You know, but I'm a big fan.</v>
