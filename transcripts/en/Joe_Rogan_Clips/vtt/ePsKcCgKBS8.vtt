00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now, what is this GCU thing you did today? Uh.</v>

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.240
<v 1>It was just so they had me breaking down like,</v>

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.200
uh, archery and movies. So I did hunger games, um,

4
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.200
and they filmed my reaction and,

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.870
and got me like talking about if it was realistic. So I did Jeremy Renner.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.350
I did Robert ERO. Um, he was in God,

7
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.270
some terrible movie and I, I don't even think he, I,

8
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.510
I was kind surprised he was actually hunting with a bow in the movie. What.

9
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.150
<v 0>Movie was that? Oh, was that a movie with him and John Travolta. John Travolta?</v>

10
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:42.020
Yes. Yes, yes. And they had a fight. Yeah. John Travolta played like a Russian.

11
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.040
He, yeah.

12
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.780
<v 1>And he shot John Travolta shot an arrow at him.</v>

13
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.340
So Robert ERO was in a tree stand,

14
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.420
John Travolta shot and it stuck in the tree. Robert DERO jumped,

15
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.140
fell out of the tree and broke his bow.

16
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.460
And so then he like started crawling towards John Travolta for summer. Anyway,

17
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.210
they had me, but Robert DERO actually had a pretty good anchor.

18
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.090
I mean, he looked pretty good with the bow. Really?

19
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.010
He had a whi biscuit on there, which wasn't good, uh, for, for the rest.

20
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.410
But he was gonna shoot this bowl.

21
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.170
Like this five point bowl came out and he couldn't do it.

22
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.760
He like, I don't know what happened. He like, had he hesitated then drunk.

23
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.800
He felt bad. Something like that. I don't know what happened. Let me see this.

24
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:31.080
Jamie, do you have it's killing.

25
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.320
<v 0>Season? Yes. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

26
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.280
<v 1>It's pretty intense, right? That's not bad. No that's no, no, no. That's not it.</v>

27
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.720
I don't like that grip. He had a compound bow. Okay.

28
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.960
<v 0>Yeah. Oh, it's a different one. There you go.</v>

29
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.950
<v 1>Yeah. Right there. Oh.</v>

30
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.390
<v 0>Yes. Hey, he looks like, uh, look at.</v>

31
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.430
<v 1>Him. I know.</v>

32
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.230
<v 0>Yeah. So he is wearing flannel too. He went old school. His.</v>

33
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.870
<v 1>Radio went off and it spooked the bowl, but he,</v>

34
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.590
he jumped out and broke that bow. Yeah. So I.

35
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.510
<v 0>I did that one. So him and John Travolta were shooting arrows at each other?</v>

36
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.900
Yeah. How dumb was the movie? Did you get? It was terrible.

37
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.500
&lt;laugh&gt; it was terrible. Apparently the new Rambo is unbelievably bad.

38
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.580
<v 1>Yeah. We did Rambo too. Cause I said, I go,</v>

39
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:17.300
we have to do Rambo. I want to talk about when he,

40
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.260
do you remember when he had the exploding? Tiffany shot the guy. Yes. Yes.

41
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.940
That was awesome. &lt;laugh&gt; why.

42
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.130
<v 0>Is he upside down? He get caught in a trap. Oh Jesus.</v>

43
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.010
Look at John ALT's beard. Oh Jesus. It's he's Russian. Yeah.

44
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.570
How bad is his accent? Oh, no. Is he, is it atrocious? I'm sure.

45
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.810
Killing season. What is it again? On rotten tomatoes? Go to rotten tomatoes.

46
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.290
One. I wanna see a three. What does it get? Please tell me. It's like 13, 10%.

47
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.080
10. That's impressive. That's.

48
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.913
<v 1>Pretty low.</v>

49
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.600
<v 0>That's that's pretty high. Well, yeah. Should be a lot lower than that.</v>

50
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.480
We go. Hey, what happened? Uhoh oh, no. You shot me. Let me get up.

51
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.520
He's trying to get up. What is he doing? Oh. Oh, he hurt his ankle.

52
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.680
<v 1>I took one to the calf. Oh.</v>

53
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.520
<v 0>Did he? Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.880
<v 1>Looks like an arrow. I think. I don't know.</v>

55
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.680
<v 0>I wanted to hear his voice, so, so, but he's gonna be right there. Oh boy.</v>

56
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.280
It's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah.

57
00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:17.200
There's very few movies that depict, uh,

58
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.320
bow hunting correctly.

59
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.910
<v 1>Yeah. I didn't see any.</v>

60
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.110
<v 0>Uh, what is this? He's holding him. He's got the arrow there. You,</v>

61
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.350
you attack him before he draws running around hiding. Just shoot me.

62
00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:31.150
Just shoot me, Jay. Shoot me. Come. Just.

63
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.830
<v 1>You hear the listen to the Russian shoot the.</v>

64
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.740
<v 0>Oh boy, my God. Pull this. Stop that right now. I am. I cannot,</v>

65
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.780
I can't do this. That's no, no, no, no.

66
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.620
<v 1>The, the best form I saw in any of the movie that I,</v>

67
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.380
that I reviewed for him today was I think it's called brave.

68
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.100
It was an animated movie. Oh yeah. And the redheaded girl. She, the she not bad.

69
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.010
She actually had perfect form. Really?

70
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.250
<v 0>Yes. Oh, lemme see that. Is there a movie though?</v>

71
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.210
Where someone Bo hunts correctly?

72
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.890
I mean, is there one movie? Yeah. Right here.

73
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.530
<v 1>Let me see. I've watched her form when she.</v>

74
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.610
<v 0>Oh, here. They're teaching her how to shoot.</v>

75
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.480
<v 1>Yeah, I think so. Yeah. But you'll see her.</v>

76
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.200
She steps up the innocent. It's a confidence.

77
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.920
<v 0>Ah, the confidence.</v>

78
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.200
<v 1>The confidence. So, you know, she's gonna put, put it on the X.</v>

79
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.600
She is, watch this confidence and the attitude. See that she's pretty.

80
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.760
<v 0>Bossy. My kids did not like this movie.</v>

81
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.430
They watch for some weird movie for some weird reason.

82
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.830
<v 1>It's her. She needs her dress is too tight.</v>

83
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.390
See that Uhhuh back sun. I watch this

84
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.883
on the move.

85
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.030
<v 0>That's pretty.</v>

86
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.910
<v 1>Good. I know. But watch this last one.</v>

87
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.910
This one's Uhhuh &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. Right here.

88
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.653
<v 0>Dun, dun.</v>

89
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.000
<v 1>Look at this. Watch this form. And this is with a Broadhead</v>

90
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.510
with distractions. She's so focused.

91
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.790
The feather cut her face a little for some reason. Oh.

92
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.670
<v 0>I like how the arrows like a real arrow.</v>

93
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.220
<v 1>I know, but watch this.</v>

94
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.780
<v 0>Whoa, whoa. Look at this. Ah, she Robin hoods it.</v>

95
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.220
I know. Pretty impressive. See.

96
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.660
<v 1>That con that's so that's what I say. All the ones that I reviewed today.</v>

97
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.020
That's the best. That's.

98
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.740
<v 0>The best. Yeah. Look at her. Her release.</v>

99
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.660
<v 1>I know. See that follow through. Yeah. Follow.</v>

100
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.530
<v 0>Throughs. Excellent. Very sweet. But there's no movie where bow hunting.</v>

101
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.450
No is accurately depicted. I don't no movie. Mm-hmm no, I'm thinking.

102
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.410
I'm trying to think of a movie that even involves bow hunting. Um,

103
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.373
can you think of one?

104
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.600
<v 1>No. Not, not hunt. Not bow.</v>

105
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.280
<v 0>Hunting. No. I mean there's deliverance where he winds up hunting people.</v>

106
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.673
Remember? Yeah. Burt.

107
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.120
<v 1>Reynolds. I wanted to do that one bow, but they didn't have that today.</v>

108
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.960
They had walking dead. They had.

109
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.040
<v 0>That's ridiculous that they call that a bow. That's a gun. That's.</v>

110
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.870
<v 1>What I said. I said, I don't, I'm not it down with the crossbow. &lt;laugh&gt; and,</v>

111
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.030
and you got a rotten,

112
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.830
a rotten corpse head and a stopping an arrow. It's not a passthrough.

113
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.630
<v 0>Excuse me. Yeah.</v>

114
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.710
<v 1>It's outrageous. Yeah. Sticks in their head's.</v>

115
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.990
<v 2>The one, I don't know how we missed this,</v>

116
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:34.990
but Samuel Jackson plays in a movie called big game where I think he might have

117
00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:37.700
been secret service, protecting the president either way,

118
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.100
the plane crashes or something.

119
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:42.980
And he ends up with a kid and learning how to bow hunt to survive. Oh really?

120
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.660
Really? Yeah. It came out three or four years ago.

121
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.700
<v 0>Oh, this must have went straight to yeah.</v>

122
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.860
<v 1>It doesn't. I never heard of it, but.</v>

123
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.340
<v 0>I want they bow hunt to survive. I mean, now he's getting in a fight.</v>

124
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.490
<v 2>Yeah. I typed in bow hunting movies and this was the most recent one I think.</v>

125
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.310
Oh, that's hilarious.

126
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.090
<v 0>He jumps on a helicopter. I know. I.</v>

127
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.930
<v 2>Mean, there's one.</v>

128
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.770
<v 0>There's one for you. Stop. Stop that before I get brain damage. Yeah. I,</v>

129
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.890
but isn't it interesting? Like you would think that there would be a way to,

130
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.010
to make a movie that involves bow hunting. That would be interesting.

131
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.490
You'd think so. Yeah. Like the movie, like there's only a couple good pool.

132
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.960
Movies is like the hustle with, uh,

133
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.000
Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason and then the color money with Paul Newman and Tom

134
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:25.200
cruise, Tom cruise. Those are the big ones. Yeah. The, the,

135
00:07:25.201 --> 00:07:29.400
the color of money changed pool. Like when that movie came out in 1986,

136
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.120
it just literally pool exploded the same as in the 1960s.

137
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:36.240
When the hustler came out, pool exploded. Yeah.

138
00:07:36.241 --> 00:07:40.390
So pool had two like giant explosions where people really started going to pool

139
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:41.990
halls. They wanted to learn how to play pool. Good.

140
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.590
And then with the hunger games,

141
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.470
apparently a lot of people got into archery because of, uh, Jennifer Lawrence,

142
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.070
we got a beautiful woman shooting a bow. That's what I said. I go, you take.

143
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.870
<v 1>Looking like a badass. You. Yeah. Yeah. The confidence is a key,</v>

144
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:55.910
but you and she's hot. She's hot.

145
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.740
And then she's got a bow it's like 10 times hot. Both those.

146
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.573
<v 0>Things are good. Yeah.</v>

147
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.140
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; so, yeah. She and she,</v>

148
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.060
what was good with her was she could go from having the bow

149
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.180
to grabbing an arrow, to putting it on the string,

150
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.420
to shooting and like half a second. Yeah.

151
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.940
And just over I go, that's not easy to do.

152
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.600
<v 0>Well,</v>

153
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.210
she must have had had some serious training just to be able to pull that off on

154
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:22.720
film.

155
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.650
<v 1>Yeah. I think she,</v>

156
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.250
and I think she shot a Hoyt and I think she took lessons from a Hoyt shooter.

157
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:32.650
Oh. And same thing with even Rambo's old bow, I believe was a Hoyt. Really?

158
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.010
Yeah. That's hilarious. I know. But yeah, he, uh,

159
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.880
he had the exploding tip and the guy, the bad, I was shooting,

160
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.280
ran outta bulls with his gun, threw it down,

161
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.720
pulled his pistol out and was shooting a Rambo and Rambo just stood up there.

162
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:49.680
Just like, you're not gonna hit me. Oh.

163
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.680
<v 0>Here she is learning how shoot. Right. That's.</v>

164
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.080
<v 2>Not her, I guess. That's that's her coach teaching the reporter.</v>

165
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.680
<v 0>Oh. Oh. So this.</v>

166
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.640

167
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.000

00:09:01.001 --> 00:09:02.960
That's what I thought it was. I outta here with this. Yeah.

169
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.080
&lt;laugh&gt; but it's that did get a lot of people involved in archery. It did girls,

170
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:08.840
especially. Yeah. Yeah. Young girls.

171
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.320
<v 0>Apparently. Uh, what is her name? Gina Davis. Gina Davis is a big time. Archer.</v>

172
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:13.920

174
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.350
<v 0>I've seen that competitions. Right? Doesn't she? I think so. Yeah.</v>

175
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.790
She's done some target competitions. Yeah.

176
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.310
<v 1>And, uh, Ivanka Trump. Does she? I saw her with a bow before.</v>

177
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.950
<v 0>Well obviously Donald Jr is the biggest one in the family. Yeah.</v>

178
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.590
Donald Jr's a legit bow hunter. Yeah. He, uh,

179
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.150
he shot a giant bull in Colorado this year. Did.

180
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.220
<v 1>He? Yeah. Oh.</v>

181
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.100
<v 0>I didn't even know that. Yeah. Yeah. He sent it to Dudley.</v>

182
00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:39.380
He sent a picture of it to Dudley Duley. Show it to me on his phone.

183
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.220
Really big bull. Yeah. God, I didn't see that all see, see it shot.

184
00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:47.420
It's a great bull. Yeah. Wow. Huh? Yeah. He's a legit bow hunter. I mean,

185
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:50.420
that guy loves bow hunting. He hunts a lot. Yeah.

186
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.340
<v 1>No he's, he's definitely avid outdoorsman. I mean,</v>

187
00:09:54.341 --> 00:09:57.170
he's always putting up from, um, with his.

188
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.490
<v 0>He learned a lot from Dudley too. Did he? Yeah. Dudley taught him quite a bit.</v>

189
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.330
Mm. Gave him quite a bit of training. Yeah. Yeah.

190
00:10:04.331 --> 00:10:08.050
But there's not a single movie where someone goes bow hunting.

191
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.130
Like you would think that, that, that could be, I mean,

192
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.890
that could be a good movie. Is that gene Davis off the Olympic team? Oh.

193
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.440
Oh she a Olympic recurve. Yeah.

194
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:23.080
She tried out for the Olympic team. Yeah. Finished 24th out of 300 women. Not.

195
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.440
<v 1>Bad. Yeah. Those in, in the Olympics, you know, it's no compound.</v>

196
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.800
It's bows just like that. Wow. At seven,

197
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.920
I think it's 70 meters and they put 'em in there. Wow.

198
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.520
But you didn't find any of look.

199
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.950
<v 0>At her. Looks, super legit. Look at her form.</v>

200
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.470
I know her grip pan everything. Yeah.

201
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.190
<v 1>Those, they are such good shooters. It's amazing how good.</v>

202
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.350
<v 0>They get. Yeah. With tabs. I mean, it's crazy. Like you're,</v>

203
00:10:48.351 --> 00:10:51.390
you're shooting off your fingers. Yeah. And you're shooting really accurately.

204
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.110
Is she still doing it? That's what I was looking at.

205
00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:57.660
They made a video with her on funny or die. I see that video arch tricks.

206
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.740
Is this, it it's joke. You said,

207
00:10:59.741 --> 00:11:03.460
I don't know how much of it is real or it's for funnier di so I don't know what

208
00:11:03.461 --> 00:11:05.940
the context was a couple years old. She's got a gun too.

209
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.980
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; look at her.

210
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.660
So it's just so you don't actually get to see okay. Being silly.

211
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.260
So you form, there's a form. Yeah. Look at that.

212
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.890
<v 1>That, uh, we never saw Jennifer Lawrence practicing. That's what?</v>

213
00:11:20.891 --> 00:11:21.724
That's that video?

214
00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.450
<v 0>I she's practicing hiding.</v>

215
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.450
<v 1>I know. I wanna see.</v>

216
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:29.330
<v 0>It. Yeah. I mean, she obviously has got to have a lot of training. Yeah.</v>

217
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:33.610
The way she executes, you know, it seems cuz like, you know, when you see, uh,

218
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.690
ke Reeves in John wick, you're like, okay, that guy had some training. Yeah.

219
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.720
Shooting hundred percent. Yeah. There's no doubt about it. Yeah. You know.
