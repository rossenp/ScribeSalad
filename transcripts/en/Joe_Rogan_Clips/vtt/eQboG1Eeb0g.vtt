00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The general can experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.470
This is what I've always wanted to ask you about this.

3
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:08.490
Did you feel physically endanger when that was happening?

4
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:13.200
Because that was such a gigantic moment and so

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.360
terrifying for most Americans that we're now sure that the

6
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:21.510
government had access to our emails and our phone records and,

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.400
and it was all broken by by you and Snowden. And I wondered, like,

8
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.920
were you worried for your safety?

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.250
<v 1>Yeah, for sure. I mean, for one thing, you know,</v>

10
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:37.100
at the time we were living in a part of Rio that was very isolated.

11
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:40.610
We were living literally on a mountain in the middle of the woods.

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.040
And, you know, I had with me at all times, physically on my person,

13
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.930
14 or 15 thumb drives that contained hundreds of

14
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:55.550
thousands. If not more, I've never quantified it on purpose. You know,

15
00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.560
of the most sensitive documents possessed by the most powerful

16
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:04.220
government on the planet, the most secretive agency within that government.

17
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.670
And I would carry them on my person at all times. You know,

18
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:10.850
I would go to the supermarket and just start laughing because on my back would

19
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:14.930
be a backpack filled with, you know, top secret CIA and NSA documents.

20
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:19.430
And obviously there were a lot of people who wanted to get their hands on those

21
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:22.520
documents, not just the U S government to take them back,

22
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:25.070
or they realized at some point that that would be impossible,

23
00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:28.820
but other governments, um, non-government actors.

24
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.950
But then on top of that, you know,

25
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.560
every story that we were doing was affecting markets,

26
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:36.980
it was affecting diplomatic relations. So there was obviously a big,

27
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.400
big interest in a lot of intelligence agencies around the world and what I was

28
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:44.390
doing and, you know, felt monitored all the time.

29
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.990
Um, because I was, you know,

30
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.820
not like the kind of paranoid feeling of monitoring,

31
00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:53.450
but the actual being monitored is, has been confirmed by, uh,

32
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.520
in a lot of different ways. Um, but you know,

33
00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:58.730
the biggest concern at the time was that the U S government being the U S

34
00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:03.380
government got very bullying and very threatening and was explicitly and

35
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:08.150
implicitly, both in public and private making clear that if I left Brazil,

36
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.120
there was a good chance that they were trying to arrest me. I mean,

37
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:12.890
remember how extreme they were with Snowden.

38
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.530
They brought down the plane of the president of Bolivia when he was

39
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:22.100
coming back from Moscow on the suspicion that he might've been taking Snowden

40
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:25.490
with them. And he course he wasn't, but that's how extreme they were.

41
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.630
So I had to, I stayed in Brazil for about 10 months and didn't feel safe.

42
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.680
Leaving the justice department was telling my lawyers if he leaves and shows up

43
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:36.140
at any airport, we're going to arrest him.

44
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:38.360
And the Brazilian government was super protective of,

45
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.430
of us because a lot of that Snowden reporting revealed how the NSA

46
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:48.260
and the UK and Canada were spying on Brazilian institutions,

47
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.880
Brazilian oil companies,

48
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.560
the president of Brazil Dumor Dilma Rousseff the population. So in Brazil,

49
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:57.320
this reporting was looked at very favorably. And so the government,

50
00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:58.970
the Senate offered a lot of,

51
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.750
so I just felt very safe in Brazil and very unsafe elsewhere. Well.

52
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.010
<v 0>It's very nice that you felt safe in Brazil. It's very nice that they were, uh,</v>

53
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.690
were protecting you. Um,

54
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.380
do they have a history of monitoring their people the same way the United States

55
00:03:13.381 --> 00:03:14.214
does?

56
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.860
<v 1>Well? So, you know, as I referenced earlier, um, the history of Brazil,</v>

57
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.940
the recent political history is a really dark one,

58
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.590
but relevant to the U S the 1940s and 1950s, early 1960s.

59
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.940
They were building the first, really vibrant democracy in Latin America.

60
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.740
And they were steadfastly attempting to remain neutral and the endless

61
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.330
Soviet union U S cold war. But in 19 63, 19 64,

62
00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:46.890
they had this kind of center of that precedent that the U S thought was becoming

63
00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:50.670
a little too close to Moscow, a little bit too social S he, you know,

64
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.650
nothing communists, but just very kind of mild reforms like rent control and,

65
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.450
uh, land reform,

66
00:03:57.451 --> 00:04:02.370
and some nationalization of companies to try and assuage the really

67
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:05.160
brutal income inequality that has played the country forever.

68
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.160
And so the us government first under John Kennedy,

69
00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:09.270
and then under Lyndon Johnson,

70
00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:12.600
worked with right wing Brazilian generals to overthrow that democratically

71
00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:14.010
elected government violently.

72
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.090
And they imposed a military dictatorship for the next 21 years of which the

73
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:22.020
current Prezilians president desirable scenario was apart as an army captain.

74
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.280
And those are really dark days. You know, dissidents were murder,

75
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.010
journalists were killed and exiled. Um,

76
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.330
everybody was spied upon with the help of the CIA and

77
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:35.760
[inaudible] in the UK.

78
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.960
And so a lot of that kind of indoors that relationship between the CIA and the

79
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:43.110
Brazilian government, but since 19 8500 democratized,

80
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.910
it's kind of re it's become once again a model of a liberal democracy. So, no,

81
00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:51.510
I don't, no government in the world is obsessed with spying on the world.

82
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.190
Like the U S is. Um, but yeah, there's a pretty dark underbelly.

83
00:04:56.191 --> 00:05:00.480
Like there isn't any major country in Brazil of kind of like a deep state or an

84
00:05:00.481 --> 00:05:04.590
intelligence community, whatever you want to call it that definitely, you know,

85
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:07.380
uses the dark arts to maintain control over the population.

86
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.610
<v 0>When you hit send, when you finally released, when you,</v>

87
00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:15.990
when you put that story out, what was the feeling like? Was there ever a, oh,

88
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.460
what have I done moment?

89
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.360
<v 1>No, there's probably should have been.</v>

90
00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:24.240
And if I were like healthier from a mental health perspective,

91
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:28.770
there would have been a bigger one of those, but, you know, it was,

92
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.430
we were, I was in Hong Kong, first of all, you know, we had flown there to meet,

93
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.470
to meet Snowden. Um, and I wasn't sleeping at all.

94
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:39.630
I mean, obviously I knew it was, you know,

95
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.630
going to be one of the biggest stories of, of that generation,

96
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:47.010
if not the biggest. Um, and I had spent years, Joe, you know,

97
00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:48.780
like writing about the NSA and, you know,

98
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:53.400
kind of trying to warn people that it seemed like it was being a lot

99
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:57.920
more invasive and a lot more aggressive about

100
00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:01.370
monitoring our private communications and our private activities domestically

101
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.380
than either the law permitted or anyone knew.

102
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.660
But it was very difficult to sound that alarm,

103
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.060
because everything was done behind a wall of secrecy.

104
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.140
And so when I finally got these documents in my hand, you know,

105
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:15.560
it was like the dream, right? It's why you go into journalism.

106
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:19.040
But especially for me to be able to show the world that everything was so much

107
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:23.690
more extreme than even I thought that I just wanted to get them out in the world

108
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:27.110
as soon as possible, like any delay at all on the part of the guardian,

109
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:30.590
which was the newspaper with which I was working at the time and reporting,

110
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.740
you know, drove me into a rage. Um,

111
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.820
I just felt like the world deserved to see these documents. And also, you know,

112
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:42.200
I was so inspired by, by, by Snowden. I mean,

113
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:46.250
you've talked to him, I think twice now. So, you know, like, you know,

114
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:50.300
he's this 29 year old kid at the time who pretty much gambled,

115
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:53.450
we thought 95% likelihood, he was going to end up in prison,

116
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.000
not for a few years, but for the rest of his life.

117
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.410
And like not in a nice prison,

118
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:00.500
but in the kind of person that you go and when they accuse you of jeopardizing

119
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:01.730
American national security,

120
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.290
but he did it because he believed in the cause like that was not the reason.

121
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.790
Like not the movie script. He like, that was his genuine, which shocked me,

122
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:14.660
right. It was this jaded reporter who kept looking for the real motive,

123
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.880
but that was it. There was no other motive.

124
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.020
And so I just felt like I owed him such a duty and kind of inspired by his

125
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:23.090
example. I thought, you know,

126
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:26.990
if he's willing to go to prison for the rest of his life, um,

127
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.750
and he chose me to work with him, you know,

128
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:32.450
I kinda courage kind of became infectious. Um,

129
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.330
and we kind of adopted this trench bunker mentality.

130
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:38.780
Like we were in this together and we were going to fight everybody. Um,

131
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.280
and that became the energy much more.

132
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:43.610
And it kind of drowned out the fears that probably were rational for us to have.

133
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.880
<v 0>I felt very honored and very,</v>

134
00:07:48.881 --> 00:07:50.920
very fortunate to be able to talk to him.

135
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.730
And I think he's a very noble person,

136
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.780
unusually noble and you in long form conversations, if,

137
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.350
if there was any hint of something different,

138
00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:05.950
I really believe it would have leaked out. He really is that guy.

139
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.780
And I think history when we look upon this case, I mean,

140
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.210
the documentary was pretty excellent. Um,

141
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.890
that showed all the moments leading up to you releasing the story.

142
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.350
But I think these conversations with him,

143
00:08:20.351 --> 00:08:25.240
I just feel very fortunate to have that platform where he's willing to come on

144
00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:30.040
and talk for hours at a time and express his thoughts on just on

145
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:34.690
spying in general national security issues and all of these situations that

146
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:39.790
he faced, uh, up to. And now, currently, because of that, and he's,

147
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.540
it's, it's a, it's a very,

148
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.620
it's embarrassing that this is the world that we live in.

149
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.030
This is the country that we live in, that,

150
00:08:49.031 --> 00:08:53.530
that man who I really genuinely believe is a hero is

151
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.920
now a Russian citizen forever.

152
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.060
<v 1>Yeah. Hopefully there's an opportunity. Um,</v>

153
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.960
just because of all the bizarre vindictive

154
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.090
impulses that Trump has, and the fact that by complete coincidence,

155
00:09:11.091 --> 00:09:15.620
the people who want snowed in to be in Russia forever or to

156
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.310
rot in prison happened to be Trump's enemies as well.

157
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.500
That I'm hoping there's an opportunity to persuade Trump after the

158
00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:26.210
election, particularly if he loses,

159
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:29.750
but even if he doesn't that he should follow through on what he's now twice

160
00:09:29.751 --> 00:09:33.200
bizarrely raised on his own, which was the prospect of pardoning Snowden.

161
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.160
It's something probably my top priority in the world at the moment.

162
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.750
And the reason is, is what you just said, which is, is, you know,

163
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.620
w we, we we're, we're,

164
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:49.580
we're so accustomed to people doing things for are, uh,

165
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.100
just missing sky. Did reasons, corrupted reasons, um,

166
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.120
people lying and deceiving about why they're doing things about presenting a

167
00:09:59.121 --> 00:10:03.530
false version of who they are. And that's the thing is, you know,

168
00:10:03.531 --> 00:10:07.040
you talk to them for those hours. When I got to Hong Kong, you know,

169
00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:09.620
before becoming a journalist, I was a litigator in Manhattan,

170
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.130
and I used those skills. You know, I CA I mean,

171
00:10:13.131 --> 00:10:16.580
I kind of created a little mini Guantanamo where I just like put them in front

172
00:10:16.581 --> 00:10:19.940
of me and just question them for eight hours, straight, three different,

173
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.271
you know,

174
00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:23.480
three straight days without letting you even have a glass of water or go to the

175
00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:27.470
bathroom, because I really wanted to know what was actually motivating him,

176
00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:32.090
who was this person to whom I was about to tie myself and my reputation and

177
00:10:32.091 --> 00:10:36.980
credibility eternally. And he really is somebody who,

178
00:10:36.981 --> 00:10:38.720
you know, and like the thing about it too, it's like,

179
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.700
that's so amazing about it is that oftentimes people who leak secrets or who

180
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.550
become a source that, you know,

181
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:51.530
wants to expose secrets and are willing to go to prison are often kind of

182
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.210
up people, right? They're like alienated from society. Um,

183
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.720
they feel persecuted and mistreated.

184
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.530
They don't have much going on in their lives and therefore don't feel like they

185
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:06.320
have a lot to risk. Noting was exactly the opposite. You know,

186
00:11:06.321 --> 00:11:10.310
he had at the time, this incredibly beautiful and brilliant girlfriend,

187
00:11:10.311 --> 00:11:13.250
who today is his wife. They had been together for years.

188
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.650
And in order to do what he did, he had to deceive her.

189
00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:18.590
He had to leave the country and not tell her what he was doing,

190
00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:22.340
because he wanted to make certain that when the government knocked on her door,

191
00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:26.300
she could truthfully say she knew nothing about it because he knew they would go

192
00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:31.160
after her. If, if, if they could hire to it. Um, he had a great job.

193
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.830
He was making a lot of money. You know, he was a high school dropout,

194
00:11:33.831 --> 00:11:38.120
but had taught himself these really coveted skills.

195
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.370
Um, so we had a great career ahead of him,

196
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.850
a mother and a father who both love him, very stable home life.

197
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.430
He had none of those traits, you know,

198
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:49.370
that typically are used to demonize people who do this,

199
00:11:49.371 --> 00:11:52.430
which is why I knew he was going to be gold from a media perspective.

200
00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:56.050
And to be able to prevent the government from that demonizing him in the way

201
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:59.080
they like to do. But more importantly than that, like leaving aside,

202
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:02.650
all the perception stuff and all the PR and media stuff, you know,

203
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:05.050
he's probably the person or one of the people,

204
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:08.950
certainly I admire most in this world in all the time I've lived.

205
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.480
And what's so unbelievable. You know, people always say to me, oh, poor Snowden.

206
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:16.180
You know, he's trapped in Russia. He can't come home.

207
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:19.060
He's facing multiple felony charges. He's been separated from his,

208
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.670
all of which is true. But like,

209
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.350
I also always say that he's the person who I know in this world who,

210
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:31.210
when he puts his head down on his pillow at night, he falls asleep most easily.

211
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.010
Um, because there's something about knowing that you,

212
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.970
you face this dangerous choice and you chose the right thing. I mean,

213
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:42.430
in Hong Kong, as I said, we were never, I was never sleeping.

214
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.220
My colleague or Poydras was never sleeping.

215
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.760
We were sleeping like an hour or two with the aid of very strong sleep

216
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.740
narcotics. And, you know, he would say like at nine 30, he would yawn.

217
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.020
He would say, okay, guys, I think I'm going to hit the hay.

218
00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.970
Like he had no care in the world. Um, and that was, I was like, what the?

219
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.790
And he would like to see for eight hours, you know, and he would wake up,

220
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:08.050
have a little coffee. Um, but that's what that, you know,

221
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.160
clean conscience does to a person, even.

222
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.030
<v 0>With a clean conscious,</v>

223
00:13:12.031 --> 00:13:16.200
I just don't understand the weight of the stress that he was under,

224
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.510
how I don't understand how he could be so calm.

225
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.570
<v 1>He, I mean, he, he didn't have stress. That's, what's so bizarre. I mean,</v>

226
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:29.070
you saw on the film right in the documentary citizen four where like, you know,

227
00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:31.710
if we wait, cause we were, we had no idea what the CIA knew.

228
00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:33.390
We had no idea what the Chinese government, we knew.

229
00:13:33.391 --> 00:13:36.750
We had no idea what Hong Kong authorities knew. We were waiting.

230
00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:40.740
I was always waiting for the door to be kicked in at any moment, you know, and,

231
00:13:40.741 --> 00:13:43.110
and for him, at least if not the rest of us, you know,

232
00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:45.690
me and Laura to be taken away. Um,

233
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.780
and like I said, I mean,

234
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.440
our working assumption the whole time was that there was, you know,

235
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.700
as excited as I was the one thing that was kind of a dark cloud that hovered

236
00:13:56.701 --> 00:14:01.050
over it all the time was that this person who I had now become connected with

237
00:14:01.051 --> 00:14:04.530
and developed an admiration for, I was certain at any moment,

238
00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:07.350
he was going to be in the hands of the us government.

239
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.090
And the next time I would see him would be on television in an orange jumpsuit

240
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.190
and shackles and a courtroom,

241
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.890
getting ready to be sentenced to like 50 years in prison.

242
00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:18.150
And one of those hellholes,

243
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.110
you have the U S specializes in where you spend 23 and a half hours a day alone

244
00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:24.750
in your cell. Um, and you have 30 days,

245
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.520
30 minutes a day where you get to walk in a little room in the sun to satisfy

246
00:14:29.521 --> 00:14:32.910
legal requirements. And that was going to be him for the rest of his life.

247
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.560
He got very lucky. I mean, he almost did end up that way. So for me,

248
00:14:37.561 --> 00:14:40.000
I was concerned for him stress for him,

249
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.520
but he was at peace with the fact that that was the path he

250
00:14:44.521 --> 00:14:47.190
chose. I mean, it wasn't like, you know,

251
00:14:47.191 --> 00:14:50.760
and that was really important for me to know that he had thought through all the

252
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.310
likely consequences.

253
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:56.930
I didn't want to feel like I was using somebodies work

254
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:57.764
product,

255
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.880
who hadn't given full thought to what it is that they had gotten themselves

256
00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:05.340
into. And it was only once I became very, you know, he,

257
00:15:05.341 --> 00:15:08.480
he could fight the statutes with which they were going to charge him and what

258
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:11.510
the legal defenses that were available were.

259
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:13.760
So he had given extreme thought to this,

260
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:17.870
he's an adult and he made that choice and it was amazing to this very day.

261
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:19.430
He's completely at peace with it.

262
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.150
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>
