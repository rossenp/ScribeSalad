1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. My pleasure. So tell me what's up. Are we in trouble?</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.240
What's going on, man? It's world war three. Haven't you heard? Is.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.560
<v 1>It oh no, no, it's not. No, I'm no, I'm here to burst that bubble. I think. Um,</v>

4
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.410
not that anyone's going to say. Okay. I, I I'm writing this down. Like I said,

5
00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:18.860
no world war three. Uh, but it was, it was amazing how,

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.820
how fast the I'll put that closer there. It was amazing how fast the, uh,

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.790
the narrative came out. Anatomy we'd barely smoked, uh,

8
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.380
Subramanian and suddenly, uh, the current president's going to get us into this,

9
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.430
this, uh, conflict. And I was nervous. Well,

10
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:37.280
I think everybody stepped back because it was such a shock to the system. Right.

11
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.740
We had, I mean, what was the last time we dealt with Iran in this fashion?

12
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.850
I mean, as opposed to like a harshly worded DeMar or a note,

13
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:48.680
or maybe an extra sanction here or there, but that it was such a strange,

14
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.780
um, uh, development that I think it did. And the natural reaction was to say,

15
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:57.110
oh my God, here we go. You know? And certainly everybody's exhausted from,

16
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.370
you know, 19 years out there. So, but you know.

17
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.410
<v 0>It was a shock that Trump could make that call because they had a bunch of</v>

18
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:09.770
different options. They had like, or we could kill him. He's like,

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.633
let's kill him.

20
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.270
<v 2>I was like, whoa, I didn't know. You could do that. Well, you know what, he's,</v>

21
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:16.970
he's been a target before Sumani.

22
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.540
<v 1>Is, I mean, it's, there's, I guess I should first say, um,</v>

23
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.900
where I stand on all this, which is I'm, I'm not mourning his, uh, his,

24
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:25.970
his passing, right? I mean, I think he deserved it.

25
00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:28.700
I think it was justice that should have been served up sometime ago.

26
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:30.500
He's responsible, not just, not just war,

27
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.940
as people have talked about the hundreds of, of a us serviceman, uh,

28
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.380
but thousands and thousands of people. This guy was a completely, uh,

29
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.950
bloodthirsty. I mean, there's no way about it and it, and it was,

30
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.520
and we're talking about the second most, um, structure wise,

31
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:49.430
the second most important person within the Iranian machine next to the,

32
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:53.780
I told her. So, but the idea that somehow we took out a foreign leader,

33
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.060
right. Or a military general, like he was some sort of, you know,

34
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.900
Eisenhower, uh, is insane. The guy was a mob boss. He was,

35
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:05.090
he was the head terrorist for a state.

36
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:08.240
That is the number one sponsor of terrorism around the world.

37
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.720
And so, but he's been on,

38
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.790
on target lists for a long time. You go back to, I think 2008,

39
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:20.630
there was an operation to take out a guy named Mugnier, who, uh,

40
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.490
himself was also a bloodthirsty psychopath. And, um,

41
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.930
he was running Hezbollah operations. So the Israelis, uh,

42
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.850
I'd been tracking him as had we, um, and, uh,

43
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:38.570
at one point they had an opportunity to take out McNeil and also uh Sulaymani

44
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.140
and they backed off at the time. Um,

45
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.560
essentially because the U S wouldn't get behind the idea that we're going to

46
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:47.660
take out Soleimani. That was, you know, at that point.

47
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.370
And that was a step too far. So they eventually, we got Magonia. Um,

48
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.160
but Soleimani is just, I mean,

49
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:57.950
I don't even know where to start with the amount of blood that he he's

50
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:01.480
responsible for. Um, people talk about again, okay.

51
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.920
He authorized operations and activities in Iraq against us soldiers and against

52
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:10.030
Iraqi soldiers and Iraqi civilians. But it goes back to the beginning of that.

53
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.361
I mean,

54
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:15.250
you could go back to 2003 and Sue

55
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.710
Amani was, he was the architect.

56
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:22.360
He dreamt up this idea as the us was going into Iraq that,

57
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.180
um, he was going to, I mean, what he did was insane. He basically authorized,

58
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:29.260
I mean, he's in charge, right?

59
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:32.200
So he authorizes the release of a bunch of SUNY's that they've been holding

60
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.180
onto, around being shot. Um, arch rivals being the Sunni's essentially,

61
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.910
um, and the Saudis are, are their arch enemy, a SUNY nation. And,

62
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.890
but he released all these Sunni extremists that Iran had been holding on to, uh,

63
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.620
essentially ever since we had gone into Afghanistan right after nine 11,

64
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.810
and he released them into Iraq,

65
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.820
including a guy named [inaudible], who became the head of Al Qaeda in Iraq.

66
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.780
And within a few months of our getting out to Iraq,

67
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.280
the, uh, the Sunni's, uh, under basically under Sewell monies to tillage,

68
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.510
uh,

69
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.830
had a series of bombings and started bombing everything from Shia mosques to,

70
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.090
uh, UN facilities, uh, Jordanian embassy, a variety of targets,

71
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.040
killing thousands of Shiites. Now he's a Shiite, right?

72
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.050
So this is how bad this guy is.

73
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.450
He goes into Iraq with this plan that I'm going to push the Shiite in

74
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:32.560
Iraq to Iran. I'm going to, I'm going to make them come to us for protection,

75
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.220
for coverage. Essentially, we can write in there because he, what does he want?

76
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:39.640
He wants to exert their influence within Iraq. He doesn't want a strong Iraq.

77
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:43.720
He doesn't want the U S and they're building a strong stable Iraq. I mean,

78
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.380
you go back to the Iran, Iraq war, where Sumani started his military career,

79
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.760
and, you know, he's not, he, there's no way that he's a true believer.

80
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:54.580
There's no way he's ever going to let a rock become stable again.

81
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.920
And he's insane enough that he kills thousands of shy his

82
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:03.880
own people, right. In order to push, um,

83
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.420
the Shiite population in Iraq to Iran.

84
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.250
I know if I'm like being eloquent enough, but false flag operations,

85
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:13.030
who is he blaming.

86
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.600
<v 2>The islands? The Sunni's it's, the Sunni's are doing Sunni extremists. Yeah.</v>

87
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.811
<v 1>But,</v>

88
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:21.670
but he's authorized and he's pushed them into Iraq to do this under.

89
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.420
And so he's,

90
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.340
he was always very unusually capable at walking a fine

91
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:31.730
line between, uh, his own, uh, she,

92
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.140
uh, believes population. And at times,

93
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.440
being able to be sort of a puppet master for Sunni extremist when it suited his

94
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.970
cause. And it's, I mean, it's, it's anyway, it's fascinating stuff.

95
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.010
And whether it was dealing with, um, Hezbollah, you know, Palestinian,

96
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:52.930
Islamic, jihad, whomever, he, uh, again,

97
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:55.420
I keep going back to the same thing. He deserved what he got,

98
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.140
no doubt in my mind. Um, and I'm just surprised it didn't happen sooner.

99
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.950
Maybe not from us, but from others. They just, it, back in October,

100
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.830
the Iranians, you know, claimed that they foiled, uh,

101
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.360
an assassination attempt against Soleimani by Israel and some unnamed Arab

102
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.220
agents. So it's not as if we just plucked his name out, you know,

103
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:19.960
he'd spent two decades, you know, engaged in,

104
00:06:19.961 --> 00:06:23.620
in death and mayhem. Now.

105
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.240
<v 0>The take on him dying has not been like the take on Baghdadi and Baghdadi.</v>

106
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.660
One of the most disturbing things that I saw was the Washington post called him

107
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:35.890
in his store, religious scholar. Did you, did you see that? Yeah,

108
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.960
when that guy died, they called them in the store,

109
00:06:37.961 --> 00:06:42.850
religious scholar and people that I've talked to that understand who

110
00:06:42.851 --> 00:06:47.740
he was and what was going on. There were fuming. They were like, what is this?

111
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:52.300
Not who the wrote this? Right. You're talking about a terrorist,

112
00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:54.610
a real legitimate murderous terrorist.

113
00:06:54.611 --> 00:06:57.040
And you're calling them in a store religious scholar.

114
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.280
<v 1>Right. You're giving them this credibility that I don't understand that either.</v>

115
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.410
I saw that. And I talked to a handful of people who, um, you know,

116
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:07.450
kind of leaned in that direction. And, and, and,

117
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.060
and also you get the same thing with Sulaymani. Now. I don't want money.

118
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:13.180
I can understand he's wrapped in the cloak of a, of a military uniform. And,

119
00:07:13.181 --> 00:07:17.950
you know, people saw him sitting next to the Ayatollah and that okay. Uh,

120
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.840
but I look at it the same way. There's this is not a assassinating,

121
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.830
a foreign leader. This is not assassinating, a, a revered scholar. This is, uh,

122
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.120
taking out, uh, uh, terrorists, bloodthirsty terrorists,

123
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:36.070
who have a long track record of, of killing people. And, and, and it's not,

124
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.490
he was, he was not, uh, you know, he was not choosy, right.

125
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.440
Which it was still Amani. We're talking about again, uh, Iraqis, humanities,

126
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.510
um, uh, you know, Syrians, um, his own people.

127
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.640
We, you know, they,

128
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.880
they talk about maybe some 1500 or so protesters being killed in Iran,

129
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.070
uh, in the past few months,

130
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.950
as a result of the protests against the Iranian regime,

131
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.760
primarily because of corruption. You know, the,

132
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:04.440
the fact that they've driven that economy into a toilet, uh,

133
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.500
at the expense of the Iranian people, a lack of,

134
00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:12.040
of rights of any sword and pseudo Mani, again, as the head of the goods force,

135
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.430
you know, the number two person there he's responsible. So I,

136
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:18.760
I don't understand anybody who doesn't just say. Yeah.

137
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.190
And I think the left had a hard time with it to hard left.

138
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.830
You saw them spinning a little bit saying, okay,

139
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:27.250
we don't say he shouldn't have gotten it. We don't say he didn't deserve it,

140
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.890
but, and then they had to try to figure out some way to,

141
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.640
because it's all gotta be about politics now. So bring it back to the president.

142
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.150
<v 0>Trump, whenever Trump does anything, even if what he does is fantastic,</v>

143
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.080
they can't get behind it.

144
00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:40.990
They almost have to get a go against things that are great.

145
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.170
Like if the economy is great, they've got to find a reason why it's bad.

146
00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:48.100
The economy is great. If it's his decisions lead to something positive,

147
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.220
they can't accept it. That's unfortunate.

148
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.620
<v 1>Well, we've lost ability to, uh, I think to look at things, um,</v>

149
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.100
just in an objective fashion, in any sense of the word objective,

150
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:01.470
or certainly when we don't have civil conversations anymore. But,

151
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.920
but the idea that we can look at and separate the politics from it, look,

152
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:08.130
I know, you know, again, I don't care whether people like Trump or not. I don't,

153
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.050
I, you know, I didn't vote for him.

154
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:12.360
I don't meet him necessarily care for the individual,

155
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.030
but that doesn't mean I can't like policies.

156
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.460
And whether you're talking about what's going on with Iran,

157
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:18.420
whether you're talking about, you know,

158
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:21.600
the way that we've been dealing with China lately, um, other issues, I,

159
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.410
you know, Hey, I liked, I liked, uh, president Obama.

160
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.700
Didn't like his policies, you know, I don't necessarily like Trump.

161
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.620
I like his policies. I don't want, I don't see any conflict there. Yeah. But.

162
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.360
<v 0>Anyway, no, I don't see any conflict there. Either being,</v>

163
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:37.580
people are complicated. And I just,

164
00:09:37.581 --> 00:09:39.920
I just didn't know that Trump could make the call.

165
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.800
Like he could be the guy that goes, take him out. Like when, when,

166
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.270
when I thought that was like,

167
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.710
there was probably a panel of military leaders and like really important people

168
00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:52.430
that understand the ramifications, a lot of game show hosts, like.

169
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.630
<v 2>An America's got talent or something for people sitting there as a buzzer,</v>

170
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.260
I felt like it would be like some thing that they would discuss.

171
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.350
<v 0>That the Trump would be like, yeah, option three, them.</v>

172
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.200
<v 1>And there is a great deal of conversation that goes on.</v>

173
00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:08.280
Not necessarily with the president, you know, I,

174
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:12.110
I have no idea how he processes his information. Um,

175
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.140
but there's a great deal of conversation and discussion that goes on in the

176
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:19.250
Pentagon, within the Intel community and, and national security council. Um,

177
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.521
you know,

178
00:10:19.521 --> 00:10:22.040
what happens once they lay out these options in front of the president?

179
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:27.140
You know, I don't have a clue, but, um, he does have that authority.

180
00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:28.850
He's got that ability. And president Obama had that authority,

181
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.900
president Obama took out, remember us citizens, um, you know, the, who would,

182
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.550
you know, overseas in, uh, in the middle east. And there were, you know,

183
00:10:37.551 --> 00:10:40.100
there was a human cry over the sort of the, the legality of it,

184
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.780
but you didn't see a lot of people saying, you know, in part, okay. I admit,

185
00:10:44.781 --> 00:10:48.280
because it wasn't, again, this, you know, Sulaymani is wrapped in a cloak of,

186
00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:49.580
of his military uniform.

187
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:49.910
<v 0>And it's all,</v>

188
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.090
so people were very concerned about this possibility of what's going to war with

189
00:10:53.091 --> 00:10:56.570
Iran and they think that this might have started that off.

190
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.370
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I think, um,</v>

191
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:03.590
what changed the calculus here is Iran is, you know,

192
00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:07.340
the regime is brutal and awful. They're not crazy.

193
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.970
And the one thing they want more than anything else is to retain power,

194
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.080
that's it. And I think they looked at the idea of a, of a military conflict,

195
00:11:15.081 --> 00:11:17.780
a direct military conflict with the U S and this is not to say that their

196
00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:22.070
proxies won't strike out at us someplace around the world at some point. Um,

197
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.000
but the, the regime looked at that and thought, nah, you know what,

198
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.210
we're not going to do this in, in part because you know,

199
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:32.810
the killing of Soleimani is important on a much bigger level than just taking

200
00:11:32.811 --> 00:11:37.640
out, you know, a, uh, a, uh, a terrorist of his stature.

201
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.980
Um, it's important for deterrence purposes. And so, you know, again,

202
00:11:42.981 --> 00:11:46.280
I think they looked and felt like the calculus in dealing with the us has

203
00:11:46.281 --> 00:11:49.730
shifted now, and they don't understand it. They're not comfortable with it.

204
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.530
And also they can't afford it. Like w if we got in the military conflict,

205
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:54.550
that was just the idea that, you know,

206
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.520
somehow we were going to get in world war three, it would be over in an evening.

207
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.770
Literally it would be over in one night,

208
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.630
we have the ability to take out their entire energy infrastructure. Um,

209
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.560
their missile bases, their key military facilities.

210
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.600
And I don't want to oversimplify this, but after that first night's activity,

211
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.620
that's it they're done. So the idea that somehow there's going to be now,

212
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.630
does that mean that, you know, we should do that. Of course not,

213
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:23.380
nobody wants a military conflict, but, you know,

214
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.920
and again, there would be knock-on repercussions, et cetera, et cetera.

215
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.700
So hopefully we can sort this thing out through now that we're doing the

216
00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:33.400
military deterrence and they understand that we're serious,

217
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.290
we've got the economic pressures,

218
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.910
we've got diplomatic pressure primarily to keep them isolated. I think,

219
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:42.040
you know, I think we're on the right track with, with Iran.

220
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.600
I think we're gonna see a different reaction.

221
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.490
<v 0>From them. Well,</v>

222
00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:49.140
I was a little bit relieved when they attack back and just sort of like

223
00:12:49.141 --> 00:12:53.400
launched missiles on the outside of basis. Nobody died. I was like, okay.

224
00:12:53.401 --> 00:12:55.920
So it seems like this is almost like they're,

225
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.280
they're making a signal like they're attacking,

226
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.900
but they're not really doing anything.

227
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.230
<v 1>I think there was an optic to it. I think you're right, absolutely.</v>

228
00:13:04.231 --> 00:13:06.500
That they felt like they had to do something. Yeah.

229
00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:09.660
I told this guy that I don't know what he called saving face or not, but, um,

230
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.290
you know, and the, and we had a warning, we have warning ahead of time.

231
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.330
<v 0>And didn't, they print in their paper.</v>

232
00:13:15.331 --> 00:13:18.570
Didn't they say that they killed a bunch of people. They did the missile attack.

233
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:18.810
Yeah.

234
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.990
<v 1>They claimed about 80 or so I think keeps them right, exactly.</v>

235
00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:24.540
Just do whatever it takes. But then, I mean, you know, and,

236
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:28.950
but look at the reaction that we've had, you know, of course the Ukrainian, uh,

237
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:34.050
commercial passenger jet, uh, went down, um, and that was them,

238
00:13:34.051 --> 00:13:36.570
right? Oh, that was, that was definitely them. Uh.

239
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.540
<v 0>When do you think that they shot it down because they thought it was a us</v>

240
00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:40.374
military plane.

241
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.070
<v 1>Yeah. It was an it, look, this is it. This it's not unprecedented. I mean,</v>

242
00:13:44.071 --> 00:13:46.980
we shut down an Iranian passenger jet years and years ago. Right.

243
00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:49.990
The Russians shot down and they still won't admit to it, but they shut down a,

244
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.680
uh, uh, passenger jet over Ukraine. Uh, yeah. What, uh,

245
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:59.430
just a handful of years ago that, which they still won't admit to. Um, it's,

246
00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:02.550
it's human error and it's human error in a conflict zone in a,

247
00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:03.600
in a situation where there's,

248
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.410
there's a lot of moving parts and it's never going to be a zero risk game.

249
00:14:07.411 --> 00:14:11.520
So if the Iranians had done this as tragic as it is and come out and said,

250
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.570
oh my God, we, you know, we did this okay, where this, you know,

251
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.280
it would have been horrific, but they, um, you know,

252
00:14:20.281 --> 00:14:23.160
they did this to themselves because they just couldn't bring themselves to be

253
00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:27.720
truthful. Uh, they've got a long track record of not, uh, and so they,

254
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.280
they engaged in this and, and shut it down.

255
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.370
When you find missile debris in a, uh,

256
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.850
in a field where you're doing an investigation of a plane crash,

257
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.180
that's a pretty good indication. And then there's the video on top of that?

258
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.780
Well, there is a video of the missile hitting the plane. Yeah. Two missiles. Oh,

259
00:14:45.781 --> 00:14:48.600
Jesus Christ. 30 seconds support, roughly 30 seconds apart.

260
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.420
<v 0>So two missiles to down a plane. Yeah. It.</v>

261
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.810
<v 1>Hit the first one, uh, the first one hit. Um, and then about 30 seconds later,</v>

262
00:14:56.811 --> 00:15:00.770
not quite 30 seconds later, the second missile hits, um, there's a,

263
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.040
another fireball and the plane stays up in the air for, you know,

264
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.970
a period of time just cause it's just, it's not devastated, but it's, it,

265
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.300
it was some 20 miles from the airport.

266
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.200
And it actually kind of made up as if it was turning back to the airport

267
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.630
probably right after that first missile hit. But here's the thing, uh, I mean,

268
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:24.020
that was, that's a tragic disaster right there. Right. But the idea that,

269
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:26.960
you know, somehow nobody's, nobody's actually saying they did it on purpose.

270
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:28.820
They didn't do it on purpose. They did it, it was an accident.

271
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:33.800
They mistook it for either an incoming missile, uh, or a hostile aircraft,

272
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:33.951
you know,

273
00:15:33.951 --> 00:15:38.300
coming in for a bombing run after they launched their ballistic missile strike.

274
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:44.060
So nobody's saying it was done on purpose. Um, but it's,

275
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.270
it's again, it's,

276
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.920
it's indicative of the revolutionary guard force. Um,

277
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:56.750
and the regime itself that they spent several days denying it and saying it was

278
00:15:56.751 --> 00:15:59.870
mechanical failure and pressuring the Ukrainians to come out and say it was

279
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:00.710
mechanical failure,

280
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:05.540
which they then reversed course on that once it became obvious. Um, yeah.

281
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.090
So, uh, it's a tragic situation,

282
00:16:08.091 --> 00:16:10.430
but now the protests out in the streets of Iran,

283
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.280
which are a continuation of the past several months, right.

284
00:16:13.281 --> 00:16:17.260
Which were targeted at a corrupt regime, have picked up strength in,

285
00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:20.810
in light of that because the people are just like, we're tired of this,

286
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.990
you know, so, and who knows where it's going to go? I suspect,

287
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:25.880
unfortunately I'm fairly cynical about all this.

288
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:30.260
We've been hoping that Iranian population would kind of rise up for

289
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:34.190
decades and it doesn't happen because it's a pretty brutal regime.

290
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.930
We don't understand that. We don't understand how, how difficult they are.

291
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.690
Right. And how serious minded they are about holding onto power.

292
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.100
So every now and then we think, okay,

293
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.940
how come the protest is going to top a little regime and it doesn't happen.

294
00:16:46.941 --> 00:16:51.250
So maybe it's different this time. I'd, you know, I don't think so. Hmm.

295
00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.210
<v 0>Now, were you concerned at all? And this is one of the things when,</v>

296
00:16:54.211 --> 00:16:58.180
when you say that we could go in there and level them in a day,

297
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:03.100
the real issue is their allies, right? The real issue is China and Russia.

298
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.400
<v 1>Yeah. But they're not gonna do anything. China and Russia,</v>

299
00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:09.940
aren't gonna do anything. It's not in their best interest. And they, they,

300
00:17:09.941 --> 00:17:11.320
if they're consistent about one thing,

301
00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:14.410
both those countries it's that they act in their own best interests and they

302
00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:17.620
would look at that and go, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Um, I mean, look,

303
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:22.270
so what are we dealing with in, in that immediate area? Um, Iran,

304
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.830
his closest ally is Syria, right? So Normani, so money spent, you know,

305
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.880
uh, billions of, uh, you know, uh,

306
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:35.200
Iranian dollars or money, um, that they couldn't afford to.

307
00:17:35.201 --> 00:17:39.310
And that should've been spent on its population, um, arming training, equipping,

308
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:43.420
and dealing with, um, the Syrian, uh,

309
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.830
war and keeping his pal Assad in power. Um,

310
00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.200
so Iran and Syria are tied together,

311
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:56.850
but as Syria in a position to somehow rise up and, you know, engage,

312
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.920
this is not going to be, this wouldn't have been a conflict as we imagine it.

313
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.131
Right.

314
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:06.480
It wouldn't be a conflict of occupying space and ground and all the rest of it.

315
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.690
Nobody wants it. Nobody needs, it's not, it's not good for anybody.

316
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.700
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that, uh, in the scheme of things, um,

317
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:20.310
where you would have overwhelming, um, superior support superiority and,

318
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.630
and yeah, I, I, I can't imagine a scenario where Russia, you know,

319
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.290
would come in and we, in fact, we would probably, um, as, uh, you know,

320
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.220
as anybody would, we would say, okay, look, the Russian military is in Syria.

321
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.150
We're going to liaise where they're going to advise you, you know, coming down.

322
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:37.590
And cause we,

323
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:40.830
the last thing we want to do is drag them into it by hitting some of their

324
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:42.360
facilities or personnel or whatever.

325
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.190
So there would be that level of coordination,

326
00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:46.410
which there always is no matter who the parties are,

327
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:50.760
there's always some element of coordination. But anyway, yeah,

328
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.990
I don't see that happening.

329
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.530
I think we've averted that I hope we've averted sort of further military, uh,

330
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.340
no conflict. Uh, I think again,

331
00:18:59.341 --> 00:19:02.190
I think the Iranian regime understands it's a new day,

332
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.100
perhaps that they'll come to the table eventually.

333
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:09.900
That's what this whole maximum pressure campaign is about is to again,

334
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.510
create sufficient economic pressure,

335
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.920
ensure that they understand the idea of deterrence, uh,

336
00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:21.100
which I think they do after this strike on Sulaymani. Um, and that,

337
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.790
that goes back a ways that it wasn't just like something that just, you know,

338
00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:26.130
they thought after an American contractor was killed,

339
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.320
the Iranian regime had been ratcheting up their aggressiveness and their attacks

340
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:35.790
and their various operations out in that region for a, quite a while.

341
00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:38.820
And we had been talking to them about it or getting the signal to them that

342
00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:42.960
you've got to stop this. And back in December, they were told, look,

343
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:46.260
if you continue this path, we are going to take serious action.

344
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:48.020
We did.
